Mr. President, I think it is important to note the \nsituation escalating in the Mideast as a consequence of the tensions. \nIt is unfortunate it would be at a time when we had hoped there would \nbe an effort to get a firm peace agreement. As a consequence of that, I \nthink it is important to bring to the attention of my colleagues a \nreality relative to the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at \nthe recommendation of Vice President Gore to our President.\n  As you know, the President did release 30 million barrels of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. This was the largest single release of \ncrude oil from SPR in the 25-year history of the reserve. The \nadministration has claimed this has been a successful effort because \nthe price of oil has dropped. Notwithstanding that, using SPR to \nmanipulate prices is contrary to the law because we have not \nreauthorized SPR, and of course the success of this is determined in \nthe long term, not the short term.\n  But I wish to bring to the attention of each and every Member some \nfacts. Since the President made his announcement, there has been no new \nheating oil placed into the market and no measurable rise in \ninventories. It may surprise some of you, particularly those in the \nNortheast, to know that American consumers may, under the current \narrangement, never see any of the product refined from the crude oil \nthat we released from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Let me explain \nwhy because this is important.\n  In the arrangement, there was absolutely no requirement that those \nwho successfully bid on crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nneeded to refine it into heating oil. They may decide to make gasoline \nor some other product.\n  Second, there is absolutely nothing that prevents this product from \nbeing shipped to foreign markets, either in its crude form or as a \nrefined product such as heating oil.\n  Guess what. That is just what is happening. We are shipping heating \noil to Europe. Look at the Wall Street Journal this morning. Let me \nquote:\n\n       Europe's market for heating oil is 50 percent bigger than \n     the U.S. heating oil market. Europe's stocks are even tighter \n     and prices there are a few cents a gallon higher, so U.S. \n     refiners have renewed incentive to ship heating oil across \n     the Atlantic. . . . U.S. exports of heating oil to Europe \n     have ballooned nearly six times, in the first 7 months of \n     this year. . . .\n\n  That tells the story of the arrangement that the administration made \nto take the oil out of SPR and increase our heating oil supply. What \nhas happened with it is it is going to Europe. I am not surprised by \nthis, in the sense of the market going to the highest price where it \ncan generate a return. But I am astonished about the claim of the \nadministration and those who support the movement of SPR, and the \nrelease, that it was done because of concerns over supply for the \nbenefit of the American consumer. The American consumer has not \nbenefited. This is a spin being put on by the pundits.\n  I asked the Secretary of Energy pointblank at a hearing last week:\n\n       Is it possible as a result of oil being released from SPR \n     that prices could fall but no new heating oil would find its \n     way into the U.S. heating market?\n\n  Do you know what the answer was? It could happen. The irony is that \nwe are going to release oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \nprovide product to a European market. That should not be lost on the \nAmerican consumer or Members of this body.\n  Finally, SPR was created for one specific purpose: as a reserve in \ncase our supply, our dependence on OPEC and other countries, is \ndisrupted. We are 58-percent dependent on imported oil. We have a \nsituation in the Mideast. Iraq is claiming Kuwait is stealing its oil, \nthe same claim it made prior to the Persian Gulf war. Kuwait is now \nclaiming Iraq stole oil during the gulf war. The entire Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process appears, unfortunately, to have fallen apart. \nAll this leads to a reminder that we should not use our petroleum \nreserve for political purposes, and that appears to be what we have \ndone in this arrangement.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask the Chair to advise me when I have 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a consequence of the focus on energy \nbetween our two Presidential candidates, it is very appropriate that we \nidentify differences.\n  The Vice President has said he has an energy plan that focuses not \nonly on increasing the supply but also on working on the consumption \nside, but the real facts are the Vice President does not practice what \nhe preaches. Let's look at the record over the last 7\\1/2\\ years.\n  The administration has opposed domestic oil exploration and \nproduction. We have had 17 percent less production since Clinton-Gore \ntook office, and the facts are it decreased the number of oil wells \nfrom 136,000 and the number of gas wells has decreased by 57,000. These \nare wells that have actually been closed since 1992. There has been \nabsolutely no utilization of American coal in coal-fired electric \ngenerating plants. We have not built a new plant since 1990.\n  The difficulty is the Environmental Protection Agency has made it so \nuneconomic that the industry simply cannot get the permits. We force \nthe nuclear energy to choke on its own waste. We were one vote short in \nthe Senate to pass a veto override. Yet the U.S. Court of Appeals has \ngiven the industry a liability case in the Court of\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\nClaims, with a liability to the taxpayers of somewhere between $40 \nbillion and $80 billion.\n  The administration threatens to tear down hydroelectric dams out \nWest. What are we going to do there? We are going to take the traffic \noff the rivers and put it on the highways. We have ignored electric \nreliability and supply concerns. Go out to California, particularly San \nDiego, where they have seen price spikes and brownouts, no new \ngeneration, no new transmission. This has happened on the Vice \nPresident's watch.\n  Natural gas prices in the last 10 months have gone from $2.60 to \n$5.40 for delivery. That is the problem we are facing, and that is the \nrecord under this administration.\n  Let's not forget one more thing. The Vice President talks about \ncutting taxes. The Vice President himself cast the vote in 1993 to \nraise the gas tax 4.3 cents a gallon. He did not just cast the vote; he \nbroke the tie, and that is the significance of the record with regard \nto a contribution to increase domestic energy in this country. Instead \nof doing something to increase domestic oil supply, the Vice President \nand the administration would rather blame big oil profiteering, and \nthat is ironic. Where was big oil a year ago when oil was selling for \n$10 a barrel? Who was profiteering then, Mr. President?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Who sets the price of oil? OPEC.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of our time for Senator \nStevens, who wants to claim that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems to me the majority is crying \nbecause the price of oil has dropped. The President made a decisive \nstep and said we are going to pump oil from our reserve. Immediately, \nthe price of oil dropped. Today it is below $30 a barrel. The majority \nseems so concerned that what the President has done has helped--the \nprice of oil has dropped.\n  I suggest my friends in the majority talk to the Governor of Texas or \nmaybe the man running for Vice President. They have connections with \nthe oil industry. Maybe they could talk him into not shipping oil \noverseas if that is, in fact, what is happening. They are crying \ncrocodile tears because what is happening here is good. We laid out in \ngreat detail yesterday what this administration has done to lower the \nprice of oil to make sure the economy was in good shape.\n  I am also continually amazed at what the majority says about the Vice \nPresident: He broke the tie, so there is a 4-cent-per-gallon increase \nin gas; isn't that too bad?\n  Let's look at the history. Remember, the majority was saying all \nkinds of bad things would happen. The Republicans were saying all kinds \nof bad things would happen if, in fact, the Clinton and Gore budget \ndeficit reduction plan passed. It passed.\n  Prior to passing, listen to what the Republicans had to say.\n  Conrad Burns:\n\n       So we're still going to pile up some more debt. But most of \n     all, we're going to cost jobs in this country.\n\n  He was wrong on both counts. There are 22 million new jobs and, of \ncourse, the debt is gone.\n\n  Orrin Hatch said:\n\n       Make no mistake, this will cost jobs.\n\n  Wrong again.\n  Phil Gramm, the Senator from Texas:\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill, \n     the American economy is going to get weaker, not stronger, \n     and the deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is \n     today, and not lower. When it is all said and done, people \n     will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, \n     Government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  I am not going to go into detail, but we have 300,000 fewer Federal \nemployees than in 1992. We have the lowest unemployment in some 40 \nyears. We have created 22 million jobs. We have a Federal Government \ntoday that is smaller than when President Kennedy was President. I \nthink those on the other side should realize, yes, the Vice President \ndid cast a decisive vote, but it was so decisive that it put this \ncountry on the road to economic recovery.\n  I also suggest my friends should stop talking about nuclear waste. We \nknow there is not going to be another nuclear powerplant built in \nAmerica, but we also recognize that rather than spending time on \nnuclear waste, why don't they talk about alternative energy--solar, \nwind, and geothermal?\n  My friend from Alaska continually talks about energy policy. I \nrespect his opinion, but I continue to believe he is absolutely wrong.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend from California from \nthe time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for setting the record \nstraight and for doing such a good job because we do have to remember \nwhere we were when the Clinton-Gore administration took office.\n  In my State, there was suffering; there was no hope; people's dreams \nwere set aside; the economy was in the tank; and there was double-digit \nunemployment. Today we are in the midst of the greatest economic \nrecovery ever. It dates back to the vote Al Gore cast because he was \nthe deciding vote on that budget. The Republicans predicted gloom and \ndoom, deficits and debt, unemployment and the rest. Let's face it; they \nwere wrong. We do not want to go back to those days of high deficits.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the assistant Democratic \nleader yielding me time because I want to talk briefly about the \nViolence Against Women Act, and then I am going to make a unanimous \nconsent request, of which I believe the other side has been made aware.\n  The Violence Against Women Act, a landmark law that was passed in \n1994, has now expired. We have to reauthorize it. It is crucial. It has \nexpired.\n  Is this an important and worthy act? Yes, it is. Both sides of the \naisle agree. We have seen a 21-percent reduction in violence against \nwomen. We have seen shelters for battered women and their families \nbuilt. They have gone up from 1,200 to about 2,000. We see doctors \ntrained to recognize domestic abuse and police men and women trained to \nrecognize domestic abuse. So we are seeing, in the figures, a decrease \nin the violence.\n\n  But we cannot allow this law to die. The point is, it passed the \nHouse overwhelmingly. It is a clean bill. But there are political games \ngoing on over here. People want to attach all kinds of different things \nto the Violence Against Women Act. It can stand alone on its own two \nfeet. Senator Biden wrote that act a long time ago. When I was in the \nHouse, he asked me to carry it. He has been joined by Senator Hatch. \nThey have worked together now on this new reauthorization.\n  The last point I want to make before making my unanimous consent \nrequest is this: It may be called the Violence Against Women Act, but \nthis act directly attacks the problem of children in these homes. We \nhave to realize that children under the age of 12 live in approximately \n4 out of 10 homes that experience domestic violence.\n  We look at Hollywood--and we are critical of what they are doing in \nterms of the R-rated films shown to kids--but the fact is, there is \nonly one reliable predictor of future violence. If a male child sees \none parent beat another parent, he is twice as likely to abuse his own \nwife as the son of nonviolent parents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have a situation where we know if a child sees \nviolence in the home, that child is very likely to repeat that \nviolence. We have to protect these children by stopping the violence.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 1248\n\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 834, H. 1248, an \nact to prevent violence against women, that the bill be considered read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Senator, under my \nreservation, this bill which has done so much good in the country, has \nit lapsed?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. The Violence Against Women Act reauthorization has \nexpired. We can't permit this to continue any longer. The House acted, \nand well over 400 Members voted to reauthorize it.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator telling me that right now the law is not in \neffect in our country?\n  Mrs. BOXER. In essence, the authorization has definitely expired. My \nfriend is right. That is why I make this request in a most urgent \nfashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Reserving the right to object, I rise on behalf of the \nleader, who is working now with Members on the other side. I do not \nknow of anyone who disagrees with what the Senator from California has \nsaid. No one I know of disagrees with the bill. I certainly do not. \nHowever, there is a process underway. I object to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Time runs equally against both sides.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. How much time is remaining on the minority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Reid, once more, for yielding me some \ntime.\n  I understand the Republican side of the aisle wants to attach \ndifferent pieces of legislation to the Violence Against Women Act, and \nthat is what is slowing it down. I know they want to see this act go \nforward. But I have to say to them, there is an easy way to do it.\n  I am very disappointed we had this objection this morning. We had a \nbeautiful prayer--a beautiful prayer--given by Senator Leahy's brother-\nin-law. If you heard what he said, he prayed that we in the Senate \ncould work to do good works--to do good works. I know that is what we \nall strive to do every single day we get up in the morning. But it \nseems to me that good work such as the Violence Against Women Act is \neasy to do. We do not have to use it as a train to which we attach \ndifferent pieces of legislation.\n  I see Senator Wellstone on the floor. He has worked so hard in the \narea of the trafficking of women worldwide. Yes, we have no objection \nif we marry these two, if you will, pieces of legislation together \nbecause they make sense. One is talking about violence at home; one is \ntalking about taking girls and putting them into sex trafficking. And \nit is a sin upon the world that this happens. We agreed to do this. It \ncould have been done in a minute. We do not need to come on the floor \nand have a long period of time to discuss this. I am sure the Senator \nwould agree; we could have a few comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very disappointed this morning that we haven't been \nable to do at least one good thing for the women and children of this \ncountry, and that is to pass the House bill, the Violence Against Women \nAct, to get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Time runs equally against both sides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of my friend \nfrom California in the minute we have remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. With all this compassionate conservatism around, do you \nthink it would be good if the Governor of Texas interceded in this \nmatter?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I would call on the Governor to intercede with our \nfriends on the other side. He was asked about the Violence Against \nWomen Act on the campaign trail. He was unaware of it. He said he had \nnot heard of it, although Texas has received about $75 million, and \nthey have built battered women shelters. Then when he studied it, he \nsaid he supported it, for which I am very grateful. But this is a \ngolden moment for him.\n  Since we have passed the bill, I want to say to my friend from \nNevada, intimate-partner violence has decreased by 21 percent. Again, \nwe have seen the number of battered women shelters increase by 60 \npercent. Before there were more animal shelters than there were for \nwomen and children. So we should act. I hope my friends will \nreconsider.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time of the minority has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Time will run on the majority side.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think we are getting prepared, within a \ncouple minutes now, to have a vote on the continuing resolution. I \nsimply want to rise again to say I do not disagree at all with what the \nSenator from California is saying. But the fact is, there is a plan. \nThere is a plan to operate under here. The Senate does not simply react \nbecause someone gets up and says it is time to do this. There are \nnegotiations going on between the leader and Senators on the other \nside.\n  I am sure this will indeed be done. We have a lot of things that need \nto be done. I would suggest that we ought to get the whole thing \nplanned a little bit. I am a little surprised that this Senator is \ntalking about objecting to moving forward because I think there have \nbeen quite a few objections coming from that side that has gotten us to \nwhere we are now. That is not really the point. The point is, we will \nhandle this bill. The leader has prepared to do that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I hope we can now proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the joint resolution for \nthe third time.\n  The joint resolution was read the third time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass? The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Senate Agenda\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the situation we are in right now is \ninteresting. It is different from any similar period I can recall in \nnearly 26 years in the Senate. We are at the end of the fiscal year--we \nhave actually gone beyond the end of the fiscal year--and nothing seems \nto be happening. I voted against the continuing resolution, not because \nI do not think we should keep the Government going--of course we \nshould; it is unfortunate to close down the Government--but more to \nexpress my concern that we are not doing our business.\n  We have not passed our appropriations bills as we should. We all talk \nabout how we make Government more efficient or how we make Government \nbetter. But imagine if you are running one of these Agencies or one of \nthese Departments and you have to make the decisions for the year, and \nCongress, which has a mandate under law to pass the appropriations \nbills by September 30, we are here on October 5 and are nowhere near \ncompleting the bills.\n  Yet in a Congress that spends more time investigating than \nlegislating, we are perfectly willing to have investigations and \nactually bring a lot of these Departments to a halt while we ask them \nquestion after question, even if the questions have already been asked, \nand yet we are unwilling to do our own work on time. It is not the way \nit can be done, and it is not the way it should be done.\n  I strongly urge Senators to consider next year when we come back, no \nmatter who wins the Presidency, no matter who wins seats in the Senate \nor in the other body, that we spend more time trying to do things that \nactually help the country, that we set aside some of the partisanship \nand bitterness that has marked this Senate actually since impeachment \ntime, which in itself was marked by partisanship when impeachment was \nrushed through in a lame duck House of Representatives and then passed \nover to this body. It appears in many ways we lost our footing at that \ntime and never got back on course.\n  There are bills that have bipartisan support. There was one I was \ndiscussing on the floor a few minutes ago with the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, the Campbell-Leahy bulletproof vest bill. This \nis a bill that provides money for bulletproof vests for law enforcement \nofficers.\n  Senator Campbell and I served in law enforcement before we came to \nCongress. We served at a time when much of law enforcement did not face \nthe danger it does now, but we kept enough of our ties to law \nenforcement and so we know how difficult it is. We know that the men \nand women we send out to protect all of us are themselves so often the \nvictims of the same criminals from whom they try to protect us.\n  Bulletproof vests are a $500 or $600 item. They wear out in 5 years. \nA lot of departments, especially small departments in States such as \nVermont or rural areas like Texas, cannot afford these vests. I have \nletters from hundreds of law enforcement people from around the country \nwho tell me that under the original Campbell-Leahy bill, they finally \nhave a sense of security because they have bulletproof vests. We want \nto extend that for a couple more years. Yet we cannot even get a vote \non it.\n  This is a bill which, if it is brought to a vote in this Chamber, I \nam willing to bet virtually every Senator, Republican and Democrat, \nwill vote for. How can one vote against it? Yet there has been one hold \non the Republican side of the aisle, and we cannot bring up this vital \nlaw enforcement piece of legislation.\n  I wanted to be sure--I am hearing from law enforcement agencies all \nacross the country: Why can't you pass it?--so I actually made the \npoint of checking with all 46 Democratic Senators: Do any of you have \nany objection to voting on this on a second's notice? They said: No, \npass it by unanimous consent, if you want.\n  I ask whoever is holding it up on the other side not to continue to \nhold it up.\n  Mr. President, I return to ask the Republican leadership what is \nholding up enactment of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n2000? This is a bill I introduced with Senator Campbell and others last \nApril. The Senate Judiciary Committee considered and and reported the \nbill unanimously to the full Senate back in June. I have since been \nworking to get Senate consideration, knowing that it will pass \noverwhelmingly if not unanimously.\n  Unfortunately, an anonymous ``hold'' on the Republican side prevented \nenactment before the Senate recessed in July. I have been unable to \ndiscover which Republican Senator opposes the bill or why, and that \nremains true today.\n  We have been working for several months to pass the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act of 2000. It has been cleared by all Democratic \nSenators.\n  That it has still not passed the full Senate is very disappointing to \nme, as I am sure that it is to our nation's law enforcement officers, \nwho need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. \nProtecting and supporting our law enforcement community should not be a \npartisan issue.\n  Senator Campbell and I worked together closely and successfully in \nthe last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998 into law. This year's bill reauthorizes and extends the successful \nprogram that we helped create and that the Department of Justice has \ndone such a good job implementing.\n  I have charts here that show how successful the Bulletproof Vests \nGrant Program has been for individual states. In its first year of \noperation in 1999, the program funded the purchase of 167,497 vests \nwith $23 million in federal grant funds.\n  For the State of Alabama, the program funded the purchase of 2,287 \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State \nof California, the program funded the purchase of 28,106 bulletproof \nvests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Colorado, \nthe program funded the purchase of 1,844 bulletproof vests for police \nofficers in 1999.\n  For the State of Idaho, the program funded the purchase of 711 \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State \nof Michigan, the program funded the purchase of 2,932 bulletproof vests \nfor law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Minnesota, the \nprogram funded the purchase of 1,052 bulletproof vests for law \nenforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Mississippi, the program \nfunded the purchase of 1,283 bulletproof vests for law enforcement \nofficers in 1999. For the State of Missouri, the program funded the \npurchase of 2,919 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in \n1999.\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\n  For the State of New York, the program funded the purchase of 13,004 \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State \nof Oklahoma, the program funded the purchase of 3,042 bulletproof vests \nfor law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Rhode Island, \nthe program funded the purchase of 792 bulletproof vests for law \nenforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Utah, the program funded \nthe purchase of 1,326 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in \n1999. For my home State of Vermont, the program funded the purchase of \n361 bulletproof vests for police officers in 1999. For big and small \nstates, the program was a success in its first year.\n  I have a second chart that shows how successful the Bulletproof Vests \nGrant Program has been for individual states in its second year of \noperation. In 2000, the program funded the purchase of 158,396 vests \nwith $24 million in federal grant funds.\n  For the State of Alabama, the program funded the purchase of 2,498 \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State \nof California, the program funded the purchase of 27,477 bulletproof \nvests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Colorado, \nthe program funded the purchase of 2,288 bulletproof vests for police \nofficers in 2000.\n  For the State of Idaho, the program funded the purchase of 477 \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State \nof Michigan, the program funded the purchase of 3,427 bulletproof vests \nfor law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Minnesota, the \nprogram funded the purchase of 709 bulletproof vests for law \nenforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Mississippi, the program \nfunded the purchase of 1,364 bulletproof vests for law enforcement \nofficers in 2000. For the State of Missouri, the program funded the \npurchase of 1,221 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in \n2000.\n  For the State of New York, the program funded the purchase of 11,969 \nbulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State \nof Oklahoma, the program funded the purchase of 3,389 bulletproof vests \nfor law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Rhode Island, \nthe program funded the purchase of 313 bulletproof vests for law \nenforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Utah, the program funded \nthe purchase of 1,326 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in \n2000. For my home State of Vermont, the program funded the purchase of \n175 bulletproof vests for police officers in 2000. For the second year \nin a row, the program was a great success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two charts listing \nthe number of bulletproof vests purchased and the Federal grant amounts \nfor each state in 1999 and 2000 under the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nGrant Program be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds \non the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 \nmillion for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by \nguaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receiving \nthe full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these \nsmaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests \neligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close \nquarters in local and county jails.\n  We have 20 cosponsors on the new bill, including a number of \nDemocrats and Republicans. This is a bipartisan bill that is not being \ntreated in a bipartisan way. For some unknown reason a Republican \nSenator has a hold on this bill and has chosen to exercise that right \nanonymously.\n  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the \ncountry face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during \nroutine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential \nthe we update this law so that many more of our officers who are \nrisking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves.\n  I hope that the mysterious ``hold'' on the bill from the other side \nof the aisle will disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and send to the \nPresident for his signature into law.\n  Before we recessed last July, I informed the Republican leadership \nthat the House of Representatives had passed the companion bill, H.R. \n4033, by an overwhelming vote of 413-3. I expressed my hope that the \nSenate would quickly follow suit and pass the House-passed bill and \nsend it to the President. President Clinton has already endorsed this \nlegislation to support our Nation's law enforcement officers and is \neager to sign it into law.\n  I find it ironic that the Senate in July passed the Federal Law \nEnforcement Animal Protection Act, H.R. 1791. That bill increased the \npenalties for harming dogs and horses used by federal law enforcement \nofficers. President Clinton signed that bill into law on August 2nd.\n  The majority acted quickly to protect dogs and horses used by law \nenforcement officers but has stalled action on legislation to provide \nlife-saving protection for law enforcement officers themselves. The \nSenate should have moved as quickly in July to pass the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and sent it to the President for his \nsignature into law.\n  Several more months have come and gone. Unfortunately, nothing has \nchanged. Not knowing what the misunderstanding of our bill is, I find \nit is impossible to overcome an anonymous, unstated objection. I, \nagain, ask whoever it is on the Republican side who has a concern about \nthis program to please come talk to me and to Senator Campbell. I hope \nthat the Senate will do the right thing and pass this important \nlegislation without further unnecessary delay.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            BULLETPROOF VEST

Mr. President, today is October 5, the first anniversary \nof an event I hope I will not see again in the Senate. I have spoken \nmany times about the Senate being the conscience of the Nation, and it \nshould be. A year ago today, I believe the country was harmed by a \nparty-line vote. That party-line vote defeated the nomination of \nJustice Ronnie White to the Federal district court in Missouri. Justice \nWhite, on the Missouri Supreme Court, had the highest qualifications. \nHe passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee. He had the highest \nABA ratings. He is a distinguished African American jurist. Yet when it \ncame to a vote, every Democrat voted for him and every Republican voted \nagainst him. I believe that was a mistake and one we will regret. I \nspoke on this nomination on October 15 and 21 of last year and more \nrecently this year.\n  Fifty-one years ago this month--I was 9 years old--the Senate \nconfirmed President Truman's nomination of William Henry Hastings to \nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. That was actually the first \nSenate confirmation of an African American to our Federal courts--only \n51 years ago. Thirty-one years ago, the Senate confirmed President \nJohnson's nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nWhen we rejected Ronnie White, I wonder if we went backward or we moved \nforward.\n  This year, the Judiciary Committee has even refused to move forward \nwith a hearing on Roger Gregory or Judge James Wynn to the Fourth \nCircuit. It is interesting--talk about bipartisanship--one of these men \nis a distinguished African American, a legal scholar, strongly \nsupported by both the Republican and Democratic Senators from his \nState. Senator Warner, a distinguished and respected Member of this \nbody and a Republican, strongly supports him. Senator Robb, an equally \ndistinguished and respected Member of this body and a Democrat, a \ndecorated war hero, also supports him, and the President nominated him. \nWe cannot even get a vote.\n  I hope this does not continue. I suggest, again, whoever wins the \nPresidency, whoever wins seats or loses seats in the Senate, that we \nnot do this next year.\n  This year, the Judiciary Committee reported only three nominees to \nthe Court of Appeals all year. We denied a committee vote to two \noutstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I understand \nthe frustration of Senators who know Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, \nKathleen McCree Lewis, Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, and others \nshould have been considered and voted on.\n  There are multiple vacancies on the Third, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, \nNinth, Tenth, and District of Columbia Circuits; 23 current vacancies. \nOur appellate courts have nearly half of the judicial vacancies in the \nFederal court system. That has to change. I hope it will.\n  I see my distinguished colleague and friend from Texas on the floor. \nI want to assure her I will yield the floor very soon.\n  But I hope we can look again and ask ourselves objectively, without \nany partisanship, can we not do better on judges?\n  I quoted Gov. George Bush on the floor a couple days ago. I said I \nagreed with him. On nominations, he said we should vote them up or down \nwithin 60 days. If you don't want the person, vote against them. The \nRepublican Party should have no fear of that. They have the majority in \nthis body. They can vote against them if they want, but have the vote. \nEither vote for them or vote against them. Don't leave people such as \nHelene White and Bonnie Campbell--people such as this--just hanging \nforever without even getting a rollcall vote. That is wrong. It is not \na responsible way and besmirches the Senate, this body that I love so \nmuch.\n  I consider it a privilege to serve here. This is a nation of a \nquarter of a billion people; and only 100 of us can serve at any one \ntime to represent this wonderful Nation. It is a privilege that our \nStates give us. We should use the privilege in the most responsible way \nto benefit all of us.\n  When Senators do not vote their conscience, they risk the debacle \nthat we witnessed last October 5th, when a partisan political caucus \nvote resulted in a fine man and highly qualified nominee being rejected \nby all Republican Senators on a party-line vote. The Senate will never \nremove the blot that occurred last October when the Republican Senators \nemerged from a Republican Caucus to vote lockstep against Justice \nWhite. At a Missouri Bar Association forum last week, Justice White \nexpressed concern that the rejection of his nominations to a Federal \njudgeship will have a ``chilling effect'' on the desire of other young \nAfrican American lawyers to seek to serve on our judiciary.\n  President Clinton has tried to make progress on bringing greater \ndiversity to our federal courts. He has been successful to some extent. \nWith our help, we could have done so much more. We will end this \nCongress without having acted on any of the African American nominees, \nJudge James Wynn or Roger Gregory, sent to us to fill vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit and finally integrate the Circuit with the highest \npercentage of African American population in the country, but the one \nCircuit that has never had an African American judge. We could have \nacted on the nomination of Kathleen McCree Lewis and confirmed her to \nthe Sixth Circuit to be the first African American woman to sit on that \nCourt. Instead, we will end the year without having acted on any of the \nthree outstanding nominees to the Sixth Circuit pending before us.\n  This Judiciary Committee has reported only three nominees to the \nCourts of Appeals all year. We have held hearings without even \nincluding a nominee to the Courts of Appeals and denied a Committee \nvote to two outstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I \ncertainly understand the frustration of those Senators who know that \nRoger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, as well as \nJudge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell and others should have been \nconsidered by this Committee and voted on by the Senate this year.\n  There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Third, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 23 current \nvacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial \nemergency vacancies in the federal court system. I note that the \nvacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 12 percent \nnationwide. If we were to take into account the additional appellate \njudgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, \nS.3071, a bill that was requested by the Judicial Conference to handle \ncurrent workloads, the vacancy rate on our federal courts of appeals \nwould be more than 17 percent.\n  The Chairman declares that ``there is and has been no judicial \nvacancy crisis'' and that he calculates vacancies at ``less than \nzero.'' The extraordinary service that has been provided by our corps \nof senior judges does not mean there are no vacancies. In the federal \ncourts around the country there remain 63 current vacancies and several \nmore on the horizon. With the judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy \nFederal Judgeship Act of 2000, there would be over 130 vacancies across \nthe country. That is the truer measure of vacancies, many of which have \nbeen long-standing judicial emergency vacancies in our southwest border \nstates. The chief judges of both the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have had \nto declare their entire courts in emergencies since there are too many \nvacancies and too few circuit judges to handle their workload.\n  The chairman misconstrues the lessons of the 63 vacancies at the end \nof\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\nthe 103rd Congress in 1994. I would point out that in 1994 the Senate \nconfirmed 101 judges to compensate for normal attrition and to fill the \nvacancies and judgeships created in 1990. In fact, that Congress \nreduced the vacancies from 131 in 1991, to 103 in 1992, to 112 in 1993, \nto 63 in 1994. Vacancies were going down and we were acting with \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents to fill the 85 judgeships created \nby a Democratic Congress under a Republican President in 1990. Since \nRepublicans assumed control of the Senate in the 1994 election the \nSenate has not even kept up with normal attrition. We will end this \nyear with more vacancies than at the end of the session in 1994. As I \nhave pointed out, the vacancies are most acute among our courts of \nappeals. Further, we have not acted to add the judgeships requested by \nthe Judicial Conference to meet increased workloads over the last \ndecade.\n  According to the Chief Justice's 1999 year-end report, the filings of \ncases in our Federal courts have reached record heights. In fact, the \nfilings of criminal cases and defendants reached their highest levels \nsince the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. Also in 1999, \nthere were 54,693 filings in the 12 regional courts of appeals. Overall \ngrowth in appellate court caseload last year was due to a 349 percent \nupsurge in original proceedings. This sudden expansion resulted from \nnewly implemented reporting procedures, which more accurately measure \nthe increased judicial workload generated by the Prisoner Litigation \nReform Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both \npassed in 1996.\n  Let me also set the record straight, yet again, on the erroneous but \noft-repeated argument that ``the Clinton Administration is on record as \nhaving stated that a vacancy rate just over 7 percent is virtual full-\nemployment of the judiciary.'' That is not true.\n  The statement can only be alluded to an October 1994 press release. \nIt should not be misconstrued in this manner. That press release was \npointing out that at the end of the 103rd Congress if the Senate had \nproceeded to confirm the 14 nominees then pending on the Senate \ncalendar, it would have reduced the judicial vacancy rate to 4.7 \npercent, which the press release then proceeded to compare to a \nfavorable unemployment rate of under 5 percent.\n  Unfortunately, the chairman's assertions are demonstrably false. \nContrary to his statement, the Justice Department's October 12, 1994 \npress release that he cites does not equate a 7.4 percent vacancy rate \nwith ``full employment,'' but rather a 4.7 percent rate. Additionally, \nthe vacancy rate was not reduced to 4.7 percent in 1994, and stands at \nthree times that today.\n  The Justice Department release was not a statement of administration \nposition or even a policy statement but a poorly designed press release \nthat included an ill-conceived comment. Job vacancy rates and \nunemployment rates are not comparable. Unemployment rates are measures \nof people who do not have jobs not of Federal offices vacant without an \nappointed office holder.\n  When I learned that some Republicans had for partisan purposes seized \nupon this press release, taken it out of context, ignored what the \npress release actually said and were manipulating it into a \nmisstatement of Clinton administration policy, I asked the Attorney \nGeneral, in 1997, whether there was any level or percentage of judicial \nvacancies that the administration considered acceptable or equal to \n``full employment.''\n  The Department responded:\n\n       There is no level or percentage of vacancies that justifies \n     a slow down in the Senate on the confirmation of nominees for \n     judicial positions. While the Department did once, in the \n     fall of 1994, characterize a 4.7 percent vacancy rate in the \n     federal judiciary as the equivalent of the Department of \n     Labor `full employment' standard, that characterization was \n     intended simply to emphasize the hard work and productivity \n     of the Administration and the Senate in reducing the \n     extraordinary number of vacancies in the federal Article III \n     judiciary in 1993 and 1994. Of course, there is a certain \n     small vacancy rate, due to retirements and deaths and the \n     time required by the appointment process, that will always \n     exist. The current vacancy rate is 11.3 percent. It did reach \n     12 percent this past summer. The President and the Senate \n     should continually be working diligently to fill vacancies as \n     they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent \n     capacity for the Federal bench.\n\n  At no time has the Clinton administration stated that it believes \nthat 7 percent vacancies on the federal bench is acceptable or a \nvirtually full federal bench. Only Republicans have expressed that \nopinion. As the Justice Department noted three years ago in response to \nan inquiry on this very questions, the Senate should be ``working \ndiligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to \nreach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.''\n  Indeed, I informed the Senate of these facts in a statement in the \nCongressional Record on July 7, 1998, so that there would be no future \nmisunderstanding or misstatement of the record. Nonetheless, in spite \nof the facts and in spite of my July 1998 statement and subsequent \nstatements on this issue over the past three years, these misleading \nstatements continue to be repeated.\n  Ironically, the Senate could reduce the current vacancy rate to under \n5 percent if we confirmed the 39 judicial nominees that remain bottled \nup before the Judiciary Committee. Instead of misstating the language \nof a 6-year-old press release that has since been discredited by the \nAttorney General herself, the chairman would have my support if we were \nworking to get those 39 more judges confirmed.\n  I regret to report again today that the last confirmation hearing for \nfederal judges held by the Judiciary Committee was in July, as was the \nlast time the Judiciary Committee reported any nominees to the full \nSenate. Throughout August and September and now into the first week in \nOctober, there have been no additional hearings held or even noticed, \nand no executive business meetings have included any judicial nominees \non the agenda. By contrast, in 1992, the last year of the Bush \nadministration, a Democratic majority in the Senate held three \nconfirmation hearings in August and September and continued to work to \nconfirm judges up to and including the last day of the session.\n  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all \nnominees, including women and minorities. So long as the Senate is in \nsession, I will urge action. That highly-qualified nominees are being \nneedlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate should join with the \nPresident to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees \nto fulfill the needs of the Federal courts around the country.\n  As I noted on the floor earlier this week, the frustration that many \nSenators feel with the lack of attention this Committee has shown long \npending judicial nominees has simply boiled over. I understand their \nfrustration and have been urging action for some time. This could all \nhave been easily avoided if we were continuing to move judicial \nnominations like Democrats did in 1992, when we held hearings in \nSeptember and confirmed 66 judges that Presidential election year.\n  I regret that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate is not holding \nadditional hearings, that we only acted on 39 nominees all year and \nthat we have taken so long on so many of them. I deeply regret the lack \nof a hearing and a vote on so many qualified nominees, including Roger \nGregory, Judge James Wynn, Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, Enrique \nMoreno, Allen Snyder and others. And, I regret that a year ago today, \nthe Senate rejected the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the \nFederal District Court of Missouri on a partisan, party-line vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Vermont, the bulletproof vest bill \nthat you wrote and that you have spoken about here on the floor this \nmorning--is that right?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. It would greatly benefit rural Nevadans; is that not right?\n  Mr. LEAHY. There is no question it would benefit rural Nevada. Of \ncourse, the distinguished deputy leader was in law enforcement himself. \nHe knows the threat that police officers face. That threat is not \nexclusive to big cities, by any means.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the lead Democrat on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Nevada is an interesting State. Seventy percent of the \npeople in Nevada live in the metropolitan Las\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\nVegas area. Another about 20 percent live in the Reno metropolitan \narea. The 10 percent who are spread out around the rest of the State \ncover thousands and thousands of square miles, and there are many small \ncommunities that do not have the resources that the big cities have to \nprovide, for example, bulletproof vests.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont, do you agree that people who work in \nrural America in law enforcement deserve the same protection as those \nwho work in urban centers throughout America?\n  Mr. LEAHY. There is no question about it. In fact, in the 1999 bill \nthey were able to purchase nearly 400 vests, many of those in the rural \nareas. If we get this through, now they can purchase 1,176 vests.\n  I say this because the Senate moved very quickly to pass a bill that \nincreased the penalties if we harmed dogs or horses used by law \nenforcement. In other words, we could quickly zip this through and pass \na bill saying the penalty will be increased if one harms a dog or horse \nused by law enforcement, but, whoops, we can't pass a bipartisan piece \nof legislation protecting the law enforcement officer himself or \nherself. I think of Alice in Wonderland, I have to admit, under those \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I am happy we are looking out for \nanimals. I support that and was aware of that legislation, but I think \nit is about time we started helping some of these rural police \ndepartments in Nevada that are so underfunded and so badly in need of \nthis protection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from Nevada, I, too, support the bill \nprotecting animals in law enforcement. But I wish we could have added \nthis other part. If you have the police officer out with the police \ndog, that police officer deserves protection. If you have a police \nofficer out there with a horse--in many parts of both urban and rural \nareas horses are still used for a number of reasons by police \nofficers--then let's also protect the police officer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nthe leader, at 1 o'clock today, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nFitzgerald, be recognized to make closing remarks on the Interior \nappropriations conference report for up to 45 minutes, and following \nthe use or yielding back of time, the cloture vote occur, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, and following that vote, if invoked, the \nconference report be considered under the following time restraints: 10 \nminutes equally divided between the two managers, 10 minutes equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member of Appropriations; 30 \nminutes under the control of Senator Landrieu, 15 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator McCain.\n  I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report, \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the Senator \nwould be kind enough to change the time until 2 o'clock. I think that \nhas been agreed to on your side. I did not hear. Senator Fitzgerald is \nto be given 1 hour rather than 45 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, that is acceptable. We could change \nthe time to start at 2 o'clock today, with Senator Fitzgerald having 1 \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In light of this agreement, Mr. President, the next \nvote will be at approximately 3 o'clock.\n  Let me revise, once again, the unanimous consent request to begin at \n1 o'clock, leaving the 1-hour timeframe for Mr. Fitzgerald; therefore, \nin light of the agreement, the vote would occur at approximately 2 \no'clock, with another vote on adoption of the conference report at 3:30 \ntoday. If I could wrap all of that in together as a unanimous consent \nrequest, that would be my hope. I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. The confusion is not on the part of the Senator from Texas. \nIt is my confusion. I apologize for inserting that 2 o'clock time. \nThere was some confusion on my part. The debate will start at 1 and we \nwill vote around 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Judicial Appointments\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, having heard my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont talk about the judicial selection process, I \nrise to commend Senator Hatch and his leadership of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  It is very difficult to accommodate all of the requests and \nresponsibilities that are entailed in a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal bench. I think Senator Hatch has done the very best job he \npossibly could in getting appointments through, appointments that are \nreflective of Clinton administration priorities. The vast majority of \nClinton appointees have gone through. In my home State of Texas, we \nhave had 20 nominations. Senator Gramm and I have supported 18 of \nthose, and 17 have gone through. There is still one pending that we \nsupport.\n  I think Senator Hatch has bent over backwards to do his due diligence \nbut to respect the wishes of the Democratic side and the \nadministration. I don't want to leave unchallenged some of the comments \nmade that indicate that serious consideration has not been given to \nevery single Clinton appointee and that in most cases those appointees \nhave been put forward.\n  It is important that a lifetime appointment be scrutinized because \nthere is no accountability of that lifetime appointment. We need to \nlook at all of the factors surrounding a particular nominee, knowing \nthe power that a Federal judge has and that the accountability is \nlimited.\n  I applaud Senator Hatch. I think he has done a terrific job under \nvery difficult circumstances. I hope he will continue the due diligence \nand also continue apace with the nominations process.\n\n\n                       Hospital Preservation Act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Hospital \nPreservation Act that Senator Abraham and I introduced last year. We \nachieved partial relief for hospitals last year, but we have \nreintroduced it this year in an attempt to get more relief for the \nbeleaguered hospitals of our country.\n  Today we have both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate \nFinance Committee working on this very important legislation. We will \nhave legislation that will, at least for this year, restore the cuts \nthat are being made to our hospitals in Medicare payments, but I am \nhoping we can get more. In fact, there are many areas of our health \ncare system that have been undercut by a combination of the Balanced \nBudget Act and have actually been cut even more forcefully by the \nHealth Care Financing Administration than was ever intended by \nCongress.\n  When we passed the Balanced Budget Act, we said we would look at the \neffects, and if we needed to refine it in any way, we would do that. \nCongress has met its responsibility in that regard. We had the Balanced \nBudget Act Refinement Act passed. We have come back and restored cuts \nthat were too much. That is what we are doing in the bill that is \nbefore us or will be before us very soon, that is now being considered \nby the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Finance \nCommittee. In fact, the legislation would increase payments to \nhospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies, managed care \norganizations, and other health providers that are paid under Medicare.\n  This legislation is needed especially for our hospitals because they \nare the front line of our health care delivery system. This legislation \nbuilds on legislation Congress passed last year that reversed some of \nthe cuts in provider payments that did result from the Balanced Budget \nAct and from excessive administrative actions taken by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration.\n\n  Last year's bill contained important provisions that have helped \npreserve the ability of American hospitals to continue to provide the \nhighest level of health care anywhere in the world. The Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act that\n\n[[Page S9884]]\n\nCongress passed last year did make the situation a little brighter for \nsome of these struggling hospitals. It eases the transition from cost-\nbased reimbursement to prospective payment for hospital outpatient \nservices. It restores some of the cuts to disproportionate share \npayments, and it provides targeted relief for teaching hospitals and \ncancer and rehabilitation hospitals.\n  I was proud to have been the prime advocate in the Senate for one of \nthe provisions in that bill that restored the full inflation update for \ninpatient hospital services for sole community provider hospitals, \nthose located primarily in rural areas that provide the only \ninstitutional care in a 35-mile geographic area. However, last year's \nbill was really just a start. I think we have all heard from hospitals \nthat they are really hurting. Hospitals are actually beginning to \nclose, in Texas and all over the Nation. Independent estimates are that \nthis trend will only get worse unless something is done.\n  I and many of my colleagues in Congress continue to hear from \nhospital administrators, trustees, health professionals that they were \nstruggling to maintain the quality and variety of health services in \nthe face of mounting budget pressures. With the statutory and HCFA-\nimposed cuts that they were seeing, many efficiently run hospitals \nbegan for the first time to run deficits and threaten closure. For many \nof these hospitals to close, particularly those in rural areas, would \nmean not only the loss of life-saving medical services to the residents \nof the area but also the loss of a core component of local communities. \nJobs would be lost. Businesses would wither, and the sense of community \nand stability a local hospital brings would suffer.\n  My colleague, Senator Spence Abraham of Michigan, and I began the \ntask of looking for the best way to provide significant assistance to \nthese hospitals to make sure the payments they were receiving for \ntaking Medicare patients were fair and adequate to enable them to \ncontinue serving our Nation's seniors, and also to have the support \nthey need to run their hospitals. We decided to try to expand the sole \ncommunity provider hospital provision to all hospitals.\n  The bill we have introduced will make sure that Medicare payments for \ninpatient services actually keep up with the rate of hospital \ninflation. We will restore the full 1.1 percent in scheduled reductions \nfrom the annual inflation updates for inpatient services called for by \nthe Balanced Budget Act. Moreover, rather than just applying to a small \ngroup of hospitals, this legislation would benefit every hospital in \nAmerica, providing an estimated $7.7 billion in additional Medicare \npayments over the next 5 years.\n  Now, you may ask, where is that $7.7 billion going to come from? \nWell, when we passed the Balanced Budget Act, we projected savings of \n$110 billion over the 5-year period that should have occurred from the \ncuts we put in the Balanced Budget Act. But, in fact, instead of $110 \nbillion, we are now projecting $220 billion in savings. So the $7.7 \nbillion just for this part of the bill has already been saved, and $100 \nbillion more is estimated when you take into account the whole 5 years.\n  So the bottom line is, we cut too much; we are going to restore part \nof those cuts; and we are still going to be approximately $100 billion \nahead. So we will have saved $100 billion, as we intended to do, but we \nwill restore the cuts that have caused such hardships to the hospitals \nthroughout our country.\n  The bill that is being considered by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee contains a full 1-year restoration in the inflation update \nfor hospitals. The pending Senate Finance Committee bill would restore \nthe cuts in 2001, but it only delays the 2002 cuts until 2003. This is \nprogress.\n  I so appreciate Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan's efforts in the \nSenate Finance Committee. But I don't want to delay those cuts. I want \nto restore the cuts for the full 2 years. I hope that in the end we can \ngo ahead and do that because these hospitals need to know that there is \na stability in their budgeting, that they will be able to look at the \nrestoration in the cuts for the next 2 years. They need to be able to \nplan. They need to know they will have the adequate funding for \nMedicare that they must have to give the services in the community and \nto support the hospital for all of the people and the health care needs \nof the community.\n  So we are not doing anything that would bust the budget or go into \ndeficits. The fact is, this is a refinement. We have cut $100 billion \ntoo much, and we are restoring $8 billion of that.\n  In the bill that is being considered by the Senate Finance Committee, \nwe also will strengthen the Medicare payments for the disproportionate \nshare hospitals, for home health care agencies, for graduate medical \neducation, and for Medicare+Choice plans. We are not out of the woods, \nbut we are taking a major step in the right direction.\n  I commend Senator Roth for his leadership of the committee, along \nwith Senator Moynihan. I implore Congress to move swiftly on this very \nimportant legislation. We cannot go out of session without addressing \nthe issue of keeping our hospitals from suffering disastrous cuts in \nMedicare--cuts that they cannot absorb and cuts that are not warranted. \nThis is our responsibility, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Abraham, for helping me so much on this \nissue. He has been a leader. After listening to hospital personnel in \nhis home State of Michigan, he came to me and said, ``We have to do \nsomething; let's do it together,'' and I said, ``Great,'' because we \nmust act before we leave this year in Congress. We cannot go forward \nwithout addressing this very important issue for the hospitals and \nhealth care providers of our country.\n\n\n                        Certification of Mexico\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution I have introduced on behalf of myself and \nSenators Grassley, Gramm, Kyl, Domenici, Dodd, Feinstein, Hollings, and \nSessions.\n  We have submitted this sense-of-the-Senate resolution to deal with \nthe issue of the certification of Mexico. Several of us introduced a \nbill earlier in the session after the election of the new President of \nMexico, Vicente Fox, to try to address the issue of two new \nadministrations in both of our countries that will be faced with the \nautomatic certification of the issue of how we are dealing with illegal \ndrug trafficking as a bilateral effort in our two countries, but with \ntwo administrations that have not had time to sit down and come up with \na plan that would cooperate fully in this very important effort.\n  Since time is so short, we have come up with a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that I think will at least say it is the will of the Senate. \nIf we can pass this before we adjourn sine die, I think it will be a \nmajor step in the right direction to give some relief to the two new \nPresidents who will be sworn in for both of our countries and to say, \nfirst of all, we in the Senate take this very seriously. One of the \nmost important issues for our countries is dealing with illegal drug \ntrafficking between Mexico and the United States. Realizing that \nneither President could be held accountable yet for the programs that \nshould be put in place, we are going to have a 1-year moratorium.\n  This is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution:\n       Whereas Mexico will inaugurate a new government on 1 \n     December 2000 that will be the first change of authority from \n     one party to another;\n       Whereas the 2nd July election of Vincente Fox Quesada of \n     the Alliance for Change marks an historic transition of power \n     in open and fair elections;\n       Whereas Mexico and the United States share a 2,000 mile \n     border, Mexico is the United States' second largest trading \n     partner, and the two countries share historic and cultural \n     ties;\n       Whereas drug production and trafficking are a threat to the \n     national interests and the well-being of the citizens of both \n     countries;\n       Whereas U.S.-Mexican cooperation on drugs is a cornerstone \n     for policy for both countries in developing effective \n     programs to stop drug use, drug production, and drug \n     trafficking; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       (a) The Senate, on behalf of the people of the United \n     States\n       (1) welcomes the constitutional transition of power in \n     Mexico;\n       (2) congratulates the people of Mexico and their elected \n     representatives for this historic change;\n       (3) expresses its intent to continue to work cooperatively \n     with Mexican authorities to promote broad and effective \n     efforts for the health and welfare of U.S. and Mexican \n     citizens endangered by international drug trafficking, use, \n     and production.\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the incoming new governments in both Mexico and the \n     United States must develop and implement a counterdrug \n     program that more effectively addresses the official \n     corruption, the increase in drug traffic, and the lawlessness \n     that has resulted from illegal drug trafficking, and that a \n     one-year waiver of the requirement that the President certify \n     Mexico is warranted to permit both new governments time to do \n     so.\n\n  I appreciate very much Senator Grassley working with me on this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. All of my cosponsors represent a \nbipartisan effort across the borders and across both sides of the \naisle.\n  Mr. President, I want to just say I went to Mexico leading a \ndelegation of Members of Congress. It was the first congressional \ndelegation to visit Mexico with the new President-elect, and we were \nable to sit down and visit with both President Zedillo, the President \nof Mexico, and the President-elect, Vicente Fox. I want to say how \nencouraged we were with the dynamism of President-elect Fox, with his \nabsolute assurance that this drug issue is one of the most important of \nall the issues between our two countries, and they promised to work \nhand in hand with the new administration that will be elected in the \nUnited States in November, and with Members of Congress to do \neverything they can working with us to cooperate in stopping the cancer \non both of our countries that this drug trafficking is causing.\n  When we have a criminal element in Mexico and a criminal element in \nthe United States, that is bad for both of our countries. It is preying \non the ability of our country to have full economic freedom, to grow \nand prosper, and to have friendly relations across our borders. The \ndrug trafficking issue is the big cloud over both of our countries. I \nbelieve that President-Elect Fox is going to pursue this vigorously.\n  I also want to say that President Zedillo has taken major steps in \nthat direction for his country. He, first of all, laid the groundwork \nfor the democracy that clearly was shown in this last election. Instead \nof handpicking a successor and not allowing free primaries, he did the \nopposite. He allowed the free primaries and he said in every way they \nwere going to have open and free elections. President Zedillo has made \nhis mark on Mexico. He was a very important President for recognizing \nthat the time had come for free and open elections in Mexico. He is to \nbe commended, and I think he will go down in the history books as one \nof the great Presidents of Mexico.\n  In addition, President Zedillo tried very hard to cooperate in the \neffort that we were making in drug trafficking. I would say that no one \nbelieves that we are nearly where we need to be in that regard. But I \nthink he took some very important first steps.\n  I see a ray of sunshine in Mexico. Our country to the South is a very \nimportant country to the United States. They are our friends. We share \ncultural ties. We share family ties.\n\n  It is in all of our interests that we have the strongest bond between \nMexico and the United States--just as we have with Canada and the \nUnited States. These are our borders. I have always said that I believe \nthe strengthening of our hemisphere is going to be a win for all three \nof our countries.\n  I want to go all the way through the tip of South America in our \ntrading relations and in the building of all of our economies because I \nthink that is our future. Our countries depend on each other. We are \ninterdependent, and our friendship and our alliances will be important \nfor the security and viability of all of our countries in the Western \nHemisphere.\n  I am very pleased that we have introduced this sense of the Senate. I \nurge my colleagues to help us pass this sense of the Senate so that we \nwill be able, next session, to say that the Senate has spoken, and that \nwe want to give some time to certification so that our countries can go \nforward with our two new Presidents and have a strong working \nrelationship.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for no more than 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my attention was drawn this morning to an \narticle in the Washington Times where our Secretary of Energy, Bill \nRichardson, defends energy policy by saying something that I found \nfascinating, to the point of absurdity. He says, ``We are not in an \nenergy crisis.''\n  I am not quite sure how Mr. Richardson defines ``crisis,'' but I do \nknow Mr. Richardson has recognized, at least for 12 months, a problem. \nAm I to understand that the reason for the absence of an energy policy \nin the Clinton administration is that we recognize a problem, but we \nare not going to do anything about it until it becomes a crisis?\n  Home heating oil last year, in the Northeast, began at 80 cents to 90 \ncents a gallon. It went to nearly $2 before that season was over. It \nwas contracted this summer at $1.19, and it is now selling at $1.40. I \ncall that a crisis if I am low income and I want a warm home this \nwinter. I call it a crisis if I want to travel cross-country and I \ncan't afford to fill my gas tank. I call it a crisis if I am a trucker \nand I can't up my contracts to absorb my fuel or energy costs and I \nmust turn my truck back in, as thousands are now doing--turning their \ntrucks back in on the lease programs under which they acquired them \nwhen they planned to move the commerce of America across this country.\n  Mr. Secretary, earlier this year, you flew numerous times to the \nMiddle East with a tin cup in hand, begging the sheiks of the OPEC \nnations to turn the valve on just a little bit and let out a little \nmore oil, hopefully dropping the price of crude and therefore lowering \nthe cost at the pump. For a moment in time it worked. Then the price \nstarted ratcheting up as the markets began to understand that what had \nhappened was pretty much artificial and pretty much rhetorical in \nnature and that, in fact, the supplies had not increased to offset the \ndemand.\n  While all of that was going on, underneath the surface of this issue \nwere a few basic facts. We have lost over 30 refineries in the last \ndecade because they couldn't afford to comply with the Clean Air Act; \nthey couldn't retrofit in a profitable way. They were not given tax \ncredits and other tools because it was ``big oil'' and you dare not \ncause them any benefits that might ultimately make it to the \nmarketplace so the consumer could ultimately benefit. Those refineries \nwent down.\n  Here we are at a time when the price of crude oil peaked and the Vice \nPresident ran to the President and said please release SPR, and that \nhas been done, or at least it is now being organized to be done, and it \nmay lower prices. Yet that was a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that was \ndestined to be used only for a crisis. And the Secretary of Energy says \nno crisis. He himself said yesterday before the National Press Club \nthere is no energy crisis in this country. But there was a crisis last \nweek and the President agreed to release the oil out of SPR.\n  I don't get it. I do not think I am that ignorant. I serve on the \nEnergy Committee. We reviewed this. We have argued for a decade that \nthere is a problem in the making, but this administration will not put \ndown a policy, even though they see a problem, unless the problem \nbecomes a crisis.\n  But now there is not a crisis, so why are we releasing the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, which was designed not only for a crisis but for a \nnational emergency, one that was inflicted upon us by a reduction or a \nstoppage of the flow of foreign crude coming into our economy that \nmight put our economy at risk.\n  The Secretary says we have a short-term problem and we will work it \nout in time.\n  Mr. Secretary, what does ``working it out'' mean? Have you proffered \nor proposed a major energy policy before the Congress of the United \nStates? No, you\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\nhave not. Have you suggested an increase in production of domestic \nresources so we could lower our dependency on foreign oil? No, you have \nnot, Mr. Secretary.\n  So the American public ought to be asking of this administration, the \nVice President, the President, and the Secretary of Energy: Mr. \nSecretary, Mr. President, and Mr. Vice President, if there is no \ncrisis, then why are you tapping the very reserves that we have set \naside for a time of crisis? Somehow it doesn't fit.\n  There were political allegations 3 or 4 weeks ago when the Vice \nPresident was asking the President to release the petroleum reserve. He \nwas saying there was a crisis, or a near crisis. That got done. And \nyesterday,\n\n       In remarks before the National Press Club, [Secretary] \n     Richardson said the ``political campaign'' was behind Gore's \n     accusations against [big] oil companies and that a surge in \n     demand for oil in the United States and abroad is the real \n     reason gasoline, heating-oil and natural-gas prices have \n     soared this year. ``We are not in an energy crisis.''\n\n  Mr. Secretary, if you are traveling or if you are not wealthy and you \nhave to pick up the 100 percent increased cost in your energy bills and \nyour heating bills, I am going to tell you that is a crisis. But my \nguess is, it is typical of this administration, a problem is a problem \nuntil there is a crisis, and then you find a solution; 8 years without \na solution to this problem spells crisis.\n  I am sorry, Mr. Secretary, but your rhetoric doesn't fit the \noccasion, nor does it rectify the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes, and I ask to be followed by the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, who will speak on the same \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    The ``Captive Shipper'' Problem\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller and I, along with the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, have \nbeen working on legislation dealing with our railroad service in this \ncountry. We have introduced legislation, S. 621, entitled the Railroad \nCompetition and Service Improvement Act which addresses problems \nassociated with shippers who are ``captive'' or dependent on one \nrailroad for their shipping needs. Mr. President, I have with me a \nletter from over 280 chief executive officers of American corporations \nwriting about this subject.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record following my \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. These CEOs of some of America's largest companies, and \ncompanies all across this country, join us expressing concern about \nwhat has happened to America's railroads. There is no competition in \nthe railroad industry in this country. The deregulation of the rail \nindustry occurred, now, over 20 years ago. At that point, we had 42 \nclass I railroads. Now we are down to only about four major railroad \noperations in this country--two in the East and two in the West. Rather \nthan encouraging some competitive framework in the rail industry, the \nderegulation of the railroad industry has resulted in a handful of \nregional monopolies. They rely on bottlenecks to exert maximum power \nover the marketplace.\n  These megarailroads dominate railroad traffic, generating 95 percent \nof the gross ton miles and nearly 94 percent of the revenues, and they \ncontrol 90 percent of all coal movement in this country, 70 percent of \nall grain movement in America, and 88 percent of all chemical movement \nin this country.\n  It is quite clear what consolidation has meant to all Americans. Let \nme give a practical example. If you are a farmer in my State of North \nDakota and you want to sent a load of wheat to market and you put that \nload of wheat on a railcar in Bismarck, ND, and send it to Minneapolis, \nMN, a little over 400 miles, you will pay $2,300. If you are going to \nship that same carload of wheat from Minneapolis to Chicago, about the \nsame distance, you do not pay $2,300, you pay less than $1,000.\n  Why the difference? Why are we charged more than double as North \nDakotans to ship wheat about the same distance? Because there is no \ncompetition on the line from Bismarck to Minneapolis, but there is \ncompetition between Minneapolis and Chicago, so the prices are \ncompetitive. Where there is competition, there are lower rates. Where \nthere is no competition, there are monopoly prices. They say to \nbusinesses and farmers: Here's the charge; if you don't like it, don't \nuse our service.\n  What other service exists? There is only one line, only one railroad. \nThere is a monopoly service, and they are engaged in monopoly pricing, \nand we have no regulatory authority to say this is wrong.\n  We have what are called ``captive shippers.'' These are Main Street \nbusinesses, family farmers, big companies, small companies, and they \nare held captive by the railroad companies that say to them: We have \nthe rails, we have the cars, we have the company, and here's what the \nservice is going to cost you; if you don't like it, tough luck.\n  In the circumstance I just described, the railroad says to a North \nDakota farmer: We're going to charge you double what we charge other \npeople. Why? Because we choose to. Why? Because we want to; because we \nhave the muscle to do it, and if you don't like it, take a hike.\n  That is what is going on in this industry where there is no \ncompetition and where we have shippers being held captive all across \nthis country.\n  Do rail costs matter much to my part of the country? Let me give \nanother example.\n  Grain prices have collapsed. A farmer does not get much for grain \nthese days. If you take wheat to an elevator in Minot, ND, that \nelevator pays about $2.40 a bushel for it, which is a pittance--it is \nworth a lot more than that--the cost to ship that $2.40 a bushel wheat \nto the west coast is nearly $1.20 a bushel. Half the value of that \nwheat on the west coast ends up being transportation costs by the \nrailroad industry.\n  How can they do that? It's pricing gouging and nobody can do much \nabout it because there is no regulatory authority to say it is wrong. \nThey hide behind the Staggers Rail Act which deregulated the railroads, \ngave them enormous power, and resulted in a substantial concentration. \nThe result is, all across this country we have shippers who are now \nheld captive, they are locked in by an industry that says: This is what \nwe are going to charge you; if you don't like it, that's tough luck.\n  What happens if someone believes this is really arbitrary, really \nunfair and they intend to complain about it? We had what was called the \nInterstate Commerce Commission. That was a group of folks who had died \nfrom the neck up. Nobody told them, but they were dead from the neck up \nand had one big rubber stamp down there. It said: ``Approved'' They had \none big rubber stamp and one big ink pad. Whatever the railroads \nwanted, the ICC said: ``Approved.''\n  We got rid of the ICC. Now we have a Surface Transportation Board, \nand we have someone at the Surface Transportation Board, Linda Morgan, \nto whom I pay a compliment. She put a moratorium on mergers. We had \nanother proposal for a merger, and she slapped on a moratorium. That \nmerger fell apart. Good for her. It is the first good sign of life for \na long while among regulators. Good for her. But all of the merger \ndamage is pretty well done. Linda Morgan is fighting a lonely battle at \nthe Surface Transportation Board.\n\n  Let me show you what happens when somebody files a complaint for \nunfair rail charges. You file a complaint, and here are the steps. \nFirst of all, you need to ante up some money. The filing fee for the \nstandard procedure of complaint will be $54,000. It differs in some \ncases. If you have a beef with the railroad, first of all, understand \nyou are taking on somebody with a lot more money and muscle than you \nhave, No. 1. No. 2, you are going to pay a filing fee to file a \ncomplaint against the railroad freight rates, and then when you file \nthe complaint, you ought to expect to live a long time because you are \nnot going to get a result for a long, long time. In fact, some folks in \nMontana filed a complaint against a railroad. It took 17 years--17 \nyears--for the complaint to go through the process, and then it never \nreally got resolved in a\n\n[[Page S9887]]\n\nsatisfactory way. That is why rail shippers understand it does not make \nmuch sense to take the railroads on.\n  You have the railroad with the muscle to make these things stick, and \nthen you have regulators who have largely been braindead for a long, \nlong time and do not want to do much. The exception again is we have a \nnew Surface Transportation Board. Linda Morgan showed some courage, so \nthere is some hope with the current STB.\n  What is happening in this country must change. Senator Rockefeller, \nwho has been a leader on this issue, and I have held hearings on it. We \nboth serve on the Senate Commerce Committee. We are joined by Senator \nBurns in our efforts. It is a bipartisan effort.\n  We want to pass the S. 621, but we are not going to get it done by \nthe end of this year. What we are hoping for is that the 280 plus CEOs \nof companies across this country, large and small, who wrote this \nletter saying they are sick and tired of being held captive by shipping \nrates imposed by railroads that are noncompetitive--a rate that does \nnot often relate to value for service--will get the attention in \nCongress that they deserve. We hope these CEOs continue to weigh in, in \na significant way, with those who matter in this Congress to say: \n``Let's do something serious about this issue.'' This is a tough issue \nbut it is one Congress has a responsibility to tackle.\n  I pay credit to my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller. \nHe has been working on this issue for a long time. I have been \nprivileged to work with him. We know that which is worth doing takes \nsome time to get done often, but we are not going to quit. The message \nto the 280 companies that have signed this letter, the message to our \nfriends in Congress is: We have a piece of legislation that tries to \ntackle this issue of monopoly concentration and inappropriate pricing \nin the railroad industry. It tackles the issue on behalf of captive \nshippers all across this country--family farmers and Main Street \nbusinesses and others--and we are not going to quit.\n  We hope as we turn the corner at the start of this next Congress that \nwe will be able to pass legislation that will give some help and some \nmuscle to those in this country who are now paying too much. They \nexpect to be able to operate in a system that has competition as a \nregulator in the free market, and that has not existed in the rail \nindustry for some long while.\n  I yield the floor, and I believe my colleague from West Virginia will \nalso have some things to say.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 26, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ernest Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Commerce Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain and Senator Hollings: We are writing \n     to ask that shipper concerns with current national rail \n     policy be given priority for Commerce Committee action next \n     Congress. The Staggers Rail Act was enacted in 1980 with the \n     goal of replacing government regulation of the railroads with \n     competitive market forces. Since that time, the structure of \n     the nation's rail industry has changed dramatically. Where \n     there were 30 Class I railroad systems operating in the U.S. \n     in 1976, now there are only seven. While major railroads in \n     North America appear poised to begin another round of \n     consolidations in the near future, the Surface Transportation \n     Board continues to adhere to policies that hamper rail \n     competition. Structural changes in the rail industry combined \n     with STB policies have stopped the goal of the Staggers Rail \n     Act dead in its tracks.\n       We depend on rail transportation for the cost-effective, \n     efficient movement of raw materials and products. The quality \n     and cost of rail transportation directly affects our ability \n     to compete in a global marketplace, generate low cost energy, \n     and contribute to the economic prosperity of this nation. \n     Current rail policies frustrate these objectives by allowing \n     railroads to prevent competitive access to terminals, \n     maintain monopolies through ``bottleneck pricing,'' and \n     hamper the growth of viable short line and regional railroads \n     through ``paper barriers.''\n       We applaud the Commerce Committee's leadership on behalf of \n     consumers concerning proposed mergers in the airline \n     industry. America's rail consumers also need your support and \n     leadership to respond effectively to the dramatic changes \n     that are underway in the rail industry. Bipartisan \n     legislation is currently pending in both the Senate and House \n     of Representatives that takes a modest, effective approach in \n     attempting to remove some of the most critical impediments to \n     competition. Please work with us and take the steps that are \n     needed to create a national policy that ensures effective, \n     sustainable competition in the rail industry.\n           Sincerely,\n       Fred Webber, President and CEO, American Chemistry Council;\n       Glenn English, CEO, National Rural Electric Cooperative \n     Association;\n       Alan Richardson, Executive Director, American Public Power \n     Association;\n       Tom Kuhn, President, Edison Electric Institute;\n       Henson Moore, President and COE, American Forest and Paper \n     Association;\n       Kevern R.

Mr. President, all of us in our public lives on \noccasion meet an individual under circumstances and remains with us. \nThey are so powerful in their impact that they haunt us and, if we are \ntrue to our responsibilities, also lead us to involvement. It could be \ncircumstances of a struggling family attempting to pay their bills. It \ncould be someone in enormous physical or emotional distress.\n  I rise today because 3 years ago I met a young family from Burlington \nCounty, NJ, who had exactly this impact on me, my life, and my own \nservice in the Senate.\n  Kevin O'Donnell was 31 years old, a devoted father who was skiing \nwith his daughter one weekend, when he noticed a strange pain in his \nleg. It persisted, which led him to visit his family doctor. Here, he \nwas shocked to learn, despite his apparent good health, the vibrancy of \nhis own life and his young age, that he had been stricken with ALS, \nknown to most Americans as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  We are fortunate that ALS is a very rare disorder. It affects 30,000 \nindividuals in our Nation, with an additional 5,000 new cases diagnosed \nevery year. We should be grateful it is so rare because the impact on \nan individual and their health and their family is devastating. Indeed, \nthere are few diseases that equal the impact of ALS on an individual.\n\n  It is, of course, a neurological disorder that causes the progressive \ndegeneration of the spinal cord and the brain. Muscle weakness, \nespecially in the arms and legs, leads to confinement to a wheelchair. \nIn time, breathing becomes impossible and a respirator is needed. \nSwallowing becomes impossible. Speech becomes nearly impossible. Muscle \nby muscle, legs to arms to chest to throat, all motor activity of the \nbody shuts down.\n  While ALS usually strikes people who are over 50 years old, indeed, \nthere are many cases of young people being afflicted with this disease. \nOnce the disease strikes, life expectancy is 3 to 5 years. But the \ndifficulty is, life expectancy is not measured from diagnosis; it is \nmeasured from the first symptoms.\n  Diagnosing ALS is very difficult. What can appear as a pain in the \nleg can be overlooked for months. Muscle disorders can be ignored for a \nyear. Doctors have a difficult time diagnosing Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  Not surprisingly, after diagnosed, the financial burdens are \nenormous. Work is impossible. Twenty-four hour care is likely. \nWheelchairs, respirators, nursing care can easily cost between \n$200,000, to a quarter of a million dollars a year.\n  Families struggle with this financial burden while they are also \nstruggling with the certainty of death at a young age.\n  This leads me to the responsibilities of this institution.\n  Patients with ALS must wait 2 years before becoming eligible for \nMedicare. For 2 years--no help, no funds, no assistance. As a result, \n17,000 ALS patients currently are ineligible for Medicare services. And \nthousands of these\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\nindividuals will die having never received one penny of Medicare \nassistance. Their death from ALS is a foregone conclusion. It could \ncome in a year or 2 years or 3, but we are requiring a 2-year waiting \nperiod before there is any assistance.\n  Clearly, ALS, the problems of diagnosis, the certainty of death, the \nrapid deterioration of the human body, was not considered with this 2-\nyear waiting period.\n  Nearly 3 years ago, I first introduced legislation that would \neliminate the 24-month waiting period for ALS from Medicare. Most of \nthe people who were with me that day here in the Senate when we \nintroduced this legislation are now dead. Most of them never received \nany Medicare assistance. Only I remain, having been there that day \noffering this legislation again to bring help to these people.\n  But their agony and the burdens on their families have now been \nsucceeded by thousands of others, who at the time probably had never \nheard of ALS disease, certainly did not know that Medicare, upon which \ntheir families had come to rely, would be out of reach to them in such \na crisis.\n  The ALS Treatment and Assistance Act, since that day, has enjoyed \nbipartisan support, with 28 cosponsors in the Senate, 12 Republicans \nand 16 Democrats. In the House of Representatives, 280 Democrats and \nRepublicans have cosponsored the legislation.\n  This spring, the Senate unanimously adopted this legislation as part \nof the marriage penalty tax bill, which, of course, did not become law.\n  Both Houses, both parties have responded to this terrible situation.\n  Two weeks ago, when Senator Moynihan and Senator Daschle introduced \nS. 3077, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000, I was very proud \nthat the ALS provision was included in their legislation. Last \nWednesday, the ALS waiver was included in the balanced budget \nrefinement legislation approved by the House Commerce Committee. So \nthere is still hope.\n  As every Member of this institution knows, the calendar is late. \nRegretfully, we are again at a time of year when the legislative \nprocess ceases to work as it is taught in textbooks across the country. \nThere will not be an opportunity for me to advocate this legislation \nfor ALS patients by offering an amendment on the Senate floor to the \nMedicare package developed by the Finance Committee. That option is \nsimply not going to exist under the procedures and the calendar of the \nSenate.\n\n  I am, therefore, left with the following circumstances. Having lost \nmany of those ALS patients, on whose behalf I originally began this \neffort, a new group of families are now helping me across the country. \nThey, too, have a year or two remaining in their lives and need this \nhelp.\n  If I can succeed in getting this provision, with the support of my \ncolleagues, in the balanced budget refinements that ultimately will be \npassed by this Senate, for those people before their deaths, there is \nstill hope. If I fail, then these people, too, will expire before they \nget any assistance from the Government.\n  I do not know of an argument not to pass this legislation. I do not \nknow of a point that any Senator in any party, at any time, could make, \nto argue on the merits, that these ALS patients should not get a waiver \nunder Medicare, in the remaining months or years of their lives, to get \nsome financial assistance.\n  The unanimous support of the Senate previously, I think, is testament \nto the fact that we are of one mind. I simply now would like to ask my \ncolleagues, in these final days, knowing that there will be a Medicare \nbalanced budget refinement bill, that this provision be included.\n  I also, Mr. President, ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of the letter that was sent to Chairman Roth last week, \nsigned by 16 of my colleagues in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, \nasking for inclusion of the ALS legislation in a balanced budget \nrefinement package.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2000.\n     Hon. William V. Roth,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth: As the Finance Committee prepares to \n     mark-up a Balanced Budget Act refinement package for Medicare \n     providers, we urge your support for the inclusion of an \n     important provision of S. 1074, the Amyotrophic Lateral \n     Sclerosis Treatment Act. This provision would eliminate the \n     24-month waiting period for Medicare which prevents ALS \n     patients from receiving the immediate care they desperately \n     need.\n       As you know, ALS is a fatal neurological disorder that \n     affects 30,000 Americans. Its progression results in total \n     paralysis, leaving patients without the ability to move, \n     speak, swallow or breathe and therefore totally dependent on \n     care givers for all aspects of life. Without a cure or any \n     effective treatment, the life expectancy of an ALS patient is \n     only three to five years.\n       A common problem for individuals stricken with ALS is that, \n     due to the progressive nature of the disease and the lack of \n     any diagnostic tests, a final diagnosis is often made after a \n     year or more of symptoms and searching for answers. This \n     delay results in a loss of valuable time that could have been \n     spent in starting treatment early. Once a diagnosis is \n     finally made, the tragedy is needlessly worsened by \n     Medicare's 24-month waiting period which forces ALS patients \n     to wait until the final months of their illness to receive \n     care.\n       Eliminating this unfair restriction for ALS patients enjoys \n     strong bipartisan support in the Senate and the House. In \n     fact, the House version of this bill has the support of 280 \n     co-sponsors. Including this legislation in a BBA refinement \n     package will represent a first real step toward improving the \n     quality of life for Americans stricken with ALS. We look \n     forward to working with you, and appreciate your \n     consideration of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank you for the time and I thank \nmy colleagues for their indulgence. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. First, I would like to comment on the comments that \nwere made by Senator Torricelli from New Jersey. I thought they were \nprofound, moving, and obviously urgent.\n  What I regret to have to report to him is that the Senate Finance \nCommittee, on which I serve on the minority side, has concluded there \nwill be no markup. There will with no markup on the balanced budget \namendment. So this is very sad. This is part of the denigration of the \nprocess of this entire institution.\n  There is no health care legislation that has come out of the Finance \nCommittee, or anywhere else, in the last 2 years. We could go through \nthat litany.\n  But I want to report my profound discouragement to the Senator that \nwe were told yesterday there would be no markup, no markup on the one \nthing that we could do to help not only the people you are talking \nabout but all the hospitals and hospices and skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health agencies in our States which are suffering.\n  So we have to rely on the good will of the President when he meets \nwith leaders, Republican leaders. Hopefully, maybe a Democrat will be \nincluded in that meeting. Maybe something can happen.\n  But this is where we have arrived at in this institution. It is \nunfortunate. It is wretched. It has a terrible consequence for the \npeople who you so movingly and eloquently talked about.\n\n\n                          Railroad Competition\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to \nspeak about an issue--the plight of captive shippers--on which the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, spoke and on which I have been \nworking for 16 years, every day I have been in the Senate, with a \ncomplete, absolute, and total lack of success. One doesn't ordinarily \nadmit those things, but I say that because that is how bad the \nsituation is. That is how unwilling the Congress is to address this \nproblem even though it affects every single Senator and every single \nCongressman in the entire United States of America without a single \nexception.\n  How did this happen is the same question as asking why is it that \npeople complain about planes being late but don't take any interest in \naviation policy. We are a policy body. We are meant to deliberate; we \nare meant to discuss issues. We don't. We don't take any interest in \naviation. So we complain but don't do anything. We take no interest in \nrailroad policy, and so we don't complain and we don't do anything.\n  As a result, the American Association of Railroads, which is one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\nall-time most powerful lobbying groups in the country, has its way. As \nSenator Dorgan said, they have their way although there are only really \nfour or five railroads left. When I came here in 1985, as the junior \nSenator from West Virginia, there were 50 or 60 class I railroads. \nThose are the big ones. Now there are four or five, probably soon to be \ntwo or three.\n  When the Staggers Act was passed to deregulate the railroads, which \nunfortunately this Congress did in 1980, they divided it into two \nparts. They said for those railroads which had competition, the market \nwould set the price. But they said there are about--let's pick the \nnumber--20 percent of all railroads which have no competition. In the \ncoal mines, steel mills, granaries, and manufacturing facilities that \nthese railroads serve, there is no competition. Their rates would be \ndetermined by the Interstate Commerce Commission at that time. Now it \nis called the Surface Transportation Board. Very few of my colleagues \nknow anything about the Surface Transportation Board or knew anything \nabout the Interstate Commerce Commission, even though many of their \npeople are suffering vastly from the consequences of the inaction of \nthese two bodies.\n  We don't have railroad competition in many aspects of our economy. \nYou can't move coal by a pickup truck and you can't fly it in an \nairplane, you have to move it in a train. Sometimes you can put it in a \ntruck, but you have to basically put it in a train. The Presiding \nOfficer knows that very well; he comes from a State that produces coal.\n  I also am going to submit the same letter the Senator from North \nDakota did for the Record so it appears at the conclusion of my \nremarks. It is an extraordinary letter to Chairman McCain and Senator \nHollings signed by 282 CEOs--not government relations people, not \nlobbyists, but by CEOs. It is the most extraordinary document of \ncommitment and anger over a subject I have seen in the 16 years I have \nbeen in the Senate. I have never seen anything like this before.\n  This is obviously a matter of enormous importance to my State. Most \nof what we produce has to be moved by railroad: Chemicals; coal; steel; \nlumber. It is a place where railroads have an enormous presence and \nrailroads dominate.\n  This letter seeks to make railroad policy a top concern. These people \nsay it is their top legislative concern. They represent virtually every \nindustry, and all parts of the country.\n  I don't know how we got to this situation. I think it is ignorance on \nthe part of the Congress, it is inattention, to some degree laziness on \nthe part of the Commerce Committee and the Congress. It doesn't rise to \nthe level of a crisis which hits us one day and grabs all the \nheadlines. It is like the ALS about which the Senator from New Jersey \nwas talking. It just creeps slowly. It just gradually destroys parts of \nthe economy.\n\n  Let me explain the situation this way. Imagine if I decided I wanted \nto fly to Dallas, TX, from Charleston, WV, and I was told I had to go \nthrough Atlanta. We don't have a lot of direct connections out of West \nVirginia. And suppose the airline told me, told this Senator, that they \nwould not tell me how much my ticket would cost from Atlanta to Dallas. \nI would be outraged. All kinds of people would jump into the action. \nThey couldn't do that. That would be illegal. It would be wrong.\n  The railroads can do what the airlines are prevented from doing. They \ncan refuse to quote you a price on what is called bottleneck \nsituations, where they will not tell you how much it is going to cost \non a monopoly segment. By doing that they control the price of whatever \nyou are shipping, wherever you are shipping it. That is wrong.\n  One of the reasons they are able to do that is that railroads, unlike \nvirtually every other industry that has been deregulated, have \nantitrust exemption. Why do railroads have antitrust protection? Can \nanybody give me a reason they would have antitrust protection? They \nhave been deregulated. No other industry that has been deregulated has \nan exemption from our antitrust law, but the railroads do, because the \nAmerican Railroad Association moves very quietly and skillfully under \nthe radar of attention. It is a huge and powerful group. It doesn't \nmake waves, doesn't cause notice. It hands out tremendous amounts of \nmoney, but they do their work below the radar screen.\n  As a result, when chemicals move out of the Kenawha Valley and the \nOhio Valley in West Virginia and when coal moves out of southern West \nVirginia and northern West Virginia, we are victims in many \ncircumstances to captive shipping. We are captives of the railroads. \nThey can charge our companies whatever they want, and they do. It is \nillegal, but the railroads have on their side the Surface \nTransportation Board, which is supposed to ``regulate'' them, but \ninstead is concerned only with how much money the railroads are making. \nSo why should the railroads do anything other than make the most money \nthey can? And they do.\n  I know of no other situation like that in America. I come from a \nfamily that knew something about monopoly. And, properly and correctly, \na President named Theodore Roosevelt came along and ended that because \nit was wrong. It was done in those times. That is the way those \nbusinesses were done, but it was wrong.\n  Well, it is wrong what the railroads are doing today on captive \nshipping. For 16 years we have been fighting this--16 years, no \nprogress, nothing. The STB comes up and they say: We need to have rules \nand regulations from the Congress. The folks in the Commerce Committee \nsay: We are having all kinds of hearings.\n  We don't have hearings. We technically have hearings, but they are \nnot hearings. They are not probing hearings. A couple people drop in; a \ncouple people drop out. Consumers everywhere suffer from this, and they \ndon't even know about it. We should, because it is our responsibility \nto protect consumers. Where the law says the railroad companies cannot \ndo something which they are doing, we should be upset by that. And if \nit is 20 percent of railroad traffic, we should be angry about it. But \nwe don't care. We don't care.\n  Again, many, if not most, of the products and commodities--coal and \nchemicals especially--being shipped by companies in West Virginia these \nproducts are shipped by companies, are shipped by companies that are \ncaptive to a single railroad. Only one line serves most of these \nplants. The railroads have all power: This is what you are going to \npay; if you don't want to pay it, then we won't serve you.\n  And they use a lot of other strong-arm tactics, which I will not go \ninto, although I am protected on the floor and I could, and I would be \nhappy to, but I won't do it. But they use strong-arm tactics; they know \nhow to use them and they do use them. There are four or five major \nrailroads, and they can use strong-arm tactics and get away with it. \nAll the others have been merged and eaten up. So the shippers are \nforced to pay whatever the railroads want to charge. If my colleagues \nthink that is fair, fine.\n  This is what it's like: When you walk into a grocery store to buy \nbread, you know what bread is supposed to cost. But no, the grocer \nsays, no, you have to pay three times the usual cost. I don't think my \ncolleagues would stand for that. But my colleagues do put up with this, \nby continuing to let railroads charge whatever they want--not what the \nmarket says the cost should be--even though it costs their constituents \nand companies in their states more money than it should, and puts \npeople out of work.\n  Why won't my colleagues get interested in this subject? Why won't \nthey require the STB and the railroads to follow the law? Why doesn't \nthe Commerce Committee take this more seriously?\n  I cannot remember any significant period of time since I have been in \nthis body that I have not had a steady flow of complaints from my \n``captive'' shippers--large and small companies that are captive to one \nrailroad. They have no alternative but to pay what the railroad says \nthey must. There is only one line going in; what are they going to do? \nCarry it out by hand? The Staggers Act said the railroads shouldn't \nexercise this kind of control. The captive shippers cannot set their \nown price. The railroads set the price on the monopoly segment, often \nwithout telling shippers what the price is, and thereby control the \nprice along the entire route. This happens--today and every day--in the \nAmerican economy. This is free market?\n  So businesses in my State and in your State, Mr. President, and the\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\nState of the Senator from Alaska are hindered from making the kinds of \nprofits and putting a number of people to work because we in Congress \nchoose to ignore an enormous American problem.\n  I'd like to say a little bit about why this has all happened. I have \ntalked about the diminution of the number of railroads. We have just \ntwo railroads on the east coast and two on the west coast, and one \nrunning the length of the Mississippi. These five railroads collect 95 \npercent of all freight revenues, as Senator Dorgan said. Pretty soon, \nthat number may be reduced to just two railroads, period. These \nrailroads are not exactly having a hard time. This level of \n``competition''--with just a few railroads controlling 95 percent of \nthe traffic--means, prima facie, that we really have no competition at \nall. You just say 95 percent, and there you have it. By definition, \nthere is no competition.\n  During the last 5 years, the pace of railroad consolidation has been \ndizzying. In 1996, the merger of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific \nRailroads threw the entire country into crisis. Did we care? Yes, \nbriefly, for a week or so. There were some stories in the Wall Street \nJournal--we heard about the Houston railyard being shut down--and some \nof the rest of the country noticed, too. It was a strange and confusing \nrailroad problem, and we didn't have time to figure it out; that was \nour attitude. So it came and it went. But it cost endless millions of \ndollars and endless lost jobs.\n  But we need to look at what happened. The results of that merger--\ncreating one huge, unresponsive railroad, from two large unresponsive \nrailroads--were major service disruptions, plant closings, thousands of \nlost workdays, and endless millions of dollars lost by companies all \nover this country.\n  We had the same thing on a smaller scale in West Virginia and in the \nEast. We have had our own merger. Conrail was divided kind of piecemeal \nbetween CSX and Norfolk Southern Railroads. A period of disruption \nfollowed that merger also--perhaps not the scale of the UP-SP debacle--\nbut still devastating and frustrating to my manufacturers in my State \nand throughout the Northeast. The railroads didn't worry because they \nknew nobody here was paying any attention.\n\n  Rail consolidation isn't the only culprit. Several unjustified and \ncounterintuitive rulings made by the Surface Transportation Board and \nits predecessor agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission, have \nstifled railroad competition and made matters much worse.\n  These agencies have enormous power in our economy. Their key decision \nwas the 1996 ``bottleneck'' decision to which I have already referred. \nThat allows a railroad to remain in control of its essential \nfacilities, known as ``bottlenecks'' and effectively prevent a rail \ncustomer from getting to a competing railroad, or even getting a price. \nIn other words, where railroads share a line, they won't let you use \nit. They won't let anybody else use it. They won't tell you what it \nwould cost even if you work out some kind of arrangement. They control \nthe cost of shipping along your whole route, and they shut you down.\n  The court of appeals upheld the decision of the STB as not being \n``arbitrary or capricious.'' So that seems to be on the side of the \nrailroads. In its decision, the court of appeals went out of its way to \nsay that the bottleneck decision was, one, not the only interpretation \nthat the STB could have made under the law; and, two, not necessarily \nthe interpretation the court itself would have made.\n  Since then, the STB, predictably, has refused to revisit this \ndecision and seems to take the official position that it does not have \nthe legal authority to reach any other conclusion without specific \ndirection from Congress to put competition first. Well, I don't have \nany problem with that, except Congress hasn't been paying any attention \nand probably won't do that anytime soon. There is no chance we will do \nthat in the Commerce Committee now. Public anger hasn't been \ngalvanized, and congressional anger hasn't been galvanized. \nCongressional passiveness rules.\n  Under the protective rulings of the Surface Transportation Board, \nrailroads are the only industry in the Nation that have both been \nderegulated and allowed to maintain monopoly power over its essential \nfacilities. Congress, the Federal agencies, and the Federal courts have \nspecifically prevented telephone companies, airlines, natural gas \npipelines, and electric utilities from controlling essential \nfacilities, while at the same time they enjoy the benefits of \nderegulation.\n  I reject the notion that the Staggers Rail Act intentionally allowed \nrailroads to use their bottleneck facilities to prevent customers \naccess to competition. That is wildly illogical and wildly untrue. It \ngoes against every principle of the American market economy. Likewise, \nit makes no sense, and runs counter to the law of the land, for the STB \nto view protection of the financial health of the railroads as its \noverriding mission, which they do. In all of their history, they have \nnever found a railroad to be revenue adequate. That is the technical \nterm. In other words, they have never found a railroad which is making \nenough money. The railroads have to make more money, suppress \ncompetition, according to the STB.\n  So if we in Congress really care about the long-term viability of the \nfreight railroad industry, we have to examine and make fundamental \nchanges to the policy. But first we have to understand it--and we \ndon't, and we won't, until people get motivated.\n  The railroad industry itself is given unwarranted special treatment, \nabout which I have spoken, regarding the antitrust review. They are \ntotally exempt from review by the Antitrust Division of the Department \nof Justice. Instead, it is left to the Surface Transportation Board to \ndetermine whether a merger or acquisition is ``in the public \ninterest.''\n  Now, fortunately, as the Senator from North Dakota indicated, the STB \nis quite concerned about its merger policy. Hurrah. They see, as I do, \nthe very real and ominous possibility that a final round of railroad \nmergers could leave us with just two transcontinental railroads \ncarrying 97 percent of all American rail freight.\n  So the STB responded this year by instituting a 15-month moratorium \non major railroad mergers. They are also conducting a rulemaking on \ntheir merger procedures.\n  I commend this unprecedented and important letter from 282 chief \nexecutive officers of huge American companies and small American \ncompanies to all of my colleagues. My guess is that very few colleagues \nwill read that letter because we are passive, because this issue is \nunder our radar. Or more accurately, we have decided to ignore it. When \nit comes to ignoring this problem, we have an unblemished record of \nsuccess, even though our inaction hurts companies and people in every \npart of this country.\n  Their letter sends a compelling message to Congress that the status \nquo on railroad policy is unacceptable and must be changed. Senator \nBurns, Senator Dorgan, and I have a bill to do exactly that, if we can \nget anybody to pay attention to it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West \nVirginia. I sympathize with the exposure that his State has. Of course, \nmy State, unfortunately, is not connected to the rest of the United \nStates by rail. We have a State-owned railroad and would like to have \nthe opportunity to have a railroad connection. I am sympathetic to his \ncause.\n\n\n                             Energy Crisis\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address a couple of \nsituations that I think are paramount in our consideration of issues \nbefore us today. I know most of my colleagues are aware of the current \nsituation in Belgrade and the uprising against the dictatorship of \nMilosevic. I understand the situation is very grave at this time. I \nknow we are all hopeful there will be no serious loss of life as a \nresult of the uprising. I am sure my colleagues will join me in our \nprayers and hopes that the opposition's Kostunica will be successful in \nousting Milosevic and instituting a democratic and peaceful new \ngovernment in Yugoslavia. I know the Senate hopes for the best and that \nthe nightmare in Yugoslavia may soon be at an end.\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\n  Unfortunately, we have a similar situation in the Middle East and the \nfighting that is going on between the Israelis and the Palestinians. \nOver 67 people have been killed.\n  I think it appropriate at a time when we are facing an energy crisis \nin this country to recognize the volatility associated with the area \nwhere we are most dependent on our oil supply; namely, the Middle East. \nFifty-eight percent of our oil is imported primarily from OPEC.\n  As we look at the situation today, we recognize the fragility, if you \nwill, and the sensitivity associated with relying on that part of the \nworld, particularly when we see the action by this administration in \nthe last few days of drawing down oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve which is set up for the specific purpose of ensuring that we \nhave an adequate supply in storage if, indeed, our supply sources are \ninterrupted.\n  By drawing that reserve down 30 million barrels, we sent a signal to \nOPEC that we were drawing down own our savings account making us more \nvulnerable, if you will, to those who hold the leverage on the supply \nof oil; namely, OPEC, Venezuela, Mexico, and other countries.\n  I wanted to make that observation and further identify, if you will, \nthat we have a situation that needs correction. We still have time to \ndo it in this body; that is, to pass the EPCA reauthorization bill.\n  As a consequence of the effort by the majority leader yesterday to \nbring that bill up--H.R. 2884--the reauthorization bill, I think it is \nimportant that we recognize why we need it.\n  First, it reauthorizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The \nauthorization expired in March of this year.\n  It creates a home heating oil reserve with a proper trigger mechanism \nthat is needed.\n  It provides State-led education programs on ``summer fill\" and fuel \nbudgeting programs.\n  It requires the Secretary of Defense to concur with drawdowns and \nindicate that those drawdowns will not impact national security.\n  It strengthens weatherization programs by increasing the per-dwelling \nallowance.\n  It requires yearly reports on the status of fuel supply prior to the \nheating season.\n  We have worked hard at trying to bring this to the floor and get it \npassed.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from California indicated there was still \nopposition to the bill. It is my understanding that comments were made \nabout the bipartisan substitute we have offered. As a consequence, I \nbelieve there is a need for a response.\n  One, the Senator claimed that we could take up and pass the \nunderlying bill--H.R. 2884--without amendment.\n  This simply can't happen. The underlying bill does not contain \nresponsible trigger mechanisms to protect SPR from inappropriate \nwithdrawal.\n  The Secretary of Energy has asked for a more responsible trigger \nmechanism than is contained in the underlying bill. The Secretary is \nright. We need that. This is our insurance policy if we have a blowup \nin the Middle East.\n  Second, by accepting the House bill, we would lose the opportunity to \nstrengthen the weatherization program contained in the substitute and \nwe would also lose the mandate for a yearly report from the Department \nof Energy on the status of our fuel heading into the winter contained \nin the substitute.\n  These are important issues. I am sure the Senator from California \nwould agree that she would support these.\n  But, as a consequence, to suggest that we can accept the House bill \nthat doesn't include the triggering mechanism is the very point that I \nwant to bring up.\n  The Senator from California also said the Federal Government should \nnot be in the oil business and that they don't do well in the oil \nbusiness. I certainly agree. We don't do well with the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. We have bought high and sold low out of that \nreserve.\n  But it is even more important now that we have moved some of our oil \nto build up a heating oil reserve.\n  Isn't it ironic that the facts are, since the beginning of this year, \nmore than 152,000 barrels of distillate--heating oils, light diesels, \nand so forth--have been exported each day. We are exporting fuel oils \nand heating oils that we ought to be holding in our reserve since we \nhave a shortage of heating oil for the Northeast States that are so \ndependent on it. That is not what we are doing.\n  According to today's Wall Street Journal, that number is ballooning \neven higher because of tight supplies and higher prices in Europe. In \nother words, we need more of it here, but we are sending it over to \nEurope--as opposed to the administration putting a closure or requiring \nthat crude oil be taken out of SPR and be refined for heating oil and \nheld in this country in reserve.\n  That isn't in the requirement for the 30 million barrels that went \nout of SPR. The companies that bid on it can do whatever they wish with \nit. So we haven't accomplished anything. Where is it going? It is going \nto Europe.\n  I agree with the Senator from California that the Federal Government \nshould not be in the oil business. They are doing a lousy job of it, \nand their SPR withdrawal is strictly a political cover to try to imply \nthat the administration is doing something about the crisis so we don't \nget too excited about the election that is coming up. It is a charade.\n  The Senator from California claims the royalty-in-kind provisions are \na charade allowing oil companies to pay fair market value--and this \nSenator is trying to undercut efforts to resolve valuation issues.\n  While I would like to take credit for all the provisions in our bill, \nin fairness, they were worked out with the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Senator Bingaman, and the administration. In fact, the \nroyalty-in-kind program was initiated in 1994 by none other than Vice \nPresident Gore as part of the reinvention of government to test new, \nmore efficient ways of collecting its royalty share.\n  If the Senator from California is saying that Al Gore's efforts to \nreinvent government have been a failure and have cost the American \ntaxpayer millions of dollars, I would certainly respect her opinion.\n  Furthermore, a provision requires that the Government receive \nbenefits ``equal to or greater'' than it would have received under \na royalty evaluation program.\n\n  Finally, the Senator accused me--the Senator from Alaska--of trying \nto move this program ``in the dark of night.''\n  Well, I am disappointed by that statement. Prior to even taking this \nsubstitute up on the floor, my staff approached the staff of the \nSenator from California to work to resolve concerns in a good-faith \neffort.\n  The staff of Senator Bingaman, the ranking member of the Energy \nCommittee, which I chair, spent countless hours answering the Senator's \nquestions and addressing her concerns. Unfortunately, those efforts \nevidently have been unsuccessful.\n  So any argument that the RIK language in this bill has not gone \nthrough an appropriate process pales in comparison to that alleged lack \nof process involved in a ``rider'' on the same subject the Senator from \nCalifornia supports in the Interior appropriations bill.\n  You cannot have it both ways.\n  The arguments are simply empty rhetoric premised on the assumption \nthat oil companies are inherently bad and any program dealing with them \nmust be flawed. The implication is that the oil companies are \nprofiteering.\n  There is no mention that we were selling oil in this country at $10 a \nbarrel a year ago. Now it is $33 a barrel.\n  Who sets the price of oil? Is it ``Big Oil'' in the United States? \nNo. It is OPEC. OPEC provides 58 percent of the supply. It is Venezuela \nand Mexico. You pay the price, or you leave it.\n  I am prepared to bring up this bill under a reasonable time \nagreement, debate the issue at length, and have the Senator from \nCalifornia offer an amendment to strike the provision if she finds it \nobjectionable. That is her right. I support that right.\n  But it is time we move the Senate version of this very important bill \nto reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and establish a home \nheating oil reserve, and get the administration focused on the reality \nthat the oil they propose to take out of SPR is being refined and sent \nover to Europe to meet\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\ntheir heating oil demands. That is the reality.\n\n  If we don't move this legislation, the Senator from California will \nhave to bear the responsibility. It is unconscionable to me at a time \nwhen we face an energy crisis--not only oil and natural gas but other \nareas and in our electric industry--that we find some other important \nbills being held up. We have passed out of the Committee an electric \npower reliability bill. The purpose was the recognition that we have a \nshortage of generating capability in this country.\n  We have not expanded our generating capacity to meet the demand. As a \nconsequence of that, we have not progressed with a distribution system \nto meet the demand that is growing. So out of the Committee, along with \nSenator Gorton, we specifically worked to get an electric power \nreliability bill. It is sitting here waiting for passage. What it \ndoes--and the administration wants it--it sets up a way to share the \nshortage.\n  That sounds ironic, but we have a shortage of generating capacity. We \nhave seen spiking costs very high, hundreds and thousands of dollars, \nfor short periods of time. The reliability bill administers in a fair \nmanner, to ensure that if there is any surplus in one area, it is moved \nto other areas without the exposure of spiking. We cannot seem to move \nthat on the floor of the other body. We are going into a timeframe \nwhere, if we get a cold winter and higher electric demands, we will \nneed that legislation.\n  Another bill, of course, that we considered is our electricity \nderegulation bill, a comprehensive bill. The problem was there was a \nmandate to have 7\\1/2\\ percent of our energy derived from renewables. \nThat is easy to say. The administration mandated that bill. But there \nis no way to enforce it because we simply don't have the technical \ncapability to achieve 7\\1/2\\ percent of our energy from non-hydro \nrenewables. It is less than 2 percent now.\n  They say we haven't spent enough money or been dedicated or made a \ncommitment. I remind my colleagues, we have extended in 5 years $1.5 \nbillion in direct spending to subsidize development of renewables. We \nhave given tax incentives for renewables of $4.9 billion. I support \nrenewables, but we just can't pick them up. The wind doesn't always \nblow outside. In my State of Alaska, it is not always sunny. Solar \npanels do not always work.\n  As a consequence, I remind my colleagues, when you fly out of \nWashington from time to time, you don't leave here on hot air, you need \nenergy. We have a crisis. We have not passed the electric power \nreliability legislation, we have not passed comprehensive electricity \nderegulation, and we are in a situation where we have taken oil from \nSPR and now we are seeing that oil move to Europe.\n  I want to use the remaining time to do a contrast because I want to \nemphasize the significance of the energy policies as proposed by our \ntwo Presidential candidates. Make no mistake, on energy policy the \ndifferences between Vice President Gore and Governor Bush could not be \nmore clear.\n  Let's look at costs. We have added up the Bush proposal, $7.1 billion \nover 10 years. The Gore proposal, which the newspapers have added up--\nwhich are usually somewhat favorable to the Vice President--costs 10 \ntimes more than that, somewhere between $80 and $125 billion. They are \nstill trying to pin down the figures. The Vice President wants to raise \nprices and limit supply of fossil energy, which makes up over 80 \npercent of our energy needs. By discouraging domestic production, the \nadministration has forced us to be more dependent on foreign oil, \nplacing our national security at risk and, of course, raising prices.\n  The Vice President's only answer in the first debate was to give you \nsolar, wind, biomass technologies, that are not yet available. Again, I \nremind my colleagues, we have spent $1.5 billion in direct spending and \n$4.9 billion in tax incentives over 5 years trying to develop more \nrenewables.\n  In contrast, Governor Bush would expand domestic production of oil \nand natural gas, reduce imports below 50 percent, and ensure affordable \nand secure supplies by developing resources at home. He would invest \nample resources into emerging clean fossil technologies, renewable \nenergy, and energy conservation programs, but, most of all, he won't \nbet on our energy future. Governor Bush will use the energy of today to \nyield cleaner, more affordable energy sources for tomorrow.\n\n  Now, let's look at the record. The Vice President has said he has an \nenergy plan that focuses not only on increasing the supply but also \nworking on the consumption side. The facts show the Vice President \ndoesn't practice what he preaches. The administration has actually \ndecreased energy supply during the past 7\\1/2\\ years. They have opposed \ndomestic oil production and exploration. We have 17 percent less \nproduction since Clinton-Gore took office. We have closed 136,000 oil \nwells and 57,000 gas wells since 1992. They oppose the use of plentiful \nAmerican coal and clean coal technology. The EPA makes it uneconomical \nto have a coal-generating plant. The demand is there for energy, but \nclearly coal is simply almost off limits because of the process.\n  We force the nuclear industry to choke on its waste. We are one vote \nshort in this body of passing a veto override, yet the U.S. court of \nappeals, in a liability case, ruled the Government had the \nresponsibility to take the waste. The cost to the taxpayers here is \nsomewhere between $40 and $80 billion in liability due the industry as \na consequence of the Federal Government's failure to honor the sanctity \nof the contract.\n  They have threatened to tear down hydroelectric dams. Where are they \ngoing to place the traffic that moves on barges? Put it on the \nhighways? That will take away 10 percent of our Nation's electricity.\n  They ignored electric power reliability and supply concerns. Go out \nto San Diego and see the price spikes there--no new generation, no new \ntransmission in southern California.\n  They have claimed to support increased use of natural gas, yet they \nhave kept Federal lands off limits to natural gas production; \napproximately 64 percent of the overthrust belt in the Midwest--\nWyoming, Colorado, Montana--is off limits to exploration. We all \nremember in this body the Vice President coming and sitting as \nPresident of the Senate, utilizing his tie-breaking vote in 1993 to \nraise the gas tax.\n  We recall initially he wanted a Btu tax to reduce consumption of \nenergy when the administration first came in. There has been a series \nof taxes. We heard a lot about it in the debate the other day. The Vice \nPresident said the tax plan favors the richest 1 percent. Yet 2 percent \nof the people pay 80 percent of the taxes. He didn't mention that.\n  Talking about crude oil and the Vice President, instead of doing \nsomething to increase the domestic supply of oil, the Vice President \nseems to want to blame big oil for profiteering as a cause for high \nprices. This simply is an effort to distract attention from the real \nproblems, to cover for this Administration's lack of a real energy \nstrategy.\n  One year ago, oil was being given away at $10 a barrel. Who was \nprofiteering, Mr. Vice President? Were American oil companies simply \nbeing generous? The small U.S. companies-- ``Small Oil''--were \nsuffering, with 136,000 stripper and marginal oil wells closed. Our \ndomestic energy industry was in real trouble. Stripper wells cannot \nmake it at $10 a barrel.\n  The six largest oil companies--Al Gore's ``big oil''--only comprise \n15 percent of the world oil market. In contrast, OPEC--Saudi Arabia, \nIran, Venezuela, Mexico, Iraq--produce 30 million barrels a day and \ncontrol 41 percent of the world's oil market. OPEC controls the supply. \nTherefore, they set the price, not the United States.\n  If we don't like their price, I guess we don't have to buy their oil. \nBut obviously we are addicted to it. By discouraging domestic \nexploration and increasing our reliance on foreign oil, the Vice \nPresident would take away that option, essentially, forcing us to pay \nOPEC's price for oil, holding us hostage to foreign governments, as the \ncase is now.\n\n  What about Governor Bush? He would encourage new domestic oil and gas \nexplorations. As he said Tuesday: The only way to become less dependent \non foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. Charity begins \nat home.\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\n  Just opening up the ANWR Coastal Plain in my State of Alaska to \nexploration would increase domestic production by a million barrels a \nday. I bet it would drop the price of oil $10 to $15 a barrel. The same \namount, a million barrels a day, is slightly more than what we import \nfrom Iraq. Here is a person we don't trust, whom we fought a war \nagainst, yet we are dependent on, and that is Saddam Hussein. Shouldn't \nwe produce this oil at home rather than risk our national security by \nrelying on Iraq for energy needs?\n  Yesterday I gave a few facts, not fiction, about oil exploration and \ngas exploration in my State. My colleague from Nevada, who is not on \nthe floor today, continued to refer to outdated estimates and \nrecoverable oil from ANWR using oil prices. He said at a price of $18 a \nbarrel, ANWR was likely to yield a low-end estimate of 2.4 billion \nbarrels, but that still is 1 million barrels a day for 6 years, Mr. \nPresident.\n  And the prices will be much higher than that--they will be $25 a \nbarrel, or more. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the ANWR \nCoastal Plain is likely to yield 10 billion barrels of recoverable oil, \nnearly as much as Prudhoe Bay. But it is interesting to reflect on \nPrudhoe Bay because that one area has supplied one-fifth of our oil \nneeds for the last 20 years. ANWR could do the same for the next 20 \nyears. Remember the realities associated with estimates. They estimated \nPrudhoe Bay would produce 10 billion barrels, and it has produced over \n12 billion and is still producing over a million a day.\n  I want to talk about natural gas because Governor Bush's energy plan \nis more than just increasing the domestic supply of oil. He would also \nexpand access to natural gas on Federal lands and build more gas \npipelines.\n  The Vice President makes no mention of natural gas, leaving the most \ncritical part of America's energy mix policy simply unsaid. Yet natural \ngas is vital for home heating and electric power. 50 percent of U.S. \nhomes, 56 million, use natural gas for heating. Natural gas provides 15 \npercent of our Nation's electric power, and that generating capability \nhas no place to go for more capacity other than natural gas because you \ncan't get permitted. Mr. President, 95 percent of our new electric \npower plants will be powered by natural gas as the fuel of choice, but \nthis administration refuses to allow the exploration and production of \ngas, or the construction of pipelines, to increase the supply of gas to \ncustomers.\n  Demand has gone up faster than supply. This yields higher prices. And \nour demand for gas will only increase. The EIA expects natural gas \nconsumption to increase from 22 trillion cubic feet now to 30 to 35 \ntrillion cubic feet by 2010.\n  The administration touts natural gas as its bridge to the energy \nfuture--our cleanest fossil fuel--fewer emissions, efficient end use \nfor industrial and residential applications, huge domestic supply, no \nneed to rely on imports. Yet they place Federal lands off limits to new \nnatural gas production. Where are we going to get it? Mr. President, 64 \npercent of the Rocky Mountain overthrust belt is off limits. The \nroadless policy of the Foreign Service locks up 40 million acres of \npublic land, and there is a moratorium on OCS drilling until 2012. \nWhere is it going to come from, thin air?\n  Al Gore would even cancel existing leases. He made a statement in \nRye, NH, on October 21, 1999:\n\n       I'll make sure there is no new oil leasing off the coasts \n     of California and Florida. And then I would go much further: \n     I will do everything in my power to make sure that there is \n     no new drilling off these sensitive areas--even in areas \n     already leased by previous administrations.\n\n  The American people ought to wake up. Where is our energy going to \ncome from? Now there is no strategic natural gas reserve, is there, \nlike we have for an oil, for the Vice President to fall back on in the \ncase of natural gas prices. This administration simply ignored energy, \nand now we are in trouble and they are covering their behind.\n  Natural gas is now over $5.30 per thousand cubic feet. Less than 10 \nmonths ago it was $2.16.\n  The differences are clear. The Vice President would limit new natural \ngas production and force higher prices for consumers. Governor Bush \nwould encourage domestic production of natural gas and the construction \nof pipelines to get it there.\n  We talked, finally, about renewables. The Vice President said Tuesday \nthat:\n\n       We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current \n     technologies to have a whole new generation of more \n     efficient, cleaner energy technologies.\n\n  That sounds fine, but how are we going to get there? I think we all \nagree in this case our energy strategy should include improved energy \nefficiency, as well as expanded use of alternative fuels and renewable \nenergy and a mix of fuel oil, natural gas, nuclear, and hydro.\n\n  But the critical question is how do you get there from here? The Vice \nPresident would make a bet. He would bet that by diminishing supply of \nconventional fuels such as oil and natural gas, you will be more \nwilling to pay higher prices and make renewables competitive. He will \nsupport higher energy taxes, just as he did in 1993 when he cast the \ntie-breaking vote to raise gas taxes. And he will favor more \nregulations, more central controls on energy use standards for each \npart of our everyday life.\n  The Vice President will tell you what kind of energy you could use, \nhow much of it you could use, and how much you would have to pay for \nit.\n  In contrast, Governor Bush would harness America's innovative \ntechnological capability and give us the technologies of tomorrow by \nusing the American ``can do'' spirit. Governor Bush would set aside the \nup-front funds from leasing Federal lands from ANWR, for oil and gas--\nthe ``bid bonuses''--to be earmarked for basic research into renewable \nenergy. He has a plan. It is a workable plan. It is not smoke and \nmirrors. The production royalty from oil and gas leases would be \ninvested in energy conservation and low-income family programs such as \nLIHEAP or weatherization assistance. Using tax incentives, Governor \nBush would expand use of renewable energy in the marketplace--building \non successful experience in the State of Texas. As a result of Governor \nBush's efforts on electricity restructuring, Texas will be one of the \nlargest markets for renewable energy, about 2000 new megawatts.\n  Finally, Governor Bush would also maintain existing hydroelectric \ndams and streamline the Federal relicensing process. Al Gore would \nbreach the dams in the Pacific Northwest.\n  The Vice President will try to lay the blame on Congress. He said we \nhave only approved about 10 percent of their budget requests for \nrenewable energy. Here again the Vice President is twisting the facts. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, we have provided $2.88 \nbillion in funding for renewable energy since 1992; 86 percent of their \nrequest.\n  The conclusion, the bottom line, is the contrast between the \ncandidates and their energy policies could not be more clear. The Vice \nPresident wants to raise prices and limit the supply of fossil energy \nwhich makes up over 80 percent of our energy needs, replacing it with \nsolar, wind, and biomass technologies which are just not widely \navailable or affordable today.\n  Governor Bush would expand the domestic production of oil and natural \ngas, ensuring affordable and secure supplies. He won't bet on our \nenergy future. Governor Bush will use the energy of today to yield \ncleaner more affordable energy sources for tomorrow.\n  The choice for the American consumers on November 7 is clear. Support \na candidate with a positive plan to reduce dependence on Saddam \nHussein, the Middle East, and other areas; produce here at home and use \nall our energy resources, our coal, our oil, our hydro, our nuclear, \nand natural gas because we are going to need them all to keep the U.S. \neconomy going.\n  Remember, you can't fly out of here on hot air.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The time until 2 o'clock is \nunder the control of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed \nto speak for up to 5 minutes, with the consent from the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Yugoslavia\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my intention to speak for a \ncouple of\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nminutes, and then I will suggest the absence of a quorum and ask if the \ndistinguished Chair would also like to say a few words. And if he \nindicates such, I will step aside.\n  I want to speak about something that is happening that is very \nimportant to our country and to the rest of the world. As we speak, \nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslavian people are demonstrating in the \nstreets, saying they want the election result to be declared. It was an \nelection. There is a question about how free it was.\n  Certainly President Milosevic is trying to have a runoff, to have \ntime to get his troops back together. But it is clear the people of \nYugoslavia are standing up for their rights. During all the time the \nUnited States has been dealing with the issue of President Milosevic \nand his wife continuing to keep down the people of Yugoslavia and the \nsatellite countries--Montenegro, Macedonia, Kosovo--to keep them from \nhaving the opportunity to express their free will, we in America have \nsaid to the people of Yugoslavia: Please, make your voices heard.\n  We will be supportive of what the people of that country want to \nhappen. Clearly, there has been somewhat of a revolution in this last \nelection period.\n  I hope and pray for the people of Yugoslavia that they will get their \nvoice, that they will have their voices heard, that they will have \nrepresentation in Parliament, and that the truly elected President of \nYugoslavia will be able to take office.\n  It is impossible for us to know if the election was fair. It is \nimpossible for us to know if there should be a runoff. Certainly the \npeople have taken matters into their own hands, and they have shown a \nspirit that cannot be denied.\n  The hearts and prayers of the people of America are with the people \nof Yugoslavia today, hoping they will be able to have a free and fair \nPresidential election; that they will be able to have a Parliament that \nis truly representative of the people of Yugoslavia. That extends to \nthe people of Montenegro, the people of Macedonia, the people of \nKosovo, that they, too, will have their free will to be in control of \ntheir countries.\n  We are watching in our country and we wish them the best. We hope the \npeople of Yugoslavia can take control of their own destiny. That is \nwhat we would wish for every person in the world, for every country in \nthe world, and no less certainly for Yugoslavia.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to all the \nMembers of this distinguished body and, in particular, our Senate \nleaders on both sides of the aisle for the opportunity they have given \nme over the last couple days to speak to a matter of great importance, \nin my mind, a matter which, though it concerns only a relatively small \nportion of the Interior conference committee report that is before the \nSenate, I think nonetheless is a matter that goes to the heart of the \nGovernment's appropriations process.\n  I want to review and describe the filibuster I have conducted since \nabout 2 days ago. It has had four major parts.\n  First, I explained the project about which I was concerned: The \nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library to be built in Springfield, IL. \nThis is a project I support, and I am working to help make sure the \nproject is adequately funded over the next couple years in the Senate.\n  Second, I explained our insistence on Federal competitive bidding and \ndescribed the bill the Senate supported which detailed the competitive \nbid provision. This body, on its own, when focused on the narrow issue \nof whether the Federal funding the Congress is approving for the \nAbraham Lincoln Library would require that the project be competitively \nbid in accordance with Federal bidding guidelines, all Members from all \n50 States, agreed that the Federal competitive bid guidelines should be \nattached.\n  However, the Interior conference committee report that is before us \nhas stripped out that competitive bidding requirement, and since the \nproject now is in the heart of this Appropriations Committee report, \nwhich has many other projects and appropriations for programs and \nDepartments of the Federal Government all over the country, it is now \nin a bill that will no doubt pass the Senate.\n  Third, I compared the State versus the Federal procurement process \nand procedure.\n  Finally, I gave the context in which these concerns arise. I read a \nseries of articles from publications from throughout the State of \nIllinois that discussed, first, the various contexts in which the \nissues of competitive bidding have come up in the State of Illinois \nand, second, the potential for insider abuse when there are not tight \nrequirements that competitive bidding be applied to a government \nconstruction project or a government lease or to practically any kind \nof project in which the Federal or State government is involved.\n  It has been my effort to make the best possible case that Federal \ncompetitive bidding rules should be attached to the Lincoln Library.\n  I began by reviewing the time line of this project. This project was \nfirst discussed 2 years ago, or more, under the administration of then \nGov. Jim Edgar of the State of Illinois. In the first few months of \nFebruary 1998, Governor Edgar at that time was proposing a $40 million \nlibrary. Later, we saw how, by March of 1999 in a new administration, \nthe project had grown to a $60 million project. Then we saw how, by \nApril of 1999, they were discussing $148 million project to construct \nthe Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, IL.\n  Since then, I think the numbers have fallen back down, and we are \nreally talking about a $115 million to $120 million project: $50 \nmillion will come from the Federal Government, $50 million will come \nfrom the State, and the rest will come from private sources.\n  I also talked about the specific language in the Interior conference \ncommittee report that is before us.\n  I noted that that authorization for $50 million in funding, coupled \nwith an appropriation for $10 million that would be distributed in this \nfiscal year, does not specify who is to get the $50 million \nauthorization. The authorization language does not require that the \nmoney be delivered to the State of Illinois. It says the money will be \ndelivered to an entity that will be selected later by the Department of \nthe Interior in consultation with the Governor of the State of \nIllinois.\n  I have been concerned by the wide open nature of that language. When \nyou think about wording a bill that money will be funneled to an entity \nthat is going to be selected later, we do not know what that entity is. \nThat raises cause for concern. What happens if that money falls outside \nof the hands of State or Federal officials altogether and is in private \nhands? Will there be any controls on it at all?\n  I also mentioned that I was concerned, if this money did go to the \nState of Illinois--it may well go to the State of Illinois--the State \nwould probably hand it over to its Capital Development Board.\n  I noted that the Illinois Capital Development Board, which builds \nmany of the State's buildings, such as prisons, built the State of \nIllinois Building in the city of Chicago, IL. They have an unusual \nprovision in the general State procurement code, a highly irregular and \nunusual provision, that allows the Capital Development Board to \nestablish ``by rule construction purchases that may be made without \ncompetitive sealed bidding and the most competitive alternate method of \nsource selection that shall be used.''\n  I pointed out that with this lack of a hard and fast requirement, if \nthe money were to flow to the State of Illinois, and the Capital \nDevelopment Board were to construct this library, the Capital \nDevelopment Board, by their own statute, would have the authority to \nopt out of competitively bidding this project.\n  I do not think a project of any magnitude, paid for by the taxpayers, \nshould be done without competitive bidding. Obviously, there is too \nmuch potential for abuse. We want to make sure we get the best value \nfor the taxpayers. It would be irresponsible for\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\nthe Congress to not require competitive bidding, in my judgment, and \nnot just on a small project but most particularly for a very large \nproject such as this, a $120 million project.\n  I also want to note--to give some scale to the size of a $120 million \nbuilding--we have some Illinois structures and cost comparisons. The \nsource for this is the State Journal-Register, the newspaper in \nSpringfield, IL, from a May 1, 2000, article.\n  They said that the estimated cost, adjusted for inflation, of \nbuilding the Illinois State Capitol in today's dollars would be $70 \nmillion. So $120 million is much more expensive. The Lincoln Library \nwould be much more expensive than the State capital.\n  There is another building in Springfield that is worth $70 million. \nThat is the Illinois State Revenue Department building, the Willard Ice \nBuilding, built in 1981 to 1984. It would probably cost about $70 \nmillion to build. That is a huge building.\n  The Prairie Capital Convention Center: It is estimated to have cost \n$60 million in today's dollars.\n  The Abraham Lincoln Library will be much more expensive than all of \nthese very major buildings in Springfield, IL. On a project of this \nmagnitude, obviously we need to have the construction contracts \ncompetitively bid.\n\n  In discussing the State procurement code, I noted that the State \nCapital Development Board had the ability to opt out of competitively \nbidding projects. It was for that reason, when I saw the language of \nthis measure that originally came over to us from the House, I decided \nwe ought to look at attaching tougher guidelines.\n  We compared the State procurement code to the Federal procurement \ncode, and I determined that in order that we not have to worry about \nthe State opting out of competitive bidding, and in order that we not \nhave to worry about some other flaws in the State procurement code, we \nwould instead attach the Federal guidelines.\n  When I was in Springfield as a State senator for 6 years, back in \n1997 I voted for the current State procurement code. It is indeed some \nimprovement over the old State procurement laws. Nonetheless, it does \nhave some problems and it could be better. I regret that I missed the \nloophole that allows the Capital Development Board to opt out of \ncompetitively bidding a project.\n  I also discussed, at length, yesterday how the Capital Development \nBoard was sending around a letter saying they would competitively bid \nthis project, no matter what. They also suggested that their rules \nrequire them to competitively bid this project.\n  That contention is conclusively demolished by the language of the \nState statute, which shows that they do not have to competitively bid. \nThey are sending out a letter saying they would competitively bid. \nObviously, that does not create a legal requirement. They sent the \nletter to me. Maybe it creates a contractual obligation to me, but it \ndoes not make them legally accountable in the bidding process. How can \nyou hold someone accountable if the code is optional? That is the \nproblem with the State procurement code.\n  Furthermore, I noted, when I had a discussion with Senator Durbin--\nhe, of course, along with all other Senators in this body, supported \nthe passage of the Senate provision which required competitive bidding \nin accordance with the Federal guidelines. However, he did raise the \nquestion, How would the State be able to adapt itself so it would apply \nthe Federal competitive bidding guidelines?\n  I pointed out that the State code contemplates, in fact, that from \ntime to time Federal guidelines will be attached on grants from the \nFederal Government and that the State has statutory authority to adopt \nall its forms and procedures in order to make sure they can comply with \nguidelines imposed by the Federal Government, much in the same way the \nState would have to comply with any guidelines the Federal Government \ngave along with funding for education, for health care for the \nindigent, for Medicaid dollars, or the like. Absolutely, there is \nnothing wrong with that, nor is there anything unusual about that. That \nis why the State contemplates it in its procurement code.\n  I also reviewed, at length, the context in which this debate has \noccurred. I read a series of articles from publications throughout the \nState of Illinois into the Record. Those articles discuss the various \ncontexts in which competitive bidding had come up before in the \nawarding of construction contracts, of leases for State buildings, of \nlicenses for riverboats.\n  I also discussed loans the State had given out back in the early \n1980s to build luxury hotels, loans that never were repaid, and it \nseemed the borrowers had never really been held fully accountable.\n  I told you that from my experience of several years in the Illinois \nState legislature, I could not casually dismiss this history. It is \nseared in my memory from many bruising battles I had when I was a State \nsenator in the Illinois State Senate from 1993 to the end of 1998.\n  Finally, we asked the question whether the Lincoln Library is another \none of those insider deals, such as the ones we discussed when we read \ninto the Record stories of leases of State buildings to the State in \nwhich it seemed the people who owned the property made out real well \nbut the State seemed to be paying very exorbitant rental rates, and \nalso mishaps that we had with construction projects in the past.\n  We described how, with the very lucrative Illinois riverboat \nlicenses, some of which could be worth in the hundreds of millions of \ndollars each, the minute you got one of those riverboat licenses, you \nwould have the ability to earn in some cases $100 million a year, and \nthat these licenses could be considered extremely valuable. They would \nprobably sell on the open market for many times the amount of annual \nearnings that would accrue to one of those licenses.\n  We described how those very valuable licenses were given out in the \nState of Illinois on a no-bid basis for a total consideration of \n$85,000 apiece. I described how I thought that was wrong, that those \nlicenses, instead of being handed out as political bonbons to connected \npolitical insiders who happen to be longtime, big-dollar contributors \nto both sides of the aisle, that we should not have just given them \naway like that. They should have been competitively bid, and the people \nwho wanted those lucrative licenses should not have been going through \nthe legislature or through a gaming board made up of officials \nhandpicked by the Governor to see who would become the next \nmultimillionaire in the State of Illinois.\n  Had we had competitive bidding for those riverboat licenses, then we \nmight not have had all the articles written about how it was that only \na handful of politically connected people just happened to wind up \nbeing the ones who got these phenomenally lucrative gambling licenses.\n  They were lucrative licenses not only because they were gambling \nlicenses but because they were monopoly licenses. There could be only \n10 riverboats in the State of Illinois. If there could only be 10 \nrestaurants or 10 hotels in the State of Illinois, then the license to \noperate one of those restaurants or hotels would be very valuable as \nwell.\n  We reviewed at length all the problems that happened and all the \nquestions that get raised when a governmental body gives out privileges \nor contracts or leases without tight procedures to make sure that \npolitical favoritism does not enter into the equation and without tight \nguidelines to make sure there is a fair and equitable competitive \nbidding process.\n  After this whole discussion, in which some names of prominent \npolitical people seemed to be coming up again and again and again in \nmany of the articles, we finally arrived at the question, is this \nAbraham Lincoln Library to be built in Springfield--the construction \nhas not started yet; it is scheduled to start on Lincoln's birthday \nnext year, 2001; they have awarded some architecture and engineering \ncontracts and some design contracts--just another insider deal? We \nconcluded that it may or may not be. We won't know until it is done, \nuntil we see how it is done. But we concluded that, clearly, given the \nwhole history of problems we have seen again and again and again in \nrecent State history with the awarding of construction contracts, \nleases, privileges, licenses, that we ought to do our very best to \nprevent this project from becoming just one more insider deal. And\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n\nwe noted what a horrible, ugly irony it would be if a monument to \n``Honest Abe'' Lincoln, arguably our country's greatest President, \nwound up having any taint at all.\n\n  That is what we are seeking to avoid. We should do our very best to \nprevent it from becoming an insider deal.\n  Moreover, we have many red flags that have to be taken into account. \nWe have the price increases from $40 to $60 to now $120 million. We \nhave the location of the library. The library site has recently been \nselected. This is a map of Springfield. This is the State Capitol \ncomplex. This is where Abraham Lincoln's home is. It is now run by the \nNational Park Service. There is, in fact, an entire neighborhood that \nhas been renovated and kept up to look as we think it looked in the day \nand age that Abraham Lincoln and his family lived there.\n  This is where the Capital Convention Center is. This is where the \nAbraham Lincoln Library is now planned. That was the site selected. \nMaybe that is the best site. I don't know. One may never know. It is \nclose to the old State Capitol, which Abraham Lincoln actually served \nin and spoke in when he was a State legislator. It is near the Abraham \nLincoln law office. Is it the best site? I don't know. Did political \nfavoritism come into consideration in selecting that site? I don't \nknow. We don't know.\n  One thing is interesting, though. This hotel, the Renaissance \nSpringfield Hotel, is very close to the proposed library. That is the \nhotel that, as we discussed yesterday, was built with taxpayer money in \nthe form of a State loan given out back in the early 1980s. The loan \nwas never paid back, though some payments were made on the loan. The \npeople who got the loan still own the hotel and still manage it. \nPresumably if the Lincoln Library results in increased tourism revenue \nand more people coming to visit the city of Springfield, there will be \na lot of tourist dollars. Some projections estimate as much as $140 \nmillion in tourist revenue will be added by the construction of the \nlibrary in Springfield. Certainly some of that would probably accrue to \nthe benefit of those who have the Renaissance Springfield Hotel.\n  The price increases, the location of the library, we note these \nthings. We note the involvement of individuals whose names have come up \nin the past and were described again and again in many of the articles \nread into the Record. And we note the general problem that the State \nhas had with projects such as this in the past.\n  Given all these red flags, isn't it appropriate that we be extra \ncareful and that we do everything we can to ensure that the project be \nappropriately competitively bid? It is for that reason that I attached \nthe Federal competitive bid guidelines when the authorization bill came \ninto the Senate. These guidelines were adopted unanimously in the \nSenate Energy Committee and, ultimately, the whole Senate unanimously \nadopted these guidelines and sent the bill back to the House.\n  We are here today because we have to vote on the Interior conference \ncommittee report which has appropriations for the project tucked in, \nbut with the Senate requirements for competitive bidding in accordance \nwith Federal guidelines stripped out. It is the fact that those \ncompetitive bid guidelines are not contained within the authorization \nand appropriations for the library in this Interior conference \ncommittee report that I am here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, this debate, as I have said, goes to the very heart of \nthe appropriations process itself. We need to take great care with the \ntaxpayers' money. The money represents precious hours of hard work, \nsweat, and time away from their families. The American people are \nfundamentally generous and they will permit reasonable expenditures for \nthe good of their country and their communities. The people of \nSpringfield, IL, are as generous as any, and they are as fine a people \nas any.\n  I have heard more from the people of Springfield, IL, than from \nanywhere else in my State about the importance to them of having an \nhonest and ethical bidding process on this library that they hope will \nbe a credit to their community for ages to come. But while the people \nare generous and they are willing to permit us to make reasonable \nexpenditures in support of our States and communities, the taxpayers do \nexpect that they not be abused. We need to do our best to make sure \nthere are sufficient safeguards so that the people can know their hard \nwork is not being trampled on, that politically connected individuals \nare not deriving private profit at the expense of the taxpayers, all \nunder the guise of a public works project.\n  I know that in this Chamber our remarks go out to the entire country. \nI am well aware of it in this debate because our office is receiving \ncorrespondence from people all over the United States who find \ninteresting what has happened in Illinois. But I want to address these \nremarks now exclusively to the people of my State--the land of \nLincoln--Illinois.\n  In a very short time now, the Senate will soon take a vote on the \nInterior appropriations conference report. This is the vehicle that \ncontains the Lincoln Library provisions we have been talking about in \nthis filibuster.\n  When the Senate votes, we will lose because the Interior bill itself \nis a bill with considerable support for projects around the country--it \nis an $18 billion bill that literally has implications for every State \nin the Nation--my colleagues will vote for it. Even those who, along \nwith me, believe the Lincoln Library should have Federal competitive \nbidding rules attached to the money that will be appropriated today \nwill do so.\n  As I have noted, all Members of this body, earlier this week, voted \nin favor of Federal competitive bidding guidelines for this project \nwhen we had a vote just on that narrow issue. We cannot have a vote to \ntake out the language that is in the conference committee report that \ndoes not require the competitive bidding. These are the rules of the \nSenate. However, when the vote is called and we lose, I do not want the \npeople of Illinois to be discouraged by the difficulties we have \nencountered. If nothing else, from the materials we have introduced \ninto the Record, it is clear that the political culture of Illinois is \nentrenched and formidable--so entrenched and formidable that a simple \nprovision such as competitive bidding could become controversial.\n\n  Our effort in these last couple of days is just a baby step. Real \nchange can only come as the people of Illinois see more, know more, and \ngradually come to realize that they do indeed have the power to make it \ndifferent. Real change comes from the bottom, from the people up. All \nthose of us in this body can do is observe, think, exercise our very \nbest judgment, and then make the case.\n  Today and yesterday, we have made the case. In a little while, the \nopponents of our simple competitive bid requirement will prevail. But \nthe next time you hear of leases, or loans, or capital projects, or \nriverboat licenses going to political insiders, you will remember this \ndebate; and together we will rejoin the fight and redouble our efforts \nfor the next time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? I object.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I speak just on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Can we suggest the absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I don't want to go through that if I don't have to.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to \nthe occupant of the chair, Senator Voinovich from Ohio.\n  (Mr. FITZGERALD assumed the chair.)\n\n\n                        Elections in the Balkans\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as my colleagues are well aware, I have \na keen interest in what happens in the Balkans because I believe what \nhappens in Southeastern Europe impacts on our national security, our \neconomic well-being in Europe, the stability of Europe and yes, world \npeace.\n  For the better part of the 20th Century, Western Europe and the U.S. \nhave had an enormous stake in what has occurred in Southeastern Europe.\n  However, we have not done enough to pay attention to what is \nhappening there, dating back to the time when former Secretary of \nState, Jim Baker, said of Yugoslavia that ``we don't have a dog in this \nfight.''\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\n  Unfortunately, that line of thinking has prevailed, and we've allowed \nSlobodan Milosevic to wreak havoc. Over the last decade, he has spread \ndeath and destruction to the people of Serbia, Kosovo and Croatia and \nwe all know that U.S. troops now are in Kosovo and Bosnia because of \nhim.\n  Even a U.S. and NATO led air war last year was not sufficient to \nbring an end to the Milosevic regime.\n  Since the end of the war, I have been working hard on three essential \nitems that I believe will bring peace and stability to the region. \nFirst, I have been working with leaders here and abroad to help stop \nthe ethnic cleansing in Kosovo; second, to try and make sure that we \nkeep our promises to the Stability Pact of Southeast Europe. To that \nend, I recently met with Bodo Homback, the head of the Stability Pact \nto underscore the importance of the Stability Pact; and third, I have \nbeen working tirelessly to support democracy in Serbia, a cause I took \non when I was governor of the State of Ohio.\n  When I was in Bucharest at the Organization for the Security and \nCooperation of Europe, OSCE, in July of this year, I introduced a \nresolution on Southeastern Europe that called to the attention of the \nOSCE's Parliamentary Assembly the situation in Kosovo and Serbia, and \nmade clear the importance of democracy in Serbia.\n  I pointed out to my OSCE colleagues in that resolution that Milosevic \nwas a threat to the stability, peace and prosperity of the region. I \nargued that in order for the nations of that region to become fully \nintegrated into Europe--for the first time in modern history--\nMilosevic's removal from office was absolutely essential.\n  My resolution put the OSCE, as a body, on record as condemning the \nMilosevic regime and insisting on the restoration of human rights, the \nrule of law, free press and respect for ethnic minorities in Serbia. I \nwas pleased that my resolution passed, despite strong opposition by the \ndelegation from the Russian Federation.\n  Many people had become resigned to the fact that if the NATO bombing \nand the hardships that followed the end of the air war did not produce \nwidespread anti-Milosevic sentiment, the prospect for Milosevic's \nremoval from office by the Serbian people would not happen any time \nsoon. Even Milosevic himself felt confident enough in his rulership of \nYugoslavia to call for general elections nine months earlier than they \nwere supposed to occur.\n\n  On Sunday, September 24th, historic elections took place in \nYugoslavia in spite of the worst type of conditions that could possibly \nhamper free and fair elections, including military and police presence \nat polling places; ballots counted by Milosevic appointees; reports of \n``ballot stuffing;'' intimidation of voters during the election \nprocess; and the refusal to allow independent observers to monitor \nelection practices and results.\n  In spite of all that, the people won. They won because of the old \nSerbian slogan--Samo, Sloga, Srbina, Spasava--which translates into \n``only unity can save the Serbs'', or, ``in unity there is strength for \nthe Serbs.''\n  And I might say the opposition finally got its act together with \nprayers to St. Sava, and with enlightenment from the Holy Spirit.\n  It was the political force of the people that propelled law \nprofessor, and political unknown, Vojislav Kostunica, to victory.\n  This monumental victory over an indicted war criminal proves that the \nSerb people strongly desire positive change. They want to see their \ncountry move beyond the angry rhetoric and nationalistic fires fanned \nby Milosevic.\n  And let me make this point clear: Mr. Kostunica's victory and his \nsupport are not the result of Western influence.\n  And although Milosevic had previously acknowledged that Mr. Kostunica \nhad more votes, we learned yesterday afternoon that his pawns on the \nconstitutional court declared that the September 24th elections were \nunconstitutional.\n  This latest and most blatant attempt by Milosevic to thwart the will \nof the people is the final insult to the citizens of Yugoslavia.\n  The citizens of Yugoslavia--through a constitutional election--have \nspoken. They have elected a new President.\n  The Serb people, driven by a desire to live free from the \ndictatorship of Milosevic, have been pushed to take their election \nmandate by force. They are, at this very moment, engaged in a struggle \nto throw off the shackles of oppression.\n  In light of these developments, I am prayerful that the Serb people \nwill be able to enforce their will, and that they will remember their \nslogan--Samo, Sloga, Srbina, Spasava--and remain united at this very \nimportant time for freedom.\n  I also pray that the Serb military and police forces will avoid \nbloodshed, recognizing that their brothers and sisters only seek the \nfreedom that a tyrant has denied them.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President: this is not a revolution. The Serb \npeople are enforcing the mandate of their election because this man who \nhas been beaten refuses to relinquish power.\n  He ought to understand that he's either going to walk out of there or \ngo out on a stretcher or in a body bag.\n  Mr. President, we in the United States must render our support to the \nSerb people immediately, and convince our allies and the nations of the \nworld that Vojislav Kostunica is the new and legitimately elected \nleader of Serbia, and we need to convince Russia that they should \nimmediately tell Milosevic that the game is over; it's time to go.\n  Mr. President, we also need to assure the Serbian people--who have \nbeen long-standing friends of this nation and also our allies in World \nWar II--that we are still their friends and that it is Milosevic who \nhas been the problem, not the Serbian people.\n  The Serb people need to know that with their new leader, Vojislav \nKostunica, we will remove our sanctions against Serbia and help them \nre-invigorate their economy and re-establish their self-respect and the \nUnited States will welcome them into the light of freedom and a bright \nnew chapter in Serbian history.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again, we are witness to the belated \nif inevitable fall of a tyrannical regime that failed to convince the \npopulation under its control that its worst enemy lay outside that \nnation's borders. As I speak, the Serbian people are storming \nYugoslavia's Parliament building and seizing television stations. In \nthe town of Kolubara, coal miners and tens of thousands of supporters \nhave openly and peacefully defied the Milosevic regime's efforts at \nstemming the tide of history. A regime that stands accused of crimes \nagainst humanity is on its deathbed, and the United States must not \nhesitate to declare its unequivocal support for those brave enough to \ndefy that regime.\n  The people of Yugoslavia have spoken very clearly. They turned out to \nelect a new President, and Slobodan Milosevic's efforts to manipulate \nthe democratic process has not succeeded. The formidable internal \nsecurity apparatus that Milosevic and his supporters in the Socialist \nParty, as well as the Yugoslav United Left, the Communist organization \nled by his wife Mirjana Markovic, have established cannot save him.\n  The new defense doctrine President Milosevic approved just 2 months \nago listed as its highest priority preservation of the regime that \ntoday finds itself under the gravest threat to its survival. While the \nUnited States must exercise care in how its role in developments in \nSerbia are perceived, it must not fail to lend its moral support to \nthose fighting for democracy.\n  Since 1992, the Balkans have been the scene of the bloodiest fighting \nin Europe since World War II. The wars that have ravaged Bosnia-\nHerzegovina and Kosovo produced a list of war criminals that will take \nyears to try, in the event they are brought to justice. A tremendous \namount of the blame for that situation resides in one man--Slobodan \nMilosevic. He was instrumental in creating the environment in which \nthose atrocities occurred and presided over military campaigns that \ngave the world a new and onerous phrase: ethnic cleansing.\n  There are those who believe the United States did not have a role to \nplay in supporting democratization in Serbia. Those of us who supported \nS.720, the Serbia Democratization Act, however, have remained firm in \nour conviction that U.S. support for democracy in that troubled nation \nwas\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\nsomething to be proud of and could play a positive role in facilitating \npositive change in Yugoslavia. That S.720 has remained stuck in the \nHouse is unfortunate, but the message that it sent merely by its \nintroduction was powerful. We cannot selectively stand for freedom and \nshould not be ashamed that it provides the moral foundation of our \nforeign policy. Ongoing events in Serbia illustrate vividly the intense \ndesire for democracy in Serbia and the United States should not \nhesitate to state its strong support for the election of Vojislav \nKostunica and for the forces of change in Yugoslavia.\n  The Balkan powderkeg is facing its most promising period of change \nsince the end of the Cold War. We should not be idle witnesses to that \nchange. I urge the House to speak forcefully on this issue by passing \nthe Serbia Democratization Act at once. The symbolism of U.S. support \nfor democratic change will not play into the hands of a discredited \nregime in its death throes. On the contrary, it will tell the people of \nYugoslavia that we stand with them on the verge of a new era.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 4578, the Department of the Interior \n     appropriations bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first, I congratulate Mr. Fitzgerald, the \nSenator from Illinois, for his valiant effort to prevent a contract to \nbe let without any competition. I do not understand why contracts that \nentail expenditure of taxpayers' funds should not be let in a \ncompetitive fashion so that the taxpayers can receive the maximum value \nfor their investments in their Government. I congratulate Senator \nFitzgerald for his valiant effort.\n  This year's final agreement provides a much-needed infusion of \nfunding for conservation, wildlife management, and Native American \nprograms. However, once again, I express my objections to the amount of \nexcessive pork barrel spending and extraneous legislative riders \nincluded in this final agreement.\n  The agreement exceeds its overall budget by $2.5 billion, increasing \nspending by 25 percent, with funding levels that are close to $4 \nbillion higher than the House bill and $3 billion more than the Senate \nbill.\n  We are entering a remarkable phase of American political history. The \nspigot is on, and it is on in a fashion I have not seen in the years I \nhave spent in the Congress.\n  The new conference agreement has taken pork barrel spending to higher \nproportions by adding more than $120 million more in earmarks that \neither were not included in the Senate or House bill or added funding \nfor unrequested or unauthorized projects. In addition to higher amounts \nof pork barrel spending, appropriators conveniently designated billions \nmore in emergency spending, including nearly $30 million in ``emergency \nfunds'' for locale-specific earmarks.\n  As I said, I have a list that was printed in the Record. Several of \nour favorites: $1.25 million for weed programs at Montana State \nUniversity and Idaho--weed programs that are specific to two \nuniversities; $5.25 million for a new dormitory at the National \nConstitution Training Center; $20,000 for office renovations at the \nWhite Sulfur Springs National Fish Hatchery. Guess where. West \nVirginia. We have several fish hatcheries in my State of Arizona. I \nwonder if maybe we could get a little refurbishment for our offices, as \nwell as those in West Virginia.\n  There is $487,000 for a carriage barn in Longfellow National Historic \nSite in Massachusetts--a carriage barn.\n  Here is one of my favorites. I think we should all be impressed by \nthe pressing need for this: $176,000 for the Reindeer Herders \nAssociation. For the Reindeer Herders Association, $176,000 is \nearmarked.\n  That also happens to be out of the Bureau of Indian Affairs funding. \nNever mind that we have dilapidated housing, terrible schools, \nnutrition programs that need to be funded in the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, my friends, but we put in $176,000 for that vitally needed \nReindeer Herders Association. I am sure Santa Claus is very pleased \nthat these funds will be going to the Reindeer Herders Association.\n  You will find something very interesting, Mr. President, as I go \nthrough the list of earmarks and as people read the Record. You will \nsee the names Alaska, West Virginia, Washington State, and Hawaii \nappear with amazing frequency, which I am sure is pure coincidence.\n  So we have $1 million for a distance learning telemedicine, fiber-\noptic pilot program in Montana.\n  Here is an important one. Here is a vital item that had to be \nearmarked: $1.5 million to refurbish the Vulcan Statue in Alabama. I am \nnot familiar with the Vulcan Statue, but I am sure it needed to be \nrefurbished over any other statue in America that may need to be \nrefurbished.\n  Here is one that should interest taxpayers and entertain all of us: \n$400,000 for the Southside Sportsman Club in New York. Take heart, all \nSouthside sportsmen, help is on the way: $400,000 for your operations.\n  There is $5 million for the Southeast--guess where--Alaska Economic \nDisaster Fund, which was not included in either the Senate or House \nproposals, ordered to be used for Craig, AK, to assist with economic \ndevelopment. Times are tough in Craig, my friends. They need $5 million \nin Craig.\n  I urge those who are interested to find out what the population of \nCraig, AK, might be. I think that might turn out to be a fair amount of \nmoney per capita.\n  There is $500,000 for administrative duties at the Kensington Mine in \nsoutheast Alaska--ta-da, Mr. President--for administrative duties at \nthe Kensington Mine in southeast Alaska.\n  We have lots of mines in my State. I hope they will consider helping \nthem with their administrative duties in their mines, as well.\n  Mr. President, the list goes on and on and on.\n  So $2 million for the purchase of Cat Island in Mississippi; $5 \nmillion for a land transfer in Kake, AK; $4.6 million for the Wheeling \nNational Heritage Area in West Virginia, which has received earmarks in \nprevious Interior\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\nappropriations without any authorization. I should point out that new \nlegislative language was tacked on to this report to finally authorize \nthis project, although it certainly never went through the normal \nprocess of approval.\n  I hope the taxpayers will be able to see how we are spending their \ndollars. It is remarkable.\n  I believe in the debate one of the candidates was saying: You ain't \nseen nothing yet. Mr. President, you ain't seen nothing yet. Wait until \nwe get to the omnibus bill which very few of us will have ever seen or \nread when we vote yes or no on it. We will have a remarkable document, \none I think historians in the centuries ahead will view with interest \nand puzzlement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n              atlantic salmon conservation and restoration\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee for his invaluable help in \nsecuring funding for vital, time-sensitive, on-the-ground Atlantic \nsalmon conservation and restoration programs in Maine on an emergency \nbasis. Due to your efforts, $5.0 million in emergency appropriations \nwere included in the Interior Appropriations conference report for this \npurpose. It is critical that these funds be on the ground this year in \norder to demonstrate a federal financial commitment to salmon in my \nState, and that a listing under the Endangered Species Act is not \nnecessary to conserve and restore Maine's Atlantic salmon.\n  Mr. GORTON. My home state, too, has experienced the disruption that a \nfederal endangered species listing can cause. I therefore appreciate \nthe importance and urgency of the funds sought by the Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The emergency appropriation included in the Interior \nAppropriations conference report will make a substantial contribution \nto salmon conservation and restoration efforts in the State. The funds \nwill be made available to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (or \n``NFWF''), which has made a commitment to me to allocate the monies to \nworthwhile projects as soon as possible. The conference report provides \n$5.0 million to NFWF, of which $2.0 million will be made available to \nthe Atlantic Salmon Commission and $500,000 will be made available to \nthe National Academy of Sciences. The remaining $2.5 million will be \nadministered by NFWF to carry out a grant program that will fund on-\nthe-ground projects to further Atlantic salmon conservation or \nrestoration efforts in coordination with the State of Maine and the \nMaine Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan.\n  The conference report contains language indicating that funds \nadministered by NFWF will be subject to cost sharing. Is it your \nunderstanding, Mr. Chairman, that this language means the $2.5 million \nadministered by NFWF to carry out a grant program must be matched, in \nthe aggregate, by at least $2.5 million in non-federal funds?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Maine is correct. I expect that the $2.5 \nmillion grant program administered by NFWF will leverage at least $2.5 \nmillion overall in additional, nonfederal funds.\n  Ms. COLLINS. And is it also your understanding, Mr. Chairman, that \nthe $2.0 million made available to the Atlantic Salmon Commission and \nthe $500,000 made available to the National Academy of Sciences will \nnot be subject to any matching requirement?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is also correct.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to again thank the distinguished Chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee. In crafting this conference \nreport, he has accomplished a Herculean task with this usual grace and \nskill. And the $5.0 million he has helped secure will promote a \nvigorous and effective salmon conservation and restoration effort in my \nState.\n  Mr. GORTON. As I have said before, I greatly admire the Senator from \nMaine's tenacity and her unfailing devotion to the best interests of \nher State.\n\n\n                  lake tahoe land acquisition colloquy\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request your help \ninterpreting the language that was inserted into the conference report \npertaining to the use of funds appropriated for the acquisition of \nenvironmentally sensitive property at Lake Tahoe. That language states \nthat no funds may be used to acquire urban lots. To my knowledge, \n``urban lots'' is a term that is not defined in this bill or any \nrelated statute or regulation. As a result, I want to make sure that we \nclarify what we intend by the term urban lot.\n  As you know, the plan to protect Lake Tahoe is predicated in large \npart of the Lake Tahoe Preservation Act of 1981 (H.R. 7306), commonly \nknown as the Santini-Burton Act, and companion California and Nevada \nbond acts. Together, these State and Federal acts provide for the \npurchase and stewardship of environmentally sensitive lands in the Lake \nTahoe Basin. The legislative history of the Santini-Burton Act \nindicated that approximately $150 million worth of land in Lake Tahoe \nwould be purchased (approximately $100 million has been expended to \ndate). The Santini-Burton Act generally identified lands eligible for \npurchase, and was followed by the adoption of a comprehensive plan \nidentifying specific criteria for purchases. That plan was subject to \nan Environmental Impact Statement and accompanying public comment \nprocess, and this plan remains in effect to this day.\n  I am confident that, with the correct information in hand, Congress \nwill direct the Forest Service to go forward with the completion of the \nprogram. In the meantime, however, the effort to protect Lake Tahoe is \nlikely to sustain significant damage if the language in the conference \nreport is mistakenly interpreted to reverse long standing policy \ndecisions. That is why I am asking for your concurrence to direct the \nForest Service to interpret the language in a manner consistent with \nthe existing program.\n  Specifically, I want to make it clear that the term ``urban lot'' \ndoes not include environmentally sensitive lands. The current program \ndesignates a property's eligibility for acquisition according to its \nenvironmental sensitivity because that is the purpose of the \nacquisition program. Such designations reflect extensive analysis and \nthe support of the local community. This report language should not be \ninterpreted to change this methodology such that acquisition \neligibility is based on an unspecified and invariably random geographic \ndistinction. In all likelihood, any ill-conceived geographic standard \nwould exclude the most environmentally sensitive property that the \nongoing program is designed to protect.\n  I believe that the report language is consistent with the current \npractice of federal land acquisition in the Lake Tahoe basin. Do you \nshare my understanding that the definition of ``urban lots'' includes \nonly those properties that are presently qualified for urban \ndevelopment?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. REID. Then it makes sense for any prohibition on land acquisition \nreferred to in the report language to apply only if to properties that \nsatisfy all of the following criteria: (1) they are not adjacent to \ncurrent forest system lands, (2) they are within Tahoe Regional \nPlanning Agency's urban boundaries, (3) they are not adjacent to Lake \nTahoe, or to waters or streamzones tributary to Lake Tahoe, and (4) \nthey are presently eligible to take residential or commercial \ndevelopment. This clarification integrates the intent of the new \nconference report language to limit such acquisitions to essential \nsensitive lands while retaining the basic purpose of the Lake Tahoe \nland acquisition program.\n  Mr. GORTON. In response to my colleague, the senior Senator from \nNevada, let me say that your understanding of the issues affecting Lake \nTahoe is correct. Your concerns seem reasonable, as does your \ninterpretation of the language in question.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Chairman's understanding and concurrence \non this very important issue.\n\n\n          regarding sec. 156 and accompanying report language\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the Chairman knows, I included language \nin this bill that directs the Department of Interior to finalize the \nso-called 3809 regulations, which govern hardrock mining operations on \npublic lands, and to do so consistently with the findings and \nrecommendations of a study completed by the National Research Council \nor NRC. The language is identical to\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\nlanguage enacted in last year's omnibus bill. I want to emphasize my \nintent in offering this language, and request the Chairman's \nunderstanding and concurrence. Briefly, my intent is to ensure that the \nDepartment of Interior finalizes a rule that protects the environment \nand that takes into account the direction of Congress and the findings \nand recommendations of the NRC report.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am glad to assist my friend, the senior Senator from \nNevada. In clarifying Congress' intent in enacting these provisions. I \nagree with his statement that the Committee intends for Interior to \nstudy the entire NRC report carefully and to adopt a rule that is \nconsistent with the findings and recommendations of that report.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last year Congress adopted this requirement \nthat Interior finalize 3809 rule changes only if they are ``not \ninconsistent'' with the recommendations of the NRC report I already \ndescribed. Parsing this statutory language to the point of absurdity, \nthe Interior Solicitor quickly wrote and circulated a legal opinion \nconcluding that Congress intended by this action to require Interior's \nconsideration only of material in the report specifically labeled as \n``recommendations''--amounting only to a few lines of the report--and \nno other information in the report. And, he went on to conclude that \nthis law imposes no significant limitations on the agency's ability to \nfinalize its proposed 3809 rule. This year we have adopted the \nconsistency requirement again, just as it was written last year. I ask \nthe Chairman, did we enact the language again just to ratify the legal \nconclusion that Interior could finalize 3809 rules essentially without \nrestrictions?\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friend, and emphasize that we did not act \nagain this year just to ratify the actions of the Department of \nInterior. The Committee to reemphasize its original intent: That \nInterior study the NRC report carefully, and that any final 3809 \nregulations promulgated be consistent with that report.\n  Mr. REID. One last question that I have concerns a statement made by \nsome of our House colleagues during House consideration of the FY 2001 \nInterior appropriations bill in which they suggested an interpretation \nof the ongoing rulemaking including broad discretion to deny mining \npermits, by redefining the existing statutory definition of unnecessary \nor undue degradation. Does the Chairman of the subcommittee who helped \ndevelop this language agree that our House colleagues are suggesting an \ninterpretation that clearly goes beyond current law and that section \n156 specifically states that nothing in this provision shall be \nconstrued to expand existing authority.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. Section 156 states, ``nothing in \nthis section shall be construed to expand the existing statutory \nauthority of the Secretary.'' The interpretation suggested by our House \ncolleagues would require additional statutory authority which Interior \ndoes not have and is specifically denied by this bill.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chairman for his help in clarifying the \nCommittee's intent.\n\n\n              u.s. forest service national fire retardants\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee on an issue that affects the Forest Service \nand forest fire fighting in the West.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be glad to engage in such a discussion with my \nfriend, the distinguished Chairman of Forest and Public Lands \nSubcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the U.S. Forest Service has announced its \nintention to move to gum thickened/sodium ferrocyanide aerially applied \nfire retardants in the 2004 bid process. The Service is to be commended \nfor this initiative that seeks a more effective and environmentally \nfriendly means to address the wildfires with which we have become so \npainfully accustomed in the West. Indeed, the Forest Service's own \nresearch shows that gum thickened retardants are 25-40 percent more \neffective than un-thickened retardants. The criteria called for in \n2004, though, can be met today. Is it the Committee's view that the \nU.S. Forest Service should be striving for a more environmentally \nfriendly product and should use such a product as soon as possible?\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree with that view. It should be the U.S. Forest \nService's priority to use the most effective, environmentally \nprotective aerially applied fire retardants.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the after-effects of wildfires \nare devastating to the landscape. Mother Nature has a way of bringing \nlife back to the land when all appears lost. However, even Mother \nNature cannot erase for years the stains on the lands caused by some \naerially applied fire retardants. This is especially of concern where \nhistorical and archeological resources, national parks, wilderness \nareas and urban/wilderness areas are concerned. Would you agree that \nU.S. Forest Service should preserve the option for local foresters to \nuse less staining fugitive retardants where, in their judgment, it is \nwarranted?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would agree that the U.S. Forest Service should \npreserve the option to use such fire retardants in order to minimize \nthe long-term visual impacts of wildfires.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, the U.S. Forest Service has historically \nsupported competition in the supply of fire retardants through the \ninclusion of a viability clause in its bids. For the first time, the \nupcoming 2001 bid process may be conducted by sealed bid. It is unclear \nwhether viability will be a consideration. This is a critical issue in \na fire season like the one we just experienced. Would you agree that \nthe U.S. Forest Service should support competition in the supply of \naerially applied fire retardants?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would agree that maintaining dual suppliers of high \nperformance, environmentally acceptable fire retardants is critical to \nthe mission of the Service.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chairman for this clarification.\n\n\n          great falls historic district, paterson, new jersey\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, Senator \nGorton, about one aspect of the conference report.\n  Mr. Chairman, the conference report to the Interior Appropriations \nbill for Fiscal Year 2001 does not include funding for construction \nprojects in the Great Falls Historic District, located in the City of \nPaterson, New Jersey.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Chairman, by way of background, the Great Falls \nHistoric District was established in Section 510 of Public Law 104-33, \nthe Omnibus Parks bill of 1996. This legislation, which I coauthored, \nis designed to preserve the historic character of the City of Paterson, \nNew Jersey. Like Lowell, Massachusetts, Paterson holds a prominent \nplace in our nation's industrial past. Few people realize that Paterson \nwas the first planned industrialized city. Alexander Hamilton himself \nchose the area around the Great Falls for his laboratory, and he \nestablished the Society for Useful Manufacturers right in Paterson. The \nwork of its citizens and the wealth of its natural resources soon \ncaused Paterson to thrive, and it became a mecca for countless numbers \nof immigrants, including my own family. The skills and spirit of these \nimmigrants made Paterson one of our nation's leading centers for \ntextile manufacturing, earning the nickname ``Silk City.''\n  Mr. Chairman, the 1996 legislation authorizes the Secretary of the \nInterior to provide grants through the Historic Preservation Fund for \nup to one-half of the costs of preparing a plan for the development of \nhistoric, architectural, natural, cultural, and interpretive resources \nwithin the Great Falls District. The Secretary may also provide \nmatching funds for implementation of projects identified in the plan. \nThe total federal authorization for the Great Falls Historic District \nis $3.3 million.\n  Mr. Chairman, since the authorizing legislation establishing the \nGreat Falls Historic District specifically enables the City to receive \nup to $250,000 in matching federal funds for preparation of a historic \npreservation plan, the Secretary could provide these funds through the \nfunds provided in the conference report for the Historic Preservation \nFund.\n\n[[Page S9907]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. This bill includes appropriations \nfrom the Historic Preservation Fund that could be used for eligible \nprojects such as that for the Great Falls in Paterson.\n  Mr. BYRD. I concur with the Chairman that the Great Falls project is \neligible to receive Historic Preservation Funds, for preparation of its \nplan.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Chairman, I understand that the Great Falls \nHistoric District would be eligible to receive up to $250,000 of these \nfunds for preparation of a historic preservation plan, and that, once \nthese plans are completed, an additional $50,000 in matching funds is \navailable from the Historic Preservation Fund for technical assistance \nand $3 million is available for restoration, preservation, and \ninterpretive activities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to include a letter from the Mayor of the \nCity of Paterson to the regional director of the National Park Service, \nexpressing the City's interest in moving forward with development of \nthe Great Falls development plan. I hope that this letter will confirm \nto the Service and to the Chairman and Ranking Member, that the City is \nfully prepared to provide the necessary match to develop the plan. I am \nconfident that the City will work closely with the Service on \ndevelopment of a plan, and that, once it is completed, the City may \napply for the remaining authorized funds for completion of specific \nprojects.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senator's interest in this matter, and I \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 City of Paterson,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                    Paterson, NJ, October 4, 2000.\n     Marie Rust,\n     Northeast Regional Director, National Park Service, 200 \n         Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA.\n\n     Re: Public Law 104-333.\n\n       Dear Ms. Rust: This is to reaffirm our sincere interest in, \n     and need of, the funding of Public Law 104-333. Ever since \n     the authorization of the 3.3 million dollars for the Great \n     Falls Redevelopment Act we have been anxiously awaiting the \n     appropriation. We are committed to provide the necessary \n     local match.\n       The preparation of the Development Plan required by the Act \n     is an essential first step in documenting the feasibility of \n     a National Park. After the Plan, our two primary activities \n     in the district remain to be the redevelopment of the former \n     ATP Site including the Gun Mill and the rehabilitation of the \n     raceway. Both projects are essential to the achievement of \n     the economic development objectives of the Urban History \n     Initiative. The initial Gun Mill stabilization has been \n     successfully completed. We are awaiting the execution of the \n     Programmatic Agreement so that we may continue with the \n     engineering and other site preparation and stabilization work \n     for the former ATP Site. The overall raceway and \n     prioritization has been completed. Final plans are ready for \n     the Upper Raceway section.\n       We continue to pursue other sources of funding including \n     TEA-21 Enhancement, the New Jersey Historic Trust, New Jersey \n     Green Acres, and others. If these are not successful I will \n     ask the City Council to bond any remaining local share. This \n     is to assure you that we will secure the local match for \n     whatever amount Congress appropriates.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                           Martin G. Barnes,      \n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been a long time supporter of \nCARA--the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. The concept behind CARA \nwas a visionary one--to take revenues generated from the extraction of \noffshore oil and gas resources and reinvest them permanently and \nautomatically in our nation's invaluable wildlife, coastal, and public \nland resources.\n  The CARA proposal that was developed in a cooperative, bipartisan way \nby the Senate Energy Committee offered an opportunity for this Congress \nto make an historic contribution to conservation and to truly leave \nbehind a legacy that we could be proud of and from which our children \nwould benefit.\n  Instead, we are faced with a situation in which this overwhelmingly \npopular bill will never be considered on the Senate floor.\n  The House passed its version of CARA back in May by an overwhelming \nvote of 315 to 102; it was a vote that brought in supporters from \nacross the political spectrum and around the country. More recently, a \nletter signed by 63 Senators was sent to the Senate leadership \nrequesting that CARA be brought to the floor.\n  Yet the Republican leadership has refused to let this bill move \nforward.\n  I ask my colleagues, what does it take to get a vote around here? How \ncan we say that we are doing the people's business, if a bill that is \nas broadly supported as CARA cannot even be voted upon?\n  We have now been presented with a package in the Interior \nappropriations bill that purports to fulfill the goals of CARA. I am \ntremendously disappointed to say that this package does very little to \naccomplish the goals of CARA.\n  CARA would have provided nearly $45 billion to important conservation \nprograms over the next 15 years. The Interior proposal provides roughly \n$6 billion and only makes those funds available for the next 6 years.\n  But far more disappointing than the discrepancy in funding levels is \nthe fact that the Interior proposal does little to guarantee that these \nfunds will actually be made available each year for specific \nconservation purposes.\n  Instead, the Interior proposal will force important and beneficial \nprograms like Urban Parks and Recreation to battle against other \nimportant programs like the Historic Preservation program for funding \neach year.\n  What made CARA remarkable was the fact that it would have provided \nthe Urban Parks program, or state fish and wildlife agencies, or \nendangered species recovery efforts, with a predictable and reliable \namount of funding.\n  This feature would have ensured that important conservation efforts \nwould NOT be subject to the uncertainties of the annual appropriations \ncycle, but instead could be certain that funding would be available \nover the long term. And as a result, these conservation programs could \nhave finally planned and implemented ambitious, long-term conservation \nefforts. The Interior appropriations proposal fails to provide this \nsort of certainty.\n  I will vote for the Interior appropriations bill. The bill funds many \nimportant programs that I care about and in making a nod to CARA it \nwill provide some increased funding for things like the state's portion \nof the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I am also pleased that the most egregious anti-environmental riders \nthat appeared in earlier versions of this bill have been removed.\n  However, I hope nobody will interpret my vote for this bill as a sign \nof support for what I view as a hijacking of CARA. I remain deeply \ndisturbed that a bill that had the potential to do as much good as CARA \nwill never see the light of day.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is with great regret \nthat I rise today to oppose the Conference Report to the Interior \nAppropriations bill.\n  I want to begin by praising my colleagues on the Committee on \nAppropriations who have worked so hard on this bill and conference \nreport. I know they have faced many difficult issues, competing demands \nfor limited resources, and the pressure of time as this Congress winds \ndown. And there are many good provisions in this bill, including \nseveral that will benefit my home State of New Hampshire. The bill \nincludes two projects that have been particularly important to me and \nfor which I requested funding--the Lamprey River & St. Gaudens. I \nappreciate the efforts of the Appropriations Committee to provide that \nfunding.\n  Unfortunately, notwithstanding these and other good provisions, the \nbill fails to deliver what we as elected officials have promised the \nAmerican people. I want to take this opportunity to explain, especially \nto my fellow Granite Staters, why I am voting against the Interior \nAppropriations Conference Report.\n  First, I am deeply disappointed that this bill does not include full \nfunding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund or for the many \nimportant programs included in the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. \nIn failing to provide this funding, I believe that we have truly \nsquandered an opportunity that may never exist again. Even more \nimportantly, I believe we failed to live up to the promise we made \nyears ago to dedicate a percentage of the revenues from oil and gas \nproduction on the Outer Continental Shelf to the conservation and \nenhancement of fish, wildlife, lands and waters.\n  Congress came close to keeping that promise when the House passed by \nan\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\noverwhelming margin of three to one a landmark conservation bill--the \nso-called Conservation and Reinvestment Act (CARA). The Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee passed a companion bill in July. The \nCARA bill reflects our collective commitment to investing in the \nenvironment for ourselves and for future generations.\n  I am proud that I was able to play a part in bringing attention to \nthe bill in the Senate. On May 24, 2000, I held a hearing on the Senate \nbill in the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Although that \nCommittee, which I chair, did not have primary jurisdiction over the \nbill, I felt it was important to hold the hearing to help build support \nfor the legislation and to highlight some of the very important \nprograms that would be enhanced by the passage of the bill. These \nprograms included funding for the Endangered Species Act and Pittman-\nRobertson Act, both of which are in the jurisdiction of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works. I said it then, and I want to reaffirm \nit today. Now is the time for the Federal government to step up to the \nplate and assist in the efforts to protect our natural resources--not \nby grabbing up more Federal land, but by working in partnership with \nStates and private landowners and providing much-needed funding for \ncritically underfunded programs. The CARA bill would have done that.\n  Instead, the Interior Appropriations Conference Report includes a \nmere shadow of the real CARA.\n  Instead of providing full permanent funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, the Interior Conference Report appropriates only \n$600 million for one year and only $90 million of that is allocated for \nstateside funding. The CARA bill I cosponsored would have provided the \nStates with a guaranteed $450 million a year to conduct numerous \nworthwhile conservation projects, including creating new parks and \nbuilding soccer fields. The limited appropriation provided by the \nConference Report, by contrast, with no guarantees for future years, \nisn't CARA; it's business as usual.\n\n  The bottom line is that Americans like to spend their time outdoors. \nOver half of all Americans will tell you that their preferred vacation \nspots are national parks, forests, wilderness areas, beaches, \nshorelines and mountains. And almost all Americans--94 percent believe \nwe should be spending more money on land and water conservation.\n  I agree with those Americans who believe that it's time to invest \nsome of the budget surplus in our environment. For years now, we have \nbeen telling the tax payers that there isn't any money available for \nconservation programs and that it's up to landowners to bear the \nburdens of saving our land and natural resources. Well, in my opinion, \nthose days are over. It's past time for the federal government to \ncontribute its fair share, and the Interior Conference Report falls far \nshort in that respect.\n  Second, I am extremely troubled by the fact that the Conference \nReport provides no protections for private property rights. CARA did. \nThe real CARA bill provided an unprecedented level of protection for \nthe private land owner. For example, the Senate CARA bill that I \ncosponsored expressly prohibited the federal government from using any \nCARA funds to implement regulations on private property. In addition, \nall Federal acquisitions of land through the Land and Water \nConservation Fund would have been subject to significantly more \nrestrictions than under current law. Not one of those private property \nrights protections is included in the Interior Appropriations \nConference Report.\n  Third, I cannot support the language in the Conference Report that \nestablishes a vague new Federal ``wildlife conservation program'' that \nimposes new, but undefined, obligations on the States and gives broad \ndiscretion to the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to define those \nobligations. The Interior Appropriations Conference Report directs the \nFish and Wildlife Service to create a new $300 million state grant \nprogram subject only to the approval of the Committee on \nAppropriations. That is inappropriate.\n  The Committee on Environment and Public Works is responsible for \noverseeing wildlife programs; it is our prerogative and responsibility \nto review, discuss, and ultimately authorize any wildlife program. Yet, \nthis new program was inserted at the last minute, behind closed doors, \nwithout any public debate or consultation with the Committee of \njurisdiction. For that reason, I must oppose its inclusion in this \nConference Report. The concept may be a good one, but this is not the \nright process or the appropriate vehicle.\n  Finally, I must oppose the Conference Report because of the adverse \nimpact it will have on thousands of citizens of New Hampshire who \ndepend upon and enjoy the White Mountain National Forest.\n  When the Senate passed its Interior Appropriations bill in July, it \nincluded an important provision excluding the White Mountain National \nForest from this Administration's broad policy of prohibiting the \nconstruction of all new roads in previously undisturbed areas of \nnational forests, the so-called roadless policy. We excluded the White \nMountain National Forest from this ``one-size-fits-all'' roadless \npolicy, not because we want thousands of miles of new roads in the \nWhite Mountains, but because these decisions should be made at the \nlocal level through the forest planning process, by the people who live \nnear, enjoy, and use the National Forest.\n\n  I have deep concerns about the Administration's roadless policy \nbecause I believe it is intended to limit public access and legitimate \npublic use of our national forests. But even more importantly, in the \ncontext of the White Mountain National Forest, it would specifically \noverride an existing forest management plan that maintains a balance \nbetween economic activity, recreation and environmental protection--a \nforest management plan that was developed through a collaborative \nprocess involving state and local government officials, local citizens, \nand federal officials. I firmly believe that States and local citizens \nshould play a significant role in making the management decisions \nrelating to the forest lands in their communities, including the \ndecisions about roads.\n  It was for that reason that I strongly supported the language that \nwas included in the Senate bill that allowed the citizens of New \nHampshire to make those decisions through the forest planning process \nfor the White Mountain National Forest, rather than simply mandating a \nblanket roadless policy from Washington, D.C. That important provision, \nhowever, has now been dropped from the Conference Report. I believe \nthat Washington D.C.'s roadless policy will hurt New Hampshire. It will \nhave significant economic, social, and ecological impacts. And it will \nundermine the cooperative dialogue that took place during the revision \nof the forest plan. Therefore, I cannot support a Conference Report \nthat does not include language protecting the White Mountain National \nForest from unnecessary and inappropriate interference from \nWashington's bureaucrats.\n  The Interior Appropriations bill passed by the Senate last July also \nincluded a specific exemption for North Country residents from the user \nfees that the National Forest Service charges for access to the White \nMountain National Forest. That exemption has now been deleted.\n  I have long been opposed to user fees in the White Mountain National \nForest because I believe it is fundamentally unfair to local residents. \nIn areas, like the North Country of New Hampshire, where the Federal \nGovernment owns much of the land, communities lose a significant \nportion of their property tax base which they need to fund schools and \nother necessary social programs and infrastructure. Residents in these \ncommunities then have to make up the shortfall. The user fee, on top of \nthe loss in local tax revenue, imposes an unfair burden for local \ncitizens. It is wrong for the Federal government to charge local \nresidents in the North Country a fee for enjoying the White Mountain \nNational Forest when they are already subsidizing the Forest.\n  As I stated at the beginning, there are many good provisions in this \nInterior Conference Report. I applaud the work that my colleagues have \ndone and appreciate the support they have given to important New \nHampshire projects. Therefore, it is with great reluctance that I \noppose the Conference Report.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak \nabout two provisions of great concern to my\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\nstate of Minnesota. While this conference report clearly missed the \nopportunity to make a historic, long term, commitment to our \nenvironmental heritage, I rise in support of this legislation because \nit does represent an important first step in many conservation \naccounts, and includes vital funding to restore Minnesota's National \nForests.\n  First of all, I want to make clear that I am disappointed that the \nfull Conservation and Reinvestment Act, CARA, was not included in this \nInterior Appropriations bill. CARA, as reported out of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, is landmark legislation that \nwould commit $3 billion annually for 15 years to conservation and \nnatural resource protection. CARA would provide $37.4 million of stable \nfunding annually to the conservation and protection of Minnesota's \nnatural resources.\n  However the compromise in this bill does not reflect the spirit or \nintent of the full CARA bill. First of all this Conference report does \nnot guarantee multiple year funding for the states, which was the \nentire premise of CARA. When it comes to protecting our coastlines (on \nthe North Shore in Minnesota) and open spaces (in Northern Minnesota), \nexpanding our urban parks (in the metro Twin Cities area), or investing \nin wildlife conservation, the annual appropriation approach has proven \nnot to work in the past and is unlikely to work in the future. In \naddition, the report does not include dedicated funding for wildlife \nconservation programs, which puts Minnesota's wildlife conservation \nneeds in competition with other state conservation programs, and makes \nit possible that Minnesota would receive no funds for wildlife \npreservation from this legislation. While, overall I am encouraged that \nthis legislation more than doubles conservation funding from the $742 \nmillion in the current fiscal year to $1.6 billion in FY 2000, we \nshould not loose sight of the fact that this conference report is \nclearly no substitute for a full funded CARA bill.\n  On a related matter, I am pleased the conference committee has \nrestored the balance of the Forest Service's request for Minnesota's \nNational Forests. During consideration of the Interior Appropriations \nbill, Senators Gorton and Byrd agreed to my amendment to include $7.2 \nmillion in additional emergency funds for Minnesota's National Forests. \nAnd today the Senate will take an important step that will restore the \nbalance of emergency funds requested earlier this year by the Superior, \nChippewa and Chequamegon National Forests' for blowdown recovery \nefforts.\n  Furthermore, this legislation includes an important regular, FY 2001 \nappropriation for the Superior National Forest, that my colleague from \nMinnesota and I were able to work on together. These monies would be \navailable to the Forest Service next year and are vital to continued \nrecovery efforts in northern Minnesota.\n  These national forests bore the brunt of a massive once-in-a-thousand \nyear wind and rain storm that devastated parts of northern Minnesota on \nJuly 4, 1999. The storm damaged over 300,000 acres in seven counties, \nincluding as much as 70 percent of the trees in our national forests, \nand washed out numerous roads. The damage caused by this storm has \nseverely hindered the U.S. Forest Service's ability to responsibly \nmanage the Chippewa and Superior National Forests.\n  The most troubling aspect of this storm for the people of northern \nMinnesota is the continued extreme risk of a catastrophic fire \nresulting from the tremendous amount of downed and dead timber. Funding \nprovided to the Forest Service through this legislation will be used \nfor immediate and future recovery efforts, and to reduce the threat of \na major wildland fire.\n  The storm has changed affected portions of the forests for years to \ncome and has created new risks and experiences for visitors and \nresidents. Since July 4th, the Superior and Chippewa National Forests \nofficials have been working with state, county, and local officials on \nstorm recovery activities and planning to meet future needs.\n  Immediately after the storm the Forest Service, in conjunction with \nState, County and local governments began a search and rescue operation \nthat lasted for 15 days from July 4 to July 19, 1999. Fortunately not a \nsingle life was lost in the storm, however there were 20 medical \nevacuations from the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, BWCAW. The \nmost severe case was a broken neck. In addition, the forest Service \nconducted a search of 2,200 camp sights in the BWCAW to ensure no one \nwas trapped. And finally USFS crews cleared approx. 200 miles of roads, \nand reconstructed 6 miles of emergency roads.\n  Once the emergency search and rescue was completed, the U.S. Forest \nService turned their attention to reducing hazards that could \nnegatively affect visitors, residents and local businesses that depend \non the BWCAW and the National Forests. The Forest Service brought in \n191 people including an administrative team and several crews from \nacross the country to return facilities to a safe condition so they \ncould be reopened and used during the rest of the year.\n  And now the Superior National Forest is proposing to reduce the risk \nof fire escaping the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, BWCAW, by \nusing prescribed burning within the wilderness. The 1.1 million-acre \nBWCAW, located in northeastern Minnesota adjacent to the Canadian \nborder, is one of the most heavily used wildernesses in the United \nStates.\n  The proposal is to reduce the increased risk of wildfire associated \nwith the July 4, 1999, storm. The proposed action is to treat \napproximately 47,000 to 81,000 acres of the wilderness with prescribed \nfire over a five to six year time period.\n  The goal of this project is to improve public safety by reducing the \npotential for high intensity wildland fires to spread from the BWCAW \ninto areas of intermingled ownership, which include homes, cabins, \nresorts and other improvements, or across the international border into \nCanada. This will be accomplished in a manner which is sensitive to \necological and wilderness values, and protects fire personnel and BWCAW \nvisitor safety during implementation.\n  While the Forest Service has been engaged in this work for many \nmonths, it is clear that much is yet to be done, and that it is going \nto take many years to dig out from under the storm and to restore the \nforest to a more normal and healthy state. However this cannot happen \nwithout adequate funding. This is a victory for all of Minnesota, and I \nam grateful to my colleagues for their support. I am very pleased that \nthe Senate approved the remainder of these badly needed funds today, \nespecially for the people of northern Minnesota, who cannot wait.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am delighted that the conference \nreport for Interior appropriations before this body today makes a \nsignificant investment in Wisconsin's only unit of the National Park \nSystem, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The Lakeshore recently \ncelebrated its 30th anniversary on September 26, 2000, and I rise today \nto express my gratitude to the Senior Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd) and the Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton) for working with me \nto ensure that some of the highest priority needs at the Lakeshore are \nmet.\n  I have been raising the need for these funds since 1998. On April 22 \nof that year, I introduced legislation, named for former Senator \nGaylord Nelson who was the sponsor of the federal legislation that \ncreated the Lakeshore, to try to make sure that the Park Service has \nthe funds included in this bill today. This bill helps to fund a \nwilderness suitability study of the Lakeshore as required by the \nWilderness Act. Most of the Lakeshore is managed as wilderness, yet the \nrequired study has not yet been completed so that Congress can evaluate \nwhether there is a need for a formal legal designation. This bill \nretains amendment language that I offered during the Senate \nconsideration of Interior appropriations and provides $200,000 for that \npurpose.\n  The bill also provides funds to the Park Service to protect the \nhistory Raspberry and Outer Island lighthouses which are threatened by \nerosion. The 21 islands of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore have \nsix lighthouses, the greatest number of lighthouses on any property in \nfederal ownership anywhere in the country. They are all at least 100 \nyears old, and many of them are still used as aids to navigation and \nare in need of Federal help.\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\n  By providing funds in this bill to ensure the success of the \nLakeshore we contribute to another larger success--our efforts to clean \nand protect our environment and provide places for people to rest and \nrefresh themselves. I have been very pleased in the willingness of the \nbill's managers to support my efforts to draw attention to this park. \nThey have other, bigger parks that also have funding needs. But the \nmanagers understood my appeal on behalf of the people of Wisconsin with \nthese funds. They know, as I do, that when the American people sit \namong the hemlocks on Outer Island, walk along the shore, travel to \nDevils Island, observe the waters of Lake Superior, they know \nprotection of the Apostles is worth a federal investment.\n  The investments in the Apostles are authorized investments, part of \nthe requirements that we gave the Park Service when we created the \nLakeshore. As delighted as I am that these funds have been included by \nthe managers, I remain concerned about the fact that this bill provides \nfunds and policy direction for unauthorized projects, authorizes new \nprojects and continues to contain a number of policy riders that affect \nenvironmental protection. Because these riders remain, I will vote \nagainst the bill.\n  I am concerned that this body is becoming habituated to the practice \nof environmental legislation by rider. This leaves Members of this \nbody, like myself, who are very concerned about legislation which has \nthe potential to adversely effect the implementation of environmental \nlaw, or change federal natural resource policy, with limited options. \nWe must, by either striking the riders, or trying to modify their \nefforts, do the work of the authorizing committees on the floor of this \nbody. With limited floor time on spending bills, and with the pressure \nto pass appropriations bills or risk shutting down or disrupting \nimportant Government programs, we do not do the best by the environment \nthat we can and must do in our legislative efforts.\n  I believe that the Senate should not include provisions in spending \nbills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially \nenvironmentally beneficial regulations from being promulgated by the \nfederal agencies that enforce federal environmental law.\n  For more than two decades, we have been a remarkable bipartisan \nconsensus on protecting the environment through effective environmental \nlegislation and regulation. I believe we have a responsibility to the \nAmerican people to protect the quality of our public lands and \nresources. That responsibility requires that the Senate express its \nstrong distaste for legislative efforts to include proposals in \nspending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially \nbeneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated or enforced \nby the federal agencies that carry out Federal law.\n  Every year I hold a town hall meeting in each one of Wisconsin's 72 \ncounties. When I hold these meetings, the people of Wisconsin continue \nto express their grave concern that, when riders are placed in spending \nbills, major decisions regarding environmental protection are being \nmade without the benefit of an up or down vote.\n  When this bill passed the Senate initially on July 18, 2000, I was \none of two Senators to vote against it because of legislative riders. I \nknow that the bill managers worked long and hard to keep a number of \nthe most controversial riders, many of which I was concerned about, off \nof this bill and I commend them for that. However, I am also concerned \nthat there is a category of riders to which we have become habituated: \nriders on Alaska red cedar, riders on mining regulations, riders on \ngrazing permits. There are also new authorizing provisions in this \nbill, such as developing forensic laboratory service fees for Fish and \nWildlife investigations into wildlife mortality, and a new program to \ndevelop a reduced fee program for developing a reduced fee program to \naccommodate nonlocal travel through the National Park System. Why \naren't these matters being discussed in the authorizing committees? \nThese issues may have merit, but I think they should be handled by the \ncommittees of jurisdiction.\n  We cannot continue to put the Appropriations Committee in the \nposition of having to decide which of these riders are more or less \nimportant. These measures need to be referred to the authorizing \ncommittees, and we need to restore the trust of the American people \nthat we are proceeding with the people's business in a fashion which \nallows for open debate and actual deliberation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in strong \nsupport of the conference report accompanying H.R. 4578, the Interior \nand related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001.\n  As a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and the joint \nHouse-Senate conference committee, I appreciate the difficult task \nbefore the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking member to \nbalance the diverse priorities funded in this bill--from our public \nlands, to major Indian programs and agencies, energy conservation and \nresearch, and the Smithsonian and federal arts agencies. They have done \na masterful job meeting important program needs in this final bill.\n  The pending conference report provides an unprecedented $18.9 billion \nin new budget authority and $11.9 billion in new outlays to fund the \nDepartment of Interior and related agencies. When outlays from prior-\nyear budget authority and other completed actions are taken into \naccount the Senate bill totals $18.9 billion in BA and $17.4 billion in \noutlays for fiscal year 2001. The Senate bill is exactly at the revised \nsection 302(b) allocation for both BA and in outlays filed by the \nAppropriations Committee earlier today.\n  I would particularly like to thank Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd \nfor their commitment to Indian programs in this year's Interior and \nrelated agencies appropriation bill. They have included increases of \n$160 million for Bureau of Indian Affairs education construction, $214 \nmillion for the Indian Health Service, and nearly $102 million for the \noperation of Indian programs.\n  I commend the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for bringing \nthis important measure to the floor with significant resources totaling \n$1.6 billion to address the aftermath of the devastating summer and \nfall forest fires, including my initiative to undertake hazardous fuels \nreduction activities within the urban/wildland interface to protect our \nlocal communities--the so-called Happy Forests initiative.\n  This bill also includes an important, bipartisan compromise to \nestablish a new Land Conservation, Preservation and Infrastructure \nProgram that will dedicate $12 billion over the next six years to \nconservation programs. This is an unprecedented commitment to \nconservation efforts by the Federal Government. I am pleased to support \nthis initiative in its final form.\n  I appreciate the consideration given by my colleagues to several \npriority items for my constituents in New Mexico, which are included in \nthe final bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the final version of the fiscal year \n2001 Interior and related agencies Appropriations bill, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the Budget Committee scoring of the bill be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    H.R. 4578, INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 2001, SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                            CONFERENCE REPORT\n               [Fiscal year 2001, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget authority.....................     18,883         59     18,942\n  Outlays..............................     17,284         70     17,354\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................     18,883         59     18,942\n  Outlays..............................     17,284         70     17,354\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority.....................     14,769         59     14,828\n  Outlays..............................     14,833         83     14,916\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority.....................     16,413         59     16,472\n  Outlays..............................     15,967         70     16,037\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................     14,723         59     14,782\n  Outlays..............................     15,164         70     15,234\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................     15,875         59     15,934\n  Outlays..............................     15,591         70     15,661\n     CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority.....................  .........  .........  .........\n  Outlays..............................  .........  .........  .........\n2000 level:\n  Budget authority.....................      4,114  .........      4,114\n  Outlays..............................      2,451        -13      2,438\nPresident's request \\1\\\n  Budget authority.....................      2,470  .........      2,470\n  Outlays..............................      1,317  .........      1,317\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................      4,160  .........      4,160\n  Outlays..............................      2,120  .........      2,120\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority.....................      3,008  .........      3,008\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\n \n  Outlays..............................      1,693  .........      1,693\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The comparison between the conference report and the President's\n  request is skewed because the conference report includes $1.5 billion\n  in emergency firefighting funds that the President indicated he would\n  request, but for which OMB never submitted a formal request to the\n  Congress, so the amount is not reflected in the President's request.\n \n Note.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

They are charged with a great \nresponsibility. While we have disagreed over this particular issue, we \nhave worked together as we have tried and continue to try to reach a \nbipartisan compromise over this great battle for a legacy for our \nenvironment.\n  In particular, I thank Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska, our chairman, \nand Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia, our ranking member, who \nhave been very attentive to the calling and the requests of the CARA \nsupporters in this regard. While we have disagreed on this issue, it \nhas not been personal. My remarks today are intended strictly to be \nconstructive and hopefully to help us chart a course to navigate in the \nfuture on this important issue.\n  I will read into and submit for the Record the excellent comments \nfrom individuals and Governors and mayors reflected in newspapers \naround our country, literally from the west coast to the east coast, \nfrom the south to the north, from interior communities to coastal \ncommunities, literally thousands and thousands of positive editorials \nand articles written about what we are attempting to do. From the State \nof Illinois, we have had some of our best editorials on this subject, \nof which the Presiding Officer has been a supporter.\n\n  From the Seattle Post, May 18, a few months ago this year, talking \nabout CARA:\n\n       It is a bold approach to environmental conservation and \n     restoration. If ever there were a win-win for all the \n     squabbling factions permanently encamped in the corridors of \n     Capitol Hill to argue about the environment, this bill has to \n     be it.\n\n  From the Providence Journal, RI, September 19:\n\n       Even with the unusual level of bipartisan support that this \n     measure has, it could easily get lost in the last days of an \n     election-year session. Citizens should press Congress to get \n     it on to the desk of President, who would sign it.\n\n  While time is short, where there is a will there is a way, and the \npeople of Rhode Island surely believe that.\n  From the Los Angeles Times, September 18:\n\n       This measure should be plucked from the pack and made law.\n\n  Chicago Tribune, from the home State of the Presiding Officer:\n\n       As Congress churns through its last days before \n     adjournment, one issue of environmental impact should not be \n     left in the dust, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, or \n     CARA.\n\n  The New York Times just last week:\n\n       Before adjourning next month, Congress should approve two \n     of the most important conservation bills in many years. One \n     bill, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, would guarantee \n     $45 billion over 15 years for a range of environmental \n     purposes, including wilderness protection.\n\n  Again, from my own paper, the New Orleans Times Picayune, which a few \nmonths back, actually, in its frustration in trying to communicate our \nmessage, said:\n\n       Senators from inland states don't seem to understand why \n     Louisiana and other coastal states should receive the bulk of \n     this environmental money generated by offshore revenues and \n     maybe that is because their states aren't disappearing.\n\n  From the Tampa Tribune:\n\n       The Conservation Reinvestment Act is a necessary and \n     sensible measure that would allow our nation to safeguard its \n     natural heritage. It deserves Senate support.\n\n  Finally, from the Detroit Free Press, one of our most supportive \neditorials, in June of this year:\n\n       One of CARA's most exciting aspects, in fact, is the \n     ability to focus on smaller projects than the Federal \n     Government normally would, including urban green spaces, \n     walkways, small slices of important habitat. For those with \n     visions of a walkable riverfront in Detroit, of selective \n     preservation of natural spots in the path of development, \n     CARA is a dream come true--if the Senators controlling its \n     fate will set it free.\n\n  I don't think CARA is going to get set free in the vote that we are \ngoing to have in just a few minutes, but that is the process. We will \ncontinue our fight. We will continue to talk about this important \nissue, and we will be organized and ready for next year.\n  In addition, there are still days left in this session where CARA \ncould be, or something more like it, set free so that we can begin and \ncan continue some of the very important environmental work going on in \nthe country.\n\n  Let me say, not all of that environmental work takes place in \nWashington, D.C. Not all of that environmental work takes place among \nFederal agencies, although they have a role. A lot of this work takes \nplace in our hometowns all across the Nation, with our Governors' \noffices, with our mayors and our county commissions, on ball fields and \nsoccer fields, on cleanup days and Earth Days all over the Nation. That \nis the hope that CARA would bring that will be left on the table today.\n  I will submit all of these for the Record in my closing remarks.\n  In addition, let me make the point that some people have claimed that \nthe CARA legislation was just helping coastal States. I will submit for \nthe Record a wonderful editorial today from a place right in the middle \nof our Nation, the Kansas City Star, about the Conservation \nReinvestment Act, realizing that time is short, but I want to read what \nthey say from Kansas and Missouri:\n\n       This is not the time to give up. Despite the apparent \n     bipartisan agreement, this latest version of the Conservation \n     and Reinvestment Act, also known as CARA, should not be the \n     one approved by Congress.\n\n  Let us try to unite and find the will to salvage what we can, and \nperhaps there is a possible way to do that.\n  Let me read for the Record, as I begin closing, a letter to the \neditor of all the ones that were received, and there were literally \nhundreds written by many distinguished people from around our \ncountry, the one we received that just stood out above all the others \nwas a wonderful letter written by Lady Bird Johnson and by the \ndistinguished leader, Laurance Rockefeller, who is the uncle to our \ncolleague from West Virginia whom we so admire and respect and for whom \nwe have such affection. Laurance Rockefeller is 98 years old. I will \nread into the Record what Lady Bird and Laurence Rockefeller said about \nthe actions we should be taking now:\n\n       The 20th century can rightly be called America's \n     conservation century. From President Theodore Roosevelt \n     forward, Americans began to embrace their land rather than \n     just use it. This ethic of conservation has created, \n     protected and preserved tens of millions of acres of open \n     space in America, encompassing everything from national parks \n     to neighborhood soccer fields.\n       But conservation is not something that concludes just \n     because a century does. We are not done, nor will we ever be. \n     While protecting our natural resources is often a\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\n     quiet, steady exercise, sometimes moments of great \n     opportunity arise. We are at such a moment now.\n\n  They go on to write:\n\n       The U.S. Senate has before it legislation that would do \n     more to protect America's heritage than anything in a \n     generation. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act is in the \n     true spirit of the early conservationists: It plans for the \n     future while solving the immediate; it provides for \n     recreation as well as preservation; it ensures significant \n     state and local input and control; and it has bipartisan \n     support. The House has passed the bill and the Senate Energy \n     and Natural Resources Committee has approved it. With the \n     administration supporting the legislation, all that is needed \n     is Senate action in the remaining days of this Congress.\n       CARA's origins stretch back to 1958, when President \n     Eisenhower created the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review \n     Commission to conduct a three-year inquiry into America's \n     growing outdoor needs. Its findings suggested a new approach: \n     Not only should the Federal Government step up its lagging \n     land acquisition program to round out our National Park \n     System, but it should also embark on a new venture to provide \n     matching funds that state and local governments could use to \n     meet a broader set of outdoor needs.\n       In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law a bill \n     creating the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which not only \n     affirmed these commitments but set American conservation on a \n     course it still follows.\n       The foresight embedded in LWCF--an emphasis on Federal/\n     state/local partnerships, long-term planning, permanent \n     acquisition and urban recreation--was strengthened later in \n     the 1960s by tapping money from offshore oil and gas leases \n     to fund LWCF projects. The wisdom of doing so was strikingly \n     simple: Utilize the exploitation of one public natural \n     resource in order to protect and conserve another. Congress \n     had made a promise and found a way to keep it. And for years, \n     the LWCF worked wonders. More than 37,000 projects have been \n     sparked by the initiative, helping states and localities \n     acquire 2.3 million acres of parkland and adding 3.4 million \n     acres of new Federal lands to our national bounty. The LWCF \n     has funded open space in literally every county in America, \n     and is responsible for everything from helping preserve Civil \n     War battlefields to purchasing land for Rocky Mountain \n     National Park to building the baseball field down the street \n     from your house.\n       After 15 years of generally faithful adherence to LWCF's \n     unique bargain, Presidential administrations and Congress \n     began to redirect large chunks of fund revenues from their \n     intended purposes to other budget items. Since 1980, more \n     than $11 billion has been diverted from these projects, \n     creating a staggering backlog of Federal, state and local \n     land protection needs.\n\n  They continue and write:\n\n       We urgently need to restore the promise. That's what CARA \n     will do. CARA represents the first good opportunity in 20 \n     years to set our conservation path back on track. It not only \n     fully funds the LWCF, but also addresses critical needs in \n     wildlife management, urban parks, coastal protection--\n\n  Which is so important to my State and to many of our States, \nparticularly Mississippi, Alabama, and all along the east and west \ncoasts--\n\n     and historic preservation. Most important, it establishes a \n     dependable source of funding for these programs. The \n     prescience of those who created the fund was that \n     conservation especially could not be a haphazard thing; \n     population growth, the inexorable march of development and \n     simple wear and tear on resources require a permanent \n     commitment. CARA returns us to that premise, providing \n     approximately $3 billion a year and a firm precedent for \n     future funding.\n       CARA returns us to another important ideal: bipartisanship.\n\n  Sometimes that is in too short supply here in Washington.\n\n       Republican Don Young of Alaska and Democrat George Miller \n     of California did a masterful job of steering CARA through \n     the House, winning a 315-102 vote. In the Senate, Republican \n     Frank Murkowski of Alaska and Democrat Jeff Bingaman of New \n     Mexico brought the bill out of committee with support from \n     Senators of both parties. In these gridlocked times, CARA's \n     bipartisan treatment is a reminder that policy can sometimes \n     overcome politics.\n\n  They conclude by saying:\n\n       We hope the full Senate will heed that reminder and act on \n     CARA now.\n\n  We have worked as partners on conservation issues for almost four \ndecades. Our hope has always been that American leaders would act so \nthat their children--all children--would have something to look forward \nto. By reviving the Land and Water Conservation Fund before Congress \ngoes home this year, it can provide just that.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us does not do what this vision \noutlined. It does do many good things, but it falls short of this \nvision. In the last 10 minutes that I have, I want to finalize my \ncomments by making just a few more points and submit a letter for the \nRecord.\n  According to the Webster's Dictionary, ``legacy'' means something \nhanded down from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past, or to \nbequeath.\n  For more than 3 years, many in this body, dozens of Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, hundreds of mayors and Governors, thousands \nof environmentalists and wildlife groups, and millions of Americans \nhave been calling for a true environmental legacy.\n  Those of my colleagues who will, in a few minutes, support the \nInterior appropriations conference report will do so for many good \nreasons. My great friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, spoke eloquently \nyesterday about the money in this bill to fight the wild fires raging \nacross the western plains. That is a very good reason to support this \nbill.\n\n  As the temperature gets ready to dip across America this winter, \nthere is great need for a home heating oil reserve, and that is in this \nbill. That is a very good reason to support it.\n  In my State of Louisiana, the Cat Island Refuge, which is the oldest \ncypress forest in North America--and it may be the only one left--gets \nmoney in this bill. The New Orleans Jazz Commission and the Cane River \nNational Heritage Area, the oldest settlement in the Louisiana \nPurchase, are reasons to support this bill.\n  However, if anyone here is looking for a true legacy, a long-term \ncommitment to our vanishing coastlines, our disappearing wildlife, and \nour crumbling parks and historic treasures, you will not find that in \nthis bill.\n  The true legacy would have been the Conservation Reinvestment Act--a \nbill which has bipartisan support by a vast majority of the Congress \nand support from the President of the United States. However, today we \nwill be asked to vote on what really amounts to sort of a CARA \ncardboard cutout--one that kind of looks like the real thing, but it is \nreally flimsy and hollow, one which fails to deliver the great promise \nthat we had at this opportunity for our children and our grandchildren.\n  For 3 years, a monumental and historic coalition built around this \nbill and congressional leaders designed it in a way to merit support \nacross the aisle and across the Nation.\n  Early on, some environmentalists charged it was a pro-drilling bill. \nSo we clarified the language to make sure it was drilling neutral to \ngather their support.\n  I think--and there are some of my colleagues on the floor who can \nattest to this--that perhaps we failed to go as far as we should have. \nBut I believe we made great strides in meeting the concerns of some of \nthose who claimed that this bill would have compromised private \nproperty rights and would have allowed the Federal Government to buy up \nland without willing seller provisions and congressional approval.\n  We worked mightily to meet those objectives, and we believe the \ncompromise that we came up with was fair and good along these lines.\n  I know for the past few years I have cajoled, bargained, and spoken \nto so many of my friends and colleagues to listen to the merits of this \nproposal. I am sure on more than one occasion when they saw me coming, \nthey ran the other way. But I believe this is so important that we \nshould take this step now.\n  When I am asked how we can afford to do this, my answer is simple: \nHow can we afford not to?\n  Since 1930, Louisiana has lost more than 1,500 square miles of marsh. \nThe State loses between 25 and 30 miles each year--nearly a football \nfield of wetlands every 30 minutes in my State.\n  By 2050, we will lose more than 600 square miles of marsh and almost \n400 square miles of swamp.\n  That means the Nation will lose an area of coastal wetlands about the \nsize of Rhode Island--about the size of your State, Mr. President. We \nare about ready to lose it.\n  In the past 100 years, as so eloquently spoken about yesterday by our \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Bob Graham, southern Florida's \nEverglades have been reduced to one-fifth their former size.\n  In the past 30 years, the population of blue crabs in the Chesapeake \nBay has been barely hanging on, much to the dismay, I know, of Senator \nMikulski and Senator Sarbanes, who fight\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\nvigorously for renewal in the Chesapeake.\n  In the middle of this century, a boater could look down into Lake \nTahoe's depths and see 100 feet. Today that is more like 60, or 70, and \ndropping every day. Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer know that CARA \ncould be one of the answers--not the only answer but truly one of the \nanswers to help.\n  These facts are staggering. More importantly, it will take decades to \nturn it around.\n  So let's begin now.\n  I ask each of my colleagues to put themselves in the shoes of our \nGovernors, our mayors, and our natural resource officials. All of these \nlocal officials are charged just as we are with developing long-range \nstrategies to combat vanishing coastlines, disappearing wildlife, and \ncrumbling treasures. But if we don't enact CARA, or something very \nclose to it, a funding stream they can count on year in and year out, \ntheir efforts will be marginalized.\n\n  The Gulf of Mexico does not wait for congressional approval to claim \n30 square miles of Louisiana every year. Hurricanes do not lobby \ncongressional appropriators before they claim precious beaches in \nMississippi, Alabama, Florida, and the eastern seaboard. Mother nature \ndoes not testify in front of Congress before she floods our parks, eats \naway at the Everglades, and takes her toll on our historic treasures.\n  Let us look closely at what we are doing here today. I ask that we \nnot be lulled into believing that this is anything more than a minor \ndownpayment on a debt we owe to our children.\n  In the past 2 years, I think we have made much progress in \nrecognizing the contribution of the coastal States--particularly States \nsuch as Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama--which generate \nthese offshore revenues in the first place.\n  Because I have received assurances from both leaders, Senator Lott of \nMississippi, and Senator Daschle of South Dakota, that both coastal \nimpact assistance and wildlife protection can be addressed in other \nbills in this Congress, I have withdrawn my objections to final passage \nof this bill.\n  Although CARA supporters will lose the vote today, we will grow \nstronger. We will come back energized and ready to fight for what our \ncountry really needs--a true environmental legacy. The coalition knows \nthat this is a downpayment. And, like all who are owed a debt, we will \ncome to collect.\n  Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       Want of foresight. . .unwillingness to act when action \n     would be simple and effective . . . lack of clear thinking, \n     confusion of counsel until the emergency comes . . . until \n     self-preservation strikes its jarring gong. . .these are \n     features which constitute the endless repetition of history.\n\n  Colleagues, let us heed these words. Let us come next year prepared \nwith a willingness to act. Let us think clearly before the emergencies \ncome. Let us not wait until our environmental preservation hangs in the \nbalance. And let us listen to the cause of the American people--people \nfrom my State, people from your State, people from all of our States \nwho say they need something on which they can depend--a steady stream \nof revenue; a partnership that they can depend on to help preserve what \nis best about America while protecting private property rights, while \nprotecting the great balance between land ownership and land \nmaintenance, while protecting the great needs of our coastline and our \ninterior.\n  We need a bill that America can grow on and depend on and prosper \nfrom in the decades ahead.\n  I thank again the appropriators for their hard work. I thank the \nauthorizers for their tremendous vision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of wonderful people who need to be thanked for their efforts \nand, in doing so, not conceding that there is not still some time left \nto make some corrections and improvements but recognizing that the time \nis short and we will continue to pursue this avenue. But this is a list \nof coalition members from the National Wildlife Federation; Sporting \nGoods Manufacturers Association; National Governors' Association; \nthe Nature Conservancy; Louisiana Department of Natural Resources; \nAmericans for our Heritage and Recreation; International Association of \nFish and Wildlife Agencies that worked so hard on this effort; U.S. \nSoccer Foundation; National Wildlife Federation; Coastal Conservation \nAssociation; Outdoor Recreation Coalition of America; Trust for Public \nLands; Coastal States Organization, which Jack Caldwell helped to head \nup; National Coalition of State Historic Preservation Officers, \nparticularly the Governor of Oregon who was so helpful, and many other \nGovernors; the Wilderness Society; Southern Governors Association; my \nGovernor, Governor Foster, who lent a hand early on; Land Trust \nAlliance; and the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana.\n\n  Those are just a few. There are so many more and I know my time is \nprobably up.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names \nof many of the staff people who helped make this possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         CARA Coalition Members\n\n     Mark Van Putten, Jodi Applegate, Jim Lyon, Steve Schimburg--\n         National Wildlife Federation\n     Sandy Briggs--Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association\n     Jena Carter, Diane Shays--National Governor's Association\n     Tom Cassidy, Jody Thomas, David Weiman--The Nature \n         Conservancy\n     Sidney Coffee--Louisiana Department of Natural Resources\n     Tom Cove--Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association\n     Jane Danowitz--Americans for our Heritage and Recreation\n     Glenn Delaney, Naomi Edelson, Max Peterson--International \n         Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies\n     Jim Range--International Association of Fish and Wildlife \n         Agencies/The American Airgun Field Target Association\n     Gary Taylor--International Association of Fish and Wildlife \n         Agencies\n     Herb Giobbi--U.S. Soccer Foundation\n     Pam Goddard--National Wildlife Federation\n     Bob Hayes--Coastal Conservation Association\n     Myrna Johnson--Outdoor Recreation Coalition of America\n     Lesly Kane--Trust for Public Land\n     Tony MacDonald--Coastal States Organization\n     Nancy Miller--National Coalition of State Historic \n         Preservation Officers\n     Andrew Minkiewicz, Kevin Smith--Governor Kitzhaber of Oregon\n     Rindy O'Brien--The Wilderness Society\n     Beth Osborne--Southern Governor's Association\n     Bob Szabo--Van Ness--Feldman Law Firm\n     Russell Shay--Land Trust Alliance\n     Mark Davis--Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana\n\n                 Actively Supportive Members and Staffs\n\n     Senator Thomas Daschle--Mark Childress, Eric Washburn\n     Senator Trent Lott--Jim Ziglar\n     Senator Bingaman--Minority Energy Committee Staff: Bob Simon, \n         Sam Fowler, David Brooks, Mark Katherine Ishee, Kyra \n         Finkler\n     Senator Murkowski--Majority Energy Committee Staff: Andrew \n         Lundquist, Kelly Johnson\n     Senator Mike DeWine--Paul Palagyi\n     Senator John Breaux--Fred Hatfield, Stephanie Leger, Mallory \n         Moore\n     Senator Max Baucus--Brian Kuehl, Norma Jane Sabiston, Jason \n         Schendle, Aylin Azikalin, Alyson Azodeh\n       All democratic colleagues on Energy Committee and Senator \n     Fitzgerald.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I end by saying that sometimes it takes \na bold act to receive something on which we can really build. CARA is a \nbold act.\n  In a bill with $15 billion, asking for a few hundred million for \nStates and local governments, a few hundred million for our coastal \ncommunities, a few hundred million for wildlife, was not too much to \nask. I am very hopeful in the years ahead we can meet the promise of \nCARA.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed excerpts of editorial \nsupport.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Why CARA? Why Now?\n\n\nExcerpts of Editorial Support for the Conservation and Reinvestment Act\n\n       ``It's a bold approach to environmental conservation and \n     restoration.

Despite the apparent \n     bipartisan agreement, this latest version of the Conservation \n     and Reinvestment Act, also known as CARA, should not be the \n     one approved by Congress. It falls far short of the original \n     that has been pushed by conservation groups, cities, counties \n     and states.\n       Under a strong bipartisan effort, Congress has been on the \n     verge of restoring the money to its rightful uses. Of the $3 \n     billion CARA would provide, Missouri annually stands to gain \n     $34.7 million and Kansas $17.3 million for natural resource \n     preservation and parkland acquisition. Kansas and Missouri \n     cities and counties could use their share of the money to \n     improve state and local parks, purchase land for parks, and \n     other recreational purposes.\n       The substitute version falls short in the money it would \n     guarantee over the long term. In one example, $350 million \n     annually for nongame wildlife programs has been cut to $50 \n     million.\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Minority Leader Tom \n     Daschle have announced their intention to push to restore \n     CARA to its former self. They are backed by the nation's \n     governors, who have sought significant conservation funding \n     for state needs. The original version is the one that should \n     be passed.\n       Approval of CARA could be one of the most significant \n     victories of this Congress.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent to take the remaining time of the \nSenator from Arizona, which I believe is 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the distinguished Senator allow me to use 5 minutes \nof my time as the ranking member on the subcommittee?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Go right ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I trust that the distinguished Senator will not leave the \nfloor. I hope he will follow me immediately. If he is in great haste, I \nwill be glad to yield to him.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the short time available before the \nSenate votes on final passage of the Interior appropriations conference \nreport, I want to again urge my colleagues to support this measure. It \nis a good compromise that balances the needs of our parks, our forests, \nour wildlife refuges, and our trust responsibilities to American \nIndians, against the resources made available to us. That task--the \ntask of reconciling identified needs with limited resources--is not \neasy.\n  I am particularly pleased with the level of funding in this bill for \nfossil energy research. The new power plant improvement initiative, \nalong with the other fossil energy research programs in the Department \nof Energy, are critical to this nation's energy security. Working to \ncurtail our reliance on imported oil, and ensuring that our current \nfleet of power plants are efficient and environmentally sound, should \nbe the cornerstone of the next administration's energy policy. I can \nassure the next president, whomever he may be, that I, for one, am \nready to assist in that endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to take a moment to thank the chairman of \nthe full committee, Senator Ted Stevens, for his interest in this bill, \nfor his continued support, and for his willingness to work with Senator \nGorton and me to ensure that we were able to get to this point. In \nparticular, I am grateful for his help in making additional resources \navailable to the Interior subcommittee. Without those resources, we \ncould not have crafted this bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me again thank my colleague, the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton. He and his staff have truly been \na pleasure to work with.\n  When I talk of staff, let me briefly mention my own staff person, \nPeter Kiefhaber. I believe this is his first bill, first major bill, to \nassist me on this\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\nfloor throughout the markup, throughout the hearings. He has done a \nmasterful job as a new person in that position. I thank him and I \ncongratulate him.\n  I yield the floor now. I yield my remaining time to Senator Gorton.\n  I, again, thank the distinguished Senator for yielding when he had \nthe floor, to allow me to make this brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask to take the 4 minutes that was available to the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate the opportunity to visit just a moment on a \nsubject that is very close to my heart and very close to my interests. \nI am from Wyoming, a State that has open space throughout a great deal \nof the State. It is the eighth largest State in the United States and \nstill the smallest population. I grew up near Yellowstone Park. Those \nare things I feel very strongly about.\n  I want to do two things--one, to comment on the good proposal of the \nSenator from Louisiana and her passionate defense of it. I understand \nthat. I respect that a great deal. There are some things that are \ndisadvantageous about CARA that we have talked about. One, of course, \nis the idea it makes it mandatory spending for 15 years. This is an \nentitlement. As we look at our budget now, about a third of our budget \nis up to the Congress to allocate. The rest of it is entitlements.\n  I came from serving in the Wyoming Legislature where the legislature \nnow only has control over 25 percent of the dollars. I think that is a \ndangerous position, and entitlements become a real problem.\n  Also, as we look toward the land acquisition, there are a number of \nthings we need to be concerned about in this year's budget. From this \nadministration, there was more interest on the purchase plan than the \nmaintenance plan. We have 379 parks in this country, most of which are \nin desperate need of infrastructure help, but it seems as if the more \npopular thing to talk about is the acquisition of more land. \nFifty percent of my State belongs to the Federal Government; 85 percent \nof Nevada in the west along the Rocky Mountain area, most of the land \nnow belongs to the Federal Government.\n\n  We asked in committee if we could have some kind of protection in \nthis allocation of CARA of $45 billion, that we would not have any more \nFederal land; that, indeed, if Federal lands were to be purchased, we \nwould have an opportunity to dispose of some Federal land so there \nwould be basically no net gain. It seems to me that is reasonable. The \nsupporters of CARA were not willing to talk about that.\n  In conclusion, I think there is a great deal of merit in the bill \nbefore the Senate. It isn't, of course, what everyone wants. There are \nmore expenditures to it than some like. It does reflect help however, \nfor the losses that were incurred because of the forest fires--6.6 \nmillion acres in the West burned this year and the costs associated and \nthe losses associated there.\n  I am going to support this bill. I am pleased. I thank the chairman \nfor his good work in getting this bill before the Senate.\n  I will comment on the fact that not only in this bill but in a number \nof bills there are authorizations for things I think are \ninappropriately authorized in appropriations bills. In this bill there \nare some parks, for example, and set-asides which certainly ought to \ncome from the authorizing committee, not from the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I understand what happens. We get toward the end of the year, and \nthere are things there, people want something to happen and we are in \ndanger of having a lot of that happen in the next week or so. I hope it \ndoes not. We have a system where there is an authorization and there is \nan appropriation.\n  I don't think anyone in this place is more anxious to have dollars \navailable to do something with conservation, to do something with \npreservation, to do something with easements, to do something with \nmaintenance of the land we already have, but I think we have to make \nsure those bills, indeed, have the composition that makes them the \nkinds of things that we need to have in this Congress and that is to \nhave them authorized yearly or at least in shorter spans than 15 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, before I make some general remarks, I will \nrespond to the three--and I think there have only been three--critics \nof this bill.\n  For the better part of 3 days, the Senate has indulged in the remarks \nof the Senator from Illinois over one item out of many hundreds in this \nbill. Normally speaking, items such as the Lincoln Library are included \nin bills such as this because the Senators from the States concerned \nbelieve they are important and because we believe they are reasonable \nnational priorities. I think I can assure the Senator from Illinois and \nthe body that, had I known we were going to go through this process, \nthere would have been no money for this project in this bill at all. It \nmay very well be there will be no more tomorrow.\n\n  I do think a library for Abraham Lincoln's papers in Springfield, IL, \nis an appropriate project. The State of Illinois and various local \nentities and individuals are providing the great majority of the money \nthat is going into that project. The Senator from Illinois has engaged \nin a filibuster, required the vote of 89-8 on cloture, all over the \nbidding practices with respect to the way in which that project is \nundertaken, as to whether or not they ought to be Federal bidding \npractices or the State of Illinois' bidding practices--bidding \npractices of the State of Illinois that I believe he had something to \ndo with creating while he was a member of the legislature of that body.\n  Even under the bill as it appears here, the Secretary of the Interior \nhas the authority to review the design, method of acquisition, and the \nestimated cost, and can deal with anything that the Secretary believes \nto be untoward in this entire question. But I have to say that to spend \n3 days of the time of the Senate on this internal dispute involving \nMembers of Congress and others from the State of Illinois was an \nimposition on the time of the Senate at any time, but especially when \nthe Senate is attempting to finish many important bills of which this \nis one, but only one. We will go forward with it at this point. We will \npass the bill at this point. I believe the President of the United \nStates will sign it at this point. But I can certainly not remember any \nother instance in which a Member from a State that is getting a benefit \nfrom the bill has looked so carefully at the teeth of a gift horse.\n  The second question I raise is about some of the criticisms from my \ngood friend, the Senator from Arizona. He complains about money in this \nbill for carriage barn rehabilitation at the Longfellow National \nHistoric Site. That is a national park site. That is the very kind of \nthing that we must rehabilitate. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, when he \nlived at his place, had a carriage barn. I don't know whether the \nSenator from Arizona feels we should let it fall down, but my own view \nis our first duty is to maintain the national park sites that we have \nat the present time. The Senator from Wyoming has just referred to \nthat. How that constitutes pork, or a reason to vote against this bill, \nis, I must say, beyond my understanding.\n  He complains about dollars for the southeast Alaska disaster fund \nthat he claims were not included in either the House or the Senate \nbill. In fact, they were included in the Senate bill under a different \naccount number.\n  He complains about $30 million for site-specific earmarks or \nemergency funds, one quarter of which turn out to be--slightly more \nthan one quarter--for hazardous fuels reduction activities carried on \nby Northern Arizona University.\n  When I was on the floor, he was complaining about the rehabilitation \nof a fish hatchery in White Sulfur Springs, WV, which was requested by \nmy good friend and colleague, the Senator from West Virginia. Again, I \nam puzzled why it is we should not provide such office rehabilitation \nat a site that is a specific function of the people of the United \nStates.\n  In other words, I don't find those criticisms to have any particular \nmerit whatsoever. This is our business. It is the business of this bill \nto see to it\n\n[[Page S9916]]\n\nthat the lands and historic sites and facilities of the United States \nof America are properly maintained. I think one of the great \nshortcomings, one of the overwhelming shortcomings that we have had in \nthe last few years is that we have not been maintaining these sites to \nthe extent they ought to be maintained. One of the goals, which I have \naccomplished in this bill, is to increase the amount of money for that \nmaintenance, both in the regular bill and in this supplement to this \nbill that is the third item of controversy here today.\n\n  This bill is criticized by the Senator from Louisiana as not \nincluding the full authorization for the so-called CARA bill, the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act. She is certainly correct; it does \nnot. That bill is an almost $3-billion-a-year entitlement for some 15 \nyears, the net result of which is that the items included in it are \ndeemed to be more important, should that bill pass the Congress of the \nUnited States, than saving the Social Security system, than education, \nthan health care, or any of the other items for which we appropriate \nevery year. In my view, it is utterly inappropriate as an entitlement \nthat automatically comes off the top, before all the other priorities \nof the people of the United States.\n  On the other hand, many of the items preferred in that CARA \nlegislation are highly worthy items, items for which this subcommittee \nchairman is delighted to have what now amounts to a greater \nauthorization. Many of them will be more liberally funded in the future \nas a result of the proposals that are a part of this bill now.\n  It is said--it was said in that criticism--that this bill sends all \nthe money through the Federal bureaucracy rather than CARA sending it \ndirectly to the States. First, it doesn't send all the money through \nthe Federal bureaucracy. Many of these programs are existing programs \nthat result in formula grants to the States, and others are competitive \ngrants to the States. At this point, the Congress can, through its \nauthorizing committees, change the distribution formula for any one of \nthese programs, either to make them more direct or more focused. CARA, \nof course, doesn't send all its money directly to the States, either. \nIt does include large amounts for payment to coastal States but they \nare for new programs which are not even authorized at this point and \nwill not be unless some bill of that nature is passed.\n  Second, this is criticized by some conservatives for not providing \nprotections for private property. The Interior bill funds currently \nauthorized programs. It doesn't authorize them; it funds currently \nauthorized programs and therefore, by definition, includes every \nprotection for private property that exists in any one of those \nauthorizing laws. If there are shortcomings in this field, it is not \nthe fault of the Appropriations Committee but of the very authorizing \ncommittee that presented CARA to us in the first place.\n  For Federal land acquisitions that are funded by this CARA-lite, in \nfuture years everyone is going to be subject to the same process as is \nused at the present time. They are all going to go through \nappropriations committees. I can assure my colleagues, I cannot think \nof a case where this committee has approved a project that did not have \nthe support of the relevant Members of Congress, except maybe for this \none in Illinois, which has been the subject of debate for some 3 days. \nSo that objection is simply not valid.\n  It is also pointed out this bill does not provide States and local \ngovernments with a predictable funding stream. You bet your life it \ndoes not, and it was not so designed. Why should we give a predictable \nfunding stream for grant programs to State and local governments in \nprecedence to the very programs for which we are directly responsible? \nWe do not have a fully predictable or legally enforceable funding \nstream for schools. We don't have it for most of our health care \nprograms. We don't have it for research and development programs. We \ndon't have it for a wide variety of the programs that are subject to \ndebate every year. It is just for that reason that we do not have it. \nThey should be subject to debate and revision with respect to \npriorities every year. That is why we have a Congress.\n\n  On the other hand, this new title does provide a decidedly increased \nlikelihood that these grant programs will be sustained and will \nincrease in future years.\n  What this bill does is to say that if you do not spend this money on \nthe programs outlined in this bill, you cannot spend it on something \nelse, but it will go to reducing the national debt. It is only a couple \nmonths. Members on both sides of the aisle vociferously were saying \nthat a reduction of the national debt was the most important single \neconomic activity in which we could engage. Chairman Greenspan was \nquoted constantly on the floor of the Senate. We forgot that when some \ndecided we needed these ``predictable funding streams,'' that is to \nsay, entitlements which come directly out of debt reduction.\n  I have never been able to see the logic of a 15-year guaranteed \nfunding stream that could not easily be adjusted if the programs were \nineffective or if we went into economic times in which there were \nhigher priorities.\n  Those are some of the critiques of the particular proposal, \nadditional portions of which are likely to be included in the \nappropriations bill for Commerce-State-Justice, particularly the oceans \nportions of it which will be debated later.\n  Finally, Senator Graham from Florida criticized the bill for not \nproviding adequate funds for national parks. While CARA would have \nguaranteed an extra $100 million per year for the National Park \nService--Mr. President, I am allowed to take time from Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. The answer is, of course, CARA did not either. CARA gave \nmoney to the National Park Service above the line but not below the \nline, and very likely future Congresses will simply reduce the \ndiscretionary portion of that account by the amount guaranteed in CARA \nitself.\n\n  It was at my insistence that this CARA-lite does include an item, I \nbelieve $150 million a year, for national park maintenance. I think \nthat is one of the most important elements of the bill itself.\n  The vote on cloture indicated the broad support for this bill, as did \nthe overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives. For \nthat overwhelming bipartisan support, I owe particular thanks to \nSenator Byrd for helping me in developing the conference agreement and \nshaping it in a way that merits the support of Members on both sides of \nthe aisle. His new staff minority clerk, Peter Kiefhaber, has been a \ntremendous asset during the course of his first year. He has been ably \nassisted by Carole Geagley of the minority staff and Scott Dalzell, who \nhas been with us on detail from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  I thank my own exemplary staff: Bruce Evans, who is sitting here with \nme, Ginny James, Leif Fonnesbeck, Christine Drager, and Joe Norrell, as \nwell as our detailee, Sheila Sweeney, and Kari Vander Stoep of my \npersonal staff. All have also worked so many hours on this bill that I \ndo not dare count them for fear of feeling ashamed. They have worked \nextremely hard, but they have been successful and have every reason to \nbe gratified with their work.\n  I note for the record this is the last year in which I will be \nprivileged to work with my counterpart chairman, Congressman Ralph \nRegula from the House of Representatives. He will have another \nsubcommittee next year, and I tell you, I will miss him. I have never \ndealt with anyone in this body or in the other body with whom I have \nhad a more positive and affirmative, constructive working relationship, \noften with a great many laughs because of his marvelous sense of humor. \nRalph Regula will have left a substantial legacy of increased priority \nfor the maintenance of our Federal lands and facilities and a great \napproach in a matter of principle.\n  In summary, this is a popular bill that has every right to be popular \nbecause it meets with many of the needs of deferred maintenance for \npast neglect. It has many projects in it that are of great importance \nto Members on both sides of the partisan divide in this body and our \nsignificant national priorities as well, and will get us through \nanother year with respect not just to these natural resources used in \nenergy\n\n[[Page S9917]]\n\nresearch and cultural institutions in the United States but in a way I \nthink worthy and which I recommend heartily to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think Senator Domenici will be \nseeking recognition. First, I want to take 2 minutes to alert my \ncolleagues to what I think is a very significant issue.\n  Much has been made of late about the status of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve and the recommendation by Vice President Gore that we \nwithdraw 30 million barrels out of the SPR so we can build up our \nheating oil reserve. Let me tell you what is happening to that.\n  The administration forgot a very important detail when they put that \noil up to bid for the refiners. They didn't mandate that the crude oil \nbe refined into heating oil or that it be used to build inventories \nhere in the United States for the benefit of the Northeast States that \nneed that heating oil inventories built up.\n  What will happen to the crude oil or refined product? It will go into \nthe marketplace, and it is going to Europe because Europe is paying a \nhigher price for heating oil than the United States. Currently, 167,000 \nbarrels a day of distillate is exported.\n  Let me tell you what came out of the Houston Chronicle, and I quote:\n\n       The buyers can do what they wish with the oil, such as sell \n     or swap it, said Department of Energy spokesperson Drew \n     Malcomb, although whoever ends up with the oil has to get it \n     out of storage by the end of November.\n       The extra crude won't result in any additional heating oil \n     because all the heating oil facilities already are operating \n     at maximum capacity, Brown said.\n\n  There you have it. You have an administration that said we had an \nemergency, we had to go into SPR, address our heating oil situation, \nwhile sending a message to the Mideast that we are reducing our savings \naccount. Then we find we may not build up our domestic heating oil \ninventories at all with this oil, it is going up for sale into the \nmarket and ending up in Europe because the administration didn't \nmandate that if you bought the oil, you had to keep it here in the \nUnited States.\n  Senator Stevens and I have experienced some demands relative to our \ninability to move our oil out of our State.\n  It is inconsistent to me that the administration could make such a \npoor business deal. We have not accomplished anything with SPR. We have \nsimply increased our exports of heating oil. I think it is a charade.\n  I thank my colleague from New Mexico. But I did want to call that to \nyour attention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from the Houston Chronicle entitled ``Oil from Reserve in \nHigh Demand'' and two tables on distillate exports.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Oil From Reserve in High Demand--Bidders Grab 30 Million Barrels\n\n                           (By Nelson Antosh)\n\n       Trading companies and refiners looking for a good deal on \n     crude have snapped up all 30 million barrels that the federal \n     government is releasing from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n       The Energy Department announced Wednesday that 11 \n     companies, some of them with names little known even within \n     the industry, had submitted the best bids for the oil being \n     held underground in Louisiana and Texas.\n       The buyers in effect promised to return to storage 31.56 \n     million barrels between August and November of next year, \n     thus paying a premium of about 5 percent.\n       But by using the futures market, the successful bidders \n     will be able to pay back with oil cheaper than what it is \n     today, even if the real market price for crude may be higher \n     by then.\n       ``A good transaction for value,'' said Mary Rose Brown of \n     Valero, a San Antonio-based company that will be refining its \n     federal crude. The difference between Wednesday's futures and \n     the payback cost is $3.25 per barrel, she said.\n       The futures price for next October is $28.53, said Kyle \n     Cooper of Salomon Smith Barney in Houston, who reasons that \n     all the reserve sale does is ``move around crude.''\n       In contrast to next October, the sweet crude contract for \n     next month settled Wednesday on the New York Mercantile \n     Exchange for $31.43 per barrel.\n       The buyers can do what they wish with the oil, such as sell \n     or swap it, said DOE spokesman Drew Malcomb, although whoever \n     ends up with the oil has to get it out of storage by the end \n     of November.\n       Valero will be taking 1 million barrels of sour crude from \n     the Bryan Mound storage site near Freeport and splitting it \n     between its refineries in Texas City and Freeport.\n       That crude will be co-mingled with other supplies and be \n     made into a full range of products, including gasoline.\n       The extra crude won't result in any additional heating oil \n     because all the heating oil facilities already are operating \n     at maximum capacity, Brown said. Valero even shifted some of \n     its distillate output at a New Jersey refinery from premium-\n     priced jet fuel into home heating oil.\n       ``The product will go where the market is,'' said Malcomb, \n     although he said his agency would prefer that it be refined \n     into heating oil and be shipped to the Northeast.\n       Vitol, a trading company in Houston that also owns a \n     refinery in Canada, will get 1.05 million barrels of sweet \n     crude out of a storage site in Louisiana and 550,000 sour \n     barrels out of Bryan Mound.\n       The company will apply for an export license, but logically \n     it is a better value if sold along the Gulf Coast, said a \n     Vitol employee who preferred not to be identified.\n       Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, a Houston-based venture \n     that is a major refiner, was the high bidder on 2.4 million \n     barrels of sour crude and 1.5 million barrels of sweet crude.\n       The DOE did not release the amounts that individual \n     companies promised to return to the reserve, because that \n     could influence any future sales.\n       Morgan Stanley Dean Witter of New York was the high bidder \n     on 2 million barrels.\n       Lesser known names were Euell Energy of Aurora, Colo., \n     which was the high bidder on\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\n     3 million barrels, Burhany Energy Enterprises of Tallahassee, \n     Fla., also with 3 million barrels, and Lance Stroud \n     Enterprises of New York with 4 million barrels.\n       Equiva Trading, which is a Houston-based alliance between \n     Shell and Texaco, will get 2.5 million barrels. A spokesman \n     could not be reached late Wednesday.\n       Elf Trading, also based in Houston, is getting 1 million \n     barrels.\n       The largest quantity, 6 million barrels, was won by BP Oil \n     Supply Co., in Warrenville, Ill.\n       ``Every barrel we can get into the market in the next few \n     weeks reduces the risk of a shortage of heating oil and \n     diesel fuel this winter,'' said Secretary of Energy Bill \n     Richardson in a news release. ``This is good for consumers \n     and good for our nation's long-term security,''\n       Some have criticized releasing oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve as a political ploy to get more votes in \n     the Northeast, where heating oil is widely used.\n\n                 TABLE 5.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9918-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9918-S9922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAX RELIEF PROPOSALS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I put a little editorial up here, and I \nhope I made it big enough that those who photograph what we talk about \nhere can see it.\n  I want to read this paragraph in yellow, and I want to speak to Vice \nPresident Gore's constant harping about the 1 percent of the American \ntaxpayers getting too much of a tax break.\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\n I would like to do that for about 10 or 12 minutes.\n  But first, let me suggest to the middle-class American people who \nhave been waiting for a tax cut that if you elect Vice President Gore, \nyou can wait perhaps forever because, as this editorial says, he might \nsay over and over and over--maybe as many times as he said ``1 \npercent'' the other night--that he is for middle-income Americans \ngetting a tax break.\n  But this is the Washington Post--not the Washington Times or the \nAlbuquerque Journal--that says:\n\n       If Mr. Gore believes middle-class people need a tax break, \n     he might better give them one--and let them decide how to \n     spend the money. If he believes the Government should do more \n     to promote education, he could do so more effectively with \n     truly targeted spending programs rather than with tax credits \n     that, for example, go to those who could and would pay for \n     tuition in any case along with those who need the help. But \n     for political reasons, the Democrats, as in 1992 and 1996, \n     believe they need to cloak their programs in the language and \n     form of tax cuts. One result would be an ever more complex \n     Tax Code.\n\n  The truth of the matter is that the Vice President of the United \nStates spoke the other night about the unfairness of the tax proposals \nof George W. Bush.\n  I just want to start by correcting one thing for sure. There are no \nmiddle-income tax cuts in Vice President Gore's proposal--the last time \nhe spoke to it, the second time he spoke to it, and the time he sent us \nan 81-page budget. There are no middle-class tax cuts. Why? Because he \nchooses to say to the American people: If you do this with your money, \nyou get a credit; if you do that with your money, you get a credit.\n\n  But for those who do not do this or that because they don't have any \nchildren to put in day care or they don't have any of the other things \nthey need that he wants to give them tax credit for, the overwhelming \npercentage of the middle class gets zero.\n  That is maybe what we ought to be talking about whenever he says 1 \npercent. Perhaps we ought to say middle-class people, zero; middle-\nclass Americans, zero--maybe 16 times, as he did the other night in \nreferring to ``1 percent.''\n  Having said that, I want to talk about the progressive taxes the \nAmerican people pay and the progressive system we live under because I \nbelieve there are millions and millions and millions of Americans who \nhave not been told what our Tax Code is and have not been told what \nGeorge W. Bush's tax proposals would do. Let me try that for a few \nminutes.\n  I just told you what the Washington Post said about his tax \nproposals. In essence, even when he chooses to help--that is, the Vice \nPresident--the middle-class Americans, he chooses, I say to my friend \nfrom Alabama, to tell them how to spend the tax cut.\n  That is the essence of the difference between the across-the-board \ncut of George W. Bush and the Vice President, although he has much less \non the tax side, in any event--the Vice President--but he chooses to \nsay: Mr. and Mrs. America, I don't want you to have a $1,500 tax cut if \nyou are making $60,000 or $50,000. What I want you to do, if you want \nto take advantage of what I want you to do, if you do one of these five \nor six things as we have said, you will get a tax break.\n  If you are Mr. and Mrs. America, you might say: I don't need any of \nthose taxes. Why don't you just give me my money and let me spend it?\n  That is one of the very big differences between the two parties at \nthis point, as indicated by this editorial.\n  In 1992 and 1996, Vice President Gore again chose in behalf of his \ncolleagues to say: We want to give you a tax cut, but do not \nmisunderstand; you have to use it our way or you don't get it.\n  Is there anybody in America who thinks a tax cut should be used only \nthe way the Federal Government wants them to use it? I don't think they \neven understand a tax cut to be that. But you can rest on it, that is \nwhat he is talking about--not a single middle-income tax cut--zero. I \nrepeat.\n  I would like to talk a little bit on what has happened to the Tax \nCode of the United States.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, we have the fairest and most \nprogressive Tax Code any country has ever lived under. Let me tell you \nwhat it does today.\n  If anyone wants one of these, I will gladly give them one. The \nInternal Revenue Service gives us the information, and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, which is a combined committee, gave us this \ninformation.\n  Let me talk about the 1 percent.\n  Fellow Americans, 1 percent of the taxpayers of America--1 percent--\ncurrently pay a shocking 33 percent of the taxes.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President. On the income tax side, the top 1 \npercent of Americans pay 33 percent of the taxes that America collects \nfrom income. They are rather wealthy. They make $250,000 and over, and \n1 percent pays 33 percent of the taxes.\n  Let me right off the bat give you an astonishing number. If you are \nto adopt George W. Bush's across-the-board tax cut, guess what percent \nthe top 1 percent will pay then? Remember I said, right now under our \nvery progressive code, they pay 33 percent of all the taxes we collect.\n  I say to my friend from Alabama, it is a startling revelation. After \nwe cut everybody across the board, as George Bush suggests, the top 1 \npercent will pay 34 percent total taxes. In other words, their portion \nof the total taxes will go up 1 percent, not come down. Isn't that \ninteresting?\n  So everyone understands who is rich and who isn't and who pays a lot \nof taxes and who doesn't, let's talk about the top 10 percent of \ntaxpayers. Most people watching and most people visiting are in that \nbracket because the top 10 percent of the taxpayers are people earning \n$79,000 or higher. How much of the total taxes collected by America \nfrom income does the top 10 percent pay? I am sure, unless someone has \nstudied it, in your wildest guess you will not conclude this. Sixty-\nseven percent of the income taxes collected come from the top 10 \npercent of the people in this country who are earning $79,000. Imagine.\n  Can anyone imagine a fairer system if you want to tax people who earn \nmoney than to have 1 percent of the population that makes substantial \nmoney pay 33 percent of the taxes, and the top 10 percent of 79 and \nhigher pay 67 percent? Frankly, it is obvious to me our Vice President \nis, once again, running on an issue that has been tried before, and we \nare very grateful as a nation that it has never worked. He is \npracticing the art of class warfare. He wants to make sure Americans do \nnot trust the capitalist system where people might make more money, one \nversus another, depending on what they are doing, what they have \ninvested in, and for what they have taken a risk. He wants to make the \nissue that the top 10 percent, which pays 33 percent of the taxes, does \nnot deserve to be looked at when we look at cutting taxes for \nAmericans.\n  I am quite sure that sooner or later the American people are going to \ncatch on that everybody who pays taxes gets a tax break. So nobody will \nhave a misunderstanding, if you don't pay taxes, you don't get a tax \nbreak. I think that is pretty fundamental. There are many millions of \nAmericans working for a living who do not pay any U.S. income tax. \nRight off the bat, when you speak about giving other people who are \nearning less tax breaks, we have to understand a very large percentage \nof Americans don't pay any taxes. They may think they are paying a lot \nbecause they are paying Social Security taxes, and neither candidate is \nrecommending, from what I can tell, that we dramatically reduce the \nSocial Security--other than George W. Bush saying let's investment 2 \npercent. Otherwise, I haven't heard anybody saying that onerous Social \nSecurity tax is the one that ought to be fixed.\n  Let me repeat, when the tax plan is in place under Mr. Bush, the top \n1 percent will pay $4 trillion in taxes when we have finished the tax \nacross-the-board cut. Let's give that again: That top 1 percent will \npay $4 trillion in income taxes, and it will be 34 percent of the new \nincome taxes that we are taking in.\n  What will that $4 trillion buy that 1 percent of Americans are paying \nin taxes? It will buy all of the following: All of our defense \nprograms, welfare, food stamps, child nutrition, State child health \ninsurance. We just picked some programs. That top 1 percent will pay \nfor all of that out of what they pay in income taxes.\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\n  If Mr. Gore continues to refer to this top 1 percent as public enemy \nNo. 1, then I can only say that the top 1 percent are high-income \nfolks; the top 10 percent earn $79,000 and above. One group pays 33 \npercent of the taxes; and the other group pays 67.\n\n  What should we do? Should we say because they pay 67 percent of the \ntaxes but they make $79,000 or more they should get no tax reduction? \nIf you are going to have a tax reduction because you have a giant \nsurplus, let's be fair and say the American Tax Code is fair. We ought \nto continue to be fair, leave it as fair as it was, but make sure we \nunderstand the top 10 percent deserve some tax relief, since they are \npaying 67 percent of the tax.\n  Let me also suggest that the bottom rung of wage earners and \ntaxpayers in America--so there is no misunderstanding about my \nprogressivity comment that we have a progressive code--the bottom 50 \npercent pay 4 percent; the bottom 50 percent of our earners pay 4 \npercent of the taxes of America.\n  I think we have a pretty fair system. In fact, it is very heavily \nskewed towards those people making $79,000 or more. But George Bush, \nfrom what I can analyze, intends to leave it the same. It will come out \nlike it is in terms of progressivity, excepting that those in the top 1 \npercent, by a coincidence of reducing the total tax take, will end up \npaying 34 percent instead of 33--even if we give them a tax break.\n  I do believe it is rather authentic when the Washington Post says to \nVice President Gore, if you want to give the middle income a tax cut, \ngive it to them. Don't tell them what they must use it for in order to \nget a tax credit or tax break. That is not very American. Why should \nthe Government tell wage earners, people who are making money in the \nAmerican system, what they must do with their income if they want a tax \nbreak? I thought if you were going to give it back, you would give it \nback to them so they can spend it.\n  I will discuss another issue, Mr. Vice President. I don't come today \nto the floor to talk about the case of the schoolgirl in Florida who \nhad to stand for one of her first days of classes this fall because \n$150,000 worth of computers had yet to be unboxed. That is one of the \nstatements made by our Vice President in his debate. It is now, today, \nauthentic, that is not a true statement. The people from that school \nand that school district have denied it. I think by this hour the Gore \ncampaign has said it is a mistake.\n  The Vice President said essentially in his own words that the \nanalysis of his budget from the budget experts who work for this \nSenator, the chairman of the Budget Committee, although they happen to \nwork for me, what they produced as the estimate of the cost of his \nbudget ideas would use up the entire surplus and $700 to $900 billion \nof the Social Security surplus. He said something like, it is not worth \nthe paper.\n  I have analyzed with this same staff many budgets. They have come out \nas right as anyone around. They said before the Vice President put his \nentire package together, that if every single program he advocates \nwould get funded--it is 200 or more new programs--there will be between \n20,000 and 30,000 new Federal employees.\n  Incidentally, when the Vice President takes great credit for \nshrinking the Government and says we have reduced the number of people \nworking for the Government, it would be good to note that 90 percent of \nthe shrinkage of Federal employees is because the military was \nreduced. Between 85 and 90 percent of that entire personnel reduction \nis from military reductions.\n\n  But let's get back to this. That budget staff said there are 200 new \nprograms in the Vice President's ideas for America. They also suggested \nto me it is a new era of big government, excessive government, and \nobviously huge increases in what government will do.\n  I laid that before the Senate in this report. It is as correct today \nas it was then. And, indeed, we have now seen Vice President Gore's \nplan all in one package. They reanalyzed it and said their original \nestimate is right, that he would have to spend the surplus to pay for \nhis entire budget. We will have that report next week in an edition \nsimilar to this one, in which each program is analyzed and we tell the \nAmerican people either the Vice President is suggesting myriad programs \nhe does not intend to do or intends to do less than he said because if \nhe is going to do what he says in his last written proposal, you cannot \ndo those programs without spending all of the surplus and part of--not \nall of it but part of the surplus that belongs to Social Security.\n  I close by saying the Vice President Tuesday night talked a lot about \nthe lockbox. Isn't it amazing that Democrats, including the Vice \nPresident, talk about the lockbox as if they invented it; they pursued \nit; they are the ones who really advocated it and kept it alive. I want \nto say this is one time when Senator Domenici has to say: That is not \ntrue. It came out of the Budget Committee and I was the first Senator \nto suggest it. The proposal I suggested has never been voted on to this \ndate because it is a real lockbox. It really makes it tough to spend \neither Social Security--and if you want to use the same format for \nMedicare, that is fine. But let's get it straight. We have been trying \nto get a lockbox passed up here from our side. Whatever we propose is \neither too strict, too rigid, doesn't have enough flexibility for the \nTreasury Department, or something. But let's make sure everybody \nunderstands we started the idea; we pursued it with great vigor. It is \nnow part, I believe, of what we believe. Whether we get it passed or \nnot, in our form, I believe everybody around here is going to be \nfrightened to death if a Budget Committee says: Hey, this budget is \nspending Social Security surplus money. I believe we have that \ningrained in our minds because the public expects it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Nevada takes the \nfloor, I ask unanimous consent following the Senator from Alabama, \nSenator Durbin be recognized for a half hour in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post features an \narticle entitled ``Iverson's Bad Rap Is Well-Deserved.''\n  It is a story about one of the Nation's high-profile National \nBasketball Association stars who is about to release a rap CD that \nencourages gun violence, degrades women, and blatantly bashes people \nbecause of their sexual orientation. The National Basketball \nAssociation, the Philadelphia 76ers, his team, Mr. Iverson's record \nlabel, his coach, and every fairminded person should condemn this kind \nof so-called entertainment for the trash that it is. Clearly, these are \nnot the kind of messages that one of the NBA's leading and most \ntalented players should be sending to tens of thousands of kids who \nwatch him play and may idolize him.\n  I fully respect Mr. Iverson's first amendment rights, but clearly the \nmessage he is sending encourages violence and implicitly condones it, \nhardly the kind of conduct one would expect from a celebrity whose \nconduct is admired by many of the Nation's youth.\n  What makes this particularly objectionable is the fact that Mr. \nIverson and many of his other incredibly talented colleagues in the NBA \nare specifically marketed by the NBA itself as superheroes to our kids. \nThe NBA is ultimately in a business to make money, and that is fine. \nThey use their stars to promote their teams. But one would hope the NBA \nwould exercise good judgment in choosing the athletes they select to \npromote because many of these athletes use their stardom to, again, \npromote themselves and to use that same kind of marketing appeal. And \nwhen the message, as in this case from Mr. Iverson, is both hateful and \ndangerous and is absorbed by all too many of our Nation's youth, it is \na vicious cycle that the NBA should end immediately.\n\n  The NBA has the power to pick and choose which athletes they are \ngoing to market and promote. They should exercise sound judgment and \ndiscretion before encouraging this kind of promotion and the \nreprehensible message it sends.\n  A few weeks ago I joined with many of our colleagues, both in \ncommittee and on the floor, in condemning some of the media produced in \nHollywood, some of the videos, some of the violence that so often \ninvades the Nation's television audience. We should also condemn this \nkind of conduct as well. When the NBA promotes these\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\nquestionable athletes, they assist them in their quest to become \nwealthy media darlings, and that only helps other media outlets such as \nrecord companies and movie studios to exploit their now already famous \npersonalities. In fact, Mr. Iverson's record company is apparently \nplanning to use the NBA's very well publicized All-Star weekend to \nrelease the uncensored--and one could only conclude even more \nobjectionable--version of his soon-to-be-released CD.\n  Again, it is ultimately going to have to be up to the NBA as to who \nthey promote and market and who they do not. But they need to realize \nif they continue to promote and market athletes who use their league-\nendorsed celebrity to promote or incite violence or the degradation of \nmore than half the Nation's population, they will continue to bear a \ngreat deal of responsibility for the consequences of these actions.\n  I find it somewhat incredible that the Philadelphia 76ers' own coach \nhas said, according to the Washington Post article, that he does not \nhave a problem with Mr. Iverson's CD. That is nothing more than a cheap \ncopout, and the NBA, the Philadelphia 76ers, and his coach should \nimmediately condemn this outrageous, dangerous, and hateful message.\n  Let me give an example of one of the lyrics that is on this CD. Mr. \nIverson says on his CD if someone is ``man enough to pull a gun/Be man \nenough to squeeze it.''\n  In addition, he also advocates the murder of gay men on his new CD.\n  I am told that a wire report has been circulated this afternoon \nindicating that Mr. Iverson has apologized to gay men and to women for \nthe hateful language contained in his CD. I call upon Mr. Iverson to do \nmore than that; to ask, as a responsible American, as a role model, \nwhich he styles himself to be: Let's not issue this CD. Let's recall \nit. That would be the kind of conduct we should ask and expect of Mr. \nIverson.\n  There are many athletes in America who do provide the kind of role \nmodel all Americans can endorse--the Cal Ripkens and the Tiger Woods in \nthe World. These are the kind of people who send a very positive \nmessage about the value of the work ethic and the commitment to \nstandards. All of us admire that kind of conduct. If Mr. Iverson is \ndeemed to be a role model for America's youth, I suggest that the youth \nof America is in serious trouble.\n  Michael Wilbon also had a very interesting response to this subject \nin the Post this morning. I commend it to my colleagues as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Iverson's Bad Rap Is Well-Deserved\n\n                          (By Michael Wilbon)\n\n       Like a lot of other folks who care about basketball, I keep \n     waiting for Allen Iverson to grow up. I keep waiting for him \n     to lift some weights and get stronger so that he can better \n     withstand the pounding he takes. I keep waiting, hoping for \n     him to realize that games are often won at the previous day's \n     practice, which he may or may not have attended. I keep \n     hoping that he is old enough now--25--to understand there's a \n     world of difference between being a great talent and a great \n     player, between somebody who's got game and a champion. I \n     keep waiting for Iverson to understand that the notion of \n     being a role model goes way beyond a lot of people walking \n     around town wearing your jersey.\n       But here we are, at the start of NBA season No. 5, and \n     Iverson seems no closer to getting any of this than he did \n     four years ago. Maybe he's further away. My vigil appears to \n     be in vain.\n       NBA camps have just opened, and Iverson is in the news \n     already, again for the wrong reasons. The story with sizzle \n     is the controversy over a soon-to-be-released rap CD on which \n     Iverson does what the majority of thug rappers do: He \n     demonstrates that he, too, can bash gays, degrade women and \n     talk about shooting somebody. That's the genre. It's pretty \n     clear how this breaks down; if you're under 30 (regardless of \n     race, nationality, gender), chances are overwhelming you're a \n     lot more open to thug rap than if you're over 40. I'm 41, and \n     most rap doesn't speak to me, doesn't move me whatsoever. But \n     I do listen to it enough to know that lyrics Iverson's \n     spewing on ``Non-Fiction'' are fairly common.\n       That doesn't mean people won't be offended, and \n     legitimately so. Iverson's rap on gays, as reported \n     earlier this week in the Philadelphia Inquirer: ``Come to \n     me with faggot tendencies/You'll be sleepin' where the \n     maggots be.'' He also raps, ``Man enough to pull a gun/Be \n     man enough to squeeze it.''\n       This is a young man who in the same breath will tell you he \n     is a role model? Sadly, he is probably right on the mark. And \n     sadly, the hip-hop community seems to get a pass on gay-\n     bashing and misogynist behavior.\n       Given what this kid has been through in his life, and that \n     the present environment existed long before he came along, \n     many of us have extended Iverson the benefit of the doubt. \n     He's about used it up. It's not about his twisted lyrics, \n     specifically. It's about squandering talent, it's about being \n     a self-absorbed egomaniac whose position in the culture isn't \n     nearly as big as he thinks it is. It's about never listening \n     to anyone, and having no regard for anything that doesn't \n     revolve around him and his. Kinda like the very dead \n     Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac, which I'm sure Iverson would take \n     as a compliment.\n       I thought Iverson was getting somewhere when he said \n     earlier this week, ``The whole time I've been in the NBA, I \n     haven't been professional at all. I always looked at it like \n     it was just basketball. This year will definitely be the best \n     season I've had since I've been in the NBA. I owe it to \n     myself and my family and my teammates to be a better player.\n       ``I'm concentrating on basketball. I haven't been working \n     on my game as serious as I should've. I have the raw talent. \n     this is going to be the most important year of my career \n     because all eyes are on me this year. Everybody's wanting to \n     see if I can be the captain, if I can be a leader, if I can \n     be professional besides playing basketball, and if I'm up to \n     the challenge. I'm ready for it because it's something I can \n     do.''\n       But the longer you listen to Iverson, the more you realize \n     he's disconnected from the world we live in, even the world \n     he lives in. The attitude is: I can be late or miss practice \n     whenever I want because I'm Allen Iverson, The Answer, and \n     the team don't have nothin' if it ain't got me. And if you \n     make a big deal out of me cussin' the coach and standing up \n     my teammates and getting fined 50 times in one season, then \n     you must be a punk 'cause I'm tough and you ain't.\n       Iverson is ticked off because the 76ers tried to trade him \n     because he repeatedly is late to practice, if he shows at \n     all. You know what his take is? ``That's embarrassing to hear \n     that an organization is thinking about trading its franchise \n     player because he's tardy to practice.''\n       Of course, it never occurred to him that it ought to be \n     embarrassing for the franchise player to be tardy repeatedly. \n     That wouldn't cross his mind. ``You're going to send me to \n     the worst team in the league?'' he asked incredulous at the \n     possibility of going to the Los Angeles Clippers, apparently \n     unaware that players a whole lot more accomplished than he is \n     (Wilt and Kareem to name two) were traded in their prime.\n       Truth be told, the Clippers don't want Iverson. Several \n     teams have turned down the chance to trade for him and here's \n     why: They're afraid he'll never get with the program--\n     anybody's program. He plays his heart out every time he puts \n     on a uniform. For those 48 minutes, there isn't anything he \n     won't do to win a basketball game. He'll sacrifice his body, \n     he'll do the dirty work some superstars don't want to do. But \n     the great players in any sport know it only starts there. And \n     that's what Iverson hasn't grasped. You know what he said \n     this week about his repeated tardiness, which by the way has \n     angered his teammates?\n       ``Yeah, I was late to practice, but, believe me, [the \n     number of] times that I heard nobody would put up with that. \n     I'm not even brave enough to miss that many practices.''\n       So how many, Allen? ``I don't know; I wasn't counting. \n     Don't nobody complain about the effort I give in a game. \n     [Given the injuries and pounding he takes] it's bad enough I \n     had to come to the game.''\n       Iverson went on to say he was ``hurt hearing some of the \n     things the fans were saying, some of the things people on the \n     coaching staff were saying. I thought a lot of people in this \n     organization were my friends and I found out the hard way \n     that there's no friends in this business besides your \n     teammates.''\n       I guess those would be the teammates for whom he won't come \n     to practice on time. I guess those would be the friends who \n     have begged him for years to get his act together to try to \n     realize there are obligations that come with an $80 million \n     contract. If they're not sucking up to him, they're against \n     him, they don't understand him, they're not as tough as he \n     is.\n       Folks under 30 are tired of people my age wanting Iverson \n     to be Bird or Magic or Jordan, and that's understandable. \n     Different time, different place, the world evolves. But I'm \n     looking at Kevin Garnett now, at Ray Allen, at Tim Duncan, at \n     Shaq and Kobe Bryant. There is a new generation of players \n     trying to be all they can be. And they have fully developed \n     lives outside of basketball.\n       Iverson, meanwhile, raps one thing, but his actions speak \n     even louder. It's everybody else's fault, it's the coach's \n     fault, it's the system's fault. He says he is going to \n     change. It reminds me of Bob Knight saying he was going to \n     change. I'm hoping Iverson is different because he's more \n     than 30 years younger than Knight; he can grow up if he \n     wants. But maybe it's more important for him to talk loud \n     while saying nothing.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, again, let me urge the NBA and the \nPhiladelphia 76ers to step forward and be heard.\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\n They will say: Look, we cannot control Mr. Iverson's conduct. That may \nbe true. But they have an obligation, a responsibility to speak out and \nto condemn such conduct, even if they are unable to control it. So far, \neither they have, by silence, acquiesced, or they have to acknowledge \nthat they find nothing wrong with the CD.\n  I find that both troubling and tragic if that is the standard we are \nto follow.\n  Again, the NBA, the Philadelphia 76ers, and their coach ought to \nspeak out loud and clear and indicate this is not the kind of conduct \nthey expect from one of their star athletes and to be as critical of it \nas I know Americans are in general.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I believe some of our other \ncolleagues have reserved time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nsharing those serious concerns. It was not long ago that a group of us \nwrote the major department stores in the country asking them not to \nsell this violent material to minors, and they responded as good \ncorporate citizens.\n  They said: We have a constitutional right to sell it, but we are not \ngoing to do it. Either we are not going to sell it at all, or we are \ngoing to make sure children produce an ID so we know they are old \nenough to buy the material. I thought that was a good corporate \nresponse.\n  Yes, the NBA may not legally be able to stop this stuff, but they \nought to express their concern about it. The Senator makes a valid \npoint, and I salute him for it.\n  (The remarks of Mr. SESSIONS pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3169 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I address the issue that I would \nlike to speak to this evening, I would first like to acknowledge a \npress conference which was held today, and one which I believe could \nhave some significance across the United States. It was a press \nconference here on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol. In attendance were \nSenators Bill Frist of Tennessee and Senator DeWine of Ohio--both \nRepublican Senators--as well as my Democratic colleague, Senator Carl \nLevin and I.\n  What would bring together two Democrats and two Republicans in rare \nagreement here in the close of a session? It is an issue which, \nfrankly, transcends party and transcends region. It is the issue of \norgan donation in America.\n  Mr. President, 72,000 of our friends and neighbors are sitting by a \ntelephone across America at this very moment waiting for the phone to \nring to be told that there is an organ available to be donated to them \nwhich could save their lives--72,000. In my home State of Illinois, \nthere are 4,500 such people. Sadly, 300 of them will die before they \nreceive the phone call that an organ is available.\n  So last year I joined with Senators Frist, DeWine, Levin, and \nKennedy, and half a dozen other Senators from both sides of the aisle, \nto try to address this on a national basis. We came up with the concept \nthat this Thanksgiving in the year 2000 will be designated ``Give \nThanks, Give Life Week,'' where we will try to alert families across \nAmerica, as they come together for Thanksgiving, that they should take \na few moments of time in that festivity and just perhaps talk to one \nanother privately about their feelings about organ donation.\n  We were lucky to have the endorsement of this effort by the National \nFootball League. At 17 different NFL games on Thanksgiving Week, they \nwill have ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' activities.\n  Today, we had at this gathering on the Capitol lawn, Connie Payton, \nwho is the widow of the great Chicago Bear running back Walter Payton. \nOf course, he died in November of last year from liver disease. He \nmight have been saved by a liver transplant. She has really dedicated \nher life since trying to work for children and for organ donation in \nhis memory.\n  Connie is a wonderful lady who has been on television in public \nservice spots across Illinois with our Secretary of State, Jesse White, \nfor the past 6 or 7 months. She really is well respected for her \nefforts.\n  Joining her were representatives of the National Football League from \nthe Washington Redskins and from the Tennessee Titans. It is going to \nbe a great opportunity across America to use what is a great family \nget-together to remember the very basic: If you want to give thanks, \nyou can give life with an organ donation.\n  So I hope a lot of my colleagues in the other NFL cities will be part \nof this and will participate. In Chicago, we are going to set up tables \nin Soldier Field for those who want organ donation cards and to \nencourage people to sign their driver's licenses. At half time we are \ngoing to bring out a bunch of kids and older folks who successfully \nreceived organ transplants.\n  At this meeting, we had Jon Hochstein, a 5-year-old boy from \nVirginia. He had a heart transplant a year and a half ago, and he looks \nlike he will play in the NFL some day.\n  It is a great miracle, but it can't happen without organ donors. \nThose of us who made that commitment, and have made it known to our \nfamilies, stand at least the possibility to bring a lot of joy to \nfamilies.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois and I came to the House of \nRepresentatives together 18 years ago. I was placed on the Science and \nTechnology Committee, and the first subcommittee I was on was chaired \nby Representative Albert Gore. One of the first hearings that he put \ntogether as chairman of that subcommittee dealt with organ transplants. \nThat was 18 years ago. Maybe the Senator can remember the very noted \nhearing that he held, beginning a discussion on organ transplants.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was at the same hearing.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, do you remember little \nJamie Fisk whom he brought in?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do.\n  Mr. REID. He was yellow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Jaundiced.\n  Mr. REID. He needed a liver transplant. As a result of that hearing, \nJamie Fisk got a liver transplant. It began a discussion in our country \nthat the Senator from Illinois has carried on all these years about why \nwe should be aware of the need for organ transplants.\n  I was not aware the Senator was coming to the floor today to speak \nabout this subject. But my mind returns to that very dramatic hearing \nthat went on for many hours. It was the first of its kind.\n  I would say, in passing, and ask the Senator if he agrees with me, \nthat this is like Al Gore to begin something like this. He is a \nvisionary. And this goes back long before anyone ever anticipated or \nthought that Al Gore would be a Member of the Senate, certainly not \nVice President, and not running for the Presidency.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with you.\n  But I remember it well because I was lucky enough to serve on that \nsame subcommittee. I remember that testimony as if it were yesterday. \nIt was amazing that this issue was brought forward. We have done so \nmuch.\n  Our Republican colleague, who is a medical doctor, Senator Bill \nFrist, was a former heart and lung transplant surgeon. He came down \nhere. He talked about how he used to carry around in his pocket the \nnames of 10 or 12 people who needed an organ donation. He would go \nthrough the hospital to see if there were any families with a loved one \nwho was about to pass away who would even consider that. He said since \nhe stopped that practice a few years ago, the number of organ \ntransplants has been increasing each and every year. But it can't \ncontinue unless there are more donors.\n  I hope this ``Give Thanks, Give Life Week'' around Thanksgiving will \nbecome an annual event. I want to really salute the National Football \nLeague and Paul Tagliabue, the Commissioner, for all the support they \nhave given us. They have at least given it the kind of sendoff we hoped \nto achieve. Connie Payton, who was here the other day; Mark Moseley, \nwho is a former most valuable player in the NFL; Bill Brundage, who was \nalso a lineman for the Washington Redskins--they all came out here to \nendorse the concept.\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\n  Many times, people in sports can come forward and spur a lot of folks \nto take seriously what politicians, such as ourselves, may not be able \nto impress upon them. So this meeting today was a good one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9923-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9923-S9927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TAX CUTS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I also come to the floor today to talk \nabout an issue that came up the other night during the course of the \nPresidential debate. I did a television show last night called \n``Crossfire.'' Some people probably have seen it. It was typical. It \nwas kind of a controlled shouting match, you might say, on \n``Crossfire,'' with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other. \nMary Matalin, who is from Illinois, and has been quite well known for \nher chairmanship of the campaign for George Bush's election as \nPresident, was there representing the Republican side. Of course, we \nhad Bill Press on the Democratic side. We talked about the debate.\n  The interesting thing to me was, the analysis of the debate by these \ncommentators kind of came down to what I consider to be fairly \nsuperficial questions: Did George Bush show disrespect for Al Gore when \nhe brought up the whole question about fundraising? Did Al Gore show \ndisrespect for George Bush when he shrugged or was guilty of audible \nbreathing?\n  I thought to myself at one point, is that as good as it gets in a \nPresidential campaign in America? We can listen to 90 minutes of debate \nand wonder if someone perhaps cleared their throat at the wrong time, \nor shrugged their shoulders, or someone else brought up a word or two \nthat might have crossed the line.\n  I think it is worth a lot more for us to have these debates. I think \nit is important that all of us who are in this business--Republicans \nand Democrats--take it as seriously as the American people want to take \nit.\n  What I hear from people across the country is, we are looking for \npolitical candidates who speak candidly, honestly, openly, and \ntruthfully. Tell us what you believe, even if we might disagree with \nit, so we can draw a conclusion about you, not just our ideas about \nyou.\n  The issue that Al Gore came to the debate to talk about is one which \nwas addressed a few moments ago by our colleague, Senator Pete Domenici \nof New Mexico. I listened carefully because I really respect this man. \nFor years, when I served in the House of Representatives on the Budget \nCommittee, and now on the Senate Budget Committee, I have watched Pete \nDomenici. He has gone after the deficit like a tiger and for years and \nyears was admonishing Congress to cut spending, trying to bring down \nour deficit. He continues in that effort.\n  As a consequence, I wish he were here on the floor. I told him I was \ngoing to bring up this issue. I wish he were here on the floor so we \ncould have a little debate about the proposed tax cuts of the two \ncandidates, Al Gore and George Bush, and the impact it would have on \nAmerica.\n  I think that is the point that Al Gore was trying to make the other \nnight in the debate. There really are two clear choices. Both parties \nare for tax cuts, but they are entirely different approaches. The \nAmerican people get to take their pick whichever they think is best for \nthe future of this country and fairest for the taxpayers.\n  Frankly, I think the choice is very stark and very clear.\n  Let me show you, as an example, this chart, which demonstrates George \nBush's proposal. It is true, we are at the point in our history where \nwe are going to have a surplus; more money coming into the Federal \nTreasury than going out for the next 10 years.\n  The amount of that surplus will be somewhere in the neighborhood of \n$4.8 trillion--a huge amount of money. It sure is a far cry from just a \nfew years back when we had, year after year, deficit after deficit. \nBut, thank goodness, we are now living in an era of projected \nsurpluses. We can start thinking about doing things with that money \nthat will be good for the Nation.\n  The first thing you have to notice out of the $4.8 trillion surplus \nover the next 10 years is we have all agreed--Democrats and \nRepublicans--that $2.6 trillion of the $4.8 trillion will not be \ntouched. That is a surplus in the Social Security funds. We have said \nthat is off limits. Nobody gets to touch the Social Security fund. So \nyou start off with a 10-year surplus of $2.2 trillion, which I have \nindicated on this graph.\n\n  Then we take a look at the projection, first from George Bush, as to \nwhat you might do with that. Well, there will be a surplus as well in \nthe Medicare trust fund, the hospitalization plan for the elderly and \ndisabled, of about $360 billion. We think that should also be off the \ntable. We should not touch it. We know Medicare won't last forever, and \nwe want it to be solvent. So if you take away that amount, you are down \nto $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Then, of course, you take the proposal of George Bush for tax breaks \nof $1.3 trillion, and you find that you have $500 billion left over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Then George Bush has also endorsed other Republican tax breaks, such \nas the estate tax, the marriage penalty tax, the telephone tax, a whole \nvariety of tax breaks which total $940 billion. Now we find ourselves \nin short order in the deficit category again. If you do all these \nthings, you are back in the deficit world.\n  Then take a look at proposals by Governor Bush for additional \nspending on a variety of things--the military, education, whatever it \nhappens to be--$625 billion, and that brings the deficit to a total of \n$1 trillion over the next 10 years. Then there is the proposal by \nGovernor Bush that suggests we should privatize Social Security. That \nwould cost $1.1 trillion. So add that to the $1 trillion, and now you \nhave $2.1 trillion. With added interest costs of these additional debts \nof $400 billion at the end of 10 years, you started off with a $4.8 \ntrillion surplus and now, at the end of it, under the George Bush plan, \nyou have a $2.5 trillion deficit.\n  None of us wants to see a return to those deficits. So the \nalternative which has been proposed on the Democratic side by Vice \nPresident Gore suggests a much more reasonable approach: Start with the \nsame $2.2 trillion, the non-Social Security surplus; protect the \nMedicare trust fund, $1.8 trillion; targeted investments, $530 billion. \nWhat is that for? Additional medical research at the National \nInstitutes of Health, more money for our schools, environmental \nprotection, cleaning up some of the environmental waste sites across \nAmerica. Now add in the prescription drug benefit under Medicare, which \nwe support on the Democratic side. You are now down to $943 billion.\n  Then we bring in our tax cuts, $480 billion worth of tax cuts, which \nI will describe in a few minutes. Then after you have reduced interest, \nyou have a net of $310 billion on the plus side. You are not back in \ndeficit land again. You don't see the red ink on this chart. You are \nstill above the line. You still have a surplus.\n  The Vice President has suggested that we should put this in a rainy \nday fund because, frankly, all of these economic projections are just \nguesses about the future. If we guess wrong, we should have a rainy day \nfund for emergencies. The good news is, as we address this approach, by \nthe year 2012, we will have eliminated, under Vice President Gore's \nproposal, the publicly held national debt in America.\n  What does that mean? It means that the debt being held by folks who \nown treasuries and securities in the Federal Government will have been \nretired. And if that is retired, then it means less competition for \ncapital, lower interest rates, more opportunity for businesses to \nexpand and families to borrow money for mortgages. It also means that \nour kids will not be carrying the burden of the national debt on their \nshoulders. I don't think we can leave our children a better gift. Those \nwho would suggest that a tax cut is a much better deal miss the point.\n\n  The best deal is for us to eliminate the publicly held national debt, \nhave targeted tax cuts, and end up with a surplus at the end. To find \nourselves, as Governor Bush has proposed, running into all of this red \nink from his proposals would be a recipe for disaster. We would not \nonly still have our national debt, we would be adding to it. I don't \nthink that does our kids and grandchildren any good whatsoever.\n  When Al Gore said repeatedly the other night that the Bush tax cut \nspends more for the wealthiest 1 percent than the total that he wants \nto\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\nspend on education, defense, health and prescription drugs, that is \nexactly what the figures show. The tax cuts proposed by George Bush for \nthe wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, $667 billion worth of tax cuts, \nare greater than the investments he wants to make in defense, health \ncare, education, and prescription drug benefits combined. It is his \nchoice. In this business of politics, it is a business of choices. I \nthink it is important for us to reflect for a moment on the \ndistribution of those tax cuts proposed by George Bush.\n  This was a point raised earlier by Senator Domenici. I am sorry that \nwe didn't have a chance to be on the floor together so we could explore \nwhat we are talking about.\n  Who are the people who make the top 1 percent of income in America? \nThey turn out to be folks who make more than $319,000 a year. That is \n$25,000 a month. I don't expect people to hold up their hands if they \nhappen to be in that category. When you talk about those who need a tax \ncut, does it spring to your mind automatically that this is the first \ngroup we should care about, that 40 or 50 percent of all the tax cuts \nought to go to people making over $25,000 a month? Boy, that sure \ndoesn't calculate in my mind.\n  And the Bush tax cut, the average tax cut for those people making \nover $319,000 a year, is $46,000 a year. That is the Bush tax cut for \nthe top 1 percent. You go down to people in the lower income categories \nand you see that it is small change. If you are making less than \n$14,000 a year, George Bush thinks you need a tax cut, too, $42 a year. \nIf you are making less than $24,000 a year, it is up to $187 a year; \nunder $40,000 a year, $453 a year.\n  As you look at this, you have to ask yourself a question: Is it \nreally important for Members of Congress to feel the pain of the \nwealthiest people in America or perhaps to identify with a lot of \nmiddle-income and working families who are struggling with the \nnecessities of life?\n  I come to this job believing that our responsibility isn't to the \nwealthiest. I think they are doing pretty well. America has been pretty \nprosperous for the last 8 years, more economic prosperity than at any \ntime in our history. And it shows. People are living better. They are \nsaving more. They are enjoying a better lifestyle. To think they need a \ntax cut at this moment in our history rather than to eliminate the \nnational debt, rather than to provide tax cuts for people in lower \nincome categories, is beyond me.\n  There are some interesting statistics, too, about what has happened \nto Federal tax rates since Bill Clinton and Al Gore took over. There \nwas a statement made frequently by Governor Bush that he wants to cap \nthe total Federal tax rate at 33.3 percent. He said no one should pay \nmore than a third of their income in Federal taxes. That is an \ninteresting proposal. But as you get into it, this is what it says. Let \nme give you an idea.\n\n  For middle-income families, since the Clinton-Gore administration \ntook office, the total Federal tax rate has dropped to 22.8 percent, \nthe lowest rate since 1978. So telling those folks we are not going to \nlet your taxes go beyond 33.3 percent, they are already doing well. Tax \nrates are coming down. We want to continue to see them come down with \nmore targeted tax cuts. For families with incomes of $24,000, the tax \nrate went from 19.8 percent in 1992 to 14.1 percent in 1999, the lowest \ntax rate since 1968.\n  So when the suggestion is made that the Federal tax rate won't be any \nhigher than a third for anybody, it really goes back to the highest \nincome categories. That is his shorthand version of saying: I want to \ngive a tax cut not to working families but to people at the highest \nincome categories. What George Bush is challenging is basically the \nidea of a progressive income tax, something that we really agreed on \nalmost 80 years ago in America.\n  We said, if you are well off and you are doing better, you should pay \na higher tax rate than people who are struggling to get by. Every \nPresident has gone along with that from the beginning, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike. But the arguments coming from Governor Bush at this \npoint suggest he doesn't believe that. He believes we should reduce the \nrate for the wealthiest people in the country and not provide similar \ntax relief for those who are in lower income categories.\n\n  It would be a virtual windfall, in terms of tax benefits, for some of \nthe wealthiest people in America. Honest to goodness, should we be on \nthe floor of the Senate and in the House dreaming up ways to make Bill \nGates' life more comfortable? I don't think so. How about Donald Trump? \nI think he is doing okay. I watch the way he dresses and his lifestyle. \nI don't think he will need this $46,000 from George Bush. In fact, if \nhe receives it, he may not even notice it.\n  When we talk about tax cuts on the Democratic side, we are talking \nabout things that working families will definitely notice. Let me give \nyou some ideas of the things we have come up with that we think are \ntargeted tax cuts consistent with keeping the economy moving forward \nand helping everybody, not just a few. The Republicans criticized \nthese, but that is what campaigns are about.\n  On the Democratic side we believe the No. 1 concern of working \nfamilies is paying for their children to attend college. You can look \nat kids coming out of college who are $15,000, $20,000 in debt, and \nhigher. Parents wonder, for goodness' sakes, how can we save up enough \nfor this child to be able to go to college. I did a survey in Illinois. \nOver the last 20 years, college tuition in public and private \nuniversities in my State has gone up 200 to 400 percent. So it is \nunderstandable that there would be anxiety among parents as they try to \nthink about how they are going to pay for college.\n  Well, Vice President Gore and the Democrats have suggested that up to \n$12,000 of college tuition and fees should be deductible on your taxes. \nYou can't do that now. We think you should. That would be a helping \nhand to working families who want their kids to go to college and \nacquire the best skills, but they don't want them loaded down with debt \nwhen they graduate. It is simple, straightforward, honest, and popular. \nI have been across my State, which is split down the middle \npolitically. I have yet to run into a crowd that didn't applaud that \nsuggestion. They know, either through their kids or their own life's \nexperience, that this is the sort of thing that works. I went to \nRockford College in Rockford, IL, and I asked them, ``What is the \naverage indebtedness of your graduates upon graduation?'' They said, \n``It's $20,000 after getting out of school.''\n  If the Gore plan for education expense deductions were in place, that \nstudent would graduate with a debt of $4,000 or $5,000, instead of \n$20,000. And if you have accumulated college debt, you will be able to \nclaim a tax credit for the interest that you have to pay on it. So I \nthink that is the kind of targeted tax cut that makes more sense, \nrather than giving Bill Gates $46,000 a year, which he won't even \nnotice.\n  Secondly, a lot of people are concerned about day care. I understand \nnow with a grandson--and Senator Reid and I were talking about our \ngrandkids earlier. I have a 4-year-old grandson, and my daughter and \nson-in-law are concerned about quality day care and the cost of it. We \nwant Alex to have the very best. But it gets expensive. A lot of \nfamilies can't afford the best. So we give a tax credit for day care, \nbut it is not adequate. It doesn't meet the need. A lot of families \nstruggle and worry. They are hoping that the kids they pick up at the \nend of the day will be better off than when they left them, but they \nare never sure.\n\n  Wouldn't it make more sense for us to have a greater tax credit for \nday care? A lot of working families would applaud that. Kids in a \nbetter environment have a better chance to be healthy and safe and to \nsucceed. So that is a targeted tax cut which has been supported by Vice \nPresident Gore and supported on the Democratic side.\n  A third one relates to long-term care. This is one that virtually all \nof us face as our parents get older and need additional attention. We \nmay find, perhaps, that a visiting nurse, or some sort of convalescent \ncare, or assisted living situation is the key for happiness for a \nperson you love very much, a parent who has given you their entire \nlives. But it is expensive, and there are a lot of out-of-pocket \nexpenses involved when a conscientious family cares for an aging parent \nor grandparent.\n  As the Democrats have proposed, I think a tax break for those engaged \nin\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\nlong-term care assistance for their parents and relatives is a sensible \ninvestment. Today, at a town meeting which we have every Thursday--\nSenator Fitzgerald and I--for visitors from Illinois, a young lady \ntalked about her little boy who suffered from autism and how, after all \nof the efforts by the school district and her health insurance, she and \nher husband still had to borrow from relatives and take out of pocket \nto care for their disabled little boy. She said to me: Why in the world \ncan't I get help under the Tax Code for that?\n  I think she is right. Doesn't it make more sense for us to make sure \nthe Tax Code is sensitive to people's real needs in raising their \nfamilies?\n  When these folks are making a sacrifice for their children, shouldn't \nwe be there to help them along? That is the difference. On the \nDemocratic side, we target the tax cuts as I have just described. On \nthe Republican side, they say, no, we think the wealthiest top 1 \npercent in America should get 42.6 percent of the tax breaks; those \nmaking over $300,000 a year should get $46,000 a year in tax breaks. \nAnd, frankly, they disparage our approach as being ``too selective.'' \nWell, it is true; our tax cuts do go for specific purposes, but they \nare purposes with which real families can identify.\n  So when the debate started disintegrating into a question about who \nwas clearing their throat, or shrugging their shoulders, or glaring at \nwhom, I thought there is much more at stake in this election. I hope in \nthe closing weeks of the election--and the Vice Presidential debate is \ntonight, and the Presidential candidates will debate on two more \noccasions in the next few weeks--we can get down to business here. I \nthink there is a clear choice on so many issues.\n  I haven't mentioned prescription drugs, and I would like to do that \nfor a moment. There is such a dramatic difference between the approach \nthat George Bush proposed for prescription drugs and that by proposed \nby Vice President Gore. Did you know the Bush proposal, in the first 4 \nyears, would depend on each State enacting a prescription drug benefit? \nThat's right. Every single State would have to enact the law and do it \ntheir own way. That means just a handful of people will be assisted. In \nIllinois, over a million people might qualify for prescription drug \nhelp, but because of the way the law is written, only 55,000 actually \ndo. It is limited to a certain number of diseases and certain drugs. \nFrankly, that doesn't do the job. As a consequence of that, you will \nhave a lot of people left behind.\n\n  Governor Bush says for 4 years we will let the States take care of \nit, if they want to. Some States already have prescription drug benefit \nplans. Illinois is one of them, but Texas is not. So the State of \nTexas, where he is Governor, hasn't even enacted a prescription drug \nbenefit plan. And now George Bush says we will leave it up to the \nStates and they can show the initiative and leadership when it comes to \nprescription drugs for 4 years. Then, at the end of 4 years, things get \nvery interesting under Governor Bush's plan. It is at that point he \nsays we will take it away from the Governors in the States and put it \nin the loving and caring arms of a group which we know America trusts \nthe most--insurance companies. Insurance companies.\n  So the decisions on the prescription drugs won't be made by doctors, \nnurses, or health care professionals. Once again, they will be made by \nclerks at insurance companies, who will decide which drugs they are \ngoing to put in their formulary, their accepted prescription drugs, and \nwhich ones they will not. They will decide the premiums and how much \nthe copay will be. You will decide on your own how much help you will \nget. If you happen to be making a certain amount of money, you may not \nqualify for any assistance whatsoever. That is the George Bush plan. \nThat is his approach. He says it gives you maximum choice. You get to \npick your own insurance company. What a break. Then your insurance \ncompanies get to pick the drugs which you may be allowed to take.\n  Contrast that with the Democratic plan, supported by Al Gore. He says \nthis ought to be a voluntary universal plan under Medicare. There is \nyour choice. The private insurance companies versus Medicare. That is \nthe choice I think a lot of people don't understand is really before us \nin this Presidential election. Gore believes in a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare that is universal, voluntary, and available for \neverybody. Bush says to first give it to the States, let them work with \nit for a while, and then give it to the insurance companies and let \nthem take it over. That is the choice. It is no choice at all. Under \nthe Gore plan, the Medicare prescription drug benefit plan, your doctor \nwill be prescribing your drugs. Medicare will help you pay for them. \nUnder the Bush plan, the health insurance company will decide which \ndrugs you can apply for and how much you pay in premiums.\n  I don't think that is much of a choice. I think back to 1965 when I \nwas a student. I can remember the debate under Medicare. The \nRepublicans opposed the creation of Medicare. It was Lyndon Johnson's \nidea that they called socialistic, the Great Society, so forth and so \non.\n  Look at where we are today, 35 years later: A health insurance plan \nfor the elderly and disabled which has lengthened the lifespan of \nsenior citizens and which has brought dignity and independence to their \nlives. Medicare is a system they trust. When Al Gore suggests that \nprescription drug benefits should be under Medicare, seniors say: We \nfeel at home with Medicare. We know how it works.\n  Do seniors who voluntarily sign up have to pay a premium? Of course, \nthey pay for Medicare now. It is understandable. They will be making a \nmonthly payment. But look at the peace of mind they buy for $50 a \nmonth. They realize there is a maximum amount they will have to pay \neach year for prescription drugs. If a medical catastrophe comes along, \nthey know they are not out on a limb and unable to fill those \nprescriptions if they need to.\n\n  When it comes to tax cuts and prescription drug benefits, what a \nclear contrast between the two candidates for President of the United \nStates. Elections are about choices.\n  Many of our friends on the Republican side of the aisle, frankly, who \ndidn't have much of an inclination toward these issues are now \ndiscovering these issues. They are now newfound converts to the idea of \nprescription drug benefits. They have come up with a plan, which is \ninteresting, about the reimportation of drugs after they have been sent \noverseas. You know a lot of drugs made in the United States go to other \ncountries and they are sold for a fraction of the cost. The question \nis, can you bring them back into the country, buy them at a fraction of \nthe cost in Canada and Mexico, and bring them back in the United \nStates? I support it.\n  It really shows how far this system has disintegrated when the drug \ncompanies sell drugs in Canada for a fraction of what they cost \nconsumers in the United States, where the drugs were developed with \ntaxpayers' money through the NIH and inspection by the FDA and others.\n  This reimportation of drugs from other countries, as appealing as it \nsounds, can't possibly solve the problem. It is impossible to believe \nthat American drug companies will just be shifting drugs overseas on a \nwholesale basis and expect Americans to import them back into the \nUnited States. At some point, they will slow down the sales overseas \nand they will take control of the situation.\n  The only real answer for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare \nis for the Medicare system to bargain with the drug companies for \nreasonable prices and costs for these drugs. That is really a key issue \nin this campaign and a key difference between the two candidates.\n  I know this is likely to come out tonight in the debate between our \ncolleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, and the former Secretary of Defense, \nMr. Cheney. But I don't believe this is the end of the debate. I think \nit will continue on the Senate and House floor in the closing days and \nweeks of this session. Ultimately, the American people will be the \njudge. We have asked the American people in many polls which approach \nthey prefer, and they say, hands down, that the Democrats understand \nMedicare, understand prescription drug benefits, and understand how to \nbring tax cuts that work for working families so that prosperity is \nthere for everyone and not just a few.\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the chair.)\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator yields, may I ask the \nSenator a question? Did he say the top 1 percent of the people in the \nBush tax cut get almost 50 percent of all the benefits?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator also say there are a number of converts \nduring the last few months on issues that we have developed? Take, for \nexample, the Patients' Bill of Rights. Isn't it true that in this body, \non a straight party-line vote, there was a Patients' Bill of Rights in \nname only? The majority, the Republicans, passed a Patients' Bill of \nRights. But is the Senator aware of what is in the Republicans' \nPatients' Bill of Rights that is good for the American people?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can respond in this regard. I know the Republican so-\ncalled Patients' Bill of Rights was so good that the insurance \ncompanies approved of it and embraced it and endorsed it. Frankly, it \nis supposed to be a law that protects consumers against the excessive \nattitude and conduct of these insurance companies. Excuse me if I am \nskeptical, but this bill is endorsed by the lobby that is supposed to \nbe fighting for the Patients' Bill of Rights. I smell a rat. Maybe I \nshouldn't use that term in light of the political campaign that is \ngoing on. I suggest perhaps that it not a real Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator also aware that a Republican Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, a medical doctor from the State of Iowa, who \nlooked at the bill we passed in the Senate, which the Republicans \npassed over objection, denigrated that bill? I repeat: Is the Senator \naware that a Republican House Member from Iowa who is a medical doctor \nhas stated that the bill passed out of here by the Republicans is bad?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is Congressman Ganske of Iowa. There was a \nbipartisan coalition in the House that endorsed the Democratic bill, \nthe one that really works, the only one endorsed by virtually every \nmedical group in America that understands patients ought to have the \nbenefit of a doctor's judgment, not an insurance company's judgment, \nwhen it comes to critical health care.\n  They have created their own Trojan horse, this phony bill on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Honestly, I think the American people are \ngoing to see through it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois that it is possible to do \nwork around here on a bipartisan fashion. That was demonstrated by \nCongressman Norwood, a Republican, and Congressman Dingell, a Democrat. \nCongressman Dingell is not a medical doctor. It is a good bill. Does \nthe Senator agree?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is a good bill. It is almost identical to the bill the \nDemocrats had in the Senate.\n  I think the Senator from Nevada is also aware that we now have a new \nMember in the Senate from the State of Georgia who is committed to \nsupporting our bill. We are now at a point where we believe that bill \ncould pass.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that we have not been allowed, through \nparliamentary maneuvers over here, to have a vote on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights? But we now have, obviously, a new Member who will vote in \nfavor of it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Republican leadership in the Senate doesn't want to \nallow a vote on the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, almost the \nidentical bill that passed in the House, because they know it would \npass and it would be an embarrassment to them. The Democrats would win \nthat battle. I don't think the people at home care whether the \nDemocrats win or the Republicans win. They want families to win. This \nis an example where families would win, where you could have \nprotection.\n  Let me give an example. I am sure the Senator is well aware of this. \nIf a woman in the course of a pregnancy is going to her obstetrician, \nand because there is a change of insurance companies at her employment, \nshe is asked to go to a different HMO, we provide that she can continue \nwith the same doctor's care, in whom she has confidence, through the \ncompletion of her pregnancy. I think it is common sense and good \nmedical judgment. I think both sides could agree on it. That is part of \nour Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  It says if you are going to the emergency room with a child, you \ndon't have to check in the glove compartment, pull out the insurance \npolicy, and go through it page by page to get the right hospital. It \nsays if somebody at an insurance company makes a wrong decision and you \nlose your life or your health, they can be held accountable, as every \nbusiness and person in America is held accountable.\n  Those are some basics in the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights. The \nRepublican leadership does not want that issue to come to the floor \nbecause they now know we have the votes to pass it. They have blocked \nus every step of the way.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator also aware--which I am certain he is, but I \nwould like to hear his response--that the Democrats' Patients' Bill of \nRights is something unusual as far as this Senator is concerned, \nbecause we have the support of literally every organization in America: \nthe AMA and the American Bar Association? I can't remember these two \norganizations ever agreeing on anything. Virtually the only \norganization that opposes this legislation is a health insurance \ncompany.\n  Does the Senator acknowledge that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is the reason a Patients' Bill of Rights hasn't \npassed in the Senate. It is not a question of what is right and \npopular, what the people want, and what health care professionals say \nwill be best for the future of health care. It is a question of \npolitical muscle. The insurance companies have more political muscle in \nthe Senate. They have stopped us from bringing this bill to the floor \nfor a vote.\n  Shortly we will adjourn and go home with a lot of unfinished \nbusiness. This is one of them. We came this close to doing it, but the \nRepublican leadership said: No, we are not going to allow the Patients' \nBill of Rights to come to the floor for a vote. That is an illustration \nof their insensitivity to what people in this country really care \nabout: good health care. This Congress has not responded to it. In many \nrespects, this Congress couldn't care less. That is sad because it is \nour responsibility, as representatives of the people of the States who \nelect us to listen to their needs and to respond to them. We have been \ntotally unresponsive because of the efforts of the Republican \nleadership.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would also answer this question; it was \nbrought up indirectly by the Senator's last statement. One of the \nthings we have not done here is do something about campaign finance \nreform. As we are talking all over America, there are 30-second and 1-\nminute spots being run by this group, that group, the Democratic Party, \nRepublican Party, and independent groups. The American public is \nbeginning to get almost punch drunk as to who is advertising what.\n  Does the Senator think it would be one of the most important things \nwe could do as a body and as a Congress to get this campaign finance \nproblem under control, such as getting rid of soft money? Does the \nSenator think it would help the body politic to have campaign finance \nreform? We have been prevented from this by the majority.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is right. The efforts of our colleague, \nSenator Russ Feingold, and Republican Senator John McCain are well \ndocumented. Al Gore has said: As President, the first bill we will send \nthe Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform. The first \nbill he will accept is a bipartisan bill to deal with campaign finance \nreform.\n  If we cannot come to grips with the abuses of the campaign finance \nsystem, several things will occur. The special interest groups, which \nrule the corridors of Congress and continue to rule the campaigns, will \nset the agenda; and secondly, many good men and women will continue to \nrefuse to get into this business because they don't want to mess with \nmultimillion-dollar campaigns, these attack ads that come from every \ndirection, and the attacks on personal lives and reputation which have \nbecome so commonplace in negative campaigning.\n  It is interesting to me we have a bill so clearly bipartisan. The \nRepublican Senator, John McCain, was very popular as a Republican \ncandidate for President. In fact, he carried a few States in the \nRepublican Presidential primary. Yet we can't even get that\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\nbill to the floor for a vote in a Senate that is controlled by the \nRepublican Party.\n  I think the American people see through this. I think they understand \nthat this is not a fight over the Bill of Rights, it is a fight over \nthe rights of Americans to be well represented.\n  Mr. REID. I say we need more people like the Presiding Officer. He \nhas joined with us in many bipartisan matters. I hope the conversation \nwe have had today does not in any way reflect upon the Senator from \nOregon, who has worked with us on a number of issues. I am sure it has \ncaused him a problem on the other side of the aisle.\n  The reason I mention that is everyone thinks McCain-Feingold is a \nbipartisan bill, and it is, in the sense that John McCain has stepped \nway forward on this to talk about the need for campaign finance reform. \nBut the people willing to help him on the other side of the aisle, the \nmajority of them, are few and far between.\n  On a number of issues we have talked about today, with rare \nexception, the Senator from Oregon has been willing to join in a \nbipartisan fashion to pass legislation. As my friend from Illinois has \nsaid, it is possible we could do this. All we have to do is what is \nright for the American people and get rid of these very high-pressure \nlobbying efforts--for example, the health insurance industry, which is \npreventing us from moving forward on something like a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At this point, I acknowledge my colleague, Senator \nFitzgerald of Illinois, who also voted for the Patients' Bill of \nRights. He has publicly stated he thinks it is the best approach. I \nthink it takes extraordinary courage sometimes to break from your party \non these issues.\n  The presiding Senator from Oregon has showed exceptional leadership \nand courage on the hate crimes issue. This was not an easy issue, I am \nsure, for him; it was not for any of us. He stood up on that issue. I \nwill remember that for a long time. It was exceptional. We want to make \nsure we continue in that bipartisan spirit. I hope even in the closing \ndays we might reach out and find some bipartisan common ground to deal \nwith some of these important issues.\n  I see some of my colleagues have come to the floor, and they have \nbeen very patient in waiting for me to finish my remarks. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary order before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. Senators are \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am following up on the Presidential \ndebates of the other evening. I was thinking about what Governor Bush \nwas saying about his Medicare plan. He was referring to Vice President \nGore and saying: You are engaging in ``Mediscare''--``Mediscare.'' You \nare trying to scare the seniors.\n  The more I have looked at Governor Bush's Medicare proposal for \nprescription drugs, I have come to the conclusion that if his plan ever \ncomes into effect, the senior citizens in this country ought to be \nscared. They ought to be scared about this.\n  Here is the difference between what Vice President Gore wants in \nterms of prescription drugs and what Governor Bush wants. In my right \nhand I have a Medicare card. Under the prescription drug policies of \nVice President Gore, this is all you need to get your prescription \ndrug. You have a Medicare card, you go to your doctor, he prescribes \nthe drugs, you go to your local pharmacy, and you get your drugs \nfilled. That is all you need--your Medicare card.\n  Under the Bush proposal, which goes out to the States, they have to \npass legislation, and if you make over $14,600 a year, you get nothing. \nSo in order to qualify for prescription drugs under the plan advocated \nby Governor Bush, you would basically have to meet all of the \nrequirements for Medicaid in terms of showing your income, assets, \neverything else.\n  I want to put together the sheaf of papers you would have to fill out \nif you were an elderly person and you wanted to get prescription drugs \nunder the Bush plan. This is what you would fill out. It looks like \nabout 40 pages of paperwork. First of all is the tax return. You have \nto take that in and show them how much you made. Then you have to do \nall the documents, including instructions, applications, certificates, \nestate recovery--of course, if you have some estate and you have some \nassets. There is an insurance questionnaire. This is the type of \npaperwork you would be faced with under the Bush proposal.\n  Under the Gore proposal: One simple Medicare card.\n  I sum it up by saying what the seniors of this country want is \nMedicare; they don't want welfare. That is exactly what Governor Bush \nis proposing in his Medicare prescription drug proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9927-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9927-S9928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JUDGESHIPS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, an issue I will be talking about every day \nis the issue of judgeships and the fact that we still have our judges \nbottled up, especially Bonnie Campbell, who has now been waiting 217 \ndays to be reported out of the committee. Yet we just had some judges \napproved this week who were nominated in July, had their hearing in \nJuly. They were approved. But Bonnie Campbell still sits in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  It is not right, it is not fair to her, it is not fair for our \njudicial system. Bonnie Campbell has all of the qualifications to be a \njudge on the Eighth Circuit. A former attorney general of Iowa, she did \nan outstanding job there. Since 1995, she has been the first and only \ndirector of the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of \nJustice which was created by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. \nAgain, she has done an outstanding job.\n  There has been some good news. During that period of time, domestic \nviolence against women, in fact, has decreased. But the facts are we \nhave a long way to go. In 1998, American women were the victims of \n876,340 acts of domestic violence. Domestic violence accounted for 22 \npercent of violent crimes against women. During those same years, \nchildren under 12 lived in 43 percent of the households where domestic \nviolence occurred.\n  We have to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Last week, the \nHouse passed by 415-3 the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct. Again, I doubt they would have passed it so overwhelmingly if its \nonly person charged with enforcing that law had done a bad job in \nrunning the office. I did not hear one comment on the House floor, nor \nhave I heard one here, that in any way indicates that Bonnie Campbell \ndid not do an outstanding job as head of that office. She did do an \noutstanding job and everyone knows she did. So now we're hearing that \nthe Violence Against Women Act will be attached to something else and \npass the Senate that way.\n\n  Yet perhaps the one person in this country who understands this issue \nand this law better than anyone else is Bonnie J. Campbell, who has \ndirected that office for the last 5 years. We need people on the courts \nand on the bench who understand that law and can apply it fairly across \nour Nation. That is why we need Bonnie Campbell on the Eighth Circuit.\n  Right now we have quite a lack of women serving on our circuit \ncourts. Frankly, the number of women on our circuit courts is \nappalling. We need more women on our circuit courts. And we need to \nconfirm them here. Of the 148 circuit judges, only 33 are women--22 \npercent. That, in itself, is scandalous.\n  Bonnie Campbell should be added to that list.\n  Again, it doesn't seem right that Bonnie Campbell would get a hearing \nback in May and then remain bottled up in Committe. Lets go back to the \npresidential term of George Bush. During that time, every single \ndistrict and circuit nominee who got a hearing--got a vote in \nCommittee. And all but one got a vote on the Senate floor.\n  Yet we are not allowed to vote on Bonnie Campbell's nomination on the \nfloor. So as I said, it is not fair to her. It is not fair to the \njudicial system. It is not fair to the advise and consent clause of the \nConstitution to hold her up.\n  Mr. President, I will again, today, as I will do every day, ask \nunanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary Committee of further \nconsideration of this nomination.\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary \nCommittee from further consideration of the nomination of Bonnie \nCampbell, the nominee for the Eighth Circuit Court, that her nomination \nbe considered by the Senate immediately following the conclusion of \naction on the pending matter, that the debate on the nomination be \nlimited to 2 hours equally divided and a vote on her nomination occur \nimmediately following the use or yielding back of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Is there objection?\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, every day I will come out and ask \nunanimous consent to get Bonnie Campbell's name out of the committee \nand on the floor for a vote. Yet the objections come from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Why, I don't know. As I said, no one has \nsaid she's not qualified. If someone wants to vote against her to be on \nthe Eighth Circuit, that is that Senator's right--obligation, if it is \na vote he or she feels in conscience that he or she must cast. But, \nagain, I say, give her a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to wrap it up in about 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So it only seems fair and right we bring her out here and \nhave a vote. If people want to vote one way or the other, that is fine. \nBut it is not fair, 217 days.\n  I will end my comments again by saying the standard bearer of the \nRepublican Party, Governor Bush of Texas, has stated there ought to be \na 60-day deadline on judge nominations, in other words 60 days from the \nday nominated to the time they get a vote in the Senate. I endorse \nthat. Bonnie Campbell has been sitting there 217 days. Let's bring her \nout for a vote.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9928-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9928-S9930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ECONOMICS\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I will be leaving the \nSenate at the end of my term. I want to put a few thoughts on the \nrecord over the next few days, depending on the time available.\n  I have four grandchildren--three grandsons and one granddaughter--\nRonnie Elam, Brett Elam, Blake Caldwell, and Addison McGillicuddy. The \ncomments I am going to make today really are from the perspective of \nthinking about them and their future and the desire to see that they \nwill grow up in a country and in a world where their opportunities will \nbe equal to, if not better than, those of their parents, their \ngrandparents, and their great-grandparents. I want them to have a \nbetter understanding when they reach that point when they have their \nown families.\n  As people look back on the last several decades of the 20th century, \nI want, at least from my perspective, to be able to put on the record \nwhat I believe happened from both an economic and foreign policy \nperspective, and from a national security perspective. So that is what \nmy comments will reflect today, my thoughts with respect to economics \nprimarily and some that will reflect my feelings with respect to \nnational defense.\n  So I would like to talk about economics, a topic that has been one of \nmy passions as a Member of the Congress. Economic policy was the very \nreason I ran for the House of Representatives back in 1982. As many of \nus may recall, our country remained in a deep recession at the time, \nstill struggling to recover from the economic policies of the 1970s. \nAlthough it was still being phased in, President Reagan's economic \nprogram was under attack by our friends across the aisle. But, to me, \nthe Reagan economic program was a bold reaffirmation of the very \npurpose of America.\n  Many people have noted the happy coincidence that the year 1776 saw \nthe publication of two of the most important documents in world \nhistory, Adam Smith's ``Wealth Of Nations'' and Thomas Jefferson's \nDeclaration of Independence. These works share the theme of freedom. \nSmith made the case for free trade and unfettered markets, as Jefferson \nput in words the concept that government exists to protect individual \nliberty.\n  These documents rebutted, refined, and transcended the prevailing \nviews of 1776 Great Britain. For over a century, these principles held \nfirm and the United States stood tall as a beacon of hope and \nopportunity for people from all points on the globe.\n  Ours was a society without a rigid class structure, a society that \npromised equal opportunity for all based on individual enterprise and \nhard work, not government privileges and connections. America had no \nlarge bureaucracies intruding upon every sphere of commercial life. We \nrelied on the willingness of individuals to shoulder the risk and \nresponsibility that is part and parcel of private enterprise.\n  But this distinctly American way was challenged by two worldwide \ncrises in the 20th century. First came the Great Depression. Although \ngross government mismanagement of the money supply and \ncounterproductive trade policies were the cause of this crisis, \ngovernment was put forward as the cure. This led to the proliferation \nof alphabet agencies seeking to steer every aspect of the American \neconomy, as government assumed a new income redistribution role.\n  The second crisis was the rise of totalitarianism on the European \nContinent. The United States won World War II, but in the process of \nsaving Europe from one brand of tyranny, an equally evil force came to \noccupy half of Europe, and the war effort was used as the justification \nfor price controls and economic intervention that was unprecedented in \nthe United States.\n  The welfare state in America grew by leaps and bounds. Once it was \nconceded that the Government is the guarantor of income, each \nsuccessive call for new and bigger programs became harder and harder to \nresist. At the same time, the consolidation of the Soviet bloc \npresented the largest threat to freedom in human history, presenting \nnew and costly challenges for America as the beacon of freedom. \nExaggerations of Soviet economic success fueled the call for greater \nGovernment involvement in the U.S. economy. Over time, high tax rates \nand regulatory excesses accumulated like barnacles to slow the once \nmighty ship of American private enterprise.\n  It is hard for younger Americans to imagine how bleak our Nation's \nprospects appeared before Reagan assumed the Presidency. Recurrent, \nsimultaneous bouts of high unemployment and high inflation confounded \nmost economists, who viewed the two as a tradeoff. It was thought that \nto reduce unemployment you had to accept inflation and to reduce \ninflation you had to accept higher unemployment. Producers and \nconsumers suffered from an energy crisis. And real household incomes \nwere shrinking as fast as ``bracket creep'' was raising everyone's tax \nbill year after year. The response of the incumbent administration was \nhardly inspiring--ranging from suggesting ``voluntary'' wage and price \ncontrols to preaching that we must learn to live within limits. In \nshort, the American establishment was telling the American people to \naccept the notion that they no longer controlled their own economic \ndestinies.\n  Starting in the 1970s, the media aggressively advanced the notion \npopular in intellectual circles that America's free enterprise system \nwas failing. This view persisted through the 1980s. The best-seller \nlists were crowded with books telling of the decline of America and \npredicting that Japan would be the economic juggernaut of the 21st \ncentury. Even in the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton and Al Gore were \nextolling the virtues of the European economic systems, of social \ndemocracy and industrial planning. We hear echoes of this approach \ntoday, with candidate Al Gore's Government-knows-best mentality. Gore \nproposes to micromanage and fine-tune the economy, social engineering \nthrough tax credits designed to make people behave the way the \nWashington bureaucrats want them to--such as buying ``fuel-efficient'' \neighteen-wheeler trucks.\n  Ronald Reagan's ``Program for Economic Recovery'' was the opposite of \nthe Government planning approach advocated by the critics of \ncapitalism. Reagan rejected the idea that policymakers could fine-tune \nthe economy,\n\n[[Page S9929]]\n\nmuch less control it from Washington. Instead, he sought to establish a \nstable environment conducive to economic growth. This meant getting \ninflation under control, and reducing taxes, regulation, and the size \nand scope of Government. It meant restoring the incentives for working, \nsaving, investing, and succeeding. It meant opening America to the \nbenefits and challenges of international trade.\n  Ronald Reagan's economic principles resonated within me. I had seen \nfirst-hand the obvious connection between the expansion of Government \nand our worsening economic performance. When I started in the banking \nbusiness in 1966, I probably spent 90 to 95 percent of my time engaged \nin activities that I considered productive--designing new services to \nattract business, working to increase the market share and \nprofitability of the bank. The rest involved Government paperwork. By \nthe time I left in 1982, this ratio had completely flipped: I was \nspending 85 to 90 percent of my time trying to figure out how to comply \nwith Government regulations and mandates. There was a constant stream \nof letters from the Government dictating how we should manage our \nbusiness, from the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury, the FDIC, \nand the Federal Reserve, on topics ranging from flood insurance to so-\ncalled truth-in-lending. I remember a letter that went so far as to \ntell us the specific temperatures to set our heating and cooling \nthermostats in our businesses. Some people may have forgotten this \nlevel of Government intrusion.\n  In fact, others may believe it never could happen in a country such \nas America, but it has. It has happened before, and if we are not \nvigilant, it could happen again.\n  I received a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker \ndetailing which types of loans we could and could not make. To make the \nexample, I could lend a family money to add an additional bedroom to \ntheir home. If that same family wanted to add a swimming pool to their \nhome, I was prohibited from making that loan.\n  To some, this may have made sense if you believed that the Government \nshould be managing consumer demand, but that role made no sense to me.\n  With my experience in the banking business, it wasn't hard to \nunderstand why we as a nation were having difficulty competing around \nthe globe, when we had moved so many of our resources away from \nproductive activities and into trying to comply with Government \nregulations. Over the years I had come to realize that all the abstract \nKeynesian theories I was taught in college ignored how the choices and \nincentives of individuals are altered by government interference in the \neconomy. By failing to account for the real world, those theories in \npractice had come pretty close to ruining the economy. But along came \nRonald Reagan, with a common sense approach that went back to basics--\nfree markets, free enterprise, free trade. Here was a man who had \nrecognized that big Government was a detriment to the economy, a man \nwho approached things from the perspective of freedom as opposed to \nGovernment. I shared that perspective and recognized the importance of \nPresident Reagan's election. On election night, November 4, 1980, I \nknew that I had to get involved in this great campaign to restore \nfreedom--but I would have never guessed that, two decades later, I \nwould be standing here in the United States Senate.\n  Ronald Reagan clearly saw that the problem was too much government, \nand the solution was more individual freedom. When he assumed the \nPresidency, we suffered from high inflation and high unemployment. To \ncombat the first, he prescribed reigning in the rapid growth of the \nmoney supply, asking the Fed to minimize the damage to the economy \ncaused by high and volatile inflation. The second problem required deep \ncuts in the high tax rates that were deterring work, saving, and \ninvestment. But the Fed delivered tight money a lot sooner than the \nCongress could deliver the tax cuts, which were phased-in over 3 years. \nThe Fed had overreacted to the stimulus of tax cuts that had not yet \narrived, exacerbating the economic downtown, throwing the budget \nseriously out of balance, and putting the third year of the Reagan tax \nrate reductions in jeopardy.\n  In the recession of the early 1980s, the economic policies of \nPresident Reagan that inspired me to public service came under attack. \nIn the now famous ``Stay the Course'' campaign of 1982, the President's \nparty retained control of the Senate, minimized losses in the House \ndespite the dire economic times, and preserved the Reagan economic \nprogram. We also kept on track President Reagan's defense policies, \nwhich were under attack from short-sighted critics who were unwilling \nto pay the price to ensure our freedom. I am proud that my first \ncampaign was in that fateful year, when President Reagan's detractors \nstood a chance of putting his programs in jeopardy and I was able to \nmake a stand in favor of his programs.\n  As I mentioned, the Reagan economic program was my inspiration to run \nfor office. As a freshman, I cut my teeth in the House by circulating a \nletter vowing support for the President's veto of any bill that \ntampered with the third year of the tax cuts. After I obtained the 146 \nsignatures necessary to sustain a veto, that threat disappeared, and \nthe Kemp-Roth tax cuts were allowed to work. President Reagan's most \ndramatic policy change was without a doubt this supply-side tax cut. It \nseems also inconceivable today that just two decades ago, marginal \nincome tax rates were as high as 70 percent in the United States. It \nwas little wonder that our country was in economic decline, when its \nmost economically productive citizens could keep only a 30 percent \nshare of their additional earnings. These high tax rates not only \ndiscouraged additional work and investment at the margin, but also \nconfiscated capital that could have been used for job creation by the \nprivate sector.\n  By cutting income tax rates by 30 percent across-the-board, Reagan \nrestored a large measure of freedom to the American taxpayer--not just \nthe freedom to spend money that would have been taxed away, but the \nfreedom that results when economic decisions are no longer influenced \nby high tax rates. It was not about the dollars that would have been \ncollected had tax rates stayed high, but the choices that would never \nhave been made because of these high rates--decisions to expand plant \ncapacities or start new businesses, for instance.\n  President Reagan entered the White House with one paramount spending \ngoal: to rebuild our national defense, since national security is the \nmost fundamental responsibility of the Federal Government. He realized \nthat to provide this desperately needed public good, while cutting tax \nrates to unleash the productive forces of the nation, required fiscal \nrestraint in the non-defense portion of the Federal budget.\n  The difficulties that President Reagan had in taming the \ncongressional urge to spend made a balanced budget and tax limitation \namendment to the Constitution one of my top priorities when I entered \nCongress. It also motivated me to be the main House sponsor, along with \nDick Cheney, of the Gramm-Rudman Deficit Reduction Act, which worked \nfor at least a few years to hold spending down. Today, as much as ever, \nI believe some super majority restriction on the ability of Members of \nCongress to spend taxpayers' dollars is necessary. Unless taxes are cut \nto keep the revenues from flowing into Washington, the trillions of \ndollars of surpluses that are projected over the next decade will not \nlast--if the taxes are collected, Congress will spend them.\n  Reagan also initiated a sea change in monetary policy. He did not \nwant the Federal Reserve to manipulate the money supply in an attempt \nto target interest or unemployment rates. All he wanted was price \nstability, the elimination of high levels of inflation from the \neconomy. The Fed should not be responsible for the level of growth in \nthe economy--this is the role of the private sector. The best economic \nenvironment that the Fed can provide is one in which inflation \nexpectations play a small or almost nonexistent role in long-term \nplanning. Reagan's appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, people like \nAlan Greenspan, Preston Martin, Manley Johnson, Martha Seger, and Wayne \nAngell, shared this view and took politics out of monetary policy.\n\n[[Page S9930]]\n\n  Throughout the Reagan years, the loudest and strongest advocate of \nstable prices in the Congress was Jack Kemp. Jack would talk tirelessly \nabout the need for ``a dollar as good as gold,'' and his intellectual \nand political support for this position no doubt influenced President \nReagan's selection of Greenspan as Fed Chairman. Alan Greenspan \ncontinues to hold sway at the Federal Reserve as part of the Reagan \nlegacy, and his record at containing inflation has set a high standard. \nAs a member of the Senate Banking Committee I have attempted to \ninstitutionalize this approach to monetary policy, sponsoring a bill \nthat would make price stability, not economic growth or \n``stabilization,'' the goal of the Federal Reserve. Thanks to the \nmonetary policy initiated by President Reagan, this legislation is now \na safeguard rather than a necessity.\n  The prevailing attitude concerning trade has also shifted, thanks to \nPresident Reagan--who recognized the fallacy of protectionism. In large \npart, this was due to his belief in competition and free enterprise. \nBut his attitude was also shaped by his confidence in America. He was \nneither afraid of foreign competition, nor embarrassed that imports \nmight be preferred over American goods. America, as a nation of \nimmigrants, represents the best that the world can offer. More than any \nconsumer good, the main export of America must be the ideal of \npolitical and economic freedom, an ideal that is undercut by trade \nrestrictions.\n  By signing a free trade agreement with Canada, opening free trade \nnegotiations with Mexico, and proposing the dismantling of agricultural \ntrade barriers in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, Ronald Reagan went on \nthe offensive for trade liberalization. At a time when Japan-bashing \nwas commonplace--when Members of Congress were literally bashing \nJapanese-made electronics into pieces on the steps of the Capitol--\nReagan did not retreat from his basic free-trade principles. The \nremarkable success of U.S. industries from computers, semiconductors, \nsoftware, biotechnology and many others over the past 2 decades has \nvindicated Reagan's belief that American business prospers best in an \nopen and competitive free enterprise environment.\n  Today, principally as a result of the supply-side policies pursued by \nthe Reagan administration, the U.S. economy is healthy. Both inflation \nand unemployment are low. Productivity is growing rapidly and incomes \nare rising.\n  Any doubts that President Reagan is responsible for today's bounty \nshould be dispelled by considering a few fundamental questions. Would \nAmerican economic growth be as robust today if the Federal Government \nstill took 70 cents of every additional dollar of income from our most \nproductive citizens? If the typical family was hit with a 49 percent \nFederal income tax rate on top of an effective payroll tax rate of 14.2 \npercent?\n  Would our economy be so strong if we were still suffering from \ndouble-digit inflation and interest rates, due to the politicized use \nof monetary policy to manipulate consumer demand? If the trend of the \nlast 2 decades were toward managed trade, rather than freer trade? \nWould entrepreneurs and innovators abound if high inflation and high \ntax rates on capital gains slashed the returns to their risk-taking?\n  Would the Soviet Empire have fallen if it had not been for the \nmilitary buildup, diplomatic leadership, and resolute defense of \nfreedom during the presidency of Ronald Reagan? Would our country be as \nsecure as it is today if instead of trading partners, the people of \nEastern and Central Europe were still prisoners of the Soviet bloc? If \nour fellow Americans south of our border were still the potential \nvictims of imported totalitarianism instead of full participants in \nestablished democracies?\n  Our debt to Ronald Reagan reminds me of an exchange mission I once \nwent on, with Tom Foley and Dick Cheney.\n  It was a congressional delegation that went to France in 1985. On \nthat trip, we spent most of our time in Paris. But for the last several \ndays, we went out to the French countryside. I went to a little town \ncalled Le Mans, where I traveled around with my host, Francois, from \nthat district. I learned a lot about what his country was experiencing.\n  At the end of that tour, we did what many of us would refer to as an \nold-fashioned town meeting, where I responded to questions from the \nFrench audience for almost 2 hours. At the end of the period, I asked \nFrancois if it would be all right if I were to ask the audience a \nquestion. And he was gracious in my request, and I asked them: Since I \nam returning to America tomorrow, I would like to be able to tell other \npeople of the State of Florida what you think about our country.\n  The first person stood up and said: ``We think of America as a \ndynamic, growing, thriving, exciting place.'' A second person that \nstood up said basically the same thing. The third person to address me \nwas a fellow who probably was in his late 70's or early 80's. This \nfellow was stooped over, his weight being supported precariously on an \nold, gnarled cane. He came over closer to me, looked me directly in the \neyes, and said: ``You tell the people of America that we will never \nforget that it was the American G.I. who saved our little town. You \ntell them we'll never forget!''\n  Well, I feel that way about Ronald Reagan, my political hero, who \ninspired me to enter politics. America will never forget what President \nReagan did for us. He gave us back our faith and renewed our belief in \nthis country. He gave America back its pride. He rebuilt America's \ndefenses. His economic policies reduced taxes, reduced inflation, \nreduced unemployment. He put America back to work again. He reminded \nAmerica what made us a great nation--our commitment to freedom. And he \nwon the cold war without firing a single shot.\n  The citizens of America and the people of the world will never \nforget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9931-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9931]]\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2000\n\n  Mr. MACK.

GILLIS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the upcoming \nretirement of Mr. Charles A. Gillis, who will retire on October 20, \n2000, as Branch Manager of the Gulfport Branch Office, United States \nSmall Business Administration (SBA). I know that I am joined by the \nentire business community of South Mississippi, Charlie's colleagues at \nthe SBA, and all those who have had the privilege of interacting with \nhim over the years.\n  I especially want to thank Charlie for a long career of completely \ndevoted service to his community, the State of Mississippi, and this \nNation. I have known Charlie for many years and have seen firsthand the \nsubstantial impact his extensive knowledge and business expertise have \nhad on countless small businesses and the local economy of Southern \nMississippi.\n  Charles Gillis' ties to the Gulf Coast run deep, as does his record \nof service and achievement. He is a life-long resident of Harrison \nCounty and a graduate of Gulfport High School. Charlie served in the \nFirst Cavalry Division in Korea in 1951. He received his Bachelor of \nArts in Business Administration from the University of Southern \nMississippi (USM), and later completed additional graduate studies in \nbusiness at the USM-Gulf Park Campus.\n  Prior to serving with the SBA, Charlie was a small business \nentrepreneur in his own right, as owner and operator of Gillis \nFurniture in Gulfport. Moreover, Charlie served as a furniture \nmanufacturers representative with regular travel assignments covering \nfive states. Throughout his private sector career, Charlie honed the \nbusiness skills that later made him such an invaluable public sector \nresource to other small business owners and operators.\n  Charlie began his tenure of service with the SBA in July 1982, and \nhas faithfully served the agency ever since. His service in the SBA's \nGulfport Branch Office is especially important to me since the branch \noffice was created after Hurricane Camille devastated the Mississippi \nGulf Coast and its economy in 1969, and during my service as \nAdministrative Assistant to then Congressman William Colmer.\n  Charlie has been recognized for his continuous dedication to duty and \nhis tireless community spirit. Over the years, he has been chosen as \none of the ``Outstanding Men in America,'' recognized as among the \n``Personalities of the South,'' and selected as ``SBA District Employee \nof the Year.''\n  In addition to personal accolades and longstanding official service, \nCharlie generously has given of his time in many ways to improve his \ncommunity. He served as President of the University of Southern \nMississippi's Alumni Association, as Chairman of the Harrison County \nElection Commission, and as Vice President of Governmental Affairs for \nthe Gulfport Area Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, Charlie is an \nassociate member of Delta Sigma Pi Fraternity, and serves as a Mason, a \nShriner, Rotarian, and a charter member of Trinity United Methodist \nChurch in Gulfport.\n  Charlie's constant professionalism and vast knowledge will be greatly \nmissed by the Small Business Administration, the South Mississippi \nbusiness community and officials at every level of government, who have \nhad the distinct pleasure and benefit of his insight. Whenever called, \nCharlie always responds in a timely and effective manner with \neagerness, efficiency and courtesy. Although I know he will miss daily \ninteractions with his co-workers and colleagues, I also know that \nCharlie, his wife Rose, and their family, will have many opportunities \nto focus their abundance of energy and exemplary community spirit.N O T \nI C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy.

Mr. President, I rise today to express concern and \ndismay over the unwarranted delay of a critical analysis of S. 172, the \nAcid Deposition and Ozone Control Act. This analysis thoroughly \ndocuments the substantial benefits to be achieved, at comparatively \ninsignificant costs, by passing S. 172. Unfortunately, we have received \nthis information only after it is too late to coordinate the bill's \npassage this year.\n  I first asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to analyze \nthe impacts of S. 172 in 1998. Specifically, EPA was asked to calculate \nthe costs and benefits of the legislation with regard to effects on \nhuman health, environment and the business community. EPA completed the \nreport in March, 2000 and submitted it to the Office of Management and \nBudget (OMB) for their review. Unfortunately, OMB withheld the analysis \nfor six months despite the fact that co-sponsors in both the House and \nSenate requested the report's release in letters to Director Jacob Lew. \nWe have EPA's report today because Representative Dan Burton, Chairman \nof the House Committee on Government Reform, was willing to subpoena \nthe report. I am disappointed that this course of events had to occur.\n  Nonetheless, I am quite pleased with the results of EPA's analysis. \nNot only would S. 172 significantly improve visibility and the state of \necosystems sensitive to acid rain and nitrogen loading, but it would \nproduce approximately $60 billion in public health benefits annually \nand save 10,000 lives each year. All this for an additional cost to \nutilities of $3.3 billion. What a tremendous service we could do to \nsociety by simply passing this legislation. If we don't, an epidemic \ncould ensue. For example, according to EPA an DGAO, 43% of the lakes in \nNew York's Adirondack Park will become acidified by 2040 even with the \nreductions mandated by the 1990 Clean Air Amendments.\n  As far back as the 1960s, fisherman in the Adirondacks began to \ncomplain about more than ``the big one that got away.'' Fish, once \nabundant in the pristine, remote Adirondack lakes, were not just \ngetting harder to catch--they were gone.\n  When I entered the Senate in 1977, there was much we needed to learn \nabout acid rain. So I introduced the first Federal legislation to \naddress our ``knowledge deficit'' about acid rain--the Acid \nPrecipitation Act of 1979. My bill was enacted into law as Title VII of \nthe energy Security Act, which Congress passed in June 1980. Title VII \nestablished the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP), \nan interagency program charged with assessing the causes and damages of \nacid deposition, and reporting its findings to Congress. NAPAP spawned \ntremendous academic interest in the subject of acid deposition, and our \nunderstanding of the subject has since developed substantially.\n\n  In 1990, I helped write Title IV of Clean Air Act Amendments, which \nestablished a ``Sulfur Dioxide Allowance Program.'' Its creation \nrepresented a radical departure from the traditional ``command and \ncontrol'' approach to environmental regulation, common at the time. \nThis program was the first national, statutorily-mandated, market-based \napproach to pollution control. It has been immensely successful.\n  We can be proud of these accomplishments, but we have a long way to \ngo yet. Since 1990 we have learned, for instance, that the sulfur \ndioxide (SO2) emissions reductions required under the Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1990 are insufficient to prevent continued damage \nto human health and sensitive ecosystems. NAPAP has reported that \nforests, streams, and rivers in the Front Range of Colorado, the Great \nSmoky Mountains of Tennessee, the San Gabriel and San Bernardino \nMountains of California are also now showing the effects of \nacidification and nitrogen saturation. We have learned that nitrogen \noxides (NOX), which we largely ignored nine years ago, are \nsignificant contributors to our nation's air quality deficiencies. And \nfinally, we have demonstrated that legislation containing regulatory \nflexibility and market incentives is highly effective.\n  S. 172, which I first introduced with Senator D'Amato in 1997, seeks \nto build upon this new body of knowledge, combining the best and most \ncurrent scientific evaluation of our environmental needs with the most \neffective and efficient regulatory framework. Today, S. 172 is \ncosponsored by Senators Schumer, Jeffords, Lieberman, Reed, Dodd, \nKerry, Feinstein, Lautenberg, Kennedy, Boxer, and Wyden. In the House, \nthe bill is sponsored by Representatives Boehlert and Sweeney, and co-\nsponsored by 48 House Members.\n  These are my final days in this great legislative body, and I will \nsurely cherish the accomplishments we have made through the years. \nToday, I ask my friends and colleagues to continue the push to protect \nour nation's public health and environment from critical pollutants \nsuch as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and carbon dioxide. It \nis my understanding that the able Chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Bob Smith, has indeed made this \ncommitment and I commend him for it.\n  As I mentioned before, I am disappointed that the release of \nimportant information regarding the effects of S. 172 was withheld for \nso long. However, now that we have this information, we must act upon \nit and pass legislation that goes beyond our clean air achievements so \nfar. The SO2 Allowance Program established by the Clean Air \nAct Amendments of 1990 has achieved extraordinary benefits at costs \nless than half of initial projections. The efficacy of the approach is \nproven. The science indicates that we did not go far enough. The Acid \nDeposition and Ozone Control Act endeavors to build upon our \naccomplishments, and to begin the work which remains to be done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks and two recent \narticles on this issue be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Poughkeepsie Journal, Sept. 20, 2000]\n\n                       Release Study on Acid Rain\n\n       Why is the government withholding documents that could shed \n     light on how best to deal with the ravages of acid rain?\n       Remarkably, that's the case now involving a federal Office \n     of Management and Budget report. The report likely shows a \n     remedy put forth by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan won't be too \n     financially onerous on the utility industry, a leading cause \n     of acid rain, according to the Adirondack Council. But it \n     would better protect the environment, the environmental group \n     states.\n       Acid rain occurs, in part, when polluting emissions from \n     utility plants are carried in the wind hundreds of miles from \n     their origin, often causing smog. They also can mix with \n     water vapor, falling as the acid rain that kills lakes and \n     aquatic life in the Adirondack and Catskill regions and \n     elsewhere.\n       Council officials express concern the White House is \n     putting the lid on the OMB study because it could show just \n     how ineffective government efforts to curb acid rain have \n     been. It also might demonstrate why more environmental \n     regulations must be imposed on Midwestern utilities in \n     particular, something that won't play well in those states \n     right before the national presidential election.\n       ``OMB is stonewalling while Adirondack lakes continue to \n     die,'' said Timothy Burke, executive director of the council.\n       At issue are Moynihan's suggested changes to a federal \n     program intended to convince power producers to run cleaner \n     generating plants. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency program gives utilities a \n     financial incentive by allowing them to sell pollution \n     credits to other companies. The program has been fairly \n     successful in New York, allowing utilities here to reduce \n     pollution below the federal maximums and then sell unused \n     pollution credits to out-of-state utilities. By purchasing \n     the credits, some utilities can stay within EPA pollution \n     guidelines and avoid huge fines. Thus it's more cost-\n     effective for them to continue to buy the credits rather than \n     make expensive alterations to their plants to cut emissions.\n       Problem is, many of these utilities are located in the \n     Midwest and are believed to be major contributors to acid \n     rain. This year, New York lawmakers took it upon themselves \n     to close the loophole by passing a law prohibiting utilities \n     in this state from selling credits to utilities in the \n     Midwest. But that will only go so far to fight acid rain, \n     unless other Northeastern states follow suit.\n\n                     solution can't wait any longer\n\n       And it's clear dramatic changes are needed soon. Hundreds \n     of Adirondack lakes and streams have been killed by acid \n     rain, and they'll never recover. And for years, \n     environmentalists have projected that 40 percent of the lakes \n     will be dead within 50 years. Most recently, the U.S. General \n     Accounting Office, the independent investigative arm of \n     Congress, said the Adirondacks have been socked\n\n[[Page S9935]]\n\n     with so much acid rain, the fragile mountain soil can no \n     longer soak up the pollutant nitrogen oxide. And that means \n     the nitrogen oxide is flowing into Adirondack lakes at a more \n     rapid rate than previously believed.\n       Moynihan and the rest of the state's congressional \n     delegation are proposing a 50-percent cut in emissions beyond \n     what's called for under the credit allowance program. They \n     would do so by halving the amount of sulfur dioxide that can \n     be produced through the purchase of one pollution credit. \n     Before congressional leaders are willing to consider the \n     measure further, however, they want to know the potential \n     costs of the legislation. Fair enough. The Adirondack Council \n     says the study will show the costs won't be astronomical to \n     the utilities, pointing out they were greatly off base on \n     their projections of how much the original allowance program \n     would cost their businesses.\n       The Office of Management and Budget could shed light on \n     this important matter. But the only way that will happen is \n     if President Clinton shows sufficient political courage to \n     order the study to be released. He should do so immediately.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Albany, New York, Times Union, Oct. 4, 2000]\n\nAcid Rain Bottom Line--A New EPA Study Shows Just How Affordable It Is \n                           To Fight Pollution\n\n       How much would it cost to keep Adirondack lakes from dying \n     from acid rain? How much to spare thousands of Americans who \n     suffer respiratory illnesses caused by the smokestack \n     pollutants that contribute to acid rain? New York Sen. Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan put those questions to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency two years ago, as he and Rep. Sherwood \n     Boehlert, R-Utica, struggled to push through strict new \n     federal limits on emissions of nitrogen and sulfur that drift \n     from power plants in the Mid-west and South and descend on \n     the Northeast, causing health problems in populated areas and \n     killings trees and aquatic life in the Adirondacks and other \n     pristine regions.\n       Now, after an unjustified delay by the Clinton \n     administration that some critics are attributing to election-\n     year politics, the EPA report is finally public, thanks to a \n     subpoena issued by the House Government Reform Committee. And \n     the price tag turns out to be so affordable that any further \n     delay in reducing smokestack pollution is indefensible. The \n     bottom line: $1. That is how little the average household \n     monthly utility bill would rise if the Moynihan-Boehlert bill \n     were law.\n       But time is running short, Congress has only a few days \n     left to conclude its business this year, and there are no \n     encouraging signs that lawmakers will give the Moynihan-\n     Boehlert bill the prompt attention it deserves.\n       But they should. The EPA report not only makes a convincing \n     case for stricter pollution controls, but it also spells out \n     the benefits that the nation--not just the Northeast--stands \n     to reap in return. In a cost-benefit analysis sought by Mr. \n     Moynihan, the EPA pegs the benefits of reducing acid rain at \n     $60 billion, compared with $5 billion that power plants would \n     have to pay to meet the tighter emissions standards. That's a \n     $55 billion payback, as represented in savings on treating \n     chronic bronchitis, reducing emergency room visits for asthma \n     and eliminating 1.5 billion days of lost work each year \n     because of respiratory illnesses. There would be scenic \n     improvements as well as the atmosphere cleared over national \n     treasures like the Adirondacks and the Shenandoah and Great \n     Smoky Mountains national parks.\n       In the Adirondacks, the struggle is a life-and-death one. A \n     recent Times Union series found that without sharp new curbs \n     on acid rain, half of the Adirondack lakes will no longer be \n     able to support aquatic life in 40 years. Already it is too \n     late to save some ponds and lakes that have been contaminated \n     by nitrogen oxide. The pattern will continue unless prompt \n     action is taken. As our series noted, state leaders and the \n     New York congressional delegation have made a strong \n     bipartisan effort to combat the problem. Now it is Congress' \n     turn. No one state can stop acid rain on its own. But \n     Congress can, and should, provide the necessary federal \n     remedy. The EPA has just given 55 billion reasons to act now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9935-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RAIL SERVICE ISSUES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a subject of great \nimportance to our nation and its economy, that is rail transportation.\n  Earlier today, a few of my colleagues expressed views alleging a \nfailure by this Congress for not passing legislation to regulatorily \naddress rail service and shipper problems. As Chairman of the Senate \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I want to set the \nrecord straight concerning the work of the Committee to address service \nand shipper problems.\n  Since becoming Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, the \nCommittee has held no less than six hearings during which rail service \nand shipper issues were addressed. Three were field hearings, one each \nin Montana, North Dakota, and Kansas. Three hearings were conducted \nhere in the Senate at which the topic of rail service dominated the \ntestimony and members' questioning. I also have publicly stated a \nwillingness for the Committee to hold even more hearings.\n  Further, Senator Hutchison, the Chairman of the Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee, and I requested the Surface Transportation \nBoard (STB) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of rail service and \ncompetitive issues. The STB is the federal agency which oversees rail \nservice and other matters. The Board's findings are extremely important \nand they were widely discussed during our Committee hearings last year. \nIn addition, earlier this year the Board announced it would conduct a \nproceeding to change its merger guidelines in recognition of the \ndrastically changed rail industry dynamic that has transformed since \nthe rail deregulation movement of the late 1970's and the 1980's. The \nBoard announced its new guidelines proposal earlier this week and will \nbe taking comments on the proposal through November 17.\n  Three very diverse bills concerning the STB's authorities have been \nintroduced in the Senate and another bill was submitted in the House. \nHowever, to date no consensus on a legislative approach has been \nachieved. I have had the privilege to serve in Congress nearly twenty \nyears and during that time I have learned that significant legislation \nis always the product of careful analysis and bipartisan compromise. \nPending rail legislation and the STB's future will be no exception.\n  My colleagues from North Dakota and West Virginia referred to a \nletter with 277 signatures seeking rail regulatory changes. I am in \nreceipt of that letter. But I am also in receipt of literally hundreds \nof letters--letters from Governors, rail shippers, and others--strongly \nopposing any rail reregulatory efforts.\n  To allege the Senate Commerce Committee doesn't take the issue of \nrail service seriously is a gross misstatement. The fact is, and I will \nrepeat it, there is no consensus. A bill supported by only five members \nis not a solution, but it does allow those sponsors to sound high and \nmighty about their good intentions.\n  In order to pass a bill and send it to the President, we clearly have \na long way to go. But I remain optimistic, and as a deregulator, stand \nready to support any proposal that fairly and safely balances the needs \nof shippers and carriers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9935-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9935-S9936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   POLICE REFORM IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday, an op-ed on police reform in \nNorthern Ireland written by my friend and colleague Senator Kennedy \nappeared in the Washington Post. In that op-ed Senator Kennedy very \nconcisely and eloquently stated why it is so important that meaningful \npolice reform happens in Northern Ireland. As all of our colleagues \nknow full well, Senator Kennedy has worked tirelessly to promote peace \nand reconciliation in Northern Ireland for many years. It has been an \nhonor to work closely with him in that effort and I commend him for his \nleadership on this issue. Needless to say I agree completely with him \nthat the recommendations of the Patten Commission must be fully \nimplemented, to ensure a genuine new beginning for a police force in \nNorthern Ireland that will be acceptable to the Catholic community.\n  I hope and pray that those who are currently playing a role in the \nlegislative process in the British Parliament take time to reflect upon \nthe thoughts expressed in this very important op-ed. I would ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of Senator Kennedy's article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. I would urge all of our \ncolleagues to take a moment to read it when they have the opportunity \nto do so.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 4, 2000]\n\n                     A Police For All in N. Ireland\n\n                         (By Edward M. Kennedy)\n\n       This month Britain's House of Lords will have the \n     opportunity to improve the flawed legislation approved by the \n     House of Commons in July to reform the police force in \n     Northern Ireland and give it the support and respect it needs \n     from the Catholic community.\n\n[[Page S9936]]\n\n       The case for reform is clear. The current force--the Royal \n     Ulster Constabulary (RUC)--is 93 percent Protestant. The vast \n     majority of Catholics, who make up more than 40 percent of \n     the population in Northern Ireland, do not support it because \n     it does not represent them or protect them and has too often \n     failed them.\n       Many Catholics believe the RUC has been involved in a long-\n     standing ``shoot-to-kill'' policy. Questions continue about \n     collusion of the RUC with Protestant paramilitaries in the \n     murder of Patrick Finucane, a defense attorney shot dead in \n     front of his wife and children in 1989. In 1997 RUC officers \n     stood by as Robert Hamill, a young Catholic, was kicked to \n     death by 30 Protestants shouting ``kill him'' and ethnic \n     slurs. The RUC was shamefully inactive when death threats \n     were made against another defense attorney, Rosemary Nelson, \n     who was later murdered when her car was blown up as she drove \n     to work last year. Many other examples could be cited to \n     demonstrate why Catholics distrust the police.\n       Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday agreement presented a \n     historic opportunity to change all that--to reform the police \n     service and make it representative of the entire community. \n     Under the agreement, an independent eight-member \n     international commission was established, led by a former \n     chairman of the British Conservative Party, Christopher \n     Patten. Its mission was to propose an alternative and create \n     a community-oriented, human rights-based police service that \n     Catholics and Protestants alike would be prepared to join. In \n     September 1999, the Patten Commission published its unanimous \n     report containing 175 recommendations for change.\n       The assertion has been made that in the current \n     legislation, the British government will implement 95 percent \n     of the Patten's recommendations. But quantity does not \n     measure quality. In fact, the most significant reforms \n     recommended by the commission are not adequately implemented \n     in the legislation.\n       The commission's task was to balance the desires of each \n     community against what is necessary to create a fair and \n     representative police force. The recommendations of the \n     Patten Commission reflected those compromises. Patten is the \n     compromise. It must not be diluted.\n       Unfortunately, the British government has done just that. \n     It has made unwise concessions to those of the Protestant \n     majority who still view the police as ``theirs,'' and to the \n     police themselves, who have always resisted reform. If the \n     new police service is to succeed, it must represent and be \n     accepted by the community it serves. Catholics must be \n     convinced they should support and join it. Otherwise, the \n     entire Good Friday agreement is in jeopardy.\n       As the legislation is considered by the House of Lords, the \n     British government should propose changes to implement fully \n     the Patten recommendations. Among the most obvious:\n       Name, badge and flag: As Patten recommended, to attract \n     Catholics, the police force should have a neutral name and \n     symbols. The legislation should ensure that the proposed name \n     change to the neutral ``Police Service of Northern Ireland'' \n     is made for all purposes, not just some purposes. The badge \n     should be free of any association with Great Britain or \n     Ireland, and the British flag should no longer fly above \n     police buildings.\n       Oversight Commissioner: Patten recommended the appointment \n     of an oversight commissioner to supervise the implementation \n     of its recommendations. Thomas Constantine, former New York \n     State police chief and former head of the U.S. Drug \n     Enforcement Administration, was recently named oversight \n     commissioner. He should be free to comment on the adequacy of \n     British decisions in implementing the Patten Report--not just \n     oversee the changes made by the government.\n       Accountability: Patten recommended a new policing board to \n     hold the police accountable and an ombudsman to investigate \n     complaints against and wrongdoing by the police. Restrictions \n     on the board's power to initiate inquiries and investigate \n     past complaints should be eliminated, as should the British \n     government's power to interfere in its work. The ombudsman \n     should be able to investigate police policies and practices--\n     not just report on them.\n       On June 15 British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland \n     Peter Mandelson wrote, ``I remain absolutely determined to \n     implement the Patten recommendations and to achieve the \n     effective and representative policing service--accepted in \n     every part of Northern Ireland--that his report aims to \n     secure.'' This determination has yet to be convincingly \n     demonstrated.\n       Full implementation of the recommendations of the Patten \n     Commission is essential to guarantee fair law enforcement and \n     to create a new police service that will have and deserve the \n     trust of all the people of Northern Ireland. It will be a \n     tragedy if this opportunity to achieve a new beginning is \n     lost.\n       The writer is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9936-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PIERRE ELLIOT TRUDEAU\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is often said that Canada and the U.S. \nshare the longest undefended border in the world. While this is \nrepeated so often it has become a cliche, like all cliches, there is a \nfundamental truth in it. In this case, the fundamental truth is a \nstriking geopolitical reality which Americans do not always appreciate. \nThe peace we enjoy in North America is largely a function of this \nborder.\n  With our neighbor to the north, we share a border of approximately \n4,000 miles, a border that runs through New England and the Great \nLakes, through the great forests, plains, and mountains, and along the \nAlaskan frontier of this rich North American continent. Mutually \nrespected sovereignty is the fundamental basis of peaceful \ninternational discourse. But I will add that an undefended border makes \nfor the warmest of relations, and the greatest of respect.\n  Last Thursday, Canada lost perhaps its best known Prime Minister of \nrecent times, when Pierre Elliott Trudeau died, at the age of 80. For \nthe past week, our neighbors to the north have been in mourning, and I \nstand today to pay my respects to the family of former Prime Minister \nTrudeau and to all the citizens of the country he served with singular \ndedication.\n  Mr. Trudeau and I did not share a common political tradition, nor did \nwe share a political ideology. This does not diminish my respect for \nthe man and his work one bit. I note, with appreciation, that one of \nMr. Trudeau's mottos was ``reason before passion,'' a principle I \ncertainly believe conservative lawmakers would share.\n  I admired former Prime Minister Trudeau for his dedication to his \ncountry, to the rule of law, and to the betterment of the world. In his \nmoving tribute at his father's funeral earlier this week, Justin \nTrudeau said, ``My father's fundamental belief never came from a \ntextbook, it stemmed from his deep love and faith in all Canadians.''\n  Pierre Trudeau led Canada at a tumultuous time in its history and in \nthe history of the world. In 1970, he was confronted with a terrorist, \nseparatist threat from Quebecois extremists. Prime Minister Trudeau--\nwho, in Canadian history, was at the time, only its third of Quebecois \ndescent himself--was a dedicated federalist and, even more \nfundamentally, dedicated to the rule of law. He faced down the \nterrorists, and since then issues of separatism have been dealt with at \nthe ballot box. While he successfully defended the rule of law, \nCanadians recognize the advances he instituted to preserve Canada's \nunique cultural diversity.\n  Mr. Trudeau had a different view of geopolitics than did most of the \nAmerican administrations with which he dealt. It is said that he \nsucceeded, at times, in aggravating U.S. presidents from Nixon to \nReagan.\n  Some of this had to do, in my opinion, with the nature of the \nrelationship between our countries. While Canada is the second largest \npolitical land-mass in the world, its population is small, \napproximately one-tenth of ours, and its economy is dwarfed by ours. In \nfact, the former Prime Minister famously said once: ``Living next to \nyou is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how \nfriendly and even-tempered is the beast, one is affected by every \ntwitch and grunt.''\n  While Mr. Trudeau held substantively different views on the world \nthan many American leaders, he demonstrated that policy disputes can \nexist and nations remain civilized and respectful. And that is how I \nthink of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.\n  In closing, I wish to note another story his son, Justin, told at his \nfather's funeral this week. He recounted how, as a child, his father \ntook him one day for lunch at the cafeteria in Ottawa's Parliament. \nThere, young Justin saw a political rival of his father and made a \nchildish crack about him to his dad. His father sternly rebuked him \nand, according to his son, said ``You never attack the person. You may \nbe in total disagreement with the person; however, you shouldn't \ndenigrate him.'' That day, Pierre Trudeau taught his son, who is now a \nteacher, that ``having different opinions from those of another person \nshould in no way stop you from holding them in the greatest respect \npossible as people.''\n  That is the principle of a civilized man, and the practice of a \ncivilized nation. As the world bids adieu to Pierre Trudeau, I extend \nmy deepest condolences to his family and to all the good citizens of \nour great neighbor Canada.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9937-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9937]]\nTHE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL AND THE CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President. I would like to say a few words about the \nInterior Appropriations bill and CARA. The Interior Appropriation is a \ngood bill. CARA is a great bill. CARA brought together a variety of \nsupporters from all parts of the country to develop a program that \nwould provide for wildlife protection, urban parks, green space, \ncoastal impact protection and would guarantee funding for the \ndevelopment of recreation areas for years to come.\n  Elements of CARA have been included in the Interior bill, although \nthe funding for these provisions is paltry by comparison to the House \nand Senate CARA bills. Other provisions may find a home in other \nappropriations packages, but one of the most important elements may be \norphaned in the end. That is the provision for wildlife and habitat \nprotection. Just as we are cheering our success in securing a place for \nwildlife, as we celebrate a growing population of eagles on the Potomac \nRiver, we are failing to fund the programs that make this possible. \nState wildlife agencies have clearly demonstrated their ability to \nbring back populations of threatened and endangered species, such as \nthe pronghorn and the bald eagle. But they lack the resources to repeat \nthe success on thousands of other species.\n  The purpose of CARA was to provide the ounce of prevention that keeps \nspecies from becoming threatened. CARA was to protect both game and \nnongame populations. By providing dependable state based funding we \ncould ensure on-the-ground protection of wildlife, and continued \nmaintenance of habitat for all wild species. It is important to note \nthat there is an educational component in Title III of CARA. We are \nincreasingly becoming an urban nation, and it is important to provide \nan introduction to wild places and wild things to our children. This \nintroduction will help them become the next generation of good land \nstewards.\n  Virginians have come out for CARA. Rarely have I heard from so many \ndifferent groups who support a piece of legislation. I would like to \nsubmit for the Record a list of the Virginia groups who support this \nlegislation and to thank all of the groups for the remarkable job they \nhave done in promoting CARA and the principles of outdoor recreation \nand education. I am highlighting Title III in my remarks simply because \nit is being ignored in the Interior Appropriations bill. But each and \nevery title in CARA was thoughtfully deliberated and negotiated. Rarely \nhave I seen such care taken in developing a bill, and even though \nefforts to allay the concerns of some western Senators were not \nsuccessful, they were genuine, and I hope useful for future \ndiscussions.\n  The Interior bill does provide substantial funding for the Lands \nLegacy program, and this is important. The bill also provides a good \ndeal of funding for Virginia projects that are particularly worthy. But \nwe could have done better, we could have done more.

Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the \nColumbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on \nsensible gun legislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of \nthose who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and \nwe will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following \nare the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year \nago today.\n  October 5, 1999:\n  Norman P. Blasco, 47, Chicago, IL; Guy Colbert, 25, Detroit, MI; \nDaniel Galloway, 39, San Antonio, TX; Justin Eric Googenrand, 23, St. \nPaul, MN; Denise Long, 41, Nashville, TN; Shawndell Mosely, 27, \nMemphis, TN; Donald Roper, 34, Oakland, CA; and Theodore Slater, 87, \nToledo, OH.\n  One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 41-year-old Denise \nLong of Nashville, was shot and killed accidentally by a 22-year-old \nco-worker who pulled out a handgun and dropped it on the floor. Her co-\nworker did not have a permit to carry a handgun. She also did not have \npermission to have the gun at their place of work.\n  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. \nThe deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to \nenact sensible gun legislation now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9937-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9937-S9938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  PNTR\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as a strong advocate for Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations with China, I feel a personal responsibility to \nensure that American companies benefit from this continuing trade \nrelationship. I believe most of my Senate colleagues feel the same way. \nI am confident there will be many success stories, but there are also \nvaluable lessons to be learned from watching U.S. companies that have \ntried to do business thus far.\n  Panda Energy International is one such company. Panda is currently \nbuilding a substantial gas-powered generator in Union County, Arkansas, \nand I have been personally briefed by Panda's officials about their \ndifficulties in China. Panda spent six years developing a power project \nnear Tangshan in Hebei Province. It signed a contract to sell all of \nthe output from the project to the North China Power Group--an arm of \nthe national utility--at a price to be determined by a formula. Armed \nwith this contract, Panda borrowed $155 million needed to construct the \nproject through a public bond offering in the U.S. capital markets. \nConstruction for the project got underway in 1997. The project was \ncompleted late last year, and has been in limbo since that time.\n  The project cannot sell power without formal approval of a tariff, or \nprice for its electricity, by the Tangshan municipal pricing bureau. \nThe Tangshan pricing bureau has been reluctant to assign a tariff that \nwould then set in motion the need to buy additional electricity for the \nregion\n\n[[Page S9938]]\n\nwhere demand has recently diminished. At the same time, Panda Energy is \nin a perilous bind, because it had to mortgage all of its existing \npower plants--two in the United States and one in Nepal--as security to \nguarantee the U.S. bond holders they would be repaid their loans. The \ncompany is on the verge of defaulting on the loans.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I would be pleased to yield to my friend from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I want to associate my self with the concern expressed \nby the Senator from Arkansas. Panda Energy has a major gas-fired co-\ngenerator in northwestern North Carolina. That plant, in Roanoke \nRapids, was the first project completed by this corporation and has \nbeen a significant supplier of electricity to the citizens of my state \nfor the past ten years.\n  I, too, have been briefed about the difficulties Panda has faced in \ntheir effort to improve China's electricity-generating infrastructure. \nThe commitment to approve and issue a formal tariff to the Panda \nProject in Luannan County, that the municipal and provincial \ngovernments agreed to, is not being honored. By failing to honor their \ncommitment to grant a reasonable tariff rate, these governments have \nprecluded the commercial generation of power. If this continues, the \nU.S. bondholders will have no choice but to foreclose on what \nrepresents the first U.S. capital markets power project financing in \nChina.\n  This is a difficult situation for both sides, but the bottom line is \nthat the international trading system breaks down if agreements are not \nhonored, especially for large infrastructure projects like this one \nwith long lead times. People invest money based on these agreements. \nThey put their companies at risk.\n  I would like to yield to my colleague, Senator Kerry, who has been \nworking on this issue for some time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have been aware of this story since July. \nMany of the bonds for this project are held through mutual funds in \nwhich Americans have invested their savings. This is not just a \nquestion of inequity for the U.S. developer of the project but also for \nmillions of Americans who are the bondholders, and many of whom are my \nconstituents.\n  In response to a letter written on August 7 to the Chinese \nambassador, the charge d'affaires indicated that he had met with both \nthe U.S. developer and representatives from the U.S. bondholders, had \nconveyed the concern back home, and would be--quote--making efforts to \nfacilitate a satisfactory solution to this problem--end quote. It has \nnow been almost two months, and we have seen no resolution of this \nproblem, but rather delay and discrimination.\n  I note that the Democratic Leader has joined us, and I would like to \nsuggest to him a report by the Administration, but first I would yield \nthe Floor to my colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not have first hand knowledge of the \nsituation, but it is troubling to hear of U.S. businesses running into \nsuch difficulties. I read the written statement that the U.S. sponsor \nof this project submitted to the Senate Finance Committee last spring.\n  Two things struck me. One is that the mediator split the difference. \nHe split the difference between the price for electricity proposed by \nthe Tangshan pricing bureau and the minimum price that the U.S. \ndeveloper of the project said it needed in order to avoid defaulting on \nthe project debt. The other thing that struck me is, although this was \nno great result for the U.S. developer, all the developer is seeking at \nthis point is to have the mediator's recommendation implemented.\n  I would like to read a paragraph from the statement that the U.S. \nsponsor of the project submitted to the Senate Finance Committee. This \nis the president of the company speaking. ``I am not here to ask you or \nyour colleagues to grant or deny China PNTR status. I am here to relate \na story of how one U.S. company fared when it tried to supply \nelectricity to the Chinese. Unfortunately, we have come to find that \nour experience is not all that uncommon. However, in our case, the \nconsequences are potentially disastrous because Panda had to guarantee \nthe U.S. bondholders that they would be repaid. We feel like the jilted \nbride who entered into a marriage five years ago with the Chinese only \nto find them trying to walk away from the marriage now that the child \nhas been born. This isn't fair.''\n  I agree, and I yield the Floor to the Democratic Leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have discussed this unfortunate \nsituation with several of my colleagues. I believe that it would be \nvery helpful to have the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of \nEnergy undertake a joint analysis of the facts of this situation and \nreport back to the Senate on their discussions with the Chinese \ngovernment within 45 days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9938-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, next Sunday marks the eighty-\nninth birthday of the Republic of China, which now resides in Taiwan. \nThis representative government arose from a revolution against an \narchaic imperial system. In 1911, Chinese patriots ousted\n\n[[Page S9939]]\n\nthe Qing dynasty, and ignited the promise of economic and political \nfreedom for Chinese nationalists throughout the world.\n  National Day, or the shuang shi, is the most important national \nholiday in Taiwan, for it celebrates not only a critical military \nvictory, but a wealth of principles which, to this day, guide the \ngovernance of Taiwan--particularly: resistance to dynastic tyranny, \nembrace of free market enterprise, development of western-style \npolitical institutions, and ultimately, the evolution of a fully \nthriving democratic republic. After repeated set-backs, on October 10, \n1911, the revolutionary Wuch'ang Army successfully launched a revolt \nagainst China's imperial regime. The nationalists would no longer \ntolerate property seizure and suppressed individual rights. Without a \nsupreme sovereign reigning over the country, China plunged into a civil \nwar. Although never truly resolved, this conflict stalemated in 1949, \nwhen Communists expelled Chiang Kai-shek and the nationalists to \npresent-day Taiwan.\n  After emergency martial law was lifted in 1987, the groundwork was \nfinally laid to realize the cardinal objectives of Taiwan's founding \nfather, Sun Yat-sen--to establish a representative Republic of China. \nIn 1992, Taiwan held its first democratic legislative elections, \nfollowed by presidential elections in 1996. In March of this year, \nTaiwan held her second presidential elections, installing a wholly \nindependent, man of the people as the leader of Tawain--Chen Shui-bian. \nThis man embodies the spirit of the new Republic of China on Taiwan. As \nmayor of Taipei, Chen Shui-bian cleaned up the capital city, attacking \norganized crime and other illicit industries. As a political dissident, \nhe stood strong in the face of efforts to muzzle him. In this year's \nelection, he inaugurated a new political order for his people.\n  In addition to Chen's fair elections, Taiwan has much to celebrate. \nAs Taiwan enjoys her various National Day festivities--the huge \nparades, dazzling entertainment, and explosive fireworks displays--let \nus all celebrate the birth of true democracy in Taiwan. We salute our \nfriends on that great island--the people of Taiwan. Please join me in \nsaying to them Shuang shi kwai ler.\n\n\n                    Honoring Our Fallen Firefighters\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, firefighters from across the Nation \nwho died in the line of duty will be remembered during the National \nFallen Firefighters Memorial Weekend on October 7th and 8th at the \nNational Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland. As in years past, the \nNational Fallen Firefighters Foundation and the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency will sponsor the nation's tribute to these valiant \npublic servants.\n  The 106 firefighters to be honored this year include seven \nCalifornians. On behalf of the people of my state, I want to remember \neach of them in turn:\n  Matthew Eric Black, 20, a volunteer with the Lakeport Fire Protection \nDistrict, died on June 23, 1999 when he accidentally came in contact \nwith a downed power line during operations at a grass fire. His older \nbrother is also a firefighter.\n  Stephen Joseph Masto, 28, a career firefighter with the Santa Barbara \nFire Department, died on August 28, 1999 of heatstroke while working as \nan EMT at a wildland fire. He received the Outstanding Cadet Award at \nRio Hondo Fire Academy and received a service award as a volunteer at \nUpland Fire Department.\n  Tom Moore, 38, a career firefighter with the Manteca Fire Department, \ndied on June 16, 1999 after suffering severe trauma in a training tower \nfall. He had served with the department for over 14 years and was a \nwell-known fire service instructor specializing in heavy/confined space \nrescue and hazardous materials.\n  Karen J. Savage, 44, a volunteer firefighter/EMT with Hawkins Bar \nVolunteer Fire Department in Burnt Ranch, died on October 16, 1999 from \ninjuries sustained in a vehicle accident at the scene of a wildland \nfire.\n  Martin Michael Stiles, 40, a California Department of Corrections \ninmate assigned to the Los Angeles County Fire Department Strike Team, \ndied on July 18, 1999 of injuries from a fall while working at a \nwildland fire in Ventura County, California. A San Diego native, he was \ndedicated to wildland firefighting and loved the outdoors.\n  Tracy Dolan Toomey, 52, a 27-year veteran firefighter with the \nOakland Fire Department, died on January 10, 1999 in the collapse of a \nburning building. A Vietnam veteran, he was an avid welder and a member \nof the California Artistic Blacksmith's Association.\n  Edward E. Luttig, 54, a member of the Sacramento Fire Department, \ndied on September 10, 1990 from injuries sustained 23 years earlier \nwhile searching for survivors in an apartment fire. Sacramento \nfirefighters donated their time and money to support Mr. Luttig and his \nfamily during those 23 years. His name is being added to the Memorial \nat the request of his friends and former colleagues.\n  These fallen heroes paid the ultimate price for their devotion to \npublic service and safety. They are an inspiration to us all, as are \nthe men and women who continue to protect Americans from fire and other \nemergencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9939-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9939-S9940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MOTHER KATHARINE DREXEL: A TEACHER TO SOME, A SAINT TO MANY\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of \nMother Katharine Drexel. Born into one of the wealthiest families in \nAmerica in 1858, Mother Katharine turned down a life of privilege to \nstart the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament in 1891. She dedicated her \nlife to building a brighter future for underprivileged African-American \nand Native American children.\n  In honor of her hard work and dedication to the disadvantaged and \ndisenfranchised, on October 1--just 45 years after her death--Pope John \nPaul II canonized Mother Katharine into sainthood, the highest \nrecognition a Catholic can receive. She is the fifth American to reach \nthis honor, and only the second who was born in America.\n  The prestigious Xavier University of Louisiana owes its entire \nexistence to Mother Katharine Drexel. When founded in New Orleans in \n1925, Xavier's mission was to prepare its students for positions of \nleadership. Today, Xavier is widely recognized for sending more \nAfrican-Americans to medical school than any college in America. Its 70 \npercent medical and dental school acceptance rate is almost twice the \nnational average, and 93 percent of those who enter these programs earn \ntheir degree.\n  Xavier also ranks first nationally in the number of African-American \nstudents who earn degrees in biology, physics, pharmacy and the \nphysical sciences. In fact, since 1927 Xavier has graduated nearly 25 \npercent of the black pharmacists practicing in the United States.\n  Thousands of Xavier's graduates are prominent scientists, scholars, \nmusicians, and community leaders in Louisiana and across the country. \nNotable graduates include Department of Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, \nand retired, four-star Air Force General Bernard Randolph, former head \nof the Space and Defense Systems Command.\n  Proof of Mother Katharine's superior works lies in the achievements \nof three of her former students. One of Mother Katharine's students at \nXavier was a young man who shined shoes, but wanted an education. \nToday, Dr. Norman Francis is president of Xavier University and a \nnationally recognized leader in higher education.\n  Another of her former students, Lionel Hampton, found his gift for \nmusic under Mother Katharine's tutelage at Xavier. Hampton later earned \nplatinum and gold records, and became the first African-American to \nplay in the Benny Goodman Band. Hampton joined another jazz great and \nNew Orleanian, Louis Armstrong, to play for Pope Pius XII.\n  Mother Katharine also spread her goodwill elsewhere across the \ncountry. When Marie Allen entered Mother Katharine's St. Michael's \nIndian School in Window Rock, Arizona, she was an impoverished young \nchild who spoke no English. Today, Dr. Marie Allen heads the Navaho \nNation Special Diabetes Program to educate Native Americans about \ndiabetes, a deadly disease that plagues American Indian reservations. \nEven more, over the past 10 years, 90 percent of students graduating \nfrom St. Michael's Indian School have gone to college.\n  These are just three examples of the multitude of students who have \nbeen inspired to greatness by Mother Katharine Drexel. In the midst of \na hostile\n\n[[Page S9940]]\n\nculture, she used kindness and compassion to fight injustice and \nindignities, and in the process forged a brighter future for America's \npoor and underprivileged.\n  When Katharine Drexel died at the age of 97 in 1955, more than 500 of \nher disciples were teaching in 63 schools on American Indian \nreservations and in African-American communities. This is a true \ntestament to her ability to inspire and lead.\n  History is full of truly remarkable people whose individual acts of \nkindness have left an indelible mark on our hearts, our souls and our \nconscience. Mother Katharine Drexel is no different. Her actions are a \ntrue testament to the power of strong religious faith and a moral \nobligation to those less fortunate.\n  On behalf of the thousands of people around the world who have been \ntouched by her work, I pay tribute to the life and work of Mother \nKatharine Drexel. She may have been a teacher to some, but Mother \nKatharine is a saint to many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9940-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Abdellah, RN, Ed.D., Sc.D., FAAN who is currently \nserving as the Dean of the Graduate School of Nursing at the Uniformed \nServices University. Dr. Abdellah will be inducted in the National \nWomen's Hall of Fame this weekend. Founded in 1969, the Hall is a \nnational membership organization in Seneca Falls, New York that honors \nand celebrates the achievements of American women. She will join a list \nof 157 of the most distinguished women in American history, including \nSusan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Helen Keller, Sandra Day O'Connor, Rosa \nParks, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Dr. Abdellah is being recognized and \nhonored for her pioneering work altering nursing theory and practice, \nfor the development of the first tested coronary care unit that saved \nthousands of lives, and for being the first nurse to hold the rank of \nRear Admiral (Upper Half) and the title of Deputy Surgeon General for \nthe United States.\n  Dr. Abdellah is the recipient of 79 professional and academic honors. \nShe holds eleven honorary degrees from universities that have \nrecognized her innovative work in nursing research, in the development \nof the first nurse scientist, as an international expert in health \npolicies, and for making invaluable contributions to the health of our \nnation. She has authored and co-authored more than 150 publications, \nsome of which have been translated into six languages.\n  Dr. Abdellah worked with the Surgeon General in the formation of \nnational health policies related to AIDS, drug addiction, violence, \nsmoking and alcoholism. She developed the first federal training \nprogram for health services researchers, health services administrators \nand geriatric nurse practitioners. Dr. Abdellah has worked with state \nand district nursing associations, serving on many work groups and \ncommittees developing standards of nursing practice, credentialing \nactivities, and providing workshops in nursing research.\n  As part of her international health outreach role as a nurse and \nhealth services consultant, she has been a member of official United \nStates delegations on exchange missions to Russia, Yugoslavia, and \nFrance, and designated as coordinator for nursing for the United \nStates-Argentina Cooperation in Health and Medical Research Project. \nDr. Abdellah has also served as a consultant to the Japanese Nursing \nAssociation on nursing education and research on three separate \noccasions.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Abdellah for many years.

A bill to protect seniors from fraud; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   protecting seniors from fraud act\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise as the author of the Protecting \nSeniors From Fraud Act, a bipartisan bill to prevent fraud against \nseniors.\n  The Protecting Seniors From Fraud Act is extremely important because \nseniors are disproportionately victims of telemarketing and sweepstakes \nfraud. Even though Americans over the age of 50 account for \napproximately 27% of the United States population, they comprise 56% of \nthe ``mooch lists'' used by fraudulent telemarketers. Unfortunately, \nfraudulent telemarketers prey upon the trusting nature of seniors and \nas a result seniors lose approximately $14.8 billion each year.\n  This can be prevented if seniors are educated about their consumer \nrights and are informed about methods that are available to them to \nconfirm the legitimacy of an investment or product. According to a \nnational survey, 70% of older fraud victims say it is difficult to \nidentify when fraud is happening and 40% of older Americans cannot \ndistinguish between a legitimate and a fraudulent telemarketing sales \ncall. There is a need to educate seniors about the dangers of fraud and \nhow to avoid becoming a victim of fraud. As a first step to educate \nseniors in my state of Indiana about fraud prevention, I held a Special \nCommittee on Aging field hearing on protecting seniors from fraud.\n  I heard testimony from two victims of investment scams in which both \nlost a large sum of their retirement. Mrs. Georgeanne MaCurdy lost \nclose to $150,000 and Mr. Owen Saltzgaver lost close to $50,000. Mr. \nSaltzgaver said ``It was a scam from the beginning, I wish I knew,'' \nand Mrs. Georgeanne MaCurdy stated ``It is the first thing I think of \nwhen I get up in the morning and the last thing I think of when I go to \nsleep. I thought I could trust him.''\n  At this hearing I highlighted the Protecting Seniors From Fraud Act. \nThis bill would provide necessary resources to local programs part of \nthe National Association of TRIADs, a community-policing program that \npartners law enforcement agencies with senior volunteers to reduce \ncrime and fraud against the elderly. There are 725 counties with TRIADs \nnationwide. They help more than 16 million seniors. During the field \nhearing, Captain Ed Friend, the leader of the TRIAD program in South \nBend, Indiana, testified about the importance of combating fraud and \nhow the South Bend TRIAD program has been providing seminars to Seniors \non fraud prevention. He made clear that without federal funding TRIADs' \nnationwide efforts would have to cease. The authorization for Federal \nfunding provided in this bill should ensure the continuation of TRIADs' \nefforts. In order to assist TRIAD with those efforts, this bill also \nrequires the Health and Human Services Department to disseminate \ninformation to seniors on fraud prevention through the Area Agencies on \nAging and other existing senior-focused programs.\n  In addition to educating seniors, this bill contains provisions which \nwould include seniors in the crime victimization survey and would \nrequire the United States Attorney General to conduct a study of crimes \ncommitted against seniors. I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on \nthis issue. These provisions would allow Congress to gather more \ninformation on crimes against seniors in order to react with \nappropriate legislative action.\n  Education is one of many steps that needs to be taken to prevent \nfraud. I also introduced the ``Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act'' \nthis year to increase enforcement measures and toughen penalties \nagainst those promoting fraudulent schemes through mass-marketing. \nEducation and tougher penalties will hopefully protect seniors from \nfraud.\n  Protecting seniors from fraud is of growing importance as our \npopulation ages and more seniors save more money for their retirement. \nOur seniors deserve to be informed and their investments deserve to be \nsecure. I urge the Senate to consider this bipartisan legislation and \npass it prior to adjournment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join today with Senators Bayh, Grams, and \nCleland in introducing the ``Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act of \n2000.'' I have been concerned for some time that even as the general \ncrime rate has been declining steadily over the past eight years, the \nrate of crime against the elderly has remained unchanged. That is why I \nintroduced the Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, with Senators Daschle, \nKennedy, and Torricelli over a year ago.\n  The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes one of the titles from \nthe Seniors Safety Act. This title does two things. First, it instructs \nthe Attorney General to conduct a study relating to crimes against \nseniors, so that we can develop a coherent strategy to prevent and \nproperly punish such crimes. Second, it mandates the inclusion of \nseniors in the National Crime Victimization Study. Both of these are \nimportant steps, and they should be made law.\n  The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act also includes important \nproposals for addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, \nespecially fraud\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\ncrimes. In addition to the provisions described above, the bill \nauthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to \nestablish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and educate \nthem about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information about \ntelemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and \nthrough State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions \nthat will help seniors protect themselves against crime.\n  I hope that we can also take the time to consider the rest of the \nSeniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive protections for \nour seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a comprehensive approach \nthat would increase law enforcement's ability to battle telemarketing, \npension, and health care fraud, as well as to police nursing homes with \na record of mistreating their residents. The Justice Department has \nsaid that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of assistance in a number \nof ways.'' I asked Senator Hatch to hold Judiciary Committee hearings \non the bill as long ago as October 1999, and again this past February, \nbut my requests have thus far not been granted. I ask again today for \nhearings on this important and comprehensive proposal.\n  First, the Seniors Safety Act provides additional protections to \nnursing home residents. Nursing homes provide an important service for \nour seniors--indeed, more than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this \nyear will need nursing home care at some point in their lives. Many \nnursing homes do a wonderful job with a very difficult task--this \nlegislation simply looks to protect seniors and their families by \nisolating the bad providers in operation. It does this by giving \nfederal law enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute \noperators of those nursing homes that engage in a pattern of health and \nsafety violations. This authority is all the more important given the \nstudy prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services and \nreported this summer in the New York Times showing that 54 percent of \nAmerican nursing homes fail to meet the Department's ``proposed minimum \nstandard'' for patient care. The study also showed that 92 percent of \nnursing homes have less staff than necessary to provide optimal care.\n  Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from \ntelemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. My \nbill would give the Attorney General the authority to block or \nterminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud \nseniors. If someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can \ntake away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your \nmoney, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their \nphone away. In addition, my proposal would establish a Better Business \nBureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints made \nabout telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors could \nfine out whether the company trying to sell to them over the phone or \nover the Internet has been the subject of complaints or been convinced \nof fraud. Senator Bayh has recently introduced another bill, S. 3025, \nthe Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act, which includes the part of the \nSeniors Safety Act that establishes the clearinghouse for telemarketing \nfraud information.\n  Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who \nhave worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-\nearned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The \nbill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who \ndefraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft \nin connection with employee benefit plans.\n  Fourth and finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law \nenforcement's ability to fight health care fraud. A recent study by the \nNational Institute for Justice reports that many health care fraud \nschemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the \nelderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to \ncomplain or alert law enforcement.'' This legislation gives law \nenforcement the additional investigatory tools it needs to uncover, \ninvestigate, and prosecute health care offenses in both criminal and \ncivil proceedings. It also protects whistle-blowers who alert law \nenforcement officers to examples of health care fraud.\n  In conclusion, I would like to commend Senators Bayh and Cleland for \nworking to take steps to improve the safety and security of America's \nseniors. I call upon my colleagues to pass this bipartisan legislation \nand begin the fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I also \nurge them to consider and pass the Seniors Safety Act. Taken together, \nthese two bills would provide a comprehensive approach toward giving \nlaw enforcement and older Americans the tools they need to prevent \ncrime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 3165. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to make corrections \nand refinements in the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP health insurance \nprograms, as revised by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, \nand for other purposes; read the first time.\n\n\n         Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Improvements Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join Senator \nMoynihan and my other colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee in \nintroducing the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Improvements Act of 2000. \nThis is important, bipartisan legislation intended to address needed \nhealth care funding and other improvements in these programs that are \nso important to millions of Americans. Every year on the Finance \nCommittee we maintain watchful oversight of these critical programs to \nmake sure that beneficiary access to services is maintained, and that \npayments and benefits are adjusted to meet beneficiaries' needs. This \nbill would add about $28 billion in funds to these programs over the \nnext five years. Following are some of the highlights of this \nlegislation.\n  (1) Medicare beneficiary assistance provisions would reduce \ncoinsurance liability for hospital outpatient services; improve access \nto Medigap coverage; permit Medicare+Choice plans to give beneficiaries \ncash rebates of Part B premiums; protect access to immunosuppressive, \ncancer, hemophilia and other drugs, and extend Part B premium \nassistance for lower-income beneficiaries.\n  (2) Preventive health benefits would expand existing or add new \ncoverage for pap smears, colorectal cancer screening, and nutrition \ntherapy, and request further work on effective preventive benefits for \nlater consideration in Medicare.\n  (3) Rural health care improvements address service capacity and \naccess to services through increased payments for critical access, \nsole-community and Medicare-dependent hospitals. The package also \nincludes provisions for rural health clinics, ambulance services, and \ntelemedicine. Rural hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home \nhealth agencies also benefit from general financing improvements \ndetailed in other sections.\n  (4) Medicare+Choice provisions stabilize and improve funding for \nbeneficiaries electing to enroll in privately-offered Medicare+Choice \nplans, with special attention to rural communities; restore funding for \nbeneficiary education campaigns; and provide additional assistance for \nfrail, disabled and rural beneficiaries.\n  (5) Hospital funding improvements increase annual payment updates; \nimprove disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments under Medicare \nand Medicaid for providing uncompensated care to uninsured patients; \nreform Medicare's DSH program to reduce disparities in the treatment of \nrural and urban hospitals; add funding for rehabilition hospitals; and \nprotect payments for teaching hospitals.\n  (6) Skilled nursing facility (SNF) provisions improve funding, \nmaintain access to therapy services, and reduce regulatory burdens by \ndelaying implementation of consolidated billing.\n  (7) Home health and hospice provisions protect funding for home \nhealth services by delaying a scheduled 15% cut in payments; increasing \nfunding for high-cost outlier cases, and making special temporary \npayments to rural agencies. Hospice provisions improve funding, require \nresearch on issues related to eligibility for the benefit and\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\nestablish a hospice demonstration program.\n  (8) Dialysis and durable medical equipment (DME) provisions improve \npayments for DME for all Medicare beneficiaries, and for services \nreceived by individuals with end-stage renal disease, as well as \nenhancing their opportunities to participate in the Medicare+Choice \nprogram.\n  (9) Additional provisions address physician, laboratory, ambulatory \nsurgery center and other medical services. The package also creates a \nJoint Committee on Health Care Financing to provide professional \nsupport to the Congress in addressing the burgeoning cost and \nlegislative complexity of the Medicare, Medicaid and State Children's \nHealth Insurance programs and monitoring the viability of safety net \nproviders.\n  (10) Medicaid and SCHIP provisions improve the financing of and \naccess to services provided by federally qualified health centers and \nrural health clinics; establish policies for the retention and \nredistribution of unspent SCHIP funds; increase authorization for the \nMaternal and Child Health Block Grant; and add funding for special \ndiabetes programs for children and Native Americans.\n  I would like to accomplish even more this year, especially in the \nMedicare program. For instance, I remain committed to securing \ncomprehensive drug benefits for the aged and disabled beneficiaries in \nMedicare. I will continue to work towards that goal. However, I am \npleased that we were able to achieve bipartisan support for these \nimprovements and I will continue my efforts to build the bipartisan \nconsensus needed to proceed on larger Medicare reforms in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Roth, \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, in sponsoring the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Improvement Act of 2000.\n  As part of the effort to balance the Federal Budget, the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 (BBA) provided for reduction in Medicare payments \nfor medical services. At the time of enactment, the Congressional \nBudget Office (CBO) estimated that these provisions would reduce \nMedicare outlays by $112 billion over 5 years. We now know that these \nBBA cuts have been much larger than originally anticipated--some argue \ntwice as large, although it's difficult to determine this with any \nprecision.\n  Hospital industry representatives and other providers of health care \nservices have asserted that the magnitude of the reductions are having \nunintended consequences which are seriously impacting the quantity and \nquality of health care services available to our citizens.\n  Last year, the Congress addressed some of those unintended \nconsequences, by enacting the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA), \nwhich added back $16 billion over 5 years in payments to various \nMedicare providers, including: Teaching Hospitals; Hospital Outpatient \nDepartments; Medicare HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations); Skilled \nNursing Facilities; Rural Health Providers; and Home Health Agencies.\n  However, Members of Congress are continuing to hear from providers \nwho argue that the 1997 reductions are still having serious \nunanticipated consequences.\n  To respond to these continuing problems, the President last June \nproposed additional BBA relief in the amount of $21 billion over the \nnext 5 years. On September 20, Senator Daschle and I, along with 32 of \nour Democratic colleagues, introduced a similar, but more substantial, \nBBA relief package that would provide about $40 billion over 5 years in \nrelief to health care providers and beneficiaries. Today, along with \nSenator Roth, I am pleased to be cosponsoring a bipartisan BBA relief \nbill to provider about $28 billion in relief over 5 years.\n  I want, in particular, to highlight that this legislation would--for \nfiscal years 2001 and 2002--prevent further reductions in the special \nMedicare payments to our Nation's teaching hospitals. A little \nbackground is in order.\n  Medicare provides support to our Nation's teaching hospitals by \nadjusting its payments upward to reflect Medicare's share of costs \nassociated with care provided by medical residents. This is \naccomplished under two mechanisms: direct graduate medical education \n(direct GME) payments; and indirect medical education (IME) \nadjustments. Direct GME costs include items such as salaries of \nresidents, interns, and faculty and overhead costs for classroom \ntraining. The separate IME adjustment was established in 1983 and \npertains to residency training costs that are not directly attributable \nto medical education expenses, but are nevertheless associated with \nteaching activities and the teaching hospital's research mission--for \nexample, extra demands placed on hospital staff, additional tests \nordered by residents, and increased use of diagnostic testing and \nadvanced technology. Prior to the BBA, the IME adjustment increased \nMedicare's hospital payments by approximately 7.7 percent for each 10 \npercent increase in a hospital's ratio of interns and residents to \nhospital beds.\n  The BBA included a reduction in the IME adjustment from the previous \n7.7 percent to 7.0 percent in FY 1998; to 6.5 percent in FY 1999; to \n6.0 percent in FY 2000; and to 5.5 percent in FY 2001 and subsequent \nyears. In my judgment, these cuts would have seriously impaired the \ncutting edge research conducted by teaching hospitals, as well as \nimpaired their ability to train doctors and to serve so many of our \nnation's indigent.\n  Last year, in the BBRA, we mitigated the scheduled reduction in FY \n2000--freezing the IME adjustment at 6.5 percent; and the IME \nadjustment was set at 6.25 percent for FY 2001, and 5.5 percent \nthereafter. The package we are introducing today, would restore $600 \nmillion in funds for FY 2001 and FY 2002 by setting the IME adjustment \nat 6.5 percent in both years. The IME adjustment would then fall to 5.5 \npercent thereafter--a reduction which I had hoped to cancel this year, \nand sincerely hope the congress will cancel in future legislation.\n  I have stood before my colleagues on countless occasions to bring \nattention to the financial plight of medical schools and teaching \nhospitals. Yet, I regret that the fate of the 144 accredited medical \nschools and 1416 graduate medical education teaching institutions still \nremains uncertain. The proposals in this bill will provide critically \nneeded financing--at least in the short-run.\n  In the long-run, however, we need to restructure the financing of \ngraduate medical education along the lines I have proposed in the \nGraduate Medical Education Trust fund Act (S. 210). What is needed is \nexplicit and dedicated funding for these institutions, which will \nensure that the United States continues to lead the world in this era \nof medical discovery. The Graduate Medical Education Trust Fund Act \nwould require that the public sector, through the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, and the private sector through an assessment on health \ninsurance premiums, provide broad-based financial support for graduate \nmedical education. S. 210 would roughly double current funding levels \nfor Graduate Medical Education and would establish a Medical Education \nAdvisory Commission to make recommendations on the operation of the \nMedical Education Trust Fund, on alternative payment sources for \nfunding graduate medical education and teaching hospitals, and on \npolicies designed to maintain superior research and educational \ncapacities.\n  In addition to restoring much needed funding to our Nation's teaching \nhospitals for the next two years, this bill would add back funding in \nmany vital areas of health care. Key provisions of the bill we are \nintroducing today would: provide full market basket (inflation) \nadjustments to hospitals for 2001 and 2002; target additional relief to \nrural hospitals; reduce cuts in payments to hospitals for handling \nlarge numbers of low-income patients (referred to as ``disproportionate \nshare (DSH) hospital payments''); delay the scheduled 15 percent cut in \npayments to home health agencies; improve funding for skilled nursing \nfacilities; and assist beneficiaries through preventive benefits and \nsmaller coinsurance payments.\n  Let me close by again complimenting Senator Roth on developing this \nbill on a bipartisan basis and expressing my hope that the forthcoming \ninformation negotiations with committees of the House will be similarly \nconducted on a bipartisan basis.\n\n[[Page S9948]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 3166. A bill to amend the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 to provide \nindividual federal agencies and the executive branch as a whole with \nincreased incentives to use the share-in-savings program under that \nAct, to ease the use of such program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\ninformation technology share-in-savings program improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing a bill designed to \nlower the cost of the government's information technology systems and \nimprove how those systems serve our citizens by encouraging greater use \nof a ``share-in-savings'' approach to contracting for information \ntechnology (IT).\n  Under a share-in-savings approach, the government contracts with a \ncompany to provide an improved, lower cost IT service and the company \npays the up-front costs of the project, which is not the usual \npractice. In return, the contractor gets paid a portion of the money \nsaved by the government under the new arrangement. Essentially, the \ncontractor bears the capital costs needed for the government to save \nsome money and has a strong incentive to decrease the government's \ncosts because they get paid a portion of any savings.\n  Although this approach to IT contracting is authorized as a pilot \nprogram under the Clinger-Cohen Act, I understand the executive branch \nhas not made much use of this approach to date. Hence, I believe there \nare opportunities for greater creativity in this area if we give the \nagencies greater incentives.\n  Basically, my bill does three things. First, and most importantly, it \ngives agencies an incentive to try a share-in-savings approach by \nletting them keep up to half the government's net savings to use for \nadditional IT projects, rather than having all the net savings going \nback to the Treasury. It's just human nature that if you ask someone to \ndo something risky--like a new IT system--but all the benefits go \nelsewhere, they're not going to be very inclined to do it. That is, \nunless they get to keep some of the benefits to improve their own \noperations--which is what this bill let's them do. The point here is \nthat the more agency managers actually are willing to use this \napproach, the more money the taxpayer will save in the long run.\n\n  There's precedent for this with regard to certain Energy Savings \nPerformance Contracts. Under a provision applicable to the Department \nof Defense, local base commanders can keep a portion of the savings \nfrom those contracts to purchase more energy saving equipment or even \nfor morale and recreation purposes.\n  Second, my bill gives the executive branch as a whole an incentive to \ntry share-in-savings contracting for IT by allowing the pilot program \nto graduate to a regular authority once a significant number of \nprojects have been done, the approach has been found to be useful, and \nguidance on how to use the authority has been issued. This gives the \ntop levels of the executive branch a goal to push toward.\n  Finally, my bill will ease implementation of share-in-savings \ncontracting by allowing agency program managers to approve the \nprojects, thereby giving them greater autonomy and streamlining the \nselection process. Currently, share-in-savings IT projects must be \napproved by the Administrator of Federal Procurement, a very high level \nin the executive branch.\n  In sum, my bill will encourage greater use of the share-in-savings \napproach to IT contracting under the Clinger-Cohen Act by giving the \nagencies a portion of the savings to reinvest; the executive branch a \ngoal; and the program managers more autonomy.\n\n  I had originally planned to introduce this as an amendment to the \nTreasury, Postal Appropriations bill. But, because it doesn't look like \nwe'll have a chance to really debate that bill this year, I've decided \nto introduce this bill today to get my proposal before the Senate.\n  Now, to give some credit where credit is due, I got interested in \nthis topic because of a piece I saw in Roll Call on E-Government by \nPatricia McGinnis of the Council for Excellence in Government. In it \nshe mentioned the idea of letting agencies retain some of the IT \nsavings they achieve in order to reinvest it in more IT.\n  I also understand that the Governmental Affairs Committee recently \nput up a web site to discuss potential e-government policies and \nlegislation. And, I was glad to learn that the share-in-savings \napproach to IT is one of its topics.\n  So, I hope the Governmental Affairs committee will take a thorough \nlook at the ideas in my bill. I look forward to working with them to \nfind new ways to save the taxpayer money while improving the services \nthey are provided.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill and a \nletter from Ms. McGinnis in support of the amendment I'd planned be \nincluded in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We agree that making greater use \n     of ``share-in-savings'' projects will lead to successful \n     public-private joint ventures that can produce savings for \n     the agencies and better results for the American people.\n       In particular, we think the approach to encouraging greater \n     use of ``share-in-savings'' partnerships embodied in your \n     planned amendment to this year's Treasury and General \n     Government appropriations bill--allowing agencies to retain \n     some of the savings, and the pilots to easily graduate to a \n     regular authority--deserves serious consideration by \n     Congress.\n       As you move forward, you may also want to look at the work \n     of the General Service Administration's (GSA) Federal \n     Technology Center. Ken Buck, Director of Business \n     Innovations, Office of the Commissioner at GSA, is very \n     knowledgeable about the successful methods of contracting and \n     procurement using this approach.\n       In fact, the Council is working with GSA to develop case \n     studies of best practices using share-in-savings methods for \n     use by federal agencies. We will share that work with you as \n     soon as it is available.\n       Again, thanks for your leadership on this very important \n     issue, which will not only promote e-government but also \n     excellence in government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patricia McGinnis,\n                                                President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3167.

Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator \nBingaman to introduce the ``Physician Recruitment and Retention Act of \n2000.''\n  Almost like clockwork one can pick up an Albuquerque newspaper and \nread about the shortage of physicians in New Mexico and the resulting \nproblems. When individuals have difficulty receiving adequate medical \ntreatment, action must be taken.\n  For example, in Albuquerque an urban area of almost 700,000 there are \nonly two neurosurgeons besides the five practicing at the University of \nNew Mexico. Such a ratio can only cause one thing, severe difficulties \nfor patients. Thus, a patient recently waited eighteen hours in an \nAlbuquerque emergency room before seeing a neurosurgeon.\n  I would ask my colleagues the following: what good are hospitals \nfilled with the latest technology if there are not enough doctors? And \nwhat good are modern medical offices if there are not enough doctors to \ntreat the patients in a timely manner?\n  The problem I have just described is not just occurring in New \nMexico, rather other states are experiencing similar problems because \nof a common set of problems. I would submit the combination of high \nlevels of poverty and low Medicare reimbursement rates causes a twofold \nproblem.\n  First, patients often have difficulty obtaining timely care and \nsecond, states cannot effectively recruit and retain their physicians. \nOur Bill builds upon the simple proposition that if Medicare Physician \nreimbursement rates are raised, patients will be the ultimate \nbeneficiaries.\n  The Bill we are introducing creates a two state demonstration program \nto address these problems by increasing Medicare Physician \nreimbursements by 5 percent for a period of three years if certain \ncriteria are met.\n  The Bill also authorizes a GAO study to determine whether: (1) \npatient access to care and the ability of states to recruit and retain \nphysicians is adversely impacted when the enumerated factors in the \nprevious section are present; and (2) increased Medicare Physician \nreimbursements improve patient access to care and the ability of states \nto recruit and retain physicians.\n  Thank you and I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator \nBingaman, on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate any limitation on indictment for sexual \noffenses and make awards to State to reduce their DNA casework \nbacklogs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 Sexual assault Prosecution act of 2000\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sexual \nAssault Prosecution act of 2000. This legislation will ensure that no \nrapist will evade prosecution when there is reliable evidence of their \nguilt.\n  As the law is written today, a rapist can walk away scot-free if they \nare not charged within five years of committing their crime. This is \ntrue when if overwhelming evidence of the offender's guilt, such as a \nDNA match with evidence taken from the crime scene, is later \ndiscovered. Some states, including my home state of New Jersey, have \nrecognized the injustice presented by this situation and have already \nabolished their statutes of limitations on sexual assault crimes, and \nmany other states are considering similar measures. Given the power and \nprecision of DNA evidence, it is now time that the federal government \nabolish the current statute of limitations on federal sexual assault \ncrimes.\n  The precision with which DNA evidence can identify a criminal \nassailant\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\nhas increased dramatically over the past couple decades. Because of its \nexactness, DNA evidence is now routinely collected by law enforcement \npersonnel in the course of investigating many crimes, including sexual \nassault crimes. The DNA profile of evidence collected at a sexual \nassault crime scene can be compared to the DNA profiles of convicted \ncriminals, or the profile of a particular suspect, in order to \ndetermine who committed the crime. Moreover, because of the longevity \nof DNA evidence, it can be used to positively identify a rapist many \nyears after the actual sexual assault.\n  The enormous advancements in DNA science have greatly expanded law \nenforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute sexual assault \ncrimes. Unfortunately, the law has not kept pace with science. Given \nthe precise accuracy and reliability of DNA testing, however, the legal \nand moral justifications for continuing to impose a statute of \nlimitations on sexual assault crimes are extremely weak. To that end, I \nam introducing the ``Sexual Assault Prosecution Act of 2000'' which \nwill eliminate the statute of limitations for sexual assault crimes. \nThis legislation will not affect the burdens of proof and the \ngovernment will still have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt \nbefore any person could be convicted of a crime.\n  Currently, the statute of limitations for arson and financial \ninstitution crimes is 10 years and is 20 years for crimes involving the \ntheft of major artwork. If it made sense to extend the traditional \nfive-year limitations period for these offenses, surely it makes sense \nto do so for sexual assault crimes, particularly when DNA technology \nmakes it possible to identify an offender many years after the \ncommission of the crime. By eliminating this ticking clock, we can see \nto it that no victim of sexual assault is denied justice simply because \nthe clock ran out. I look forward to working with each and every one of \nyou in order to get this legislation enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3168\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nthe International Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to drugs for minor \nanimal species, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          minor animal species health and welfare act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a \nproblem that unfortunately goes largely unnoticed except by those who \nare directly affected. Livestock and food animal producers, pet owners, \nzoo and wildlife biologists, and animals themselves are facing a severe \nshortage of approved animal drugs for minor species.\n  Minor species include thousands of animal species, including all \nfish, birds, and sheep. By definition, they are any animals other than \ncattle, horses, chickens, swine, turkeys, dogs and cats, the most \ncommon animals. There are millions of those animals. A similar shortage \nof drugs and medicines for major animal species exists for diseases \nwhich occur infrequently or which occur in limited geographic areas. \nDue to the lack of availability for these minor-use drugs, millions of \nanimals go untreated or treatment is delayed. Unnecessary animal \nphysical and human emotional suffering results, and human health may be \nthreatened as well.\n  Without access to these necessary minor-use drugs, farmers and \nranchers will also suffer. An unhealthy animal left untreated can \nspread disease throughout an entire stock. This causes severe economic \nhardship to struggling ranchers and farmers.\n  For example, sheep ranchers lost nearly $45 million worth of \nlivestock alone in 1999. The sheep industry estimates that if it had \naccess to effective and necessary drugs, growers' reproduction costs \nfor their animals could be cut by up to 15 percent. In addition, \nfeedlot deaths from disease would be reduced by 1 to 2 percent, adding \napproximately $8 million to the revenue of the industry.\n  The catfish industry is the No. 2 agriculture industry in Alabama. \nThough it is not the State's only aquacultural commodity, catfish is by \nfar its largest. The catfish industry generates enormous economic \nopportunity in the State, particularly in west Alabama, one of the \npoorest regions of the State and where I grew up.\n  The catfish industry estimates its losses at $60 million a year, \nattributable to diseases for which drugs are not available. Indeed, it \nis not uncommon for a catfish producer to lose half his stock in a pond \ndue to disease. The U.S. aquaculture industry overall, including food \nfish and ornamental fish, produces and raises over 800 different \nspecies. Unfortunately, this industry has only five drugs that are \napproved for treating these diseases. This results in tremendous \neconomic hardship and suffering.\n  Because of limited market opportunity, low profit margins, and the \nenormous capital investment required, it is seldom economically \nfeasible for drug manufacturers to pursue research\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\nand development and then seek approval of it by FDA for drugs used in \ntreating these minor species and for infrequent conditions and diseases \nin all animals. As a result, a group of people have come together, an \neffective professional coalition, to deal with this problem.\n  I, along with Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, Senator Allard, \nSenator Crapo, Senator Lincoln, and Senator Johnson resolve to improve \nthis situation by introducing the Minor Animal Species Health and \nWelfare Act of 2000. This legislation will allow animal drug \nmanufacturers the opportunity to develop and obtain approval for minor-\nuse drugs which are vitally needed by a wide variety of animal \nindustries.\n  Our legislation incorporates the major proposals of the Food and Drug \nAdministration's Center for Veterinary Medicine to increase the \navailability of drugs for minor animal species and rare diseases in all \nanimals. It actually creates incentives for animal drug manufacturers \nto invest in product development and obtain FDA marketing approvals.\n  This legislation creates a program very similar to the very \nsuccessful human orphan drug program that has dramatically increased \nthe availability of drugs to treat rare human diseases over the past 20 \nyears. Besides providing benefits to livestock producers and animal \nowners, this measure will develop incentives and sanctioning programs \nfor the pharmaceutical industry, while maintaining and ensuring public \nhealth.\n\n  The Minor Animal Species Health and Welfare Act will not alter FDA \ndrug approval responsibilities that ensure the safety of animal drugs \nto the public. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine currently \nevaluates new animal drug products prior to approval and use. This \nrigorous testing and review process provides consumers with the \nconfidence that animal drugs are safe for animals and consumers of \nproducts derived from treated animals.\n  Current FDA requirements include guidelines to prevent harmful \nresidues and evaluations to examine the potential for the selection of \nresistant pathogens. Any food animal medicine or drug considered for \napproval under this bill would be subject to these same assessments.\n  The Minor Animal Species Health and Welfare Act is supported by 25 \norganizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nAmerican Health Institute, the American Veterinary Medical Association, \nand the National Aquaculture Association. It is vital legislation.\n  This act will reduce the economic risks and hardship which fall upon \nranchers and farmers as a result of diseases. It will benefit pets and \ntheir owners and benefit various endangered species of aquatic animals. \nThe act will also promote the health of all animal species while \nprotecting human health and will alleviate unnecessary animal \nsuffering.\n  This is commonsense legislation which will benefit millions of \nAmerican pet owners, farmers, and ranchers. It is the result of a \ntremendous cooperative effort by virtually every entity concerned with \nthis problem. They have worked with the Food and Drug Administration \nand continue to work with the FDA on this bill.\n  I believe we are on the verge of taking a big step to facilitate the \nintroduction of more drugs that help treat animals in our country. I \nthank the people who have all worked to make this a reality. I \nparticularly thank Mary Alice Tyson on my staff who has worked so hard \non this project.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3169\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Minor Animal Species Health \n     and Welfare Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) There is a severe shortage of approved animal drugs for \n     use in minor species.\n       (2) There is a severe shortage of approved drugs for \n     treating animal diseases and conditions that occur \n     infrequently or in limited geographic areas.\n       (3) Because of the small market shares, low-profit margins \n     involved, and capital investment required, it is generally \n     not economically feasible for animal drug manufacturers to \n     pursue approvals for these species, diseases, and conditions.\n       (4) Because the populations for which such drugs are \n     intended are small and conditions of animal management may \n     vary widely, it is often difficult or impossible to design \n     and conduct studies to establish drug safety and \n     effectiveness under traditional animal drug approval \n     processes.\n       (5) It is in the public interest and in the interest of \n     animal welfare to provide for special procedures to sanction \n     the lawful use and marketing of animal drugs for minor \n     species and minor uses that take into account these special \n     circumstances and that ensure that such drugs do not endanger \n     the public health.\n       (6) Exclusive marketing rights and tax credits for clinical \n     testing expenses have helped encourage the development of \n     orphan drugs for human use, and comparable incentives will \n     help encourage the development and sanctioning for lawful \n     marketing of animal drugs for minor species and minor uses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to assist \ninstitutions of higher education to help at-risk students to stay in \nschool and complete their 4-year postsecondary academic programs by \nhelping those institutions to provide summer programs and grant aid for \nsuch students, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n            College Completion Challenge Grants Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Collins in \noffering legislation that will support our youth and promote their \nabilities by helping them stay in college and complete their degrees.\n  There is no question that post-secondary education is a critical \ncomponent in individual success in today's economy. Parents understand \nthis reality from the day their children are born and they start \nworrying about how to make college affordable. Students know it as they \nwork to achieve\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\ngood grades and high test scores. And policymakers know it as we work \nto increase Pell grants and support increased saving options for \nfamilies.\n  But colleges achievement is not just about being accepted at a higher \neducation institution. To fully see the benefits of post-secondary \neducation, one must complete a degree. And yet, while college \nenrollment rates have been rising, 37 percent of students who enter \npost-secondary education drop out before they receive a degree or \ncertificate. This problem is especially acute for minorities. Thirty \npercent of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans drop out of college \nbefore the end of their first year. This is almost double the rate of \nwhite Americans.\n  For these students and for us as a nation, these statistics represent \na lost opportunity. Clearly, these students aspire to greater things--\nto more education and better careers. But instead of fulfilling this \npromise, they leave school with their potential unrealized. \nUnfortunately, many of them also leave school not just with an academic \nset-back, but also with substantial student loan debt, which today is \nas much a reality of college attendance as is a course syllabus.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the ``College Completion \nChallenge Grants Act of 2000'', would provide vital support and \nassistance to at-risk students to help them stay in school and complete \ntheir degrees. The College Completion Challenge grant program is based \non the successful work of the Student Support Services (SSS) program, \nwhich is one of the Turning R Into Opportunity programs. While TRIO is \nbetter known for its early intervention programs with talented, at-risk \nhigh school students, SSS follows through on these early efforts by \nsupporting at-risk, first-generation college students once they are \nenrolled. The College Completion Challenge grants would supplement \nthese student support services by offering additional scholarship aid, \nintensive summer programs, and further support services to students at \nrisk of dropping out. Higher education institutions participating in \nSSS as well as those that provide similar support through other sources \nwould be eligible to apply for these additional dollars.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives has already acted on \nsimilar legislation, which was included in the Higher Education \nTechnical Amendments that passed the House earlier this year. So, I am \nhopeful that we too can find an appropriate vehicle to support these \nstudents as they pursue their dreams. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 3171. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe section 29 credit for producing fuel from a non-conventional \nsource; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           Energy Security for American Consumers Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if this country is ever going to \nachieve the goal of reducing our dependency on foreign sources of oil \nto at least 50 percent, we are going to have to provide incentives that \nwill encourage our energy industry to recover oil and gas from \nnonconventional sources.\n  In the aftermath of the twin oil shocks of the 1970s, Congress \nenacted Section 29 of the tax code which provides a tax credit to \nencourage production of oil and gas from unconventional sources such as \nDevonian shale, tight rock formations, coalbeds and geopressurized \nbrine. This credit has helped the industry invest in new technologies \nwhich allow us to recover large oil and gas deposits that are locked in \nvarious formations which are very expensive to develop.\n  Since the Clinton-Gore Administration came into office, it has sent \nup various proposals all designed to eliminate the Section 29 credit. \nAs a result of their efforts, the Section 29 credit has not applied to \nany facilities placed in service since July 1, 1998. That makes \nabsolutely no sense when we realize that today we are 56 percent \ndependent on foreign sources of oil. Doing away with this credit sends \na direct signal to the market--this country will not lift a finger to \nencourage energy development at home.\n  I think it is time to reverse the failed energy policies of the \nClinton-Gore administration. As part of that effort, I am today \nintroducing legislation that would extend the Section 29 credit until \n2013 and allow it to apply to facilities that are placed in service \nbefore 2011. I am pleased that Senators Breaux and Stevens are joining \nme in this effort.\n  Mr. President, if we are to retain the prosperity we have enjoyed \nover the last 20 years, we must have a stable and secure supply of oil \nand natural gas. Section 29 is an important provision that will allow \nour energy development companies to bring technologies on line to \ndevelop new energy deposits.\n  Moreover, the bill expands the definition of qualifying investments \nto include heavy oil. In Alaska, there are several billion barrels of \nheavy oil in West Sak Prudhoe Bay that are just too costly to exploit \nbecause of the density of the oil and the fact that it is heavily laden \nwith sand. Extension of the Section 29 credit could very well mean that \nthese billions of barrels of heavy oil could be exploited and brought \nonto the U.S. energy market.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3171\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Thanks to a prosperous economy \nand the Children's Health Insurance Program, the number of the \nuninsured declined for the first time in more than a decade. But that \ndecline was small, and it is no cause for complacency. The number of \nuninsured is still far too high--43 million Americans have no insurance \ncoverage--and any weakening in the economy is likely to send the number \nhigher again.\n\n  It's a national disgrace that so many Americans find the quality of \ntheir health determined by the quantity of their wealth. In this age of \nthe life sciences, the importance of good medical care in curing \ndisease and improving and extending life is more significant than ever, \nand denying any family the health care they need is unacceptable.\n  Earlier this year, along with a number of my colleagues in the House \nand Senate, I introduced bipartisan legislation to extend the Child \nHealth Insurance Program to include the parents of participating \nchildren and to increase the enrollment of eligible children in \nMedicaid and CHIP. It received a majority vote in the Senate, but it \nwas defeated on a procedural motion. I hope that we will be able to \npass it promptly next year, as an initial effective step to reduce the \nnumber of the uninsured.\n  Today, I am introducing an additional measure. The Basic Access to \nSecure Insurance Coverage Health plan--or BASIC Health plan. \nCongressman John Dingell is introducing a companion measure in the \nHouse. Our proposal uses the model of the Child Health Insurance \nProgram to make subsidized coverage available--through private \ninsurance or Medicaid--to all Americans with incomes below 300 percent \nof poverty--$25,000 a year for an individual and $42,000 a year for a \nfamily of three.\n  Almost three-quarters of the uninsured are in this income range. Our \nplan also includes innovative steps to encourage current and newly \neligible individuals and families to enroll. It is a major step toward \nthe day when access to affordable health care will be a reality for all \nAmericans, and I hope it will be enacted as well next year.\n  The need for BASIC is clear. One of our highest national priorities \nfor the new century must be to make good health care a reality for all \nour people. Every other industrialized society in the world except \nSouth Africa achieved that goal in the 20th century--and under Nelson \nMandela and Thabo Mbeki, South Africa has taken giant steps toward \nuniversal health care today. But in our country, the law of the jungle \nstill too often prevails. Forty-three million of our fellow citizens \nare left out and left behind when it comes to health insurance.\n  The dishonor roll of suffering created by this national problem is a \nlong one.\n  Children fail to get a healthy start in life because their parents \ncannot afford the eyeglasses or hearing aids or doctors visits they \nneed.\n  A young family loses its chance to participate in the American dream, \nwhen a breadwinner is crippled or killed because of lack of timely \naccess to medical care.\n  A teenager is condemned to go without a college education because the \nfamily's income and energy are sucked away by the high financial and \nemotional cost of uninsured illness.\n  An older couple sees its hope for a dignified retirement dashed when \nthe savings of a lifetime are washed away by a tidal wave of medical \ndebt.\n  Even in this time of unprecedented prosperity, more than 200,000 \nAmericans annually file for bankruptcy because of uninsured medical \ncosts. And the human costs of being uninsured are often just as \ndevastating.\n  In any given year, one-third of the uninsured go without needed \nmedical care.\n  Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take the medication that \ntheir doctor prescribes, because they cannot afford to fill the \nprescription.\n  Four hundred thousand children suffer from asthma but never see a \ndoctor. Five hundred thousand children with recurrent earaches never \nsee a doctor. Another five hundred thousand children with severe sore \nthroats never see a doctor.\n  Thirty-two thousand Americans with heart disease go without life-\nsaving and life-enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty--because they \nare uninsured.\n  Twenty-seven thousand uninsured women are diagnosed with breast \ncancer each year. They are twice as likely as insured women not to \nreceive medical treatment before their cancer has already spread to \nother parts of their bodies. As a result, they are 50 percent more \nlikely to die of the disease.\n  Overall, eighty-three thousand Americans die each year because they \nhave no insurance. The lack of insurance is the seventh leading cause \nof death in America today. Our failure to provide health insurance for \nevery citizen kills more people than kidney disease, liver disease, and \nAIDS combined.\n  Today our opportunity to finally end these millions of American \ntragedies is greater than ever before. Our prosperous economy gives us \nlarge new resources to invest in meeting this critical need. Recently, \nsome Republicans in Congress have finally joined Democrats in \nurging our country to meet the challenge of providing health coverage \nto the 43 million Americans who are uninsured.\n\n  The BASIC plan can be a bridge for both Republicans and Democrats to \ncome together. It is based on the model of the Child Health Insurance \nProgram, which enjoys broad bi-partisan support in every state in the \ncountry. It emphasizes a Federal-State partnership to make care \naccessible and affordable. Insurance is provided primarily through the \nprivate sector, but without employer mandates.\n  The BASIC plan is designed to supplement, not replace, the current \nemployment-based system of health care. It will also build on Medicaid, \nwhich effectively serves so many of the very poor, the working poor, \nthe disabled, and people with AIDS.\n  Federal subsidies under BASIC will be targeted to those without \ninsurance today. We should not disrupt the health coverage that 161 \nmillion Americans now receive through their employers. It makes no \nsense to encourage those who already have reliable employer-based \nhealth insurance to turn instead to a new government-subsidized \nprogram. The cost to taxpayers would balloon needlessly, and force us \nto reduce benefits in order to cut costs.\n  The proposal builds on and expands proven programs that are already \nin place. States will provide coverage under Medicaid for all very low \nincome people, consistent with the mandate that already exists in \nfederal law to provide Medicaid coverage for all children with family \nincomes below 100 percent of poverty. Medicaid's broad benefits and \nminimal cost-sharing are ideal for very low income people, because they \ncannot afford to contribute significantly to the cost of their own \ncare.\n  For low and moderate income individuals and families, the plan \nfollows the CHIP model. States will have the choice of providing \ncoverage through Medicaid or contracting with private insurance \ncompanies to offer subsidized coverage to those eligible to \nparticipate. The state would pay the insurance company a premium for \neach individual enrolled. For higher income enrollees, the individual \nwould make a premium contribution as well.\n  One-third of all the uninsured today are poor, and almost three-\nquarters of the uninsured have incomes below 300 percent of poverty. A \nprogram of subsidies targeted on these low and moderate income \nAmericans will put affordable health insurance within reach of the vast \nmajority of the uninsured.\n  One of the biggest problems we face in expanding health insurance \ncoverage through such a program is assuring that those who are eligible \nactually participate. We have learned a great deal from the experience \nunder CHIP on how to achieve this objective. We know that simple, mail-\nin forms are important. We know that public information campaigns and \nthe involvement of community-based organizations can be valuable. We \nknow that programs with presumptive eligibility are effective--so that \npeople can be signed up\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\nright away, without waiting until the eligibility verification process \nhas been completed. We know that enrolling people for a year at a time \nwithout subjecting them to reapplications or reverification of income \nmore often than once a year is critical. Through steps like these, we \ncan see that the uninsured are not only eligible for the program but \nactually participate in it, so that they actually have the financial \nprotection and access to timely medical care they need.\n  The BASIC Health plan will not require employers to contribute to the \ncost of coverage. But it will require them to make the BASIC plan \ncoverage available through the workplace, and forward the premiums of \nworkers to the insurance company that the workers choose. This step is \na minimum obligation that responsible employers should be willing to \naccept--and it can significantly increase the number of the uninsured \nwho actually have coverage. Eighty-two percent of uninsured Americans \ntoday are workers or dependents of workers. Our message to all of them \nis that help is finally on the way.\n  The cost of the BASIC place is an estimated $200 billion to $300 \nbillion over the next ten years--approximately the cost of the \nprescription drug plans that many of us have proposed under Medicare. \nIt's a substantial amount of the surplus, but as we know from the \nsuccess of Medicare, few if any federal dollars are better spent.\n  In sum, every child deserves a healthy start and life. Every family \ndeserves protection against the high cost of illness. All Americans \ndeserve timely access to quality, affordable health care. The American \npeople want action. It is time for all of us to make the cause of \nhealth care for all a national priority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the BASIC plan and a fact \nsheet on the problem of the uninsured be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Need for Legislation and Summary of the ``Basic'' Health Program: \n        Universal Access to Affordable Quality Health Insurance\n\n       America is the only industrial country in the world, except \n     South Africa, that does not guarantee health care for all its \n     citizens. The number of uninsured declined last year for the \n     first time in more than a decade--but 43 million Americans \n     remain uninsured, and any slowdown in the economy is likely \n     to send the number up again. The vast majority of the \n     uninsured are workers or dependents of workers. The \n     consequences of being uninsured go far beyond vulnerability \n     to catastrophic medical costs. The uninsured often lack \n     timely access to quality health care, especially preventive \n     care. They suffer unnecessary illness and even death because \n     they have no coverage.\n\n                        Growth in the Uninsured\n\n       The number of the uninsured has grown from 32 million in \n     1987 to 43 million this year. Except for a brief pause in \n     1993 and 1994, the number of uninsured has consistently \n     increased by a million or more each year until this year. \n     Even these figures understate the number of the uninsured. \n     During the course of a year, 70 million Americans will be \n     uninsured for an extended period of time.\n\n                    Characteristics of the Uninsured\n\n       The vast majority of privately insured Americans--161 \n     million citizens under 65--receive coverage on the job as \n     workers or members of their families. But the uninsured are \n     also overwhelmingly workers or their dependents. Eighty-two \n     percent of those without insurance are employees or family \n     members of employees. Of these uninsured workers, most are \n     members of families with at least one person working full-\n     time.\n       Most uninsured workers are uninsured because their employer \n     either does not offer coverage, or because they are not \n     eligible for the coverage offered. Seventy percent of \n     uninsured workers are in firms where no coverage is offered. \n     Eighteen percent are in firms that offer coverage, but they \n     are not eligible for it, usually because they are part-time \n     workers or have not been employed by the firm long enough to \n     qualify for coverage. Only 12 percent of uninsured workers \n     are offered coverage and decline.\n       The uninsured are predominantly low and moderate income \n     persons. Almost 25 percent are poor (income of $8,501 or less \n     for a single individual; $13,290 or less for a family of \n     three). Twenty-eight percent have incomes between 100 and 200 \n     percent of poverty. Eighteen percent have incomes between 200 \n     and 300 percent of poverty. Almost three-fourths have incomes \n     below 300 percent of poverty.\n\n                    Consequences of Being Uninsured\n\n       An uninsured family is exposed to financial disaster in the \n     event of serious illness. Unpaid medical bills account for \n     200,000 bankruptcies annually. Over 9 million families spend \n     more than one fifth of their total income on medical costs. \n     The health consequences of being uninsured are often as \n     devastating as the economic costs:\n       In any given year, one-third of the uninsured go without \n     needed medical care.\n       Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take medication \n     their doctors prescribe, because they cannot afford to fill \n     the prescription.\n       Thirty-two thousand Americans with heart disease go without \n     life-saving and life-enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty, \n     because they are uninsured.\n       Twenty-seven thousand uninsured women are diagnosed with \n     breast cancer each year. They are twice as likely as insured \n     women not to receive medical treatment until their cancer has \n     already spread in their bodies. As a result, they are 50 \n     percent more likely to die of the disease.\n       The tragic bottom line is that eighty-three thousand \n     Americans die every year because they have no insurance. \n     Being uninsured is the seventh leading cause of death in \n     America. Our failure to provide health insurance for every \n     citizen kills more people than kidney disease, liver disease, \n     and AIDS combined.\n\n\n  the proposal: summary of basic access to secure insurance coverage \n                  health plan (``basic'' health plan)\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The BASIC program builds on the bi-partisan Child Health \n     Insurance Program and on Vice-President Gore's proposal to \n     extend insurance coverage under CHIP and Medicaid to the \n     parents of eligible children. The Child Health Insurance \n     Program provides subsidized coverage through Medicaid or \n     private insurers contracting with state governments for low \n     and moderate income children. The BASIC plan extends the \n     availability of subsidized coverage to all uninsured low and \n     moderate income Americans, regardless of age or family \n     status. It guarantees the availability of coverage in every \n     state for every uninsured person, and includes provisions to \n     encourage enrollment by those who are eligible. The plan also \n     allows those who have incomes too high to qualify for \n     subsidies to participate in the program by paying the full \n     premium.\n\n                             Key Provisions\n\n     Phase 1: Coverage for Children and Parents--Expansion of CHIP \n         and Medicaid\n       Eligibility levels are raised to 300 percent of poverty for \n     all uninsured children.\n       Coverage is made available to all uninsured parents of \n     eligible children.\n       Coverage is made available to legal immigrant children and \n     their parents.\n       The required benefit package for children is improved by \n     adding eye-glasses, hearing aids, and medically necessary \n     rehabilitative services for disabled or developmentally \n     delayed children.\n       Additional steps are established to encourage enrollment of \n     eligible children and their parents, including presumptive \n     eligibility, qualification for at least twelve months, and \n     simplified application forms.\n       The system of capped state allotments under CHIP is \n     eliminated and federal matching funds are made available for \n     all eligible persons enrolled in the program.\n     Phase II: Coverage for the Remaining Uninsured\n       Subsidized coverage is made available for all uninsured \n     single adults with incomes below 300 percent of poverty. \n     Coverage is phased in by income levels, beginning with those \n     below 50 percent of poverty in the third year of the program, \n     rising to 300 percent of poverty in the ninth year.\n       Unsubsidized coverage is available to all individuals in \n     families with incomes too high to qualify for subsidized \n     coverage, by paying the cost through premiums.\n     Responsibility of Employers\n       Eighty-two percent of the uninsured are workers or \n     dependents of workers. Employers will not be required to \n     provide coverage or contribute to the cost of coverage--but \n     they will be required to offer their uninsured employees an \n     opportunity to enroll in the program and agree to facilitate \n     the coverage by withholding any required premium \n     contributions from the employee's periodic pay.\n     Cost\n       Preliminary estimates of similar proposals indicate that \n     the federal cost will be $200-$300 billion over the next ten \n     years, beyond the amount already budgeted for expansions of \n     coverage under the current CHIP program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bond, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Crapo, Mr. L. \n        Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 3173. A bill to improve the implementation of the environmental \nstreamling provisions of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury; read the first time.\n\n\n               Environmental Streamlining Improvement Act\n\n  Today I am introducing legislation that requires the US Department of \nTransportation to make substantial revisions to the recently proposed \nregulations on transportation planning and environmental streamlining. \nThis action is necessary because the proposed\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\nregulations fail to fully comply with the direction that Congress gave \nto the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT) in the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century--the so-called TEA--21--that we passed \nin 1998.\n  The proposed regulations cover the inter-related disciplines of \ntransportation planning and environmental protection. It is my view \nthat transportation system development and the environment can exist in \nharmony if there is proper planning and foresight. All too often, \nthough, there is a lack of coordination that results in unnecessary \ndelays to transportation projects, or leads to wasted time and funds on \nprojects that never get built.\n  This is the problem that I, along with my colleagues, Senators Graham \nand Wyden, attempted to address when we authored TEA-21's environmental \nstreamlining provision. Our provision, which is section 1309 of TEA-21, \nrequired a more systematic approach to avoid conflicts, expedite \napprovals, and eliminate duplicated efforts in developing \ntransportation projects.\n  Section 1309 does not weaken environmental standards or avoid \nexisting requirements for environmental analysis. Instead, section 1309 \nrequires better coordination between the transportation and \nenvironmental agencies.\n  Specifically, section 1309 requires that US DOT to establish a \ncoordinated review process among the various state and federal \nagencies, to ensure concurrent rather than sequential reviews by these \nagencies, and to establish a dispute resolution process so that delays \nare not created by lingering, unresolved problems. We also included \nother changes in TEA-21 that were intended to put greater order and \nefficiency into the planning and approval of transportation projects.\n  Unfortunately, the proposed regulations fail to meet the requirements \nof TEA-21 in two important respects: First, the regulations do not \nincorporate the specific requirements of environmental streamlining \nwith regard to time periods for review or a dispute resolution process.\n  Second, the regulations create new data collection, consultation and \nanalysis requirements that will further complicate and delay \ntransportation projects.\n   The full Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing \ntwo weeks ago to take testimony from the administration and the states \non the intent and effect of these regulations. the states unanimously \nobjected to the increased burden that would result from these proposed \nregulations. Where we intended to reduce delay, state transportation \ndepartments testified that these regulations would add years to project \ndevelopment, putting us even further behind in meeting our \ntransportation needs.\n  A few weeks ago, eleven bipartisan members of my committee joined in \na letter to the Secretary of Transportation recommending that the \nproposed regulations be revised and reissued. That is precisely the \nsubject of the legislation I am introducing today.\n  This bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to revise the \nrules, taking into consideration the hundreds of comments received on \nthe current proposal, and to comply with the clear directives that US \nDOT received from Congress in section 1309 of TEA-21. I hope that with \na second chance, the US DOT will craft rules that clearly meet \nCongressional intent.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today Senator Smith, on behalf of Senator \nVoinovich, myself and others is introducing the Environmental \nStreamlining Improvement Act.\n  This bill ensures that the United States Department of Transportation \nwill issue a revised rule on TEA-21 environmental streamlining \nregulations. This bill will give the USDOT another chance to follow the \nstatute when issuing proposed rules on planning and the environment.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee has held three hearings on \nthe subject of environmental streamlining since the passage of TEA-21 \nin 1998. I am sorry to say that in the 2 years it has taken the USDOT \nto issue this NPRM, they fall far short of what Congress has intended. \nTEA-21 is very specific about what the regulations should do. The \nproposed regulations follow neither the word nor the intent of TEA-21.\n  I remember working with Senators Warner, Graham, Wyden and Chafee and \nwith the House members to develop an agreement on environmental \nstreamlining. Those provisions are now Sections 1308 and 1309 of TEA-\n21.\n  I had heard from the Montana Department of Transportation and from \nothers about how cumbersome a process it is to complete a highway \nproject. Everyone who worked on TEA-21, in both the House and Senate, \nwanted to include a direction to the USDOT to streamline the planning \nand project development processes for the states.\n  We were very clear--the environment and the environmental reviews \nshould not get short shrift! But, we need to find a way to make it \neasier to get a final decision, eliminate unnecessary delays, move \nfaster and with as little paperwork as possible.\n  I cannot over-emphasize that the planning and environmental \nprovisions of TEA-21 need to be implemented in a way that will \nstreamline the expedite, not complicate, the process of delivering \ntransportation projects.\n  That is why Congress directed the USDOT to include certain elements \nin their regulations on environmental streamlining.\n  We included concepts to be incorporated in future regulations--like \nconcurrent environmental reviews by agencies and reasonable deadlines \nfor the agencies to follow when completing their reviews.\n  Certainly we did not legislate an easy task to the USDOT. Trying to \ncoordinate so many separate agencies is like trying to herd cats. The \nwhole concept of environmental streamlining--that is, to make the \npermit and approval process work more smoothly and effectively, while \nstill ensuring protection of the environment--is one of the more \ndifficult challenges of TEA-21.\n  So I waited for the rules to come out. And waited. And two years \nafter the passage of TEA-21 I look at the proposed rules and I am very \ndisappointed.\n  I have identified several problems with these regulations and I would \nlike to mention just a few things that I see as real problems.\n  First, elevating the planning process participants to the roles of \ndecision makers. These regulations were supposed to help the States get \ntheir jobs done better and more efficiently. Its one thing to add more \nparticipants to the process. More involvement is a good thing.\n  But its another thing to give them the authority to make decisions \nabout how the planning process will work. This decision maker role is \ncurrently held by State DOTs and Metropolitan Planning Organizations \nfor a reason.\n  Second, what happened to ``streamlining?'' The basic elements of real \nstreamlining are the only things not in the regs.\n  Third, these regulations are supposed to answer questions--but what \nis contained in the proposed regulations raises even more questions \nbecause they are vague there they need to be precise.\n  Fourth, this proposal makes it even harder, if not impossible to come \nto a decision. These regulations include initiatives not outlined in \nsections 1308 and 1309 and in many areas would strip states of their \nauthority.\n  I would also like to mention that the Montana Department of \nTransportation filed comments or wrote letters at every possible \nopportunity for the public record. As I read these proposed \nregulations, I see that MDT's comments were either never read by the \nUSDOT or ignored.\n  Let me close by saying that I believe the proposed rules would add \nsignificant requirements and uncertainty to planning and environmental \nreview for transportation projects. In practical terms, they would \nincrease overhead and delay--and delay usually means increased project \ncosts. These proposed rules could make it difficult for States to \ndeliver their programs. Contracts won't get let and jobs will be lost.\n  I know this is a tough task. To streamline a process while ensuring \nthat we maintain a thorough planning and environmental review process. \nBut, adding requirements to the process is contrary to the course \ncharted by Congress.\n  At our last hearing, the administration testified that their intent \nwas to streamline the process. The bill we are introducing today would \nallow them to make good on their intent.\n  Our bill requires the USDOT go back to the drawing board and \nincorporate\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\ncomments received from States and others and issue another NPRM. I am \nconfident the USDOT will do the right thing this time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Senator Bob Smith \nof introducing the Environmental Streamlining Improvement Act today. \nLast month several of my colleagues on the Environmental and Public \nWorks Committee, following a full committee hearing on the issue, \nrequested that the Administration revise its proposed rules on \nenvironmental streamlining and transportation planning, taking into \nconsideration comments already submitted on the proposed rules, and \npublish them in the Federal Register for an additional 120-day comment \nperiod. This legislation is being introduced today because the \nAdministration has not responded to our request.\n  In addition to requiring the Administration to consider public \ncomments and to revise and re-propose rules on environmental \nstreamlining and transportation planning, this legislation would \nprevent the Secretary of Transportation from finalizing the rules until \nMay 1, 2001, and require a report on changes that were made to the \nrevised rules.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, I witnessed first-hand the frustration \nof many of the various state agencies because they were required to \ncomplete a myriad of federally-required tasks on whatever project they \ninitiated.\n  With my background as a local and state official, I bring a unique \nperspective to this issue. While environmental review is good public \npolicy, I believe that there are more efficient ways to ensure adequate \nand timely delivery of construction projects, while still carefully \nassessing environmental concerns.\n  Congress recognized the frustration of the states and enacted \nplanning and environmental provisions to initiate environmental \nstreamlining and expedite project delivery. These programs are embodied \nin Sections 1308 and 1309 of TEA-21. Section 1308 calls for the \nintegration of the Major Investment Study, which had been a separate \nrequirement for major metropolitan projects, with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. Section 1309 of TEA-21 calls \nfor the establishment of a coordinated review process for the \nDepartment of Transportation to work with other federal agencies to \nensure that transportation projects are advanced according to \ncooperatively determined time-frames. This is accomplished by using \nconcurrent rather than sequential reviews, and allows states to include \nstate-specific environmental reviews in the coordinated process.\n  Last year, I conducted two hearings as Chairman of the Subcommittee \non Transportation and Infrastructure on streamlining and project \ndelivery. During those hearings I stressed how important it is that the \nplanning and environmental streamlining provisions of TEA-21 be \nimplemented in a way that will streamline and expedite, not complicate, \nthe process of delivering transportation projects. A year after these \nhearings and nearly two years after the passage of TEA-21, the \nDepartment of Transportation finally published its proposed planning \nand NEPA regulations on May 25, 2000. Frankly, I am very disappointed \nwith how long it took to propose these rules, and I believe many of my \ncolleagues feel the same way. More importantly, there is a lot of \ndisappointment with the proposed rules in general.\n  I strongly believe these proposed regulations are inconsistent with \nTEA-21 and Congressional intent and do little, if anything, to \nstreamline and expedite the ability of states to commence \ntransportation projects. The proposed rules create new mandates and \nrequirements, add new decision-makers to the process, and provide \nendless fodder for all kinds of lawsuits, especially with regard to \nenvironmental justice.\n  In Ohio, the process of highway construction has been dubbed: ``So \nyou Want a Highway? Here's the Eight Year Hitch.'' My hope has been \nthat in the future we could say ``So you Want a Highway? Here's the \nFive Year Hitch.'' I don't see that happening with the proposal we have \nbefore us. For that reason, I am very pleased Senator Smith has \nintroduced this legislation today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Burns, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Gorton, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grams, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. \n        Wellstone):\n  S. 3175.

Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Conrad to \nintroduce the ``National Rural Development Partnership Act of 2000''--a \nbill to codify the National Rural Development Partnership (NRDP or the \nPartnership) and provide a funding source for the program. I am pleased \nthat Senators Baucus, Bingaman, Breaux, Burns, Crapo, Daschle, Enzi, \nGorton, Gramm, Grams, Gregg, Harkin, Hutchison, Jeffords, Johnson, \nKennedy, Kerrey, Leahy, Lugar, Mikulski, Murray, Reed, Sarbanes, Bob \nSmith, Thomas, and Wellstone are joining us as original cosponsors.\n  The Partnership was established under the Bush Administration in \n1990, by Executive Order 12720. Although the Partnership has existed \nfor ten years, it has never been formally authorized by Congress. The \ncurrent basis for the existence of the Partnership is found in the \nConsolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 and the Rural \nDevelopment Policy Act of 1980. In addition, the Conference Committee \nReport on the 1996 federal Farm Bill created specific responsibilities \nand expectations for the Partnership and state rural development \ncouncils (SRDCs).\n  The Partnership is a nonpartisan interagency working group whose \nmission is to ``contribute to the vitality of the Nation by \nstrengthening the ability of all rural Americans to participate in \ndetermining their futures.'' The NRDP and SRDCs do something no other \nentities do: facilitate collaboration among federal agencies and \nbetween federal agencies and state, local, and tribal governments and \nthe private and non-profit sectors to increase coordination of programs \nand services to rural areas. When successful, these efforts result in \nmore efficient use of limited rural development resources and actually \nadd value to the efforts and dollars of others.\n  On March 8, 2000, the Subcommittee on Forestry, Conservation, and \nRural Revitalization, which I chair, held an oversight hearing on the \noperation and accomplishments of the NRDP and SRDCs. The Subcommittee \nheard from a number of witnesses, including officials of the US \nDepartments of Agriculture, Transportation and Health & Human Services, \nstate agencies, and private sector representatives. The hearing \nestablished the need for some legislative foundation and consistent \nfunding. The legislation we are introducing accomplishes this.\n  This legislation formally recognizes the existence and operations of \nthe Partnership, the National Rural Development Council (NRDC), and \nSRDCs. In addition, the legislation gives specific responsibilities to \neach component of the Partnership and authorizes it to receive \nCongressional appropriations.\n  Specifically, the bill formally establishes the NRDP and indicates it \nis composed of the NRDC and SRDCs. NRDP is established for empowering \nand building the capacity of rural communities, encouraging \nparticipation in flexible and innovative methods of addressing the \nchallenges of rural areas, and encouraging all those involved in the \nPartnership to be fully engaged and to share equally in decision \nmaking. This legislation also identifies the role of the federal \ngovernment in the Partnership as being that of partner, coach, and \nfacilitator. Federal agencies are called upon to designate senior-level \nofficials to participate in the NRDC and to encourage field staff to \nparticipate in SRDCs. Federal agencies are also authorized to enter \ninto cooperative agreements with, and to provide grants and other \nassistance to, state rural development councils, regardless of the form \nof legal organization of a state rural development council.\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\n  The composition of the NRDC is specified as being one representative \nfrom each federal agency with rural responsibilities, and governmental \nand non-governmental for-profit and non-profit organizations that elect \nto participate in the NRDC. The legislation outlines the duties of the \nCouncil as being to provide support to SRDCs; facilitate coordination \namong federal agencies and between the federal, state, local and tribal \ngovernments and private organizations; enhance the effectiveness, \nresponsiveness, and delivery of federal government programs; gather and \nprovide to federal agencies information about the impact of government \nprograms on rural areas; review and comment on policies, regulations, \nand proposed legislation; provide technical assistance to SRDCs; and \ndevelop strategies for eliminating administrative and regulatory \nimpediments. Federal agencies do have the ability to opt out of \nparticipation in the Council, but only if they can show how they can \nmore effectively serve rural areas without participating in the \nPartnership and Council.\n  This legislation provides that states may participate in the \nPartnership by entering into a memorandum of understanding with USDA to \nestablish an SRDC. SRDCs are required to operate in a nonpartisan and \nnondiscriminatory manner and to reflect the diversity of the states \nwithin which they are organized. The duties of the SRDCs are to \nfacilitate collaboration among government agencies at all levels and \nthe private and non-profit sectors; to enhance the effectiveness, \nresponsiveness, and delivery of federal and state government programs; \nto gather information about rural areas in its state and share it with \nthe NRDC and other entities; to monitor and report on policies and \nprograms that address, or fail to address, the needs of rural areas; to \nfacilitate the formulation of needs assessments for rural areas and \nparticipate in the development of the criteria for the distribution of \nfederal funds to rural areas; to provide comments to the NRDC and \nothers on policies, regulations, and proposed legislation; assist the \nNRDC in developing strategies for reducing or eliminating impediments; \nto hire an executive director and support staff; and to fundraise.\n  As I have stated before, this legislation authorizes the Partnership \nto receive appropriations as well as authorizing and encouraging \nfederal agencies to make grants and provide other forms of assistance \nto the Partnership and authorizing the Partnership to accept private \ncontributions. The SRDCs are required to provide at least a 25 percent \nmatch for funds it receives as a result of its cooperative agreement \nwith the federal government.\n  As you know, too many parts of rural America have not shared in the \nboom that has brought great prosperity to urban America. We need to do \nmore to ensure that rural citizens will have opportunities similar to \nthose enjoyed by urban areas. To do so, we do not necessarily need new \ngovernment programs. Instead, we must do a better job of coordinating \nthe many programs available for USDA and other federal agencies that \ncan benefit rural communities. With the passage of this legislation, \nthe NRDP and SRDCs will be better situated to provide that much needed \ncoordination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3175\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Rural Development \n     Partnership Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) rural development has been given high priority \n     throughout most of this century as a means of achieving a \n     sound balance between rural and urban areas in the United \n     States, a balance that Congress considers essential to the \n     peace, prosperity, and welfare of all citizens of the United \n     States;\n       (2)(A) during the last half century, Congress has enacted \n     many laws and established many programs to provide resources \n     to rural communities;\n       (B) in addition, numerous efforts have been made to \n     coordinate Federal rural development programs; and\n       (C) during the last decade, the National Rural Development \n     Partnership and its principal components, the National Rural \n     Development Council and State rural development councils, \n     have successfully provided opportunities for collaboration \n     and coordination among Federal agencies and between Federal \n     agencies and States, nonprofit organizations, the private \n     sector, tribal governments, and other entities committed to \n     rural advancement;\n       (3) Congress enacted the Rural Development Act of 1972 (86 \n     Stat. 657) and the Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 (94 \n     Stat. 1171) as a manifestation of this commitment to rural \n     development;\n       (4) section 2(b)(3) of the Rural Development Policy Act of \n     1972 (7 U.S.C. 2204b(b)(3)) directs the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to develop a process through which multi-state, \n     State, substate, and local rural development needs, goals \n     objectives, plans and recommendations can be received and \n     assessed on a continuing basis;\n       (5) the National Rural Development Partnership and State \n     Rural Development Councils were established as vehicles to \n     help coordinate development of rural programs in 1990;\n       (6) in 1991, the Secretary began to execute those statutory \n     responsibilities, in part through the innovative mechanism of \n     national, State, and local rural development partnerships \n     administered by the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Small \n     Community and Rural Development;\n       (7) that mechanism, now known as the ``National Rural \n     Development Partnership'', has been recognized as a model of \n     new governance and as an example of the effectiveness of \n     collaboration between the Federal, State, local, tribal, \n     private, and nonprofit sectors in addressing the needs of the \n     rural communities of the United States;\n       (8) partnerships by agencies and entities in the \n     Partnership would extend scarce but valuable funding through \n     collaboration and cooperation; and\n       (9) the continued success and efficacy of the Partnership \n     could be enhanced through specific Congressional \n     authorization removing any statutory barriers that could \n     detract from the benefits potentially achieved through the \n     Partnership's unique structure.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of Coptic \nChristians in Egypt who have been persecuted because of their religious \nbeliefs. According to reports by both the Egyptian Organization for \nHuman Rights and Freedom House in the United States, up to 1,200 Coptic \nChristians in Al-Kosheh, Egypt, were detained, interrogated, and \nsubjected to police brutality in relation to the murders of two other \nCoptic Christians in 1998. After weeks of reported torture, these \naccounts suggest that confessions were obtained under duress that \nidentified Shaiboub William Arsel as the murderer. Mr. Arsel was \nsubsequently sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.\n  Over the last two years I have met with officials from the Egyptian \ngovernment, including President Hosni Mubarak on several occasions in \nan attempt to address this issue quietly. Unfortunately, these \ndiscussions have failed to produce sufficient action on the part of the \ngovernment of Egypt. As a result, I rise today to submit a resolution \nurging the President to encourage the Egyptian government to provide \nShaiboub William Arsel with a timely and open appeal that would include \ninternational observers, and furthermore to complete an independent \ninvestigation of the police brutality in Al-Kosheh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S9965-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9965-S9975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MIWALETA PARK EXPANSION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 4290\n\n  Mr. MACK (for Mr. Murkowski) proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. \n1725) to provide for the conveyance by the Bureau of Land Management to \nDouglas County, Oregon, of a county park and certain adjacent land; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 3, beginning on line 6 strike Section 2(b)(1) and \n     insert:\n       ``(1) In general.--After conveyance of land under \n     subsection (a), the County shall manage the land for public \n     park purposes consistent with the plan for expansion of the \n     Miwaleta Park as approved in the Decision Record for \n     Galesville Campground, EA #OR110-99-01, dated September 17, \n     1999.''.\n       Section 2(b)(2)(A) strike ``purposes--'' and insert: \n     ``purposes as described in paragraph 2(b)(1)--''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SAINT-GAUDENS HISTORIC SITE LEGISLATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       THOMAS AMENDMENT NO. 4291\n\n  Mr. MACK (for Mr. Thomas) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1367) \nto amend the Act which established the Saint-Gaudens Historic Site, in \nthe State of New Hampshire, by modifying the boundary and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 3, strike ``215'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``279''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA INTERTIE SYSTEM LEGISLATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 4292\n\n  Mr. MACK (for Mr. Murkowski) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n2439) to authorize the appropriation of funds for the construction of \nthe Southeastern Alaska Intertie system, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n       ``That upon the completion and submission to the United \n     States Congress by the Forest Service of the ongoing High \n     Voltage Direct Current viability analysis pursuant to USFS \n     Collection Agreement #00CO-111005-105 or no later than \n     February 1, 2001, there is hereby authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Secretary of Energy such sums as may be \n     necessary to assist in the construction of the Southeastern \n     Alaska Intertie system as generally identified in Report #97-\n     01 of the Southern Conference.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Black Rock Desert-High Rock \n     Canon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The areas of northwestern Nevada known as the Black \n     Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon contain and surround the \n     last nationally significant, untouched segments of the \n     historic California Emigrant Trails, including wagon ruts, \n     historic inscriptions, and a wilderness landscape largely \n     unchanged since the days of the pioneers.\n       (2) The relative absence of development in the Black Rock \n     Desert and High Rock Canyon areas from emigrant times to the \n     present day offers a unique opportunity to capture the \n     terrain, sights, and conditions of the overland trails as \n     they were experienced by the emigrants and to make available \n     to both present and future generations of Americans the \n     opportunity of experiencing emigrant conditions in an \n     unaltered setting.\n       (3) The Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon areas are \n     unique segments of the Northern Great Basin and contain broad \n     representation of the Great Basin's land forms and plant and \n     animal species, including golden eagles and other birds of \n     prey, sage grouse, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, bighorn \n     sheep, free roaming horses and burros, threatened fish and \n     sensitive plants.\n       (4) The Black Rock-High Rock region contains a number of \n     cultural and natural resources that have been declared \n     eligible for National Historic Landmark and Natural Landmark \n     status, including a portion of the 1843-44 John Charles \n     Fremont exploration route, the site of the death of Peter \n     Lassen, early military facilities, and examples of early \n     homesteading and mining.\n       (5) The archaeological, paleontological, and geographical \n     resources of the Black Rock-High Rock region include numerous \n     prehistoric and historic Native American sites, wooly mammoth \n     sites, some of the largest natural potholes of North America, \n     and a remnant dry Pelistocene lakebed (playa) where the \n     curvature of the Earth may be observed.\n       (6) The two large wilderness mosaics that frame the \n     conservation area offer exceptional opportunities for \n     solitude and serve to protect the integrity of the viewshed \n     of the historic emigrant trails.\n       (7) Public lands in the conservation area have been used \n     for domestic livestock grazing for over a century, with \n     resultant benefits to community stability and contributions \n     to the local and State economies. It has not been \n     demonstrated that continuation of this use would be \n     incompatible with appropriate protection and sound management \n     of the resource values of these lands; therefore, it is \n     expected that such grazing will continue in accordance with \n     the management plan for the conservation area and other \n     applicable laws and regulations.\n       (8) The Black Rock Desert playa is a unique natural \n     resource that serves as the primary destination for the \n     majority of visitors to the conservation area, including \n     visitors associated with large-scale permitted events. It is \n     expected that such permitted events will continue to be \n     administered in accordance with the management plan for the \n     conservation area and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n       (2) The term ``public lands'' has the meaning stated in \n     section 103(e) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n     of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702(e)).\n       (3) The term ``conservation area'' means the Black Rock \n     Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation \n     Area established pursuant to section 4 of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSERVATION AREA.\n\n       (a) Establishment and Purposes.--In order to conserve, \n     protect, and enhance for the benefit and enjoyment of present \n     and future generations the unique and nationally important \n     historical, cultural, paleontological, scenic, scientific, \n     biological, educational, wildlife, riparian, wilderness, \n     endangered species, and recreational values and resources \n     associated with the Applegate-Lassen and Nobles Trails \n     corridors and surrounding areas, there is hereby established \n     the Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails \n     National Conservation Area in the State of Nevada.\n       (b) Areas Included.--The conservation area shall consist of \n     approximately 797,100 acres of public lands as generally \n     depicted on the map entitled ``Black Rock Desert Emigrant \n     Trail National Conservation Area'' and dated July 19, 2000.\n       (c) Maps and Legal Description.--As soon as practicable \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a map and legal description of the \n     conservation area.

TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coal Market Competition Act \n     of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal land contains commercial deposits of coal, the \n     Nation's largest deposits of coal being located on Federal \n     land in Utah, Colorado, Montana, and the Powder River Basin \n     of Wyoming;\n       (2) coal is mined on Federal land through Federal coal \n     leases under the Act of February 25, 1920 (commonly known as \n     the ``Mineral Leasing Act'') (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.);\n       (3) the sub-bituminous coal from these mines is low in \n     sulfur, making it the cleanest burning coal for energy \n     production;\n       (4) the Mineral Leasing Act sets for each leasable mineral \n     a limitation on the amount of acreage of Federal leases any 1 \n     producer may hold in any 1 State or nationally;\n       (5)(A) the present acreage limitation for Federal coal \n     leases has been in place since 1976;\n       (B) currently the coal lease acreage limit of 46,080 acres \n     per State is less than the per-State Federal lease acreage \n     limit for potash (96,000 acres) and oil and gas (246,080 \n     acres);\n       (6) coal producers in Wyoming and Utah are operating mines \n     on Federal leaseholds that contain total acreage close to the \n     coal lease acreage ceiling;\n       (7) the same reasons that Congress cited in enacting \n     increases for State lease acreage caps applicable in the case \n     of other minerals--the advent of modern mine technology, \n     changes in industry economics, greater global competition, \n     and the need to conserve Federal resources--apply to coal;\n       (8) existing coal mines require additional lease acreage to \n     avoid premature closure, but those mines cannot relinquish \n     mined-out areas to lease new acreage because those areas are \n     subject to 10-year reclamation plans, and the reclaimed \n     acreage is counted against the State and national acreage \n     limits;\n       (9) to enable them to make long-term business decisions \n     affecting the type and amount of additional infrastructure \n     investments, coal producers need certainty that sufficient \n     acreage of leasable coal will be available for mining in the \n     future; and\n       (10) to maintain the vitality of the domestic coal industry \n     and ensure the continued flow of valuable revenues to the \n     Federal and State governments and of energy to the American \n     public from coal production on Federal land, the Mineral \n     Leasing Act should be amended to increase the acreage \n     limitation for Federal coal leases.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lake Tahoe Restoration \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Lake Tahoe, one of the largest, deepest, and clearest \n     lakes in the world, has a cobalt blue color, a unique alpine \n     setting, and remarkable water clarity, and is recognized \n     nationally and worldwide as a natural resource of special \n     significance;\n       (2) in addition to being a scenic and ecological treasure, \n     Lake Tahoe is one of the outstanding recreational resources \n     of the United States, offering skiing, water sports, biking, \n     camping, and hiking to millions of visitors each year, and \n     contributing significantly to the economies of California, \n     Nevada, and the United States;\n       (3) the economy in the Lake Tahoe basin is dependent on the \n     protection and restoration of the natural beauty and \n     recreation opportunities in the area;\n       (4) Lake Tahoe is in the midst of an environmental crisis; \n     the Lake's water clarity has declined from a visibility level \n     of 105 feet in 1967 to only 70 feet in 1999, and scientific \n     estimates indicate that if the water quality at the Lake \n     continues to degrade, Lake Tahoe will lose its famous clarity \n     in only 30 years;\n       (5) sediment and algae-nourishing phosphorous and nitrogen \n     continue to flow into the Lake from a variety of sources, \n     including land erosion, fertilizers, air pollution, urban \n     runoff, highway drainage, streamside erosion, land \n     disturbance, and ground water flow;\n       (6) methyl tertiary butyl ether--\n       (A) has contaminated and closed more than \\1/3\\ of the \n     wells in South Tahoe; and\n       (B) is advancing on the Lake at a rate of approximately 9 \n     feet per day;\n       (7) destruction of wetlands, wet meadows, and stream zone \n     habitat has compromised the Lake's ability to cleanse itself \n     of pollutants;\n       (8) approximately 40 percent of the trees in the Lake Tahoe \n     basin are either dead or dying, and the increased quantity of \n     combustible forest fuels has significantly increased the risk \n     of catastrophic forest fire in the Lake Tahoe basin;\n       (9) as the largest land manager in the Lake Tahoe basin, \n     with 77 percent of the land, the Federal Government has a \n     unique responsibility for restoring environmental health to \n     Lake Tahoe;\n       (10) the Federal Government has a long history of \n     environmental preservation at Lake Tahoe, including--\n       (A) congressional consent to the establishment of the Tahoe \n     Regional Planning Agency in 1969 (Public Law 91-148; 83 Stat. \n     360) and in 1980 (Public Law 96-551; 94 Stat. 3233);\n       (B) the establishment of the Lake Tahoe Basin Management \n     Unit in 1973; and\n       (C) the enactment of Public Law 96-586 (94 Stat. 3381) in \n     1980 to provide for the acquisition of environmentally \n     sensitive land and erosion control grants;\n       (11) the President renewed the Federal Government's \n     commitment to Lake Tahoe in 1997 at the Lake Tahoe \n     Presidential Forum, when he committed to increased Federal \n     resources for environmental restoration at Lake Tahoe and \n     established the Federal Interagency Partnership and Federal \n     Advisory Committee to consult on natural resources issues \n     concerning the Lake Tahoe basin;\n       (12) the States of California and Nevada have contributed \n     proportionally to the effort to protect and restore Lake \n     Tahoe, including--\n       (A) expenditures--\n       (i) exceeding $200,000,000 by the State of California since \n     1980 for land acquisition, erosion control, and other \n     environmental projects in the Lake Tahoe basin; and\n       (ii) exceeding $30,000,000 by the State of Nevada since \n     1980 for the purposes described in clause (i); and\n       (B) the approval of a bond issue by voters in the State of \n     Nevada authorizing the expenditure by the State of an \n     additional $20,000,000; and\n       (13) significant additional investment from Federal, State, \n     local, and private sources is needed to stop the damage to \n     Lake Tahoe and its forests, and restore the Lake Tahoe \n     basin to ecological health.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enable the Forest Service to plan and implement \n     significant new environmental restoration activities and \n     forest management activities to address the phenomena \n     described in paragraphs (4) through (8) of subsection (a) in \n     the Lake Tahoe basin;\n       (2) to ensure that Federal, State, local, regional, tribal, \n     and private entities continue to work together to improve \n     water quality and manage Federal land in the Lake Tahoe Basin \n     Management Unit; and\n       (3) to provide funding to local governments for erosion and \n     sediment control projects on non-Federal land if the projects \n     benefit the Federal land.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Black Rock Desert-High Rock \n     Canon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The areas of northwestern Nevada known as the Black \n     Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon contain and surround the \n     last nationally significant, untouched segments of the \n     historic California Emigrant Trails, including wagon ruts, \n     historic inscriptions, and a wilderness landscape largely \n     unchanged since the days of the pioneers.\n       (2) The relative absence of development in the Black Rock \n     Desert and High Rock Canyon areas from emigrant times to the \n     present day offers a unique opportunity to capture the \n     terrain, sights, and conditions of the overland trails as \n     they were experienced by the emigrants and to make available \n     to both present and future generations of Americans the \n     opportunity of experiencing emigrant conditions in an \n     unaltered setting.\n       (3) The Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon areas are \n     unique segments of the Northern Great Basin and contain broad \n     representation of the Great Basin's land forms and plant and \n     animal species, including golden eagles and other birds of \n     prey, sage grouse, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, bighorn \n     sheep, free roaming horses and burros, threatened fish and \n     sensitive plants.\n       (4) The Black Rock-High Rock region contains a number of \n     cultural and natural resources that have been declared \n     eligible for National Historic Landmark and Natural Landmark \n     status, including a portion of the 1843-44 John Charles \n     Fremont exploration route, the site of the death of Peter \n     Lassen, early military facilities, and examples of early \n     homesteading and mining.\n       (5) The archaeological, paleontological, and geographical \n     resources of the Black Rock-High Rock region include numerous \n     prehistoric and historic Native American sites, wooly mammoth \n     sites, some of the largest natural potholes of North America, \n     and a remnant dry Pelistocene lakebed (playa) where the \n     curvature of the Earth may be observed.\n       (6) The two large wilderness mosaics that frame the \n     conservation area offer exceptional opportunities for \n     solitude and serve to protect the integrity of the viewshed \n     of the historic emigrant trails.\n       (7) Public lands in the conservation area have been used \n     for domestic livestock grazing for over a century, with \n     resultant benefits to community stability and contributions \n     to the local and State economies. It has not been \n     demonstrated that continuation of this use would be \n     incompatible with appropriate protection and sound management \n     of the resource values of these lands; therefore, it is \n     expected that such grazing will continue in accordance with \n     the management plan for the conservation area and other \n     applicable laws and regulations.\n       (8) The Black Rock Desert playa is a unique natural \n     resource that serves as the primary destination for the \n     majority of visitors to the conservation area, including \n     visitors associated with large-scale permitted events. It is \n     expected that such permitted events will continue to be \n     administered in accordance with the management plan for the \n     conservation area and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n       (2) The term ``public lands'' has the meaning stated in \n     section 103(e) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n     of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702(e)).\n       (3) The term ``conservation area'' means the Black Rock \n     Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation \n     Area established pursuant to section 4 of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSERVATION AREA.\n\n       (a) Establishment and Purposes.--In order to conserve, \n     protect, and enhance for the benefit and enjoyment of present \n     and future generations the unique and nationally important \n     historical, cultural, paleontological, scenic, scientific, \n     biological, educational, wildlife, riparian, wilderness, \n     endangered species, and recreational values and resources \n     associated with the Applegate-Lassen and Nobles Trails \n     corridors and surrounding areas, there is hereby established \n     the Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails \n     National Conservation Area in the State of Nevada.\n       (b) Areas Included.--The conservation area shall consist of \n     approximately 797,100 acres of public lands as generally \n     depicted on the map entitled ``Black Rock Desert Emigrant \n     Trail National Conservation Area'' and dated July 19, 2000.\n       (c) Maps and Legal Description.--As soon as practicable \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a map and legal description of the \n     conservation area.

The plan \n     shall be developed with full public participation and shall \n     developed with full public participation and shall describe \n     the appropriate uses and management of the conservation area \n     consistent with the provisions of this Act. The plan may \n     incorporate appropriate decisions contained in any current \n     management or activity plan for the area and may use \n     information developed in previous studies of the lands within \n     or adjacent to the conservation area.\n       (f) Grazing.--Where the Secretary of the Interior currently \n     permits livestock grazing in the conservation area, such \n     grazing shall be allowed to continue subject to all \n     applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders.\n       (g) Visitor Service Facilities.--The Secretary is \n     authorized to establish, in cooperation with other public or \n     private entities as the Secretary may deem appropriate, \n     visitor service facilities for the purpose of providing \n     information about the historical, cultural, ecological, \n     recreational, and other resources of the conservation area.\n\n     SEC. 6. WITHDRAWAL.\n\n       (a) In general.--Subject to valid existing rights, \n     all Federal lands within the conservation area and all \n     lands and interests therein which are hereafter acquired \n     by the United States are hereby withdrawn from all forms \n     of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land \n     laws, from location, entry, and patent under the mining \n     laws, from operation of the mineral leasing and geothermal\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\n     leasing laws and from the minerals materials laws and all \n     amendments thereto.\n\n     SEC. 7. NO BUFFER ZONES.\n\n       The Congress does not intend for the establishment of the \n     conservation area to lead to the creation of protective \n     perimeters or buffer zones around the conservation area. The \n     fact that there may be activities or uses on lands outside \n     the conservation area that would not be permitted in the \n     conservation area shall not preclude such activities or uses \n     on such lands up to the boundary of the conservation area \n     consistent with other applicable laws.\n\n     SEC. 8. WILDERNESS.\n\n       (a) Designatin.--In furtherance of the purposes of the \n     Wilderness Act of 1964 (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), the \n     following lands in the State of Nevada are designated as \n     wilderness, and, therefore, as components of the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System:\n       (1) Certain lands in the Black Rock Desert Wilderness Study \n     Area comprised of approximately 315,700 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled ``Black Rock Desert Wilderness--\n     Proposed'' and dated July 19, 2000, and which shall be known \n     as the Black Rock Desert Wilderness.\n       (2) Certain lands in the Pahute Peak Wilderness Study Area \n     comprised of approximately 57,400 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled ``Pahute Peak Wilderness--\n     Proposed'' and dated July 19, 2000, and which shall be known \n     as the Pahute Peak Wilderness.\n       (3) Certain lands in the North Black Rock Range Wilderness \n     Study Area comprised of approximately 30,800 acres, as \n     generally depicted on a map entitled ``North Black Rock Range \n     Wilderness--Proposed'' and dated July 19, 2000, and which \n     shall be known as the North Black Rock Range Wilderness.\n       (4) Certain lands in the East Fork High Rock Canyon \n     Wilderness Study Area comprised of approximately 52,800 \n     acres, as generally depicted on a map entitled ``East Fork \n     High Rock Canyon Wilderness--Proposed'' and dated July 19, \n     2000, and which shall be known as the East Fork High Rock \n     Canyon Wilderness.\n       (5) Certain lands in the High Rock Lake Wilderness Study \n     Area comprised of approximately 59,300 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled ``High Rock Lake Wilderness--\n     Proposed'' and dated July 19, 2000, and which shall be known \n     as the High Rock Lake Wilderness.\n       (6) Certain lands in the Little High Rock Canyon Wilderness \n     Study Area comprised of approximately 48,700 acres, as \n     generally depicted on a map entitled ``Little High Rock \n     Canyon Wilderness--Proposed'' and dated July 19, 2000, and \n     which shall be known as the Little High Rock Canyon \n     Wilderness.\n       (7) Certain lands in the High Rock Canyon Wilderness Study \n     Area and Yellow Rock Canyon Wilderness Study Area comprised \n     of approximately 46,600 acres, as generally depicted on a map \n     entitled ``High Rock Canyon Wilderness--Proposed'' and dated \n     July 19, 2000, and which shall be known as the High Rock \n     Canyon Wilderness.\n       (8) Certain land in the Calico Mountains Wilderness Study \n     Area comprised of approximately 65,400 acres, as generally \n     depicted on a map entitled ``Calico Mountains Wilderness--\n     Proposed'' and dated July 19, 2000, and which shall be known \n     as the Calico Mountains Wilderness.\n       (9) Certain lands in the South Jackson Mountains Wilderness \n     Study Area comprised of approximately 56,800 acres, as \n     generally depicted on a map entitled ``South Jackson \n     Mountains Wilderness--Proposed'' and dated July 19, 2000, and \n     which shall be known as the South Jackson Mountains \n     Wilderness.\n       (10) Certain lands in the North Jackson Mountains \n     Wilderness Study Area comprised of approximately 24,000 \n     acres, as generally depicted on a map entitled ``North \n     Jackson Mountains Wilderness--Proposed'' and dated July 19, \n     2000, and which shall be known as the North Jackson Mountains \n     Wilderness.\n       (b) Administration of Wilderness Areas.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights, each wilderness area designated by this Act \n     shall be administered by the Secretary in accordance with the \n     provisions of the Wilderness Act, except that any reference \n     in such provisions to the effective date of the Wilderness \n     Act shall be deemed to be a reference to the date of \n     enactment of this Act and any reference to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     Secretary of the Interior.\n       (c) Maps and Legal Description.--As soon as practicable \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a map and legal description of the \n     wilderness areas designated under this Act.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The areas of northwestern Nevada known as the Black \n     Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon contain and surround the \n     last nationally significant, untouched segments of the \n     historic California emigrant Trails, including wagon ruts, \n     historic inscriptions, and a wilderness landscape largely \n     unchanged since the days of the pioneers.\n       (2) The relative absence of development in the Black Rock \n     Desert and high Rock Canyon areas from emigrant times to the \n     present day offers a unique opportunity to capture the \n     terrain, sights, and conditions of the overland trails as \n     they were experienced by the emigrants and to make available \n     to both present and future generations of Americans the \n     opportunity of experiencing emigrant conditions in an \n     unaltered setting.\n       (3) The Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon areas are \n     unique segments of the Northern Great Basin and contain broad \n     representation of the Great Basin's land forms and plant and \n     animal species, including golden eagles and other birds of \n     prey, sage grouse, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, bighorn \n     sheep, free roaming horses and burros, threatened fish and \n     sensitive plants.\n       (4) The Black Rock-High Rock region contains a number of \n     cultural and natural resources that have been declared \n     eligible for National Historic Landmark and Natural Landmark \n     status, including a portion of the 1843-44 John Charles \n     Fremont exploration route, the site of the death of Peter \n     Lassen, early military facilities, and examples of early \n     homesteading and mining.\n       (5) The archeological, paleontological, and geographical \n     resources of the Black Rock-High Rock region include numerous \n     prehistoric and historic Native American sites, wooly mammoth \n     sites, some of the largest natural potholes of North America, \n     and a remnant dry Pleistocene lakebed (playa) where the \n     curvature of the Earth may be observed.\n       (6) The two large wilderness mosaics that frame the \n     conservation area offer exceptional opportunities for \n     solitude and serve to protect the integrity of the viewshed \n     of the historic emigrant trails.\n       (7) Public lands in the conservation area have been used \n     for domestic livestock grazing for over a century, with \n     resultant benefits to community stability and contributions \n     to the local and State economies. It has not been \n     demonstrated that continuation of this use would be \n     incompatible with appropriate protection and sound management \n     of the resource values of these lands; therefore, it is \n     expected that such grazing will continue in accordance with \n     the management plan for the conservation area and other \n     applicable laws and regulations.\n       (8) The Black Rock Desert playa is a unique natural \n     resource that serves as the primary destination for the \n     majority of visitors to the conservation area, including \n     visitors associated with large-scale permitted events. It is \n     expected that such permitted events will continue to be \n     administered in accordance with the management plan for the \n     conservation area and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, \n     tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires, pose great \n     danger to human life and to property throughout the United \n     States;\n       (2) greater emphasis needs to be placed on--\n       (A) identifying and assessing the risks to States and local \n     governments (including Indian tribes) from natural disasters;\n       (B) implementing adequate measures to reduce losses from \n     natural disasters; and\n       (C) ensuring that the critical services and facilities of \n     communities will continue to function after a natural \n     disaster;\n       (3) expenditures for postdisaster assistance are increasing \n     without commensurate reductions in the likelihood of future \n     losses from natural disasters;\n       (4) in the expenditure of Federal funds under the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5121 et seq.),\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\n     high priority should be given to mitigation of hazards at the \n     local level; and\n       (5) with a unified effort of economic incentives, awareness \n     and education, technical assistance, and demonstrated Federal \n     support, States and local governments (including Indian \n     tribes) will be able to--\n       (A) form effective community-based partnerships for hazard \n     mitigation purposes;\n       (B) implement effective hazard mitigation measures that \n     reduce the potential damage from natural disasters;\n       (C) ensure continued functionality of critical services;\n       (D) leverage additional non-Federal resources in meeting \n     natural disaster resistance goals; and\n       (E) make commitments to long-term hazard mitigation efforts \n     to be applied to new and existing structures.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish a \n     national disaster hazard mitigation program--\n       (1) to reduce the loss of life and property, human \n     suffering, economic disruption, and disaster assistance costs \n     resulting from natural disasters; and\n       (2) to provide a source of predisaster hazard mitigation \n     funding that will assist States and local governments \n     (including Indian tribes) in implementing effective hazard \n     mitigation measures that are designed to ensure the continued \n     functionality of critical services and facilities after a \n     natural disaster.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the amendment of the House with a further amendment which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment (No. 4299) is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. \n707, the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, and urge its passage by the \nfull Senate. This legislation represents compromise language negotiated \nwith the House of Representatives, but, is, substantively, very similar \nto the bill passed by the Senate in July of this year. This bill will \nensure that FEMA not only remains responsive to local communities after \na disaster, but also makes disaster preparedness and mitigation a \npriority. Further, I am proud that this bill will also result in both \nshort and long term savings to the American taxpayer while, at the same \ntime, providing the states and local communities with added resources \nfor future mitigation efforts. Through added efficiencies this bill \nsaves billions in the long run.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank a number of staff \nmembers who have worked so hard on this bill. In particular, I would \nlike to recognize Marty Hall from my committee staff; Jo-Ellen Darcy, \ncommittee staff for Senator Baucus; Andy Wheeler and Mike Murray from \nSenator Inhofe's staff; and Jason McNamara from Senator Graham's staff.\n\n\n                    emergency home repair assistance\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The bill includes a provision that caps emergency home \nrepair assistance for individuals and households at $5,000. Could the \nChairman elaborate on this provision to describe what additional \nassistance might be available to individuals and households should \ntheir emergency home repair costs exceed $5,000?\n  Mr. SMITH. I would be happy to elaborate on the provision. The bill \ncaps ``non-means-tested'' emergency home repair assistance at $5,000. \nIn other words, as long as insurance proceeds were not available, an \nindividual or household would be eligible for up to $5,000 of emergency \nhome repair assistance before he/she was required to seek additional \nassistance from other sources, such as the SBA Disaster Loan Program. \nIf that individual or household was not able to obtain an SBA loan, \nthen he/she could be eligible for additional emergency home repair \nassistance, as long as the total amount of FEMA assistance to this \nindividual or household does not exceed $25,000.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Is it correct, then, that if an individual or household \nwas unable to obtain a loan from SBA, or assistance from another \nsource, then they could be eligible to receive additional emergency \nhome repair assistance, based upon the regulations that FEMA \npromulgates for this section, and as long as the total FEMA assistance \nreceived by that individual or household does not exceed $25,000?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chairman for the clarification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S10019-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10019-S10027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESTORATION OF ESTUARY HABITAT\n\n  Mr. MACK.

TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIPS OMBUDSMAN.\n\n       (a) Appointment of Ombudsman.--The Secretary of Energy \n     shall direct the director of each national laboratory of the \n     Department of Energy, and may direct the director of each \n     facility under the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy, \n     to appoint a technology partnership ombudsman to hear and \n     help resolve complaints from outside organizations regarding \n     the policies and actions of each such laboratory or facility \n     with respect to technology partnerships (including \n     cooperative research and development agreements), patents, \n     and technology licensing.\n       (b) Qualifications.--An ombudsman appointed under \n     subsection (a) shall be a senior official of the national \n     laboratory or facility who is not involved in day-to-day \n     technology partnerships, patents, or technology licensing, \n     or, if appointed from outside the laboratory of facility, \n     function as such a senior official.\n       (c) Duties.--Each ombudsman appointed under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) serve as the focal point for assisting the public and \n     industry in resolving complaints and disputes with the \n     national laboratory or facility regarding technology \n     partnerships, patents, and technology licensing;\n       (2) promote the use of collaborative alternative dispute \n     resolution technique such as mediation to facilitate the \n     speedy and low-cost resolution of complaints and disputes, \n     when appropriate; and\n       (3) report quarterly on the number and nature of complaints \n     and disputes raised, along with the ombudsman's assessment of \n     their resolution, consistent with the protection of \n     confidential and sensitive information, to--\n       (A) the Secretary;\n       (B) the Administrator for Nuclear Security;\n       (C) the Director of the Office of Dispute Resolution of the \n     Department of Energy; and\n       (D) the employees of the Department responsible for the \n     administration of the contract for the operation of each \n     national laboratory or facility that is a subject of the \n     report, for consideration in the administration and review of \n     that contract.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Senator Edwards' amendment establishes a Technology \nPartnership Ombudsman at Department of Energy's National Laboratories. \nIt is my understanding that the Ombudsman should promote the use of \ncollaborative alternative dispute resolution techniques such as \nmediation to facilitate the speedy and low-cost resolution of \ncomplaints and disputes with industry partners. To ensure fairness and \nobjectivity, however, it would be the Senator's intent that nothing in \nthis Section be interpreted to empower the Ombudsman to act as a \nmediator or an arbitrator in the process.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator's understanding is correct. That is our \nintention.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as amended, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4300) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10028]]\n\n  The bill (H.R. 209), as amended, was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/05/senate-section/article/S10028-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10028-S10029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on a \nconference report, a bill we have been working on all year, including a \ncouple of other provisions that have now been added. We are ready to \nmove forward with it. That is what the vote will address tomorrow.\n  I have put forward this bill on sex trafficking with Senator \nWellstone. He and I don't get together on too many bills, so when we \ndo, it is a bit noteworthy. We come from different perspectives, \ndifferent viewpoints. I think we both have good hearts but our heads \ntake us in different directions. But on this subject of stopping sex \ntrafficking, we don't disagree. We have worked together all year to get \nthis bill through which challenges this practice known as sex \ntrafficking.\n  Throughout the world, globalization has a dark side. We are seeing \nincreasing numbers of young women, even girls, being trafficked from \npoorer countries to richer countries into the prostitution business. \nThey have been tricked, forced, coerced and defrauded into working as \nprostitutes against their will. There are about 700,000 women and \ngirls, according to our Government's estimates, being moved each year \nfrom poorer countries to richer countries into the prostitution \nbusiness. Our Government estimates that approximately 50,000 women and \nchildren are trafficked annually into the United States, primarily from \nAsia and Central America.\n  This is clearly a terrible practice. Many of these are young girls \nwho are tricked and deceived into forced prostitution believe they are \ngoing to a different country for another purpose. For example, those \ntrafficked to the United States are promised a job as a dish washer, or \na factory worker. Something that pays better than the job opportunities \navailable in their own, typically poorer, countries. However, once the \nvictims get here, there is no decent job waiting for them. Instead, the \ntrafficker will take their papers and passport so that they have no \nlegal identification. Then they are given false papers, if any. This \nbegins to prepare them for their new life of forced prostitution, \nmaking it very difficult to track down and rescue the young woman or \ngirl who has been trapped. There is a point very early in this process \nwhere the trafficker says something like the following to his victim, \n``You are mine and you will do what I say. You will work in this \nbrothel as a prostitute and you have no choice.'' At this point, she \nhad become a slave in one of the most degrading fashions imaginable.\n  Senator Wellstone and I heard testimony to this effect. We have had \ntwo hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee on this subject of \ntrafficking. At both hearings, we had victims testify to such \nexperiences. At one hearing, we had three women who had been \ntrafficked--all had been tricked into traveling to another country \nbelieving a good job was waiting on the other side, and once they got \nthere, they were forced into prostitution. This is what they were \nsubjected to. One young woman said that once she was moved into the \nUnited States, she was subjected to 30 clients a day, six days a week. \nIf she refused, she was beaten without mercy. It is a dark, dark \nbusiness.\n  In January of this year I was in Nepal. I met with a number of girls \nwho had returned from India, where they were forced to work in the \nbrothels in Bombay. These were young girls, frequently from villages, \nnot particularly knowledgeable in the ways of the world. They were \nyoung and very innocent when the trafficker had taken them away. The \ntrafficker had told one girl's parents, ``I can get her a job in a rug \nfactory in Bombay.'' The family was poor, they needed income, and they \nbelieved him. So they agreed, and gave their daughter away to the \ntrader who forced her into prostitution against her will. And she had \nno choice.\n\n  I met girls who had been trafficked at age 11, 12, and 13. The girls \nI saw in Nepal, in Katmandu, had returned from this devastating life. \nSome had escaped by running away, though many cannot since they are in \nchains or are locked away. Others were thrown out by the brothel \nbecause they had contracted AIDS or TB. When they returned at the age \nof 16, 17, or 18, two-thirds of them had AIDS and were waiting to die, \nhaving no proper medicine.\n  As I stood there with the woman who runs this place of restoration \nfor these young women, she pointed around the room whispering: She is \ndying, she is dying, she is dying. These were girls of 17 years old, 16 \nyears old, or younger. They were people who had had their youth stolen \nfrom them, were deceived or forced into this practice, and then, \nfinally, received a death sentence of AIDS. I saw that. I talked with \nthese survivors of trafficking. Once you see that, you know you have to \ntry to help to stop this. This is wrong, and this terrible practice is \nincreasing. It is happening to 700,000 women and children, girls, each \nyear worldwide.\n  Paul Wellstone and I worked very hard together. We have a bill that \nhas gone through the Senate by unanimous consent which is the most \ncomprehensive bill to combat this practice of sex trafficking. Among \nother provisions, this bill substantially increases the penalty for \ntrafficking, while protecting those victims who have been forced into \nthis awful practice. Presently, the victims of trafficking are treated \nalmost as badly as their enslaver, but this bill changes that. Instead, \nthis bill promotes the cooperation of the victims to testify against \nthose who have forced them into trafficking. This will help to bust \nopen the trafficking rings, which we are going very little of these \nday. It also promotes awareness programs so that people can protect \ntheir children and themselves from being tricked into forced \nprostitution.\n  I support the increasing globalization of the trade community, but we \nalso have to recognize the problems associated with globalization. \nTrafficking may be among the worst of those problems. The United States \ncan be a leader in starting to combat this practice, thus giving back \nto young girls all over the world their childhood instead of a death \nsentence.\n  Associated with this trafficking bill is a bill that Senator Biden \nhas worked very aggressively on, the Violence Against Women Act. This \nis a reauthorization of that bill. These two bills are being paired, \nalong with other measures. Senator Biden has spoken passionately and \nfrequently on the need to deal with domestic violence in the United \nStates, a very dark and pervasive tragedy in America.\n  It recently passed in the House of Representatives as a stand alone \nbill, with only 3 dissenting votes. It is up for reauthorization. VAWA \nwill help those women who are suffering from some form of domestic \nviolence. It is a good piece of legislation and these two bills belong \ntogether.\n  Also associated with this bill is an Internet Alcohol provision, as \nwell as a provision dealing with terrorism, put forward by Senator \nMack. It is noncontroversial. Also, in includes a bill entitled, Amy's \nLaw, sponsored by Congressman Salmon in the House, and by Senator \nSantorum here in the Senate. It ultimately promotes tougher prison \nsentences for people who have been convicted of sex crimes such as \nrape.\n  In summary, the two lead bills in this package separately address sex \ntrafficking and violence against women and children. I plead with my \ncolleagues to vote for this package. It will be up tomorrow morning. \nThis package challenges brutal practices suffered by some of the most \ndefenseless and battered in our society and worldwide. It will assist \npeople in some of the most violent and crushing situations, both here \nand abroad. It will help so many.\n  I plead with my colleagues in these last hours when people can put up \nroadblocks to bills. I plead with my colleagues to say that they will \nnot block this bill which will help so many people who are brutalized, \nincluding by sex trafficking. I plead with my colleagues, let's move \nthis package on through. This will clear through the House by a large \nvote. It is something we can do for the women and children in this \ncountry as well as worldwide. It is a sensible package. It has been \nworked out by both sides of the political spectrum, through both \nparties. So, please, let's do this.\n  This is something we can all be very proud of passing as we go home. \nWe can\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\nproudly say that we tried to do something, as we read increasing \nstories of forced sex trafficking worldwide. We can say we didn't look \naway by passing this bill.\n  Everybody is not going to like everything in these bills. But these \ntwo lead issues are so critical and important, and time is so short for \nus to get these through. Let's not wait until next session as \nincreasingly more and more girls are being tricked into this practice \nof forced sex trafficking.\n  The United States can step up awareness and advocacy, and as we do, \ngovernments around the world will do the same. The U.S. has to speak \nfirst, however, and this is the bill to do the speaking. Let's do it \nnow.\n  As we vote on this tomorrow morning, I ask my colleagues to vote yes \non these very important pieces of legislation to help children, to help \nwomen. These are vital pieces of legislation of which we can all be \nproud.\n  Mr. President, I understand there may be some more items, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate agree to the \namendments of the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure that the \nSenate is moving to pass the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \nand Emergency Act Amendments of 2000, a measure that will reauthorize a \nnational program providing primary health care services to people \nliving with HIV and AIDS. I especially want to commend Senators Hatch \nand Kennedy for the leadership they have provided since the \ninauguration of the legislation establishing the Ryan White programs \nover a decade ago. I also want to commend Senator Frist whose medical \nexpertise played a critical role in key provisions of the bill and \ncontinues to be an invaluable resource to our efforts on the range of \nhealth issues that come before the Senate. I want to recognize Senator \nDodd for his unwavering support for this legislation and people living \nwith HIV and AIDS. Finally, I want to acknowledge Senator Enzi's \nrecognition of the growing burden that AIDS and HIV have placed on \nrural communities throughout the country and the need to address those \ngaps in services.\n  It is also important that we recognize the dedicated efforts of our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives. Chairman Bliley supported \nthis bill through its passage and provided critical guidance through \nthe negotiations. Representatives Bilirakis, Coburn, and Waxman have \ndemonstrated time and time again their commitment to people living with \nAIDS and each has worked diligently to find a compromise to ensure the \ncontinued services for people with HIV/AIDS. Representatives Brown and \nDingell have also played important roles in shepherding this bill \nthrough the legislative process.\n  Since its inception in 1990, the Ryan White program has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support. During the last reauthorization of the Ryan White \nCARE Act in 1996, the measure garnered a vote of 97 to 3 on its final \npassage. As evidence that strong bipartisan support continues, I am \nhappy to report that this reauthorization bill was passed unanimously \nby this Chamber in June of this year. The bipartisan support for this \nimportant legislation underlines the critical need for the assistance \nthis Act provides across the Nation.\n  With this reauthorization, we mark the ten years through which the \nRyan White CARE Act has provided needed health care and support \nservices to HIV positive people around the country. Titles I and II \nhave provided much needed relief to cities and states hardest hit by \nthis disease, while Titles III and IV have had a direct role in \nproviding healthcare services to underserved communities. Ryan White \nprogram dollars provide the foundation of care so necessary in fighting \nthis epidemic and have allowed States and communities around the \ncountry to successfully address the needs of people affected by HIV \ndisease.\n  In recent months a number General Accounting Office studies have \nshown that the CARE Act is providing services and support to people \nwith HIV who are most in need and most deserving of our help. The GAO \nfound that CARE Act funds are reaching the infected groups that have \ntypically been underserved, including the poor, the uninsured, women, \nand ethnic minorities. These groups form a majority of CARE Act clients \nand are being served by the CARE Act in higher proportions than their \nrepresentation in the AIDS population. The GAO also found that CARE Act \nfunds support a wide array of primary care and support services, \nincluding the provision of powerful therapeutic regimens for people \nwith HIV/AIDS that have dramatically reduced AIDS diagnoses and deaths.\n  Previous efforts to improve this legislation have led to incredible \nreductions in the number of HIV infected babies being born each year \nand, equally important, to increased outreach, counseling, voluntary \ntesting, and treatment services being provided to women with HIV \ninfection. Between 1993 and 1998, perinatal-acquired AIDS cases \ndeclined 74 percent in the U.S. In this bill, I have continued to \nsupport efforts to reach women in need of care for their HIV disease \nand have included provisions to ensure that women, infants and children \nreceive resources in accordance with the prevalence of the infection \namong them.\n  The AIDS Drug Assistance Program has been another critical success. \nThis program has provided people with HIV and AIDS access to newly \ndeveloped, highly effective therapeutics. Because of these drugs, \npeople are maintaining their health and living longer. The AIDS death \nrate and the number of new AIDS cases have been dramatically reduced. \nFrom 1996 to 1998, deaths from AIDS dropped 54 percent while new AIDS \ncases have been reduced by 27 percent. In this reauthorization bill we \nhave improved access for underserved and poor communities and increased \nsupport for services that help maximize the impact of these therapies.\n  Despite our great success, the Ryan White program remains as vital to \nthe public health of this Nation as it was in 1990 and in 1996. While \nthe rate of decline in new AIDS cases and deaths is leveling off, HIV \ninfection rates continue to rise in many areas; becoming increasingly \nprevalent in rural and underserved urban areas; and also among\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\nwomen, youth, and minority communities. Local and state healthcare \nsystems face an increasing burden of disease, despite our success in \ntreating and caring for people living with HIV and AIDS. Rural and \nunderserved urban areas are often unable to address the complex medical \nand support services needs of people with HIV infection. As the AIDS \nepidemic continues to expand into these areas across the country, this \nlegislation will allow us to adapt our care systems to meet the most \nurgent needs in the communities hardest hit by the epidemic.\n  The bill being considered today was developed on a bipartisan basis, \nworking with other Committee Members, community stakeholders and \nelected officials at the state and local levels from whom we sought \ninput to ensure that we addressed the most important problems facing \ncommunities of people with HIV infection. Finally we have worked \nclosely with our colleagues in the House of Representatives to produce \nthis agreement. This morning, our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives unanimously passed this legislation that we have before \nus. The agreements we have reached with our House colleagues have been \nfully explained in an Statement of Explanation and I would like \nunanimous consent that this document be printed as part of the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  This bill will double the minimum base funding available to states \nthrough the CARE Act to assist them in developing systems of care for \npeople struggling with HIV and AIDS. The bill also includes a new \nsupplemental state grant to target assistance to small and mid-sized \nmetropolitan areas to help them address the increasing number of people \nwith HIV/AIDS living outside of urban areas that receive assistance \nunder Title I of the Act. Rural and underserved areas receive a \npreference for planning, early intervention, and capacity development \ngrants under title III. In order to assist states in expanding access \nto appropriate HIV/AIDS therapeutics to low-income people with HIV/\nAIDS, a supplemental grant has been added to the AIDS Drug Assistance \nProgram.\n\n  The bill remains primarily a system of grants to State and local \njurisdictions, thereby ensuring that grantees can respond to local \nneeds. States, EMAs, and the affected communities will still decide how \nto best prioritize and address the healthcare needs of their HIV-\npositive citizens. This bill reinforces the ability of States and EMAs \nto identify and meet local needs.\n  Finally, in recognition of the changing nature of the epidemic, I \nhave asked the Institute of Medicine to complete a study of the \nfinancing and delivery of primary care and support services for low \nincome, uninsured, and under-insured individuals with HIV disease, \nwithin 21 months after the enactment of this Act. Changes in HIV \nsurveillance and case reporting, and the effects of these changes on \nprogram funding, will be included in this study. The recommendations \nfrom this study will help Congress and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to ensure the most effective and efficient use of \nFederal funds for HIV and AIDS care and support.\n  I am proud that this bill has progressed through the Congress and \nthat we will see this bill become law this year. The people struggling \nto overcome the challenges of HIV and AIDS must continue to benefit \nfrom high quality medical care and access to lifesaving drugs. We have \nmade incredible progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and I want to \nensure that every person in America in need of assistance benefits from \nour tremendous advances.\n  Many groups and individuals have contributed significantly to \ncrafting this bill, but I want to acknowledge those at the Health \nResources and Services Administration. All of the groups united under \nthe umbrella of the National Organizations Responding to AIDS (NORA) \ndeserve recognition. Representing a diverse community of people with \nAIDS, CARE Act service providers, and administrative agencies, NORA \nclearly and effectively communicated to Congress the needs and \npriorities of their constituents.\n  I also want to thank several staff members who have worked long and \nhard to craft this bill and to address the concerns and needs of the \naffected communities. Stephanie Robinson and Idalia Sanchez, for \nSenator Kennedy, were key to reaching agreement on this bill and have \nprovided invaluable assistance and support throughout the development \nof this legislation. Dave Larson and Mary Sumpter Johnson, of Senator \nFrist's office, for their support for the needs of rural and \nunderserved communities throughout the nation. Similarly, Jeannie \nIreland with Senator Dodd's office, Helen Rhee, working for Senator \nDeWine, Libby Rolfe, for Mr. Sessions, and Raissa Geary and Mary Jordan \nin Senator Enzi's office, provided valuable input. Without the efforts \nof these staff members, we would not have such a strong, well-balanced, \nand targeted reauthorization bill before us today. I want to also \nexpress my gratitude and thanks to Bill Baird, Legislative Counsel, who \nworked tirelessly to craft legislative language. Finally, I want to \nacknowledge the contributions of Sean Donohue and William Oscar Fleming \nof my staff who guidance of this effort from the beginning has resulted \nin a bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support and which most \nimportantly meets the pressing needs of people with HIV and AIDS.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000--Managers' Statement of \n                              Explanation\n\n       The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 reauthorize \n     Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act to ensure that \n     individuals living with HIV and AIDS receive health care and \n     related support services. The legislation contains \n     authorization for appropriations and programmatic changes to \n     ensure the CARE Act programs respond to evolving demographic \n     trends in the HIV/AIDS epidemic and advances in treatment and \n     care.\n       In March, 1990, Congress enacted the Ryan White CARE Act, \n     honoring Ryan White, a young man who taught the Nation to \n     respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic with hope and action rather \n     than fear. By the spring of 1990, over 128,000 people had \n     been diagnosed with AIDS in the United States and 78,000 had \n     died of the disease. The CARE Act was reauthorized in 1996, \n     as the epidemic spread to more than 600,000 Americans \n     diagnosed with AIDS and amidst the nationwide recognition \n     that CARE Act programs were indispensable to the care and \n     treatment of Americans with HIV/AIDS.\n       The CARE Act Amendments of 2000 marks the second \n     reauthorization of the CARE Act. In the last twenty years, \n     the HIV/AIDS epidemic has claimed over 420,000 American men, \n     women, and children. Today, the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention estimates that there are currently between \n     800,000 and 900,000 persons living with HIV in the United \n     States, with 40,000 new infections annually.\n       While there is still no cure, the CARE Act has been \n     instrumental in responding to the public health, social and \n     economic burdens of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, the \n     steady expansion and changed demographics of the epidemic, as \n     well as the improved survival time for people living with \n     AIDS, are placing increasing stress on State and local health \n     care systems, community based organizations and families \n     providing care. Most importantly, the epidemic is expanding \n     beyond major cities to smaller cities and rural regions, and \n     disproportionately affecting women, communities of color, \n     children and youth.\n       The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 preserves the \n     best and proven features of existing CARE Act programs. But \n     the CARE Act Amendments of 2000 also makes important and \n     substantial reforms to respond to the significant changes in \n     the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the last 5 years.\n       The Organization of Services Under the CARE Act Amendments \n     of 2000 is as follows:\n       Title I. Emergency Relief for Areas with Substantial Need \n     for Services: Provides emergency relief grants to 51 eligible \n     metropolitan areas (EMAs) disproportionately affected by the \n     HIV epidemic to provide primary care and HIV-related support \n     services to people with HIV and AIDS. Half of the Title I \n     funding is distributed by formula; the remaining half is \n     distributed competitively, based on the demonstration of \n     severity of need and other criteria.\n       Planning Council membership has been revised to include HIV \n     prevention providers, homeless and housing service providers, \n     and representatives of prisoners. A third of Planning Council \n     members must be individuals with HIV/AIDS receiving care who \n     are not officers, employees or consultants to Title I \n     grantees.\n       Title II. CARE Grant Program: Provides formula grants to \n     States, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and U.S. \n     Territories to improve the quality of health care and support \n     services for individuals with HIV disease and their families. \n     The funds are used: to provide medical support services, to \n     continue health insurance payments, to provide home care \n     services, and, through the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs \n     (ADAP), to provide medications necessary for the care of \n     these individuals. Supplemental formula grants are awarded to \n     States with ``emerging communities'' which are ineligible for \n     grants under Title I.\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\n       Subtitle B provides discretionary grants to States for the \n     reduction of perinatal transmission of HIV, and for HIV \n     counseling, testing, and outreach to pregnant women. Subtitle \n     C provides discretionary grants to States for partner \n     notification, counseling and referral services.\n       Title III. Early Intervention Services: Funds nonprofit \n     entitles providing primary care and outpatient early \n     intervention services, including case management, counseling, \n     testing, referrals, and clinical and diagnostic services to \n     individuals diagnosed with HIV. The unfunded program of State \n     formula grants in current law is repealed.\n       Title IV. Other Programs and Activities: Provides grants \n     for comprehensive services to children, youth, and women \n     living with HIV and their families. Such services include \n     primary, specialty and psychosocial care, as well as HIV \n     outreach and prevention activities. Grantees must demonstrate \n     linkages to, and provide clients with access and education \n     on, HIV/AIDS clinical research.\n       Title IV newly authorizes the AIDS Education and Training \n     Centers (AETC), a network of 14 regional centers conducting \n     clinical HIV education and training of health providers, to \n     provide prenatal and gynecological care. The HIV/AIDS Dental \n     Reimbursement program, covering uncompensated oral health \n     care for patients with HIV/AIDS, is expanded to provide \n     community-based care in underserved areas.\n       Under Subtitle B, general provisions authorize CDC data \n     collection of CARE Act planning and evaluation, enhanced \n     interagency coordination of HIV services and prevention, \n     development of a plan for the case management of prisoners \n     with HIV, and administrative provisions related to audits, \n     and a plan for simplification of CARE Act grant \n     disbursements.\n       Title V. General Provisions: Authorizes Institute of \n     Medicine (IOM) studies and expansion of Federal support for \n     the development of rapid HIV tests. Makes necessary and \n     technical corrections in Title XXVI of the Public Health \n     Service Act.\n       A summary of selected provisions is as follows:\n       Use of HIV Case Data in Formula Grants: In order to target \n     funding more accurately to reflect the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the \n     Managers have revised and updated the Title I and Title II \n     formulas to make use of data on cases of HIV infection as \n     well as of AIDS. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2005, HIV and AIDS case \n     data is intended to be used in the Title I and Title II \n     formulas.\n       However, no later than July 1, 2004, the Secretary shall \n     determine whether HIV case data, as reported to and confirmed \n     by the Director of CDC, is sufficiently accurate and reliable \n     from all eligible areas and States for such use in the \n     formula. The Secretary shall also consider the findings of \n     the Institute of Medicine (IOM) study undertaken under \n     section 501(b).\n       If the Secretary makes an adverse determination regarding \n     HIV case data, the Managers intend that only AIDS case data \n     will be used in FY2005 formula allocations. The Secretary \n     shall also provide grants and technical assistance to States \n     and eligible areas to ensure that accurate and reliable HIV \n     case data is available no later than FY2007.\n       Planning and priority setting: The Managers have \n     strengthened the capacity of EMAs and States to plan, \n     prioritize, and allocate funds, based on the size and \n     demographic characteristics of the populations with HIV \n     disease in the eligible area. Planning, priority setting, and \n     funding allocation processes must take into account the \n     demographics of the local HIV/AIDS epidemic, existing \n     disparities in access HIV-related health care, and resulting \n     adverse health outcomes. It is the intent of the Managers \n     that CARE Act dollars more closely follow the shifting trends \n     in the local epidemic and address disparities in health care \n     access and health outcomes as well as the need for capacity \n     development within the local and State HIV health care \n     infrastructures.\n       The Managers intend both EMAs and States to develop \n     strategies to bring into and retain in care those individuals \n     who are aware of their HIV status but are not receiving \n     services. As part of this process, the Managers place the \n     highest priority on EMAs and States focusing on eliminating \n     disparities in access and services among affected \n     subpopulations and historically underserved communities. The \n     Managers recognize, however, that the relative availability \n     or lack of HIV prevalence data will be reflected in the \n     scope, goals, timetable and allocation of funds for \n     implementation of the strategy.\n       The Managers also expect the Secretary to collaborate with \n     Titles I and II grant recipients and providers to develop \n     epidemiologic measures and tools for use in identifying \n     persons with HIV infection who know their HIV status but are \n     not in care. The Managers recognize the difficulty the EMAs \n     and States may experience in identifying persons with HIV \n     infection who are not in care and who may be unknown to any \n     health or social support system. The efforts on the part of \n     EMAs and States to accomplish these important tasks, however, \n     should not be delayed until this process is complete. \n     Instead, the Managers expect Titles I and II grant recipients \n     to establish and implement strategies responsive to these \n     urgent needs before the development of nationally uniform \n     measures, to the extent that is practicable and to which \n     necessary prevalence data is reasonably available.\n       The Managers have also authorized outreach activities in \n     Titles I and II intended to identify individuals with HIV \n     disease know their HIV status but are not receiving services. \n     The intent is to ensure that EMAs and States understand that \n     outreach activities which are consistent with early \n     intervention services and necessary to implement the \n     aforementioned strategies, are appropriate uses of Titles I \n     and II funds. It is not the Managers' intent that such \n     activities supplant or otherwise duplicate activities such as \n     case finding, surveillance and social marketing campaigns \n     currently funded and administered by the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention (CDC). Instead, this authorization \n     reflects the urgency of increasing the coordination between \n     HIV prevention and HIV care and treatment services in all \n     CARE Act programs.\n       Hold harmless provisions: The hold-harmless provisions are \n     intended to minimize loss and stabilize systems of care in \n     EMAs and States, while assuring that funds are allocated in \n     Titles I and II to reflect the current distribution and \n     epidemiology of the epidemic.\n       The Managers have revised the Title I hold harmless to \n     limit a potential loss in an EMA's formula allocation to a \n     small percentage of the amount allocated to the eligible area \n     in the previous (or base) year. An EMA may lose no more than \n     15 percent of its base formula allocation over five years, \n     beginning with 2 percent in the first year and increasing in \n     subsequent years. If the Secretary determines that data on \n     HIV prevalence are accurate and reliable for use in \n     determining Title I formula grants for Fiscal Year 2005, all \n     EMAs may lose no more than 2 percent of their Fiscal Year \n     2004 formula allocation in that year.\n       Should an EMA experience a decline in its Title I formula \n     allocation followed by an intervening year in which there is \n     no decline, its losses in any subsequent, nonconsecutive year \n     of decline would once again be limited to 2 percent (i.e., \n     the intervening year ``resets the clock'').\n       The Managers intend to ensure that essential primary care \n     and support services are not compromised by short-term \n     fluctuations in AIDS case counts. Because no new EMA is \n     expected by HRSA's Bureau of HIV/AIDS to require the hold \n     harmless in the first three or four years of this \n     reauthorization period, the Managers expect this policy will \n     shield all eligible areas, save those currently requiring the \n     hold harmless, from any meaningful loss in Title I formula \n     funding.\n       Under the Title II holds harmless, a State or territory may \n     lose no more than 1 percent from the previous fiscal year \n     amounts, or 5 percent over the 5-year reauthorization period. \n     This protection extends to base Title II funding (which \n     excludes funds for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP)), as \n     well as to overall Title II funding.\n       Women, child, infants, and youth set-aside: The Managers \n     are aware of the rising incidence of HIV among youth and \n     women, particularly women of color, and recognize the \n     challenges in assuring them access to primary care and \n     support services for HIV and AIDS. The Managers intend to \n     increase the availability of primary care and health-related \n     supportive services under Title I and Title II for each of \n     the four groups described in the set-aside. Youth are added \n     as a new category within this set-aside. The Managers intend \n     the term ``youth'' to include persons between the ages of 13 \n     and 24, and ``children'' to include those under the age of \n     13, including infants.\n       The Managers clarify that the set-asides for women, \n     infants, children, and youth with HIV disease be allocated \n     proportionally, based on the percentage of the local HIV-\n     infected population that each group represents. The Managers \n     intend that the States and EMAs continue to make every effort \n     to reach and serve women, infants, children, and youth living \n     with HIV/AIDS by allocating sufficient resources under Titles \n     I and II to serve each of these populations. The Managers \n     also recognize that these priority populations often comprise \n     a greater proportion of HIV cases rather than AIDS cases in a \n     local area. This distinction should be taken into account \n     where necessary prevalence data is reasonably available.\n       The Managers are aware that these populations may also have \n     access to HIV care through other parts of Title XXVI, \n     Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), \n     and other Federal and State programs. Therefore, the \n     requirement to proportionally allocate funds provided under \n     Title II to each of these populations may be waived for \n     States which reasonably demonstrate that these populations \n     are receiving adequate care.\n       Capacity development: Titles I, II and III of this \n     legislation provide a new focus on strengthening the capacity \n     of minority communities and underserved areas where HIV/AIDS \n     is having a disproportionate impact. Currently, many \n     underserved urban and rural areas are not able to compete \n     successfully for planning grants and early intervention \n     service grants due to the lack of infrastructure and \n     experience with the Ryan White CARE Act programs. This gap in \n     services available is increasingly important, as the HIV and \n     AIDS epidemic extends into rural communities. In addition to \n     authorizing capacity development under Titles I and II, the \n     Managers establish a preference for rural areas under Title \n     III that will allow program administrators to target capacity \n     development grants, planning grants, and the delivery of \n     primary care services to rural communities with a growing \n     need for HIV\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\n     services. However, urban areas are not excluded from \n     consideration for future grants nor is funding reduced to \n     current grants in urban areas.\n       Quality management: The Managers recognize the importance \n     of having CARE Act grantees ensure that quality services are \n     provided to people with HIV and that quality management \n     activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. Quality \n     management programs are intended to serve grantees in \n     evaluating and improving the quality of primary care and \n     health-related supportive services provided under this act. \n     The quality management program should accomplish a threeford \n     purpose: (1) assist direct service medical providers funded \n     through the CARE Act in assuring that funded services adhere \n     to established HIV clinical practices and Public Health \n     Service (PHS) guidelines to the extent possible; (2) ensure \n     that strategies for improvements to quality medical care \n     include vital health-related supportive services in achieving \n     appropriate access to and adherence with HIV medical care; \n     and (3) ensure that available demographic, clinical, and \n     health care utilization information is used to monitor the \n     spectrum of HIV-related illnesses and trends in the local \n     epidemic.\n       The Managers expect the Secretary to provide States with \n     guidance and technical assistance for establishing quality \n     management programs, including disseminating such models as \n     have been developed by States and are already being utilized \n     by Title II programs and in clinical practice environments. \n     Furthermore, the Managers intend that the Secretary provide \n     clarification and guidance regarding the distinction between \n     use of CARE Act funds for such program expenditures that are \n     covered as either planning and evaluation and funds for \n     program support costs. It is not the Managers' intent to \n     divert current program resources or to reassign current \n     program support costs or clinical quality programs to new \n     cost areas, if they are an integral part of a State's current \n     quality management efforts.\n       Program support costs are described as any expenditure \n     related to the provision of delivering or receiving health \n     services supported by CARE Act funds. As applied to the \n     clinical quality programs, these costs include, but are not \n     limited to, activities such as chart review, peer-to-peer \n     review activities, data collection to measure health \n     indicators or outcomes, or other types of activities related \n     to the development or implementation of a clinical quality \n     improvement program. Planning and evaluation costs are \n     related to the collection and analysis of system and process \n     indicators for purposes of determining the impact and \n     effectiveness of funded health-related support services in \n     providing access to and support of individuals and \n     communities within the health delivery system.\n       Early intervention services: The Managers authorize early \n     intervention services as eligible services under Titles I and \n     II under certain circumstances. The Managers intend to allow \n     grantees to provide certain early intervention services, such \n     as HIV counseling, testing, and referral services, to \n     individuals at high risk for HIV infection, in accordance \n     with State or EMA planning activities. The Managers recognize \n     the range of organizations that may be eligible to provide \n     early intervention services, including other grantees under \n     titles I, II and III such as community based organizations \n     (CBOs) that act as points of entry into the health care \n     system for traditionally underserved and minority \n     populations.\n       The Managers believe that referral relationships maintained \n     by providers of early intervention services are essential to \n     increasing the numbers of people with HIV/AIDS who are \n     identified and to bringing them into care earlier in the \n     progression of their disease.\n       Health-care related support services: The Managers wish to \n     stress the importance of CARE Act funds in meeting the health \n     care needs of persons and families with HIV disease. The Act \n     requires support services provided through CARE Act funds to \n     be health care related. States and EMAs should ensure that \n     support services meet the objective of increasing access to \n     health care and ongoing adherence with primary care needs. \n     The Managers reaffirm the critical relationship between \n     support service provision and positive health outcomes.\n       Title I planning council duties and membership: The \n     Managers have amended numerous aspects of CARE Act programs \n     to enhance the coordination between HIV prevention and HIV/\n     AIDS care and treatment services. In this case, Planning \n     Council membership of the providers of HIV prevention \n     services will help assure this coordination. To improve \n     representation of underserved communities, providers of \n     services to homeless populations and representatives of \n     formerly incarcerated individuals with HIV disease are \n     included in planning council membership. It is the intent of \n     the Managers that the needs of all communities affected by \n     HIV/AIDS and all providers working within the service areas \n     be represented. The Managers also intend the Planning \n     Councils more adequately reflect the gender and racial \n     demographics of the HIV/AIDS population within their \n     respective EMAs.\n       The Managers also intend that patients and consumers of \n     Title I services constitute a substantial proportion of \n     Planning Council memberships. The prohibited of officers, \n     employees and consultants is not intended to impede the \n     participation of qualified, motivated volunteers with Title I \n     grantees from serving on Planning Councils where they do not \n     maintain significant financial relationships with such \n     grantees. In contrast to such significant financial \n     relationships, volunteers may be reimbursed reasonable \n     incidental costs, including for training and transportation, \n     which help to facilitate their important contribution to the \n     Planning Councils.\n       To ensure that new Planning Council members are adequately \n     prepared for full participation in meetings, the Managers \n     direct the Secretary to ensure that proper training and \n     guidance is provided to members of the Councils. The Managers \n     also expect Planning Councils to provide assistance, such as \n     transportation and childcare, to facilitate the participation \n     of consumers, particularly those from affected subpopulations \n     and historically underserved communities.\n       Consistent with the ``sunshine'' policies of the Federal \n     Advisory Committee Act (FACA), all meetings of the Planning \n     Councils shall be open to the public and be held after \n     adequate notice to the public. Detailed minutes, records, \n     reports, agenda, and other relevant documents should also be \n     available to the public. The Managers intend for such \n     documents to be available for inspection and copying at a \n     single location, including posting on the Internet.\n       Title I supplemental: In order to target funding to areas \n     in greatest need of assistance, severity of need is given a \n     greater weight of 33 percent in the award of Title I \n     supplemental grants. The Managers intend that Title I \n     supplemental awards are not intended to be allocated on the \n     basis of formula grant allocations. Instead, such \n     supplemental awards are to be directed principally to those \n     eligible areas with `severe need,'' or the greatest or \n     expanding public health challenges in confronting the \n     epidemic. The Managers have included additional factors to be \n     considered in the assessment of severe need, including the \n     current prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and the degree of increasing \n     and unmet needs for services. Additionally, the Managers \n     believe that syphilis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C should be \n     regarded as important co-morbidities to HIV/AIDS.\n       It is the Managers' strong view that HRSA's Bureau of HIV/\n     AIDS should employ standard, quantitative measures to the \n     maximum extent possible in lieu of narrative self-reporting \n     when awarding supplemental awards. The Managers therefore \n     renew the Bureau's obligation to develop in a timely manner a \n     mechanism for determining severe need upon the basis of \n     national, quantitative incidence data. In this regard, the \n     Managers recognize that adequate and reliable data on HIV \n     prevalence may not be uniformly available in all eligible \n     areas on the date of enactment. It is noted, however, that \n     ``HIV disease'' under the CARE Act encompasses both persons \n     living with AIDS as well as persons diagnosed as HIV positive \n     who have not developed AIDS.\n       Title II base minimum funding: The minimum Title II base \n     award is increased in order to increase the funding available \n     to States for the capacity development of health system \n     programs and infrastructure. The Federated States of \n     Micronesia and the Republic of Palau are included as entities \n     eligible to receive Title II funds, in recognition of the \n     need to establish a minimum level of funding to assist in \n     building HIV infrastructure.\n       Title II public participation: The Managers urge States to \n     strengthen public participation in the Ryan White Title II \n     planning process. While the Managers do not intend that \n     States be mandated to consult with all entities participating \n     in the Title I planning process, reference to such entities \n     is intended to provide guidance to the States that such \n     entities are important constituencies which the States should \n     endeavor to include in their planning processes. Moreover, \n     States may demonstrate compliance with the new requirement of \n     an enhanced process of public participation by providing \n     evidence that existing mechanisms for consumer and community \n     input provide for the participation of such entities. The \n     intent is to allow States to utilize the optimal public \n     advisory planning process, such as special planning bodies or \n     standing advisory groups on HIV/AIDS, for their particular \n     population and circumstances.\n       The Managers are also aware of the difficulties that some \n     States with limited resources may encounter in convening \n     public hearings over large geographic or rural areas and \n     encourage the Secretary to work with these States to develop \n     appropriate processes for public input, and to consider such \n     limitations when enforcing these requirements.\n       Title II HIV care consortia: The Manager intend that the \n     States continue to work with local consortia to ensure that \n     they identify potential disparities in access to HIV care \n     services at the local level, with a special emphasis on those \n     experiencing disparities in access to care, historically \n     underserved populations, and HIV infected persons not in \n     care. However, the Managers do not intend that States and/or \n     consortia be mandated to consult with all entities \n     participating in the Title I planning process. Rather, \n     reference to such entities is intended to provide guidance to \n     the States that such entities are important constituencies \n     which the States should endeavor to include in their planning \n     processes.\n       Title II ``emerging communities'' supplement: There \n     continues to be a growing need to address the geographic \n     expansion of this epidemic, and this Act continues the \n     efforts made during the last reauthorization to direct \n     resources and services to areas that are\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\n     particularly underserved, including rural areas and \n     metropolitan areas with significant AIDS cases that are not \n     eligible for Title I funding. A supplemental formula grant \n     program is created within Title II to meet HIV care and \n     support needs in non-EMA areas. There are a large number of \n     areas within States that do not meet the definition of a \n     Title I EMA but that, nevertheless, experience significant \n     numbers of people living with AIDS. This provision stipulates \n     that these ``emerging communities,'' defined as cities with \n     between 500 and 1,999 reported AIDS cases in the most recent \n     5-year period, be allocated 50 percent of new appropriations \n     to address the growing need in these areas. Funding for this \n     provision is triggered when the allocations to carry out Part \n     B, excluding amounts allocated under section 2618(a)(2)(I), \n     are $20,000,000 in excess of funds available for this part in \n     fiscal year 2000, excluding amounts allocated under section \n     2618(a)(2)(I). States can apply for these supplemental awards \n     by describing the severity of need and the manner in which \n     funds are to be used.\n       The Managers intend to acknowledge the challenges faced by \n     many areas with a significant burden of HIV and AIDS and a \n     lack of health care infrastructure or resources to provide \n     HIV care services. This supplemental program allows the \n     Secretary to make grants to States to address HIV service \n     needs in these underserved areas. The Managers understand the \n     necessity to continue to support existing and expanding \n     critical Title II base services.\n       AIDS Drug Assistance Program supplemental grant and \n     expanded services: Under this Act, the AIDS Drug Assistance \n     Program (ADAP) has been strengthened to assist States in a \n     number of areas. The Secretary is authorized to reserve 3 \n     percent of ADAP appropriations for discretionary supplemental \n     ADAP grants which shall be awarded in accordance with \n     severity of need criteria established by the Secretary. Such \n     criteria shall account for existing eligibility standards, \n     formulary composition and the number of patients with incomes \n     at or below 200 percent of poverty. The Managers also \n     encourage the Secretary to consider such factors as the \n     State's ability to remove restrictions on eligibility based \n     on current medical conditions or income restrictions and to \n     provide HIV therapeutics consistent with PHS guidelines.\n       States are also required to match the Federal supplement at \n     a rate of 1:4. The Managers expect the State to continue to \n     maintain current levels of effort in its ADAP funding. The \n     Managers intend that the 25 percent State match required to \n     receive funds under this section be implemented in a flexible \n     manner that recognizes the variations between Federal, State, \n     and programmatic fiscal years.\n       In addition, up to 5 percent of ADAP funds will be allowed \n     to support services that directly encourage, support, and \n     enhance adherence with treatment regimens, including medical \n     monitoring, as well as purchase health insurance plans where \n     those plans provided fuller and more cost-effective coverage \n     of AIDS therapies and other needed health care coverage. \n     However, up to 10 percent of ADAP funds may be expended for \n     such purposes if the State demonstrates that such services \n     are essential and do not diminish access to therapeutics. \n     Finally, the Managers recognize that existing Federal policy \n     provides adequate guidelines to states for carrying out \n     provisions under this section.\n       Partner notification, perinatal transmission, and \n     counseling services: Discretionary grants are authorized \n     under this Act for partner notification, counseling and \n     referral services. The Managers have also expanded the \n     existing grant program to States for the reduction of \n     perinatal transmission of HIV, and for HIV counseling, \n     testing, and outreach to pregnant woman. Funding for \n     perinatal HIV transmission reduction activities is expanded, \n     with additional grants available to States with newborn \n     testing laws or States with significant reductions in \n     perinatal HIV transmission. In addition, this Act further \n     specifies information to be conveyed to individuals receiving \n     HIV positive test results in order to reduce risk of HIV \n     transmission through sex or needle-sharing practices.\n       Coordination of coverage and services: This Act also \n     strengthens the requirements made on the States and EMAs in a \n     number of areas aimed at improving the coordination of \n     coverage and services. Grantees must access the availability \n     of other funding sources, such as Medicaid and the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and improve \n     efforts to ensure that CARE Act funds are coordinated with \n     other available payers.\n       Titles II and IV administrative expenses: The \n     administrative cap for the directly funded Title III programs \n     is increased. The administrative cap for Title III grants is \n     raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent to correspond with the \n     10 percent cap on individual contractors in Title I. The \n     Secretary is directed to review administrative and program \n     support expenses for Title IV, in consultation with grantees. \n     In order to assure that children, youth, women, and families \n     have access to quality HIV-related health and support \n     services and research opportunities, the Secretary is \n     directed to work with Title IV grantees to review expenses \n     related to administrative, program support, and direct \n     service-related activities.\n       Title IV access to research: This Act removes the \n     requirement that Title IV grantees enroll a ``significant \n     number'' of patients in research projects. Title IV provides \n     an important link between women, children, and families \n     affected by HIV/AIDS and HIV-related clinical research \n     programs. The ``significant number'' requirement is removed \n     here to eliminate the incentive for providers to \n     inappropriately encourage or pressure patients to enroll in \n     research programs.\n       To maintain appropriate access to research opportunities, \n     providers are required to develop better documentation of the \n     linkages between care and research. The Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services (HHS), through the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH), is also directed to examine the distribution \n     and availability of HIV-related clinical programs for \n     purposes of enhancing and expanding access to clinical \n     trials, including trials funded by NIH, CDC and private \n     sponsors. The Managers encourage the Secretary to assure that \n     NIH-sponsored HIV-related trials are responsive to the need \n     to coordinate the health services received by participants \n     with the achievement of research objectives. Nor do the \n     Managers intend this requirement to require the \n     redistribution of funds for such research projects.\n       Part F Dental Reimbursement Program: The Managers have \n     established new grants for community-based health care to \n     support collaborative efforts between dental education \n     programs and community-based providers directed at providing \n     oral health care to patients with HIV disease in currently \n     unserved areas and communities without dental education \n     programs. Although the Dental Program has been tremendously \n     successful, there is still a large HIV/AIDS population that \n     has not benefitted because there is not a dental education \n     institution participating in their area. These patients are \n     also in need of dental services that could be provided at \n     community sites if more community-based providers would \n     partner with a dental school or residency program. In these \n     partnerships, dental students or residents could provide \n     treatment for HIV/AIDs patients in underserved communities \n     under the direction of a community-based dentist who would \n     serve as adjunct faculty. By encouraging dental educational \n     institutions to partner with community-based providers, the \n     Managers intend to address the unmet need in these areas by \n     ensuring that dental treatment for the HIV/AIDS population is \n     available in all areas of the country, not just where dental \n     schools are located.\n       Technical assistance and guidance: The Managers reaffirm \n     the Secretary's responsibility in providing needed guidance \n     and tools to grantees in assisting them in carrying out new \n     requirements under this Act. The Secretary is required to \n     work with States and EMAs to establish epidemiologic measures \n     and tools for use in identifying the number of individuals \n     with HIV infection, especially those who are not in care. The \n     legislation requests an IOM study to assist the Secretary in \n     providing this advice to grantees.\n       The Managers understand that the Secretary has convened a \n     Public Health Service Working Group on HIV Treatment \n     Information Dissemination, which has produced recommendations \n     and a strategy for the dissemination of HIV treatment \n     information to health care providers and patients. \n     Recognizing the importance of such a strategy, the Managers \n     intend that the Secretary issue and begin implementation of \n     the strategy to improve the quality of care received by \n     people living with HIV/AIDS.\n       Data Collection through CDC: The Managers believe that an \n     additional authorization for HIV surveillance activities \n     under the CDC will serve to advance the purposes of the CARE \n     Act. To better identify and bring individuals with HIV/AIDS \n     into care, States and cities may use such funding to enhance \n     their HIV/AIDS reporting systems and expand case finding, \n     surveillance, social marketing campaigns, and other \n     prevention service programs. Notwithstanding its strong \n     interest in improving the coordination between HIV prevention \n     and HIV care and treatment services, the Managers intend that \n     this enhanced funding for CDC and its grantees ensure that \n     CARE Act programs and funds not duplicate or be diverted to \n     activities currently funded and administered by the CDC.\n       Coordination: This Act requires the Secretary to submit a \n     plan to Congress concerning the coordination of Health \n     Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Substance Abuse and \n     Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and Health \n     Care Financing Administration (HCFA), to enhance the \n     continuity of care and prevention services for individuals \n     with HIV disease or those at risk of such disease. The \n     Managers believe that much greater effort is required to \n     ensure that the provision of HIV prevention and care services \n     becomes as seamless as possible, and that coordination be \n     pursued at the Federal level, in the States and local \n     communities to eliminate any administrative barriers to the \n     efficient provision of high quality services to individuals \n     with HIV disease.\n       A second plan for submission to Congress focuses on the \n     medical case management and provision of support services to \n     persons with HIV released from Federal or State prisons.\n       Administrative simplification: The Managers intend for the \n     Secretary of HHS to explore opportunities to reduce the \n     administrative requirements of Ryan CARE Act grantees through \n     simplifying and streamlining the administrative processes \n     required of grantees and providers under Titles I and II. In \n     consultation with grantees and service providers of both \n     parts, the Secretary is directed to (1) develop a plan for \n     coordinating the disbursement of appropriations for grants \n     under\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\n     Title I with the disbursement of appropriations for grants \n     under Title II, (2) explore the impact of biennial \n     application for Titles I and II on the efficiency of \n     administration and the administrative burden imposed on \n     grantees and providers under Titles I and II, and (3) develop \n     a plan for simplifying the application process for grants \n     under Titles I and II. It is the intent of the Managers to \n     improve the ability to grantees to comply with administrative \n     requirements while decreasing the amount of staff time and \n     resources spent on administrative requirements.\n       Program and service studies: The Managers request that the \n     Secretary, through the IOM, examine changing trends in the \n     HIV/AIDS epidemic and the financing and delivery of primary \n     care and support services for low-income, uninsured \n     individuals with HIV disease. The Secretary is directed to \n     make recommendation regarding the most effective use of \n     scarce Federal resources. The purpose of the study is to \n     examine key factors associated with the effective and \n     efficient financing and delivery of HIV services (including \n     the quality of services, health outcomes, and cost-\n     effectiveness). The Managers expect that the study would \n     include examination of CARE Act financing of services in \n     relation to existing public sector financing and private \n     health coverage; general demographics and comorbidities of \n     individuals with HIV disease; regional variations in the \n     financing and costs of HIV service delivery; the availability \n     and utility of health outcomes measures and data for \n     measuring quality of Ryan White funded service; and available \n     epidemiologic tools and data sets necessary for local and \n     national resource planning and allocation decisions, \n     including an assessment of implementation of HIV infection \n     reporting, as it impacts these factors.\n       The Managers also require an IOM study focuses on \n     determining the number of newborns with HIV, where the HIV \n     status of the mother is unknown; perinatal HIV transmission \n     reduction efforts in States; and barriers to routine HIV \n     testing of pregnant women and newborns when the mothers' HIV \n     status is unknown. The study is intended to provide States \n     with recommendations on improving perintal prevention \n     services and reducing the number of pediatric HIV/AIDS cases \n     resulting from perinatal transmission.\n       Development of Rapid HIV Test: The Managers encourage the \n     Secretary to expedite the availability of rapid HIV tests \n     which are safe, effective, reliable and affordable. The \n     Managers intend that the National Institutes of Health expand \n     research which may lead to such tests. The Managers also \n     intend that the Director of CDC should take primary \n     responsibility, in conjunction with the Commissioner of Food \n     and Drugs, for a report to Congress on the public health need \n     and recommendations for the expedited review of rapid HIV \n     tests. The Managers believe that the Food and Drug \n     Administration should account for the particular applications \n     and urgent need for rapid HIV tests, as articulated by public \n     health experts and the CDC, when determining the specific \n     requirements to which such tests will be held prior to \n     marketing.\n       Department of Veterans Affairs: The Managers note that the \n     U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest single \n     direct provider of HIV care and services in the country. Over \n     18,000 veterans received HIV care at VA facilities in 1999. \n     Veterans with HIV infection are eligible to participate in \n     Ryan White Title I and Title II programs when they meet \n     eligibility requirements set by EMAs and States, whose plans \n     for the delivery of services must account for the \n     availability of VA services. VA facilities are eligible \n     providers of HIV health and support services where \n     appropriate. The Managers expect that HRSA's Bureau of HIV/\n     AIDS shall encourage Ryan White grantees to develop \n     collaborations between providers and VA facilities to \n     optimize coordination and access to care to all persons with \n     HIV/AIDS.\n       International HIV/AIDS Initiatives: The Managers note that \n     the CARE Act provides a model of service delivery and Federal \n     partnership with States, cities and community-based \n     organizations which should prove valuable in global efforts \n     to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The Managers strongly \n     encourage the Secretary, the Bureau of HIV/AIDS at HRSA, and \n     the CDC to provide technical assistance available to other \n     countries which has already proven invaluable in helping to \n     limit the suffering caused by HIV/AIDS. It is the Managers' \n     hope that the hard-earned knowledge and experience gained in \n     this country can benefit people with HIV/AIDS overseas.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to support the CARE Act \nAmendments of 2000. I commend the many Senators who worked hard and \nwell on the issue of HIV and AIDS. Senator Jeffords and Senator Hatch \nhave championed this issue since 1990 when the CARE Act was first \nproposed, and Senator Frist has been an impressive leader in recent \nyears. Their leadership has and the leadership of many others has \nraised our collective conscience about the HIV/AIDS crisis. Our goal in \nthis legislation is to ensure that citizens with HIV disease continue \nto receive the benefits of advances in therapies and a system of \nsupport that has achieved remarkable success in recent years.\n  For 20 years, America has struggled with the devastation caused by \nHIV/AIDS. It is a virus that knows no color, religion, political \naffiliation, or income status. AIDS continues to kill brothers and \nsisters, children and parents, friends and loved ones--all in the prime \nof their lives. This epidemic knows no geographic boundaries and has no \nmercy on those it strikes. HIV/AIDS has become one of the greatest \npublic health challenges of our times. The CARE Act has directed needed \nresources to accelerate research, develop effective therapies, and \nsupport the 900,000 persons and families living with HIV/AIDS in \nAmerica, and it clearly deserves to be extended and expanded.\n  AIDS has claimed over 420,000 lives so far in the United States and \nit continues to claim the most vulnerable among us, especially women, \nyouth, and minorities. We have good reason to be encouraged by medical \nadvances over the past ten years, but we still face an epidemic that \nkills over 47,000 people each year. Like other epidemics before it, \nAIDS is now hitting hardest in areas where knowledge about the disease \nis scarce and poverty is high. The epidemic has dealt a particularly \nsevere blow on communities of color, which account for 73 percent of \nall new infections. Women account for 30 percent of new infections. \nOver half of new infections occur in persons under 25.\n  An estimated 34 percent of AIDS cases in the U.S. occur in rural \nareas, and this percentage is growing. As the crisis continues year \nafter year, it becomes increasingly difficult for anyone to claim that \nAIDS is someone else's problem. We all share in a very real way in \nbeing touched by the epidemic.\n  Fortunately, we have been able to slow the progression of this \ndevastating disease. Many people living with HIV and AIDS are alive \ntoday and leading longer and healthier lives. AIDS deaths declined by \n20 percent between 1997 and 1998, thanks to advances in care and \neffective new treatments. The smallest increase in new AIDS cases--11 \npercent--took place in 1999, compared with an 18 percent increase in \nnew cases just a year before. We are helping people earlier in their \ndisease progression and keeping them healthier longer.\n  Nevertheless, an estimated 30 percent of persons living with AIDS do \nnot have insurance coverage to pay for costly treatments. As a result, \nheavy demands are placed on community-based organizations and state and \nlocal governments. For these Americans, the CARE Act Amendments of 2000 \nwill continue to provide the only means to obtain the care and \ntreatment they need.\n  In Massachusetts, there has been a 77 percent decline in AIDS and \nHIV-related deaths since 1995. But the number of cases increased in \nwomen by 11 percent from 1997 to 1998. Fifty-five percent of persons \nliving with AIDS in the state are persons of color. Massachusetts is \nfortunate to have a state budget that provides funding for primary \ncare, prevention, and surveillance efforts. But no state is \neconomically sufficient enough to provide the significant financial \nresources needed to enable all persons living with HIV disease to \nobtain the medical and supportive services they need without the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act.\n  The CARE Act will continue to bring hope to the over 600,000 \nindividuals it serves each year in dealing with this devastating \ndisease. This reauthorization builds on past accomplishments, while \nrecognizing the challenge of ensuring access drug treatment for all who \nneed it, reducing health disparities in vulnerable populations, and \nimprove the distribution and quality of services.\n  Funds totaling $3.4 billion over the next five years will target the \nhardest hit 51 metropolitan areas in the country under Title I of the \nAct. Local planning and priority-setting under Title I assures that \neach of the eligible metropolitan areas responds to local HIV/AIDS \nneeds. Safeguards are put in place to ensure that Title I areas are \nprotected from drastic shifts in funding that can destabilize their HIV \ncare infrastructure by limiting these losses to a maximum of 15 percent \nover its FY 2000 levels without compounded the effects of the loss from \nyear to year. We also have assured EMAs the opportunity to reset the \nclock each time they find they do not need hold harmless protection in \norder to allow them\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\nthe needed time and resources to plan prioritize, and redirect \nresources in response to major shifts that may occur in funding and in \nthe local epidemic.\n  Under Title II, $4.4 billion over the next five years will provide \nemergency relief to assist states in developing their HIV health care \ninfrastructure. These funds will also provide life-sustaining drugs to \nover 61,000 persons each month. In addition, these funds will provide \nassistance for emerging communities that are increasingly affected by \nHIV/AIDS, but do not currently qualify for additional assistance, while \nassuring that base Title II funding losses do not occur in any fiscal \nyear for any state or territory.\n  Title III programs will receive $730 million during the five year \nperiod to assist over 200 local health centers and other primary health \ncare providers in communities with a significant and disproportionate \nneed for HIV care. Many of these communities are located in the hardest \nhit areas, serving low income communities. An additional $30 million in \nfunds under Title III will provide planning and capacity development \ngrants for hard-to-reach urban and rural communities.\n  In Title IV, $2700 million over the next five years will be used to \nmeet the specific needs of women, infants, youth, and families. An \nadditional $42 million will assure that oral health care is available \nto persons with HIV/AIDS who are uninsured. One hundred and forty-one \nmillion dollars in funding over the five-year period will assure that \nwe continue our investment in improving the skills of the healthcare \nworkforce.\n  In total, the CARE Act will authorize over $8.5 billion in funding to \nfight HIVS/AIDS over the next five years.\n  I commend the dedication of the AIDS community and the Administration \nin working with Congress over the past year to bring forward the best \npossible legislation. I also commend Sean Donohue and William Fleming \nof Senator Jeffords' staff, Dave Larsen of Senator Frist's staff, and \nStephanie Robinson and Idalia Sanchez of my staff for their effective \nwork on this landmark legislation.\n  The Senate's action today reaffirms our long-standing commitment to \nprovide greater help to those with HIV/AIDS and to families touched by \nthis devastating disease. America has the resources to win the battle \nagainst AIDS. We must face this disease with the same courage \ndemonstrated by Ryan White, the young man with hemophilia who \ncontracted AIDS through blood transfusions, and for whom the original \nact was named. Ryan White touched the world's heart through his valiant \neffort to speak out against the ignorance and discrimination faced by \npersons living with AIDS. This legislation carries on his brave work \nand I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to acknowledge the final \nSenate passage of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 today, \nwhich follows the actions of House of Representatives earlier this \nmorning. This important bill forms a unique partnership between \nfederal, local, and state governments; non-profit community \norganizations, health care and supportive service providers. For the \nlast decade, this Act has successfully provided much needed assistance \nin health care costs and support services for low-income, uninsured and \nunderinsured individuals with HIV/AIDS.\n  Through programs such as the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, ADAP, \nwhich provides access to pharmaceuticals, the CARE Act has helped \nextend and even save lives. Last year alone, nearly 100,000 people \nliving with HIV and AIDS received access to drug therapy because of the \nCARE Act. Half the people served by the CARE Act have family incomes of \nless than $10,000 annually, which is less than the $12,000 annual \naverage cost of new drug ``cocktails'' for treatment. The CARE Act is \ncritical in ensuring that the number of people living with AIDS \ncontinues to increase, as effective new drug therapies are keeping HIV-\ninfected persons healthy longer and dramatically reducing the death \nrate. Investments in enabling patients with HIV to live healthier and \nmore productive lives have helped to reduce overall health costs. For \nexample, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the \nnation has seen a 30 percent decline in HIV related hospitalizations, \nproducing nearly one million fewer HIV related hospital days and a \nsavings of more than $1 billion.\n  During the 104th Congress, I had the pleasure of working with Senator \nKassebaum on the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 to ensure that \nthis needed law was extended. Senator Jeffords, who has done a terrific \njob in crafting this bill, has already outlined some specifics of this \nlegislation, however, I would like to conclude by discussing a specific \nprovision which I am grateful Senator Jeffords included in this \nreauthorization.\n  This bill contains a provision, under Title II of this Act, \naddressing the fact that the face of this disease is changing as AIDS \nmoves into communities which have not been impacted as great as several \nTitle I grantees. One important aspect of this provision is the \ncreation of supplemental grants for emerging metropolitan communities, \nwhich do not qualify for Title I funding but have reported between 500 \nand 2,000 AIDS cases in the last five years. For cities that have \nbetween 1,000 and 2,000 AIDS cases this provision would provide cities, \nincluding Memphis and Nashville, at least $5 million in new funding to \ndivide each year, or 25 percent of new monies under Title II, whichever \nis greater. For cities with 500 to 999 AIDS cases in the last five \nyears, at least $5 million in new funding each year will be divided, or \n25 percent of new monies under Title II, whichever is greater. This \nprovision will be implemented as soon as the appropriation level for \nTitle II, excluding the ADAP program, is increased by $20 million above \nthe FY2000 funding level. Once implemented, this program would remain \nin place every year after the initial trigger level is met with at \nleast $10 million coming from the Title II funding to support this \nneeded effort.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Jeffords for his \nleadership on this issue, and Sean Donohue and William Fleming of his \nstaff for all their expertise in drafting this bill. I would also like \nto thank Senator Kennedy and Stephanie Robinson of his staff for their \nwork and dedication to this issue. And finally I would like to think \nDave Larson and Mary Sumpter Johnson of my health staff for their work \non passage of this bill.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}]
