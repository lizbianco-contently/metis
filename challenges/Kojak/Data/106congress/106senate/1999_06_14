Madam President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate \nwill begin consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill \nwith amendments expected to be offered throughout the day. Votes were \nscheduled to occur at 5:30 p.m. However, we expect to reach an \nagreement, hopefully within the next few minutes, requiring Senators to \nfile amendments to the energy and water appropriations bill by 5 \no'clock today. Assuming that is agreed to, then there would be no votes \ntoday.\n  As a reminder, a series of votes will occur on Tuesday beginning at \n2:15 p.m., and the first votes in the series will be on the completion \nof the Y2K legislation, to be followed by cloture votes on the Social \nSecurity lockbox issue and the oil, gas, and steel appropriations bill.\n  So we will have three votes at 2:15, and we may even have additional \nvotes at that time because we could have amendments that will have to \nbe voted on with regard to the energy and water appropriations bill and \neven, hopefully, final passage.\n  For the remainder of the week, we expect to complete the energy and \nwater appropriations bill no later than the close of business Tuesday. \nToday, I will file cloture on the House-passed Social Security lockbox \nbill, with that cloture vote occurring on Wednesday. We also expect to \ncontinue with the appropriations bills process when they become \navailable, hopefully disposing of all that would be available to us. \nThat could include the military construction appropriations bill, \nlegislative branch, transportation, and State-Justice-Commerce.\n  I realize we can't do all those this week, but we will work with the \nDemocratic leadership to see if we can maybe do one or more of those \nbills in a short period of time. We also have entered into an agreement \nwith regard to State Department authorization, with a limited amount of \ntime and, I presume, a limited number of amendments. We will try to \nfind an opportunity to do that this week. Perhaps Friday morning we \ncould take up that bill and complete action on it by noon, and that \nwould be the final vote of the week.\n  Therefore, I think Members should be aware now votes will occur on \nFriday. This will be a very busy week with votes occurring every day, \nand we probably will go into the evening at least on Thursday. But it \nwill depend on how things proceed.\n  Let me take a moment now to express, frankly, my disappointment in \nthe Senate at the number of Senators who have indicated they will not \nbe here or would not be here for a vote late this afternoon. Senator \nDaschle and I have discussed the dates on Mondays or Fridays when we \nknew we would not have votes. We have advised Members of that. That was \ntrue last month, and we have indicated a couple dates here in the next \nmonth or so. But unless we say there will not be votes, Members should \nexpect to have votes occur sometime after 5 o'clock on Mondays and up \nuntil 12 o'clock on Fridays.\n\n  Because of the large number of Senators who were not going to be able \nto be here this afternoon, we have decided to defer the votes until \ntomorrow. But that inconveniences other Senators, some of whom came all \nthe way back across the country to be ready to vote at 5 o'clock, only \nto find that because of the number of Senators who say they are not \ncoming back, we are not going to have a vote.\n  So I am very disappointed in that. I have to assume some of the \nresponsibility because we could go ahead and say we are going to vote \nat 5:30. But I\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\ndo have to take into consideration that we do have a large number of \nSenators who would not be present for a vote.\n  So I am taking this opportunity to publicly admonish the Senate as a \nwhole. Last week, I had Senators who said, well, we shouldn't vote on \nTuesday morning. I had some Senators say we can't be here at Thursday \nnoon. If it continues at this pace, we will have votes stacked in \nsequence on Wednesday afternoon at 3 o'clock, which would suit me fine, \nbut I don't think it is a very good way to do business. I do intend to \nhave votes on Fridays so we can complete our work. It is not that I \nnecessarily want them; it is because we have to have them in order to \ncomplete our work. So I hope Senators will plan on being here on \nMondays and Fridays because we do assure them that there will be no \nvotes before 5 and no votes after 12. But I was very disappointed in \nwhat the whip check looked like for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6922-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I do want to note that for the first time \nin history, within the last month, the Senate leadership has selected \nour first woman to be the Senate legal counsel, and she is Pat Bryan. \nShe has served at the Justice Department and at the White House in the \npast. She is highly capable, and we are delighted to have her joining \nthe Senate in this very important position. But my reason for wanting \nto comment this morning is to talk a moment about the position and to \ntalk about her predecessor who served as legal counsel.\n  Among the officers of the Senate, one of the least known is the \nSenate Legal Counsel. There is a reason for that.\n  The Legal Counsel usually works out of the limelight, away from \npublicity, serving the Senate with a certain anonymity that is \nappropriate for the very important responsibilities of the office.\n  The Office of the Legal Counsel is, in effect, the Senate's own law \nfirm. Its staff handles any litigation concerning the Senate or its \nMembers acting in their official capacity.\n  The Senate Legal Counsel also advises the Senate, not about \nlegislation, but about legal matters of all sorts. The most recent and \nmost dramatic instance, of course, was the impeachment trial of \nPresident Clinton.\n  Throughout that extraordinary experience, our Legal Counsel, Thomas \nB. Griffith, played a crucial role in shaping our procedures.\n  He assured the legal propriety of everything we did, keeping us, \nalong with the Parliamentarian, true to the Senate's rules and \nprecedents.\n  The meticulousness he brought to our labors was characteristic of \nTom's work, as was the unflappable demeanor and unwavering courtesy he \nshowed throughout the impeachment ordeal.\n  With gratitude for Tom's service to the Senate for the last four \nyears, and yet with deep regret at the prospect of losing him, I must \nreport that he will be rejoining his former law firm of Wiley, Rein, \nand Fielding.\n  It is customary on occasions like this to say that we all wish him \nwell. In this case, that is an understatement.\n  We wish Tom the best, as he deserves, for that is what he has given \nto the Senate.\n  One example of his dedication should suffice. Tom lives quite a \ndistance away from Washington, considerably outside the Beltway even, \nin Lovettsville, Virginia.\n  During the weeks of the impeachment proceedings, Tom left his family \nthere and moved closer to the Capitol, to be always available to us \nhere, spending perhaps one day a week with Susan and the children.\n  I want all of them--Chelsea, Megan, Robbie, Erin, Torre, and Tanne--\nto know that, during those weeks when they must have sorely missed \ntheir dad, he was serving his country in a very important way.\n  That kind of selfless service has always been a part of Tom's life, \nfrom his days as a missionary in Zimbabwe with the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints through his activities with the Federalist \nSociety.\n  His example of integrity and commitment to the highest ideals of the \nlaw has brought honor to the Senate. He leaves us now with our \naffection and our enduring gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6922-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WELCOME TO THE NEW SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today is Flag Day. Utahns, and indeed \nAmericans all across our great country, revere the flag as the unique \nsymbol of the United States and of the principles, ideals, and values \nfor which our country stands. Who can forget the majestic image of the \nMarines raising Old Glory on the island of Iwo Jima during World War II \nor of school children pledging their allegiance to the American flag?\n  Over the years, the love and devotion our diverse people have for the \nAmerican flag has been reflected in the actions of our legislatures. \nDuring the Civil War, for example, Congress awarded the Medal of Honor \nto Union soldiers who rescued the flag from falling into rebel hands.\n  During World War I, the National Conference of Commissioners on \nUniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Flag Act that numerous state \nlegislatures adopted to prohibit flag desecration.\n  Congress declared the ``Star Spangled Banner'' to be our national \nanthem.\n  In 1949, Congress expressed the love the American people for their \nflag by establishing June 14 as Flag Day. Congress also adopted ``The \nPledge of Allegiance to the Flag'' and the manner of its recitation \nwhich millions of school children observe each school day.\n  In 1968, Congress adopted a federal statute to prohibit flag \ndesecration. More recently, Congress designated John Philip Sousa's \n``The Stars and Stripes Forever'' as the national march.\n  As with numerous societal interests that affect free speech, \nlegislatures of 48 States and the federal government and the courts \nalso have long respected society's interest in protecting the flag by \nbalancing this interest against the individual's interest in conveying \na message through the means of destruction of the flag instead of \nthrough the means of oral or written speech.\n  The Supreme Court continues to strike the balance in favor of \nsociety's interests in public safety, national security, protection \nfrom obscenity, libel, and the protection of children even though these \ninterests can and do implicate the First Amendment.\n  In the 1989 case of Texas v. Johnson, however, the Supreme Court \nabandoned the traditional balance in favor of society's interest in \nprotecting the flag and adopted an absolute protection for the \nindividual's interest in communicating through the means of physically \ndestroying the American flag.\n  Congress responded to the Johnson decision with a statutory attempt \nto restore balanced protection to the physical integrity of the \nAmerican flag--the Flag Protection Act of 1989. However, in the 1990 \ncase of United States v. Eichman, the Supreme Court relied on the new \nrule it created in Johnson to reject statutory protection of the flag.\n  The recent reintroduction of another flag protection statute, which \nhas been introduced in prior Congresses, is also clearly unenforceable \nunder the Johnson and Eichman precedents. Even Professor Lawrence \nTribe, a defender of the statute struck down in Eichman, has stated \nthat the reintroduced statute cannot be upheld under the new rule of \nJohnson and Eichman.\n  Moreover, in the 1992 case of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, the Supreme \nCourt clearly stated that it will no longer uphold statutory protection \nof the flag from desecration. Accordingly, the only realistic way to \nrestore traditional balanced protection for the flag is with a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  In March of this year, Senator Cleland and I introduced Senate Joint \nResolution 14, a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag.\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\n This amendment restores balanced protection to the flag by allowing \nCongress to prohibit only the physical desecration of the flag, while \nretaining the full existing freedoms for oral and written speech.\n  Thus, a would-be flag burner would still be able to convey his \nparticular message by speaking at a rally, writing to a newspaper, and \nvoting at the ballot box. He would not, however, be able to burn a flag \nor to stuff a flag into a toilet, as has been done since the Johnson \nand Eichman decisions.\n  Nearly 80 percent of the American people and 49 state legislatures \nsupport the constitutional amendment to restore balanced protection to \nthe American flag. By sending this amendment to the States for \nratification, Congress would help restore traditional balanced \nprotection for the flag while protecting the robust freedom of \nexpression that Americans enjoyed when the Marines raised the flag over \nIwo Jima and when Congress created Flag Day.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: What is \nthe subject matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 1186.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the energy and water appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I understand--is this correct--Senator Reid has \nprocured a unanimous consent agreement that all amendments will be \nfiled to this bill by 5 this afternoon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me thank Senator Reid very much for doing that. We have all been \nworking to try to make sure that as this week fills up with other kinds \nof votes, on everything from Y2K to the lockbox and other things, we be \ngiven ample opportunity to get this bill passed.\n  We worked very hard under the leadership and direction of our \nchairman, Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of the full committee, to get \nthis bill ready and to get it out here as soon as possible. This will \nbe the second full Appropriations Committee bill that will be before \nthe Senate. If it passes in the next few days, we will be on some kind \nof a record in terms of our ability to get a large number of the \nappropriation bills done in a very timely manner.\n  For that, I am grateful to the chairman and ranking member of the \nfull committee for the amount of resources that were given to this \ncommittee. I will begin with an explanation of how we tried to respond \nto the allocation of resources.\n  First of all, this is an interesting bill, interesting in the sense \nthat it is not very rational in that you have two things mixed that are \nabout as far apart in the spectrum of prioritizing and need as you \ncould get. All of the nuclear weapons research and development for all \nof our bombs and all of our safeguards and all of our great research is \nin this bill. That has been and is still defense work. It is work for \nthe defense of our country. We get money for this because it is a \ndefense function. When we had the walls up wherein you could not spend \ndefense money for anything else, the money that came into this bill for \nthat purpose came right out of the defense total.\n  There is another piece of this bill that has to do with water and \nwater resources, not as they relate to anything nuclear, just water and \nwater resources, various inland waterways, various dams, various dikes, \nCorps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, those kinds of activities, \nand a myriad of flood protection projects, because the Federal \nGovernment, over time, has been a major player with the States in a \nmatching program with reference to flood protection.\n  Then sitting kind of in the middle but aligned with those water \nprojects are things that the Department of Energy does that are not \ndefense oriented. We call those the nondefense energy projects, \nresearch of various types that is not necessarily or even required to \nbe related to the defense activities I have just described.\n  So in a very real sense, it is kind of comprehensive and a mix of \nvarious funding requirements of our country that do not mesh.\n  We started from the beginning saying there are certain resources that \ncome to this committee from the full Appropriations Committee that are \nclearly for the purposes of the defense of our Nation. We have taken \nthose resources and said that all of the resources we are getting from \nthe Appropriations Committee which have historically been for defense \nwill be used for defense only. To the best of our ability, we have not \nused any defense money; that is, defense nuclear money, and defense \nhaving safe weapons, the nuclear stockpile, the stewardship stockpile--\nwe have used defense money for that--we have not in any case taken some \nof that money or any of that money and used it for water projects or \nused it for nondefense Department of Energy work.\n  I would like to keep it that way. I have no power of the Budget \nCommittee or points of order to keep it that way, because we, in \ncompromising, when we put the 5-year Balanced Budget Act together, \nbipartisan, and executive branch with the President, had walls between \ndefense and nondefense for 3 years, and then it was discretionary for \nthe last 2. We are in the last 2 now.\n  I have, nonetheless, with the assistance of my ranking member, kept \ndefense money for defense programs and not put it into nondefense \ndomestic energy programs or in water projects.\n  On nondefense energy projects--I will just mention one--there is an \namendment pending to do more with solar and renewable energy. That is \nnot a defense activity. We have done the best we could, but we have not \nused any defense money for that. I hope when we see the amendment, \nsince one is going to be forthcoming, that they followed that pattern \nand have not taken it out of the defense activities, because with what \nwe know about the world, with what we know about Russia and the\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\nhard feelings that exist, what we know about the Chinese and their \nmoving as quickly as they can toward a nuclear empire of their own with \nreference to weapons--and we have agreed that we are not going to do \nany underground testing whether or not we pass the treaty on nuclear \ntesting or not; we have agreed not to do any--it is absolutely \nimportant and imperative we prove we can maintain our nuclear stockpile \nwith adequate safeguards and that it is standing the test of time.\n  What we need to do that with is the new program called science-based \nstockpile stewardship. The occupant of the Chair is an expert in some \nof these areas and has worked long and hard in the House. I thank him \nfor a lot of the help he gave in trying to reorganize the Department of \nEnergy, which will continue to come up even after the Rudman report \ntoday. I am sure it will be before us again. I believe the occupant of \nthe Chair, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, has constantly \nraised the question, Will stockpile stewardship work? Will science-\nbased stockpile stewardship work? Will substituting computers and new \nkinds of systems that can take x ray-type pictures of what is going on \ninside one of our nuclear weapons, even far more sophisticated than \nthat, that knows what is going on--that is the substitute for testing \nin an underground mode that we have done for many decades in getting \nour weapons to be the best and most safe in the world--if that isn't \nworking, then obviously everybody has to rethink where we are with \nreference to underground testing.\n  So I don't want to shortchange science-based stockpile stewardship. \nThere are three or four aspects of it that are very expensive--the \ndevelopment of certain buildings and certain technology. We are not \nfinished with them yet. We are maybe halfway finished. We have about \nhalf more to go, including the gigantic, new process we are building at \nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which has the initials NIF, \nNational Ignition Facility.\n  The Senate is now considering Calendar No. 128, the Energy and Water \nAct for Fiscal Year 2000. As we begin, there is a technical error in \nthe bill as reported by the committee. I will send to the desk, with \nthe full understanding of my ranking member, a correction to that \nerror. It has been cleared by both sides. I ask unanimous consent that, \nafter I send it to the desk for reading, it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 625\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 625.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 28, line 5, strike $39,549,000 and insert: \n     ``$28,000,000''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 625) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on June 2 the Committee on \nAppropriations reported Senate bill 1186, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Act for the year 2000.\n  As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the recommendation would \nprovide $21.2 billion in new budget authority, $12.6 billion within \ndefense, and $8.6 billion within nondefense. In the defense accounts, \nthat amounts to a $220 million increase over the request; in the \nnondefense accounts--that is including the water project--it amounts to \na $608 million reduction from the request.\n  For the first time in memory, the recommendation before us provides \nless money for water projects than was requested. We have reduced some \nenergy research, nondefense environment management, science, and the \nDepartment of Energy's administration accounts.\n  In fact, in order to accommodate some serious shortfalls in the \nPresident's request and some very legitimate requests from Members, we \nhave cut a significant amount more than $608 million that we are short \nfrom that request. For example, the recommendation before us restores \nthe $81 million for the Power Marketing Administration to provide power \nto their customers. That was left out of the President's request, and \nwe had to cut other programs, above the $608 million, to provide these \nfunds.\n  As we have made these reductions, we have tried to follow certain \ncriteria. In the water accounts, for example:\n  Where the President fully funded or provided advance appropriations \nfor special projects, such as the Everglades, Columbia River Fish \nMigration, and the CALFED project, we have brought those programs back \ndown in line with other accounts, but we have funded them.\n  Second, projects included in the budget at the capability level, in \nthis year when we will not be able to fund projects at their full \ncapability, have been reduced to no more than 85 percent of capability.\n  Third, items where the budget request was significantly increased \nover the current year's level of funding have been reduced to bring \nthem back in line with the fiscal year 1999 levels.\n  We have not included unauthorized projects or projects contained in \nthe water resources development bill, called WRDA 99, which is still in \nconference.\n  Finally, a significant amount of previously appropriated and unused \nfunding has been used to finance the fiscal year 2000 program or \nrecommended for rescission in order to save outlays.\n  Having said that, the recommendation for the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers is still at $3.723 billion. That is $182.6 million below the \nbudget request and $374.1 million below the fiscal year 1999 enacted \nlevel.\n  Moving on to the Bureau of Reclamation, the recommendation before the \ncommittee totals $756.2 million. This is $100 million below the budget \nrequest and $24 million below the current year level. Within this \naccount, the largest single reduction is from the request for the bay \ndelta restoration Program, and we can go into more details on other \nprojects.\n  From the Department of Energy's nondefense accounts, we have \nproposed--because we don't have sufficient money--some substantial \nreductions from the President's request.\n  For example, the recommendation for solar and renewable energy is \n$348.9 million. That is $3.4 million over the level the committee \nrecommended a year ago, but it is less than the President asked for.\n\n  We have also gone through all of the DOE accounts and found $41 \nmillion in unobligated balances from old projects and programs, and we \nhave gone so far as to rescind $1,000 from an old program that hasn't \nbeen around in years, to make those funds available for this act.\n  Within the defense allocation, we have been able to add some funds, \nbecause we were given a slight increase by the Appropriations Committee \nfrom that account. To the extent possible, we have tried to recognize \nthe needs of Members with environmental management sites. We have \nprovided increases at Savannah River and the Hanford site as well as \nRocky Flats where DOE is on track to complete this cleanup by 2006. \nLet's hope we can stay on track and celebrate that event soon. I am \nwell aware that more funds could be justified to increase the pace of \ncleanup at those sites, but we simply don't have the necessary \nresources.\n  Within weapons activities, we have begun a major realignment among \nthe defense laboratories. As we have taken some nuclear weapons designs \nout of the stockpile, an imbalance has been created between Livermore \nand Los Alamos in my State. To ensure that balance is retained between \nthem, we have transferred responsibility for one warhead design from \nLos Alamos to Lawrence Livermore. We have also expanded certain \noperations at the Nevada Test Site and initiated a microelectronics \ncapability, a new technology which will make our weapons safer in the \nfuture, and at the same time may make some breakthroughs for American \nindustry and for future uses that may bring microengineering and \nmicroelectronics into our everyday lives in a very big way.\n  The Defense Authorization Act was recently passed by the Senate, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\nIntelligence Authorization Act will come to the floor next week, \nperhaps. It is my hope that is where issues related to the Cox \nCommission report and allegations of espionage at our laboratories will \nbe addressed. The recommendation before you does not include any broad \neffort in that regard. It is an appropriations bill, not an authorizing \nbill.\n  Now, obviously, I am hopeful that nobody will offer broad changes to \nthe structure of DOE and moving toward better security within DOE. As I \nsay, it is not an authorizing bill; it is an appropriations bill. The \nextent to which we can predict the action taken on the authorizing bill \nso far will necessitate funding in this regard. We have made some \nadjustments.\n  We have increased funding for security investigations from $30 \nmillion to $45 million. We have increased funding for counter-\nintelligence from the requested level of $31 million to $39 million--we \nare proposing to more than double the funding of $15.6 million the \nCommittee provided last year. Finally, because some have raised \nconcerns about materials security, the recommendation provides an \nincrease of $10 million for physical security.\n  In summary, the recommendation before you is for $21.2 billion, a \nreduction of $380.8 million from the request.\n  It is our intention to work, if we have to, late tonight, but with \nthe unanimous consent agreement that was entered into, obviously we \nwill know by 5 o'clock the extent to which we will be working on the \nfloor handling various amendments. We will be here all afternoon.\n  I personally urge colleagues on my side--I hope that Senator Reid \nwill urge his on his side--to bring any amendments they may have to the \nfloor so we can consider them today.\n  It is my intention to shortly--after all amendments have been filed--\nact on a package of managers' amendments. We will not do that \nimmediately. We will wait a while.\n  I yield the floor and turn the podium over to my distinguished \nranking member, Senator Reid. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the State of California has 35 million \npeople. It is a State of great contrast. It is an agricultural \nproducer, to say the least. It produces more agricultural products than \nany State in the Union. Yet it is also heavy into tourism. It is heavy \ninto recreational endeavors, and also has these huge cities--Los \nAngeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Jose. It is very difficult to \ndevelop a balance between these various competing interests.\n  One of the things in this legislation that we have been asked to do \nis to step into this delicate balance. The California Bay Delta--or \nCALFED, as it is called--is a project that is going to have a \ntremendous impact on these competing interests in the State of \nCalifornia.\n  This program, as I have indicated, has environmental interests, urban \ninterests, agricultural interests, and tourism interests. We have been \nasked as a subcommittee to provide hundreds of millions of dollars for \nthe bay delta system, which provides potable water for two-thirds of \nthis huge State.\n  I don't know the latest numbers, but California as a country would be \nthe eighth largest country in the world. I think that is the number.\n  We have been asked in this subcommittee to step in and provide huge \namounts of money for this bay delta project, which, as I have \nindicated, provides water for two-thirds of California's homes, \nbusinesses, and irrigation for more than 7 million acres of farmland.\n  Additionally, this system provides habitat for at least 120 different \nspecies of fish and wildlife. Some are already listed  as threatened or \nendangered.\n\n  CALFED has been tasked with the development of long-term solutions \nfor the complex system that we call bay delta, including certain water \nsupplies, aging levies, and threatened water quality. Our bill has $50 \nmillion for this project. This isn't enough. It needs more.\n  Those are some of the responsibilities that we have.\n  I say to my friend, the chairman of the full Budget Committee, and \nchairman of this subcommittee, the senior Senator from New Mexico, that \nwe have worked hard on this bill. I appreciate his consideration on the \nissues that have been developed.\n  The problem is that with all 13 appropriations bills we simply just \ndo not have enough money. This has been a very tough year. But we have \nworked within the constraints of what we have been given to come up \nwith the best possible bill that we could.\n  I mentioned the California Bay Delta project as an example of how \nimportant this subcommittee is.\n  There are 13 subcommittees. We have already passed the defense \nappropriations bill. This will be the second bill, leaving 11 bills. I \ndon't know what is going to happen in the future with all of the bills. \nSome of them are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get passed.\n  The HUD-independent agencies is really a difficult bill with the \n302(b) allocations that they have. The bill dealing with Health and \nHuman Services is a very difficult bill dealing with issues that affect \nthe health and safety of this country.\n  We, the senior Senator from New Mexico and I, cannot be prospective \nin nature about other subcommittees. We can only do the best we can \nwith our subcommittee. We have done the very best we could with our \nsubcommittee.\n  I support this bill. I have already indicated that we don't have \nenough money. But I would like to see anyone do a better job than we \nhave done. It has taken tremendous amounts of our time, and, of course, \nthe staff has worked day and night for many weeks. If you look at the \nresponsibilities that we have with this subcommittee, they are really \nsignificant.\n  The manager of the bill has talked about the Army Corps of Engineers. \nIt is very important. It does things that only the Corps of Engineers \ncan do.\n  Take the State of Nevada. The Corps of Engineers used to be very \nimportant for water projects. Now the Corps of Engineers, with the \nrapidly growing Las Vegas area, is extremely integral to developing a \nsystem so people do not drown, so they don't lose personal property \nwhen these floods hit this metropolitan area.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation in the early years in Nevada--it was the \nsame all over the western part of the United States--was concerned \nabout Boulder Dam and Hoover Dam. Now the Bureau of Reclamation has \nother responsibilities that are just as important.\n  The Department of Energy, the atomic energy defense activities, the \nPower Marketing Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Defense Nuclear \nFacilities Safety Board, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear \nWaste Technical Review Board, the Tennessee Valley Authority--these are \nthe  responsibilities that the senior Senator from New Mexico and I \nhave with this bill.\n\n  Every one of these issues for the States in which the facilities are \nfound will be most important as we deal with this bill this year.\n  We recognize how important this legislation is. There is no secret \nthat the budget caps have a devastating effect on the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. But that is the way it is. \nWater projects have an impact on communities around the United States.\n  The point I want to make is that with this bill people start to talk \nabout pork. Try to explain to the people of the State of California, \nwith 35 million people, where pork is involved in this CALFED project. \nRemember, it deals with competing interests, all of which support our \nbill.\n  The question is, Can we provide them with enough money to make sure \nthis project stays on line?\n  This bill affects individuals and projects--people and States. It is \nimportant for their lives and for the safety and health of communities. \nThe decisions that we have made have been extremely difficult \ndecisions, because we realize that the decisions we make put people out \nof work, put people to work, and change priorities in different \ncommunities.\n  I have mentioned briefly the CALFED project. The State of Nevada is \nnot much into dredging ports and harbors. The fact of the matter is \nthat the two managers from the State of New Mexico and the State of \nNevada have responsibilities to make sure there is appropriate money \nfor dredging ports and harbors along both the\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\nAtlantic and Pacific coastlines as well as the Gulf of Mexico. This is \nthe project for the Corps of Engineers.\n  It is important on an annual basis for U.S. ports and harbors to \nhandle hundreds of billions of dollars--approaching $1 trillion--in \ninternational cargo, generating to this country and local and State \nentities over $150 billion in tax revenues every year.\n  Even though the State of Nevada is basically a desert State, the \nState of New Mexico, while not as much desert as Nevada, is also a \nState that has its share of desert. This is important for us; it is \nimportant for the Senate; it is important for the country that we do \nwhat is right regarding dredging ports and harbors.\n  Navigational improvements in New York and New Jersey include things \ncalled the Arthur Kill Channel and the Howland Hook Marine Terminal \nproject. This project includes deepening, widening, and selective \nrealignments of the channel to allow deep draft container vessels \naccess to this marine terminal.\n  This is an ongoing problem. Once you dredge a port, it doesn't mean \nyou are not going to have to dredge it again. This is an ongoing \nproblem, and this subcommittee is responsible for making sure that \nthese ports can compete with the rest of the world.\n  The New Jersey and New York ports account for 34 percent of the \nNation's trade in petroleum, automobiles, many food products, and \nimport goods bound for all of the Northeast and upper Midwest, \nsupporting nearly 170,000 jobs. When we cut back, when these ports are \nnot dredged properly, when we do not do the things that need to be done \nto make sure these ports are capable of handling this cargo, people \nlose their jobs.\n  The ports of the Northeast are not alone. There are 25 ports around \nthe coast of the United States that take in over 26 million tons of \ncargo annually. Fourteen of these ports have total trades of over $50 \nmillion in cargo. That says a lot.\n  Continuing to maintain the ports and harbors requires a long-term \ncommitment in the budget process, as does shoreline protection on which \nso many communities around the country rely. In the city of Virginia \nBeach, VA--I have never been to Virginia Beach, VA--this year we are \nattempting to fund a program at $17 million because a hurricane hit \nVirginia Beach and almost destroyed the beach. The construction of \nVirginia Beach began 3 years ago. Benefits have already been realized \nbecause the damage from Hurricane Bonnie was minimal to the unfinished \nportions of the project. The project was not in the budget request sent \nto Congress, but a $247 million project needs to be completed in a city \nthat has invested over $100 million in infrastructure over the last 5 \nyears, and that has been matched by $100 million in private investment. \nThe Federal Government doesn't do all this all alone, but it should do \nits share.\n  Additionally, the U.S. Navy megaport, Naval Air Station Oceana, \ndirectly benefits from the project at Virginia Beach with its personnel \nincreased by as many as 6,000 sailors and family members recently being \ntransferred to the base.\n  I personally recently voted for the base closure amendment before \nthis body. I did it because I think if we are going to save money, we \nare going to have to do some of the things the military says need to be \ndone. The military has stated a large amount of money can be saved by \neliminating bases around the world and certainly in the United States. \nOne way we can do this is to make sure we take care of those businesses \nthat we know are lasting in nature. Naval Air Station Oceana is one of \nthose. As a result of the additional work there, which we participated \nin, we have had 6,000 additional sailors and family members transferred \nto that base.\n  Who would think that the Corps of Engineers would be involved in \nanything in Nebraska? There are a number of important projects in \nNebraska. I could point to every State in the Union, although I have \nbeen somewhat selective. The Corps of Engineers has been given the \nresponsibility of environmental restoration in various parts of the \ncountry, not the least of which is Nebraska.\n  One of the projects I want to discuss today is the Ponca State Park \nin Nebraska. This park lies on a 59-mile stretch of the Missouri River. \nWe are spending a relatively small amount on Ponca, $1 million, but it \nis very important. Education is a primary component of gaining support \nfor additional environmental activities that people believe need to be \ndone. Through efforts of Ponca State Park, the public will be able to \nunderstand the environmental and water management problems of the \nMissouri River basin and potential solutions to its problems.\n  The Corps is also playing an integral role in the multiagency effort \nto restore segments of the Missouri River to something resembling what \nLewis and Clark saw as they searched for the Northwest River Passage, \nthe Pacific Ocean.\n  Working with Senators, particularly Bob Kerrey, the Corps expects to \npropose a plan this fall for managing the Missouri River with more \nemphasis in protecting native wildlife and their habitat and \nfacilitating outdoor recreation, while not compromising traditional \ndownstream uses of the river.\n  We need to also talk about Nevada. We have had Law Review articles \nwritten about this project in Nevada. There have been seminars held \nusing the model we used in Nevada for how to solve water problems in \nthe western part of the United States. President Bush signed a bill of \nhis Presidency where we put to rest a 100-year water war between the \nStates of California and Nevada in the Truckee and Carson Rivers. We \nsettled problems that had been outstanding for many years, including \nproblems between two Indian tribes, and there were two endangered \nspecies involved--a wetlands had gone from 100,000 very nice acres of \nmarshlands with all kinds of birds, fish, and other animals to about \n1,000 very toxic acres where fish were all but dead and birds could no \nlonger nest there.\n  We solved problems in the agricultural area, also, in the cities of \nReno and Sparks. The reason I mention this, money for solving this \nproblem for so many years came from the Bureau of Reclamation, the \nCorps of Engineers. We have put money in this project over the years \nand have generally resolved these issues that have been so difficult.\n  Remember, the Federal Government is not the only one involved. The \nState legislature this year appropriated $4 million to help with some \nprojects along the river; the private sector agreed to come up with $3 \nmillion.\n  As I have indicated with the situation in Nevada, Nebraska, \nCalifornia, the port areas in New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, they \nare essential to the well-being--commercial well-being, the financial \nwell-being, and the economic well-being--of this country. These are not \nprojects in the sense that somebody is getting something for nothing. \nThese projects are vital to the interests of the communities they \nserve.\n  I am very gratified with the work we have been able to do in this \nbill with so little money. There is much more that needs to be done and \nshould be done. We don't have the money. However, we are doing so much \ngood for the country in this legislation that it is important Members \nof the Senate and the American public understand how important this \nrelatively small subcommittee is.\n  As the manager of the bill indicated, we not only deal with these \nprograms which I have talked about that are nondefense in nature, but \nthere are other nondefense programs that deal with our energy supply. \nWe have been cut here. We are not going to be able to supply these \nprograms, these alternate energy programs that I am such a strong \nbeliever in, unless money comes from the defense programs, which it \nshould not. I think that would not be the right thing to do.\n  We have to have priorities and make decisions. Energy supply programs \nare reduced by $12 million from the current year, and from within this \nprogram we fund science, such as fusion research which is conducted at \nuniversities and labs around the country. Also funded in energy supply \nare solar and renewable technologies, which I believe are a key to the \nfuture energy sources in our society.\n\n  For Members who say we should spend more on solar and renewable \nenergies, what will we offset? It has to be offset. Finding an offset \nwill be very difficult to do.\n  We all know how important it is to provide for a secure and cheap \nsupply\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nof acceptable energy. For continued economic growth, the maintenance of \nour current business climate and global environment depend on cheap \nenergy. The research and development investments in this bill are \ncertainly far more meager than they should be but still focus on \nproviding affordable and enduring energy supply. This bill provides \nfunds to maintain our known and existing energy resources while \naggressively investing in new technology options for future resource \ndevelopment.\n  I repeat for at least the third time that we were unable to do as \nmuch as we would have liked to do. We did the best we could under the \nallocation we were given.\n  I counsel my colleagues that with the allocation mandated, the \nframework which we determined for these funding levels, any amendments \nneed to be reasonable in their approach to emphasizing one program over \nanother. It is very tough to choose.\n  As to atomic energy defense activities, my friend, the manager of \nthis bill, I think, did a very good job in pointing out why these \nprograms today are so important. We know what is going on in the world \nis so important. We have a very fractured situation in the land that \nseparates India and Pakistan--Kashmir. Two nuclear powers are looking \nat each other, threatening each other with war.\n  We had the situation with the Soviet Union, which has disintegrated, \nbut Russia still has huge numbers of nuclear devices. We have to make \nsure our nuclear weapons are safe and reliable and that we have the \nability to help the rest of the world with its nuclear weapons.\n  The atomic energy defense activities include, among other things, a \nnumber of very important national security programs. Maintenance of a \nsafe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile; support for and \nverification of global nonproliferation of nuclear weapons; support for \nand verification of nuclear international arms control agreements and \ndomestic and foreign nuclear safeguards and security; technical \nanalysis of nuclear intelligence information; and domestic \nenvironmental restoration and defense of nuclear waste management are \nall activities that are necessary in our conduct of the cold war and \nfor other reasons. These activities are important because they are \nessential elements of our comprehensive national security strategy \nwhereby we will deter any actual or possible adversary from relying on \nnuclear threats to our security interests.\n  The key ingredient of our strategy is to ensure the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile. The so-called science-based \nstockpile stewardship program has been developed and is supposed to \nprovide that assurance. It is important that this new program is active \nand is making progress. But the critically needed facilities and \ncapabilities are still being developed. Some of them are still \nconcepts. So it is critically important we stay the course and maintain \nthe necessary funding to allow this program to succeed.\n\n  We have no choice, literally. To not allow this to happen would set \nus back significantly. Let's assume we found a problem with one of our \nnuclear warheads. How are we going to test this? What are we going to \ndo? We can no longer take it to the underground caverns in Nevada, the \nunderground tunnels or shafts in Nevada, and set it off. We need the \ngreatest minds in the world to be able to tell us what we can do to \nmake sure these weapons systems are safe and reliable. At the same \ntime, we must continue making investments directed at containing and \nreducing the international threat of nuclear proliferation. Success \nhere, also, is vital.\n  It is just as important to reduce the expense, the burden, and risk \nof maintaining a stockpile of weapons that is far larger than \nnecessary. I am convinced all the elements of the Department of \nEnergy's defense activities will provide for our security, now and in \nthe future, more effectively and with less cost than will be the case \nif any one of these activities is reduced. By reducing moneys here, the \ncosts in the outyears will increase tremendously. So I recommend this \nbill to my colleagues.\n  This bill provides for national needs and addresses regional, \ninterstate, and local concerns as well, ranging from nondefense energy \nand water interests to the highest priority maintenance of \ninternational peace and security.\n  So I hope, as we proceed through this bill, we keep our eye on the \nprize, what this subcommittee is all about. It is about making sure the \nports and harbors of this country are able to handle the goods and \ncommerce that come here. It is making sure urban areas are now safe \nfrom flooding. It is making sure the Bureau of Reclamation is allowed \nto continue its projects so water supplies are good--good in the sense \nof being plentiful, and good in the sense of being pure.\n  I end this statement where I started. Using the State of California \nas an example, 35 million people are depending on this bill. They are \ndepending on it because two-thirds of their water comes from a project \nwe have in this bill. It meets the inconsistent but very vital demands \nof the agricultural interests, the recreational interests, \nenvironmental interests, and urban interests of this huge State.\n  I hope we can move through here without a lot of mischievous \namendments, move to the merits of this legislation, and complete it as \nquickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend Senator Reid for his \ncomprehensive statement. I tell him and the Senate how pleased I am \nthat I have a ranking member who understands the importance of the work \nof the Department of Energy in our nuclear weapons development, \nmaintenance, and safekeeping, because sometimes it is rather lonely.\n  Many people fail to understand the relationship between not having \nany more underground testing and the decision to have a new science-\nbased stockpile stewardship of nuclear weapons. Without underground \ntesting, with various scientific approaches and new kinds of scientific \ninstrumentation, we are going to produce the atmosphere and environment \nsurrounding what would have taken place in a real underground test, and \nwe will be able to say what is happening to our nuclear weapons--their \nsafety, well-being, maintenance, and reliability.\n  That is a big undertaking. For those who come to the floor regularly \nand eloquently urge we put plenty of money in our defenses, it is high \ntime they understand we have to put plenty of money into this area \nbecause, although the regular military of our primary military \nadversary in the world is getting depleted and its strength is being \ngreatly diminished, the country remains a huge owner and developer of \nnuclear weapons. They do not build their weapons as we build our \nweapons. They are far less sophisticated. That is their choice. We \nchose another approach. Our approach requires we regularly understand \nwhat is going on in the wear and tear and longevity of our nuclear \nweapons as they stand ready, continuing to be the great deterrent they \nare. That has a fancy name. My good friend from Nevada explained it \nvery well. It is tied inextricably to our decision not to do any \nunderground testing.\n  Frankly, there are some in this body, including the occupant of the \nChair, who are not quite sure we should have abandoned underground \ntesting, and there are some who maintain we ought to do science-based \nstockpile stewardship and nuclear testing. I heard Dr. Schlesinger \ntestify about that at a committee hearing. Perhaps Senator Kyl has \nheard them say that. The policy of our country is not to do that. It is \nto substitute for nuclear testing, scientific knowledge, and scientific \ntechnology, first simulating and then acquiring information regarding \nthe reliability of nuclear weapons--a huge undertaking.\n  Our scientists approached it with great trepidation. There are still \nsome great nuclear scientists who are not sure it is sufficient and who \nare not sure at some point we will not have to go back and think it all \nthrough again. But for now, three basic laboratories are doing this. \nOne of the lead laboratories is Lawrence Livermore, with reference to a \ngreat big project called the National Ignition Facility. Los Alamos has \na piece of it, both in computer technology and in a new building and \nnew instrumentation called the DARP program. And Sandia, the \nengineering part of our laboratory structure, is heavily engaged in \ndeveloping the kind of computer capacity to do the simulating and make \nsure we are getting\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\nthe right answers in these new, sophisticated tests of the validity and \nconsistence and well-being of nuclear weapons.\n  That is all in this bill. So Senators who are worried about defense \nshould know a big portion of this bill is defense, unless they perceive \nwe now live in a world when we can have defense all in the defense \nappropriation bill, all those subjects, and not have a nuclear \ndeterrent and a nuclear maintenance function within our Nation's \npriorities.\n  If some feel that, then this is not defense. But who would dare say \nthat to the American people? Who would even suggest we ought to be \nunderfunding this kind of activity?\n  Frankly, the Senator from New Mexico was greatly concerned upon \nhearing, in the last 3, 4, 5 months, so much about the lack of security \nbecause clearly I do not want, nor should the Senate, that fear and \nthat concern to have an impact on the maintenance of the scientific \neffort that we all know we have to do so long as we will not and do not \nintend to test any of our weapons, either old or new.\n  This is a good bipartisan bill. This is a bill that has had a lot of \ninput from Senator Harry Reid. Of that I am proud. He has listened to \nour concerns; we have listened to his. There are many Senators' States \nthat have projects in this bill that are very important to them on that \nside of the aisle and on this side of the aisle.\n  I believe we are going to have less money to spend, and I say this to \nall the Senators. We are going to have less money for this bill. Even \nif we wait around until the end of the year and think we can make some \nkind of deal with the President, we are going to have less money in \nthis bill than we had last year. That is just the way it has to be \nunder the Balanced Budget Act. I think we have done a good job in \nallocating that money, which is short, to the various functions of \nGovernment within this bill. We have not shortchanged our defense \npreparedness, as it pertains to nuclear weapons, in the process.\n  I understand that my friend, Senator Reid, concurs with this \nunanimous consent request I will propound.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives \nfrom the House the companion bill to S. 1186, the Senate immediately \nproceed to consideration thereof; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 1186, as passed, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; that the House bill, as amended, be read for a third time and \npassed; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; and \nthat the foregoing occur without any intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. 1186, not be \nengrossed and it remain at the desk pending receipt of the House \ncompanion bill; and that upon passage of the House bill, as amended, \nthe passage of S. 1186 be vitiated and the bill be indefinitely \npostponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 628\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a technical amendment to the \ndesk. It is clearly technical, and I ask it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 628.\n       On page 12, line 24, insert the following after the figure \n     ``204'':\n       ``of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, as \n     amended (Public Law 99-662); section 206''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside, and that we move on to other business, leaving \nit pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss with \nthe managers of this bill a matter relating to the 1992 Water Resources \nDevelopment Act which authorizes the construction of flood protection \nfacilities along the Lackawanna River in Olyphant and Scranton.\n  I can personally attest to the serious situation, because when the \nflooding occurred, I went there one Saturday night late to see the \nravage of that water problem and have been there on quite a number of \noccasions, to know firsthand the very severe problem which is involved \nthere.\n  The appropriated account has $42 million, and this bill removes some \n$25 million from that account. I know that the $17 million remaining \nwill be sufficient to take care of the expenditures for the next fiscal \nyear which amount to some $6 million, leaving $11 million in the \naccount.\n  I want to discuss with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \na couple of factors.\n  One is if my representation is correct that the $17 million left in \nthe account will be more than enough to take care of the expenditure \nline for the next fiscal year.\n  The second question I want to be sure about is that there will be \nadequate funding to complete this project so that when the schedule \narises that we need all of the $42 million, or whatever the amount is, \nthat we will have the cooperation of the Appropriations Subcommittee, \nthe distinguished chairman, and the distinguished ranking member in \nproviding that funding, up to $42 million, which it has now. I \nunderstand the plight the chairman is under because 302(b) allocations \nare not sufficient. I have seen that firsthand. I chair the \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, and we \nare unable to go to a markup with the figure we have because of the \nvery tight restrictions.\n  The second aspect is, I am looking for the assurance that the \nremainder of the $42 million will be appropriated when the need arises \nto meet the ensuing fiscal year requirements of the Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  The third factor that I want to be sure about on the record is that \nthere could be an analysis which will segregate this flood control into \nthree projects.\n  There you start, again, to get into the complexities of the cost-\nbenefit ratio. But as it has been structured very carefully, the \narrangement, in its present form, as a unit, satisfies the cost-benefit \nrelationship. There are a lot of concerns and a lot of battles about \nthat. But we are, as a unit, covered under that cost-benefit ratio.\n  I want to be cooperative, obviously, with the chairman as he is \nmoving through this bill. I understand, as I say, the need for taking \nsome of these funds for other projects, but if the chairman would \nrespond to those three inquiries to be sure my constituents will have \nthe adequacy of the funding. I know Senator Santorum, who could not be \nhere at the moment, has a similar concern. Congressman Sherwood has a \nsimilar concern. We have all been very close to this issue and the very \nimportant constituent interest involved here.\n  I direct those questions to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, may I suggest the absence of a \nquorum for a moment and make an inquiry of my staff, and then I will \nreturn and answer all these questions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in discussing the issue related to the \n1992 Water Resources Development Act on the Lackawanna River in \nOlyphant and Scranton, it is obvious that my first preference, the \ndelegation's first preference, is to have the $25 million restored.\n  We have a second program in south-central Pennsylvania, the \nEnvironmental Improvements Program, where $20 million has been \nrescinded. This is\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\nin line with a large sequence of rescissions which have been put into \neffect by the subcommittee under the same problem where there is simply \ninsufficient money on 302(b) allocations. Again, I understand that, \nbecause I have the problem on the appropriations subcommittee which I \nchair.\n  I am advised that the $20 million rescission as to south-central \nPennsylvania can be worked out in the House, and all of this is subject \nto compromise in the House, where we may have a larger figure for this \nsubcommittee. So it is possible that the $25 million for the Scranton-\nOlyphant projects may be restored fully as well as the $20 million for \nsouth-central Pennsylvania.\n  Before this bill is closed out, I want to be absolutely sure that we \nare protecting these projects so that whatever funding they need for \nthe next fiscal year will be provided. That is the context in which I \nhave made the request to the distinguished manager.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank Senator Specter for raising this issue \nand suggest to him that the same issue has been raised by his \ndistinguished colleague, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSantorum. Senator Specter and I have been speaking about that the last \nfew minutes.\n  Let me say, in answer to the questions that the Senator asked with \nreference to the Lackawanna project, I will answer them as best I can, \nmaybe not in the same order in which they were asked, but I believe I \nwill answer all of them.\n  First, we have had to go through this bill and where we found \nunfunded obligations that were not going to be needed for a substantial \nperiod of time, in some instances well beyond a year, and that the \nproject or projects would continue at full pace exactly as planned, we \nhave decided, since we have some desperate projects that are not going \nto get any money, to move the money around, but that does not mean we \ndo not intend to fully fund the project. If you will note in my \nremarks, I said we are not funding any unauthorized projects. The \nprojects in Pennsylvania, including the one I just mentioned, are \nauthorized and proceeding. They do not need any work by any other \ncommittee. They are ongoing.\n  All I can do is give you assurance that there is no intention to take \nthese projects off of their natural course of completion. That is what \nthe Corps says we need each year and can spend each year, and there \nwill be $17 million left in this account, only $6 million of which is \nneeded for the year 2000. Nobody should be concerned about that project \nnot proceeding at full speed ahead.\n  I can assure you that is what I have been informed. I believe that is \nwhat you would have in a letter from the Corps, if you wanted it. I can \nfurther commit to you that we continue each year with these water \nprojects, and clearly we always have substantial amounts of money.\n  Last year, the President very much underfunded projects. We had to \nfind money to fund them. This year, because the nondefense portion of \nthis bill is squeezed some and because the President cut some things we \ncan't cut, we have had to squeeze some of these other accounts, some in \nthe manner we are discussing. But there is no reason to be concerned \nabout the projects getting funded. As a matter of fact, we may find \nourselves in conference with the House, which would make available more \nmoney for the water projects because of the way they will fund things. \nIt may very well be that they won't want to do it this way, that they \nwant to save money some other way. We will work on that.\n  If, before we are finished here on the floor, this was unsatisfactory \nfor any reason that you or Senator Santorum or you together find, I \nwill be willing to discuss it again and see what we could do to assure \nyou that these projects are going to be fully funded.\n  In reference to the fact that last year three projects were put \ntogether in a technical manner but in a manner that is acceptable in \nterms of analyzing the benefits versus the costs, sometimes called a \ncost-benefit ratio, that has been done. There is no change in this \nbill. They fit together, and they are evaluated together, and they meet \nthe criteria. There is no effort on the part of the Appropriations \nCommittee I chair that I am aware of that would want to change that so \nas to demean in priority and effectiveness one versus the other two or \ntwo versus one or the like.\n  I do not know if we can do anything more to be sure of that than what \nI am telling you now and what is in the law as it is now. Somebody \nwould have to change it, not just come along and say we are not going \nto do it. They would have to change something. You would know; I would \nknow. Everybody in Pennsylvania would know. It would not be easy to do.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague for those assurances. \nI am glad to hear, with respect to these three projects joined \ntogether, that they are being viewed as one integrated whole so that \nthey do satisfy the requirements of the cost-benefit ratio, and \nfurther, that the rescissions on the two Pennsylvania projects, as to \nthe Lackawanna River in Olyphant and Scranton and also the south-\ncentral Pennsylvania rescission, that those projects will move forward \nwith sufficient funding, as Senator Domenici has pointed out, $17 \nmillion being left in the Lackawanna River project for Olyphant and \nScranton and only $6 million needed in the next fiscal year. If it is \npossible, as Senator Domenici and Senator Reid work through the bill, \nto increase the funding, to eliminate the rescissions, that certainly \nwould be appreciated.\n  I think on this state of the record, these projects are protected. I \nwill await further developments as we move through the bill to see if \nsome of those funds might be restored and even the $25 million not \nrescinded.\n  I thank Senator Domenici and I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts for waiting until we finish this item of business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6929-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6929-S6939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as all of us understand, we are \nconsidering a very important appropriations bill. The floor managers, \nSenator Domenici and Senator Reid, have a responsibility to see that we \nmeet the responsibilities of the Senate and the appropriations \nprocedures by making sure this legislation is considered and that \nMembers have an opportunity to address it and move towards conclusion. \nI respect that, and I have great respect and friendship for the two \nMembers.\n  I rise today to raise an issue which is not related to the underlying \nmeasure but is related to a very significant issue that is affecting \nmany individuals across this country, and that is the issue of whether \nwe are going to free members of our community, referred to as the \ndisability community, who are facing some physical or mental challenge, \nwhether or not we are going to free them from the kinds of governmental \npolicies that discourage them from employment but really, beyond \nemployment, from living a full and constructive and positive and \nindependent existence,  which I think all of us want to be able to \nachieve.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know the bill. I am a cosponsor. I \nhope it gets passed soon this year. I understand you are going to file \na bill but not call it up because meetings are taking place and we will \nwant to pursue those.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I have talked to the majority \nleader today, as well as our own leaders, Senator Domenici and Senator \nReid, and Senator Gramm of Texas, who had effectively put a hold on the \nlegislation and had indicated that request, that we file the \nlegislation so it would conform to the request of the floor managers. \nIt would be at the desk.\n  It is at least my impression that, given the agenda that has been \nannounced by the majority leader, we would not conclude this \nlegislation today and we will be moving on to the Y2K, and what they \ncall the Social Security lockbox, later in the week, and we would have \nan opportunity and a good-faith effort to see if there could\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nbe an agreement to consider this legislation independently--which, as \nthe Senator from New Mexico understands, is desirable for a number of \ndifferent reasons--but to do it with a precise time for the scheduling. \nThat, I believe, is the preferable way to do it. But we didn't want to \nforeclose our opportunity, if we were unable to do so, to at least be \nable to exercise some judgment and move ahead with the legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. The possibility is not remarkably good, but there is a \npossibility that we can finish this before the Y2K vote tomorrow \nmorning, according to what happens with amendments coming in today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to take this one step at a time, and I \nthink there is very little reason, given the expressions of the \nmajority leader and the Senator from Texas, why the Senate--not only \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, but Senator Roth, Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Moynihan, and myself, who are the principal cosponsors, be \ngiven assurance that this would be ready. We are quite available \nthrough the afternoon to be able to take that. I want to say at this \ntime that I would like to proceed in that way, without indicating \nexactly what our course of action would be.\n  There is no reason why we should be denied further opportunity to \nconsider this legislation. I personally would be inclined to move ahead \nwith a short timeframe for consideration of the amendment. But I am \nhopeful, as I said, that we may be able to work this out. So that is my \nintention. I am going to file this, if I may, at the desk and conform \nto the request of the floor managers.\n  Mr. President, I raise this issue, and it is a rather unusual process \nand procedure. I know the Senate has its responsibilities, but there is \nalso a responsibility to the millions of Americans with disabilities. \nThey have been waiting for some period of time as well. The fact is \nthat this legislation has 78 cosponsors. I don't know of a piece of \nlegislation that is before the Senate that has that degree of support \nfrom Republican and Democrat alike, and from over 300 organizations. We \nhave a variety of different important pieces of legislation, but for my \nmoney, this legislation was more important to consider than Y2K or, \nwith respect, the legislation that we have before us even at the \npresent time, because it has such overwhelming support. There is no \nreason why we should not move ahead on this legislation. Millions of \nAmericans are waiting for us to take action. The overwhelming majority \nof the Members of this body feels strong support for this, and that is \na compelling reason to move forward with the legislation.\n  Mr. President, we have seen this legislation pass out of the Finance \nCommittee 16-2, and one of the Members who had expressed  opposition \nhas since indicated that the changes that have been made in the \nlegislation sent to the desk have effectively addressed those concerns. \nSo here we have the overwhelming, overwhelming, overwhelming sentiment \nof those on the Finance Committee in favor of it. It is virtually \nunanimous in the House Commerce Committee. We don't have pieces of \nlegislation like this. We have had differences on some pieces of \nlegislation between Republicans and Democrats but not on this one, \nbecause the legislation is so compelling. We ought to be moving \nforward, and we ought to be moving forward now.\n\n  There are 175 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. The reason \nthis legislation has such incredible support is because the \nlegislation, perhaps more than any legislation I have seen in recent \ntimes, is really a reflection of the grassroots efforts to address this \nproblem. The overwhelming majority of Americans who have some \ndisability want to work and have the ability to work. But because of \nthe way that the support systems are set up in terms of health \ninsurance, they are prohibited from doing so because they will lose the \nhealth benefits they so desperately need. They are effectively \ndisincentivized from going to work. This legislation understands that \nparticular dilemma and addresses it. It is one of the most important \npieces of legislation we are going to have in this Congress.\n  At the outset, I want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. He has been an enormously \nimportant leader in this body on issues involving the disabled. I \nwelcome the opportunity to work with him on this and other legislation. \nWe have a number of members on our committee who have taken special \ninterest in the care of the needy and disabled; Senator Harkin and \nSenator Frist come to mind, as do others. We have had the overwhelming \nsupport of the members of our committee, most of whom were very much \ninvolved 9 years ago in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct to strike down the walls of discrimination which had existed and \nexist even today in our society against those who have some disability. \nWe have made monumental progress in terms of knocking down the walls of \ndiscrimination.\n  As I will show in a few moments, even though we have had some success \nin knocking down the walls of discrimination, we still see that many of \nthose who have disabilities are unable to go back to work because of \nthe loss of any health insurance, and it has been because of that \nparticular dilemma that this legislation was developed. We will get \ninto the sound reasons for doing so,  and the most compelling reason; \nand that is to let all Americans know that if someone has a disability \nit does not mean that they are not able to perform and live \nindependently in so many instances, and be constructive, positive, and \ncontributing members of our society. We will go through why and how \nthis legislation does that.\n\n  I want to indicate at this time that the leadership of our \ncolleagues--Senator Roth on the Finance Committee and Senator Moynihan \non the Finance Committee--was essential in getting that legislation \nthrough. We worked very closely together. The legislation itself is \nreally a reflection of their strong work and their strong commitment, \nas well as that of Senator Jeffords.\n  It seems to me this is the time to act. We will hopefully get some \nagreement by the leadership to call this legislation up. The \nappropriate way to have this legislation called up would be with our \ngood colleagues and friends, Senator Roth and Senator Jeffords, to \noffer this as independent legislation. We will move forward and pass it \nat that time. That is what I am hopeful we will be able to do. But \nquite frankly, we have been unable to get those kinds of assurances.\n  I think the delay in bringing this legislation to the floor has gone \non long enough. We ought to be about the business of the substance of \nthis legislation. We know there can be those who are opposed to it, or \nare concerned about it. But I believe we need a time for accounting. We \nneed a time for yeas and nays. That is what this business is ultimately \nabout. It is about choices. It is about priorities. It is about whether \nwe are going to take action.\n  We strongly believe we should take action, and we should take action \nnow. We have waited now some 2\\1/2\\ weeks since we had the \nunderstanding that this was going to be called up. Then it was \ntemporarily shelved and put aside.\n  We have waited and waited for those who have been concerned about it \nto express their concern. We have tried to work through some of their \nconcern. One of their concerns is about the offsets. We tried to work \nthrough that, but it is time to take action. This is the vehicle by \nwhich we can at least get action by the Senate of the United States. I \nbelieve we should move ahead.\n  Former majority leader Bob Dole stated in eloquent testimony before \nthe Finance Committee that this issue is about people going to work--\n``it is about dignity and opportunity and all of the things we talk \nabout when we talk about being Americans.'' Senator Dole has been a \nstrong supporter of this legislation, and we welcome his support for \nthis program.\n  We know a large portion of the 54 million disabled men and women in \nthis country want to work and are able to work. But they are denied the \nopportunity to do so. The Nation is denied their talents and their \ncontributions to our community.\n  These are the results of a Lou Harris 1998 poll of the 54 million \nAmericans with disabilities:\n  Seventy-two percent of working-age people with disabilities who are \nnot\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\nworking now say they want to work. There is a great desire for work by \nthose individuals, but still they are effectively denied in a practical \nway the opportunity to do so.\n  Removing these barriers to work will help large numbers of disabled \nAmericans to achieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and stronger and \nfairer country when we open the golden door of opportunity to all and \nenable them to be equal partners in the American dream. For millions of \nAmericans with disabilities, this bill can make the American dream come \ntrue. When we say ``equal opportunity for all,'' it will be clear that \nwe truly mean all.\n  How large are the gaps? This chart is the comparison between persons \nwith and without disabilities on ``indicator'' measures in 1998.\n  Employment: Working either full time or part time, persons with \ndisabilities, 29 percent. Persons with no disabilities, approximately \n80 percent. The gap between those with disabilities and without \ndisabilities who work is some 50 percent.\n  If we look at the income for households, you will see that of those \npersons with disabilities who are working, many of them are working in \nlow-income jobs--34 percent have incomes of $15,000 or less compared to \nonly 12 percent of those persons with no disabilities. Again we find \nthe extraordinary disparity.\n  It is long past time to banish the mind-set that the disabled are \nunable. In fact, they have enormous talents and abilities, and America \ncannot afford to waste an ounce of it.\n  For too long, Americans with disabilities have faced a series of \nunbearable penalties if they take jobs or go to work. They are in \ndanger of losing their medical coverage, which can mean the difference \nbetween life and death. They are in danger of losing their cash \nbenefits, even if they earn only modest amounts from work. No disabled \nAmerican should face the harsh choice between buying a decent meal and \nbuying the medication they need.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act will begin to remove these unfair \nbarriers facing people with disabilities who are able to work and who \nwant to work.\n  It will continue to make health insurance available and affordable \nwhen a disabled person goes to work or develops a significant \ndisability while working.\n  It will gradually phase out the loss of cash benefits as income \nrises--instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that so many workers with \ndisabilities face today. We have the important demonstration program in \nhere that will effectively see the phasing out of the kind of income \nthese individuals are entitled to--the phasing out of 50 cents for \nevery new dollar they make over a period of time. They would be able to \nincrease their income, and we would see a diminution of the amounts \nactually being contributed by the States and Federal Government as they \ncontinue in the employment.\n  This would, obviously, be an incentive for them to move ahead on the \neconomic ladder, rather than being the disincentive that it is now, \nwhich would have a termination of benefits which they receive once they \nmove above $500, which effectively locks the disabled into part-time \njobs and jobs that pay very little.\n  It makes a good deal of common sense. It places work incentive \nplanners in communities rather than in bureaucracies, and helps workers \nwith disabilities learn how to access employment services and support \nthe services by help and assistance to the States and communities. The \nStates and communities themselves would have some flexibility in being \nable to raise some fees in the administration of these programs. We \nprovide a very modest amount for that.\n\n  Finally, all Americans get a fiscally responsible bill. This is based \non the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates which incorporate CBO \nestimates that S. 331 would cost $838 million over 5 years, to be \noffset by the bill's revenue provisions totaling $906 million, for a \nnet savings of $68 million over the 5 years. This does not even begin \nto take into consideration two very important factors; that is, what \nwill actually be paid in, in terms of taxes to the Federal Treasury, in \nterms of revenues that the taxpayers will pay, and also the basic \nsavings that will be there under the Social Security trust fund.\n  This chart shows where we are. We have 7.5 million individuals that \nqualify for Federal participation in some disability program--\nindividuals who are eligible for some kind of payment. One-half of 1 \npercent now are. If, out of the 7.5 million, we are able to get 210,000 \nworking, we would save the trust fund $1 billion a year. That does not \ncome through CBO or OMB because of the way the Budget Act works. This \nis the extrapolation we have in terms of working with the Social \nSecurity agency. It represents $1 billion saved with 210,000 working \ninstead of the 70,000 that are working a year. Ours is $800 million \nover 5 years.\n  This makes a good deal of sense. We believe it is economically sound. \nThese are savings we will have. When we hear about costs of the bill, \nthese are the savings we will have. As I mentioned, it does not even \ntake into consideration what will actually be paid in, in terms of \ntaxes for those individuals, which will be certainly more than those \nfigures.\n  We worked very assiduously with a lot of the different groups on this \nprogram. When we think of citizens with disabilities, we tend to think \nof men, women and children who are disabled from birth. However, fewer \nthan 15 percent of all people with disabilities are born with their \ndisabilities. A bicycle accident or a serious fall or a serious illness \ncan suddenly disable the healthiest and most physically capable person. \nThis is enormously important. This legislation is not just for our \nfellow Americans that may be born with some disability, but for all \nAmericans.\n  In the long run, this legislation may be more important than any \nother action we will take in this Congress. It offers a new and better \nlife to large numbers of our fellow citizens. Disability need no longer \nend the American dream. That was the promise of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act a decade ago, and this legislation dramatically \nstrengthens our fulfillment of that promise.\n  I will not take the time this afternoon to go through a diary I have, \n``A Day in the Life of People Who Want To Work.'' We have broken down \nby States and included letters from individuals who have written about \nwhat this particular legislation means in terms of their lives today, \nhow their lives would be changed, how their lives would be altered with \nthis particular legislation. It is enormously powerful and moving.\n  If necessary, if we have to convince our colleagues about this \nlegislation, I will take some time and go through some of the letters.\n  I will mention very briefly the human aspect of this legislation. \nThis legislation is for Alice in Oklahoma who is disabled because of \nmultiple sclerosis and receives SSDI benefits. She needs personal \nassistance to live and work in her community. But to do so, she must \nuse all of her savings and half or all of her wages to pay for personal \nassistance and prescription drugs. As a result, she is left in poverty.\n  This bill is for Tammy in Indiana who has cerebral palsy and uses a \nwheelchair. She works part-time at Wal-Mart, but her hours are \nrestricted because if she works too much she will lose her health \nbenefits. Her goal of becoming a productive citizen is denied by the \nunfair danger of losing the health care she needs.\n  This is for Jay in Minnesota on SSDI who wants to work. However, the \njob he is qualified for offers no health care. If he accepts the job, \nhe will join the ranks of the uninsured.\n  This bill is for Abby in Massachusetts who is only 6 years old and \nhas mental retardation. Her parents are very concerned about her future \nand her ability to work and still have health insurance. Already she \nhas been denied coverage by two insurance firms because of the \ndiagnosis of mental retardation. Without Medicaid, her parents would be \nbankrupted by her medical bills today. If Abby eventually enters the \nworkforce, she will have to live in poverty or lose Medicaid coverage \nunder current law. Under this bill, all that would change. She and her \nparents will have a chance to dream of a future that includes work and \nprosperity, rather than a future of government handouts.\n  This bill is for many other citizens whose stories are told in this \ndiary.\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\n This diary alone should be enough to shock and shame the Senate into \naction.\n  Our goal in this legislation is to banish the stereotypes, to reform \nand improve the existing disability programs so that they genuinely \nencourage and support every disabled person's dream to work and live \nindependently and be a productive and contributing member of the \ncommunity. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans. With \nthis legislation, we are taking a giant step toward that goal.\n  A story from the debate on the Americans With Disabilities Act \nillustrates the point. A postmaster in a town was told he must make his \npost office accessible. The building had 20 steps leading to a \nrevolving door at the entrance. The postmaster questioned the need to \nmake such costly changes. He said, ``I've been here for 35 years and in \nall that time I have yet to see a single customer come in here in a \nwheelchair.'' As the Americans With Disabilities Act shows, if you \nbuild the ramp, people will come and they will find their field of \ndreams. This bill expands the field.\n  The road to economic prosperity and the right to a decent wage must \nbe more accessible to all Americans, no matter how many steps stand in \nthe way. That is our goal in this legislation. It is the right thing to \ndo. It is the cost-effective thing to do, and now is the time to do it. \nFor too long, our fellow disability citizens have felt left out and \nleft behind. A new and brighter day is on the horizon for them and \ntoday we finally will make it a reality.\n  I will describe a few other reasons for the importance of this \nlegislation, including the cost of this legislation and what is \nhappening currently. I will refer to the work in the Work Incentive \nImprovement Act and a report.\n  7.5 million disabled receive cash payments from SSI and SSDI. \nDisability benefit spending totals $73 billion a year. That is what we \nare spending at the present time under this program--$73 billion a \nyear, making disability programs the fourth largest entitlement \nexpenditure in the Federal Government. If only 1 percent, or 75,000, of \nthe 7.5 million were to become employed, Federal savings in disability \nprograms would total $3.5 billion over the worklife of the \nbeneficiaries.\n  Do we hear that? If we get to 1 percent, we will be effectively \nsaving $3.5 billion over the life of those beneficiaries. That is if we \njust get to 1 percent, let alone the goal of those of us who believe in \nindependent living.\n  I will quote from the General Accounting Office:\n\n       The two largest Federal programs providing cash and medical \n     assistance for people with disabilities grew rapidly between \n     1985 and 1994, with the enrollment of working age people \n     increasing 59 percent from 4 million to 6.3 million.\n\n  The figures I just read are the most current figures--7.5.\n\n       . . . the inflation-adjusted cost of cash benefits growing \n     by 66 percent. Administered by SSA, DI and SSI paid over $50 \n     billion in cash benefits to people with disabilities in 1994.\n\n  So we are up now to $77 billion. In 1994 it was $50 billion. Now, \nthis last year, in a period of 4 years it is up to $77 billion. That is \na $27 billion increase. The flow line of these expenditures is going \nright up through the roof without any further indication of effectively \nreducing their unemployment, improving the ability of these \nindividuals--who want to work and who have the ability to work if they \nare able to continue with their health insurance--to be contributing \nmembers of the community. It can have a dramatic, significant impact in \nlowering the continued escalation in expenditures under this fund.\n  For those individuals here who fail to understand what we are doing, \nwhat is happening, I hope they will refer to an excellent GAO report.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Social Security: Disability Programs Lag in Promoting Return to Work\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: You asked us to \n     discuss today ways to improve the Disability Insurance (DI) \n     and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs by helping \n     people with disabilities return to work. Each week the Social \n     Security Administration (SSA) pays over $1 billion in cash \n     payments to people with disabilities on DI and SSI. While \n     providing a measure of income security, these payments for \n     the most part do little to enhance the work capacities and \n     promote the economic independence of these DI and SSI \n     recipients. Yet societal attitudes have shifted toward goals, \n     as embodied in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), of \n     economic self-sufficiency and the right of people with \n     disabilities to full participation in society.\n       At one time, the common business people was to encourage \n     someone with a disability to leave the workforce. Today, \n     however, a growing number of private companies have been \n     focusing on enabling people with disabilities to return to \n     work. Moreover, medical advances and new technologies provide \n     more opportunities than ever for people with disabilities to \n     work.\n       We found that the DI and SSI programs are out of sync with \n     these trends. The application process places a heavy emphasis \n     on work incapacity, and it presumes that medical impairments \n     preclude employment. And SSA does little to provide the \n     support and assistance that many people with disabilities \n     need to work. Our April 1996 report shows, in fact, that \n     program design and implementation weaknesses hinder \n     maximizing beneficiary work potential.\\1\\ Not surprisingly, \n     these weaknesses also yield poor return-to-work outcomes. \n     Other work we are doing for you highlights strategies from \n     the private sector and other countries that SSA could use to \n     develop administrative and legislative solutions to improve \n     return-to-work outcomes. Indeed, if an additional 1 percent \n     of the 6.3 million working-age SSI and DI beneficiaries were \n     to leave SSA's disability rolls by returning to work, \n     lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $2.9 \n     billion.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     See footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       With this in mind, today I would like to focus on how the \n     current program structure impedes return to work and how \n     strategies from other disability systems could help \n     restructure DI and SSI to improve return-to-work outcomes. To \n     develop this information, we surveyed people in the private \n     sector generally recognized as leaders in developing \n     disability management programs that focus on return-to-work \n     efforts. We also interviewed officials in Germany and Sweden \n     because the experiences of their social insurance programs \n     show that return-to-work strategies are applicable to a broad \n     and diverse population with a wide range of work histories, \n     job skills, and disabilities. We also conducted focus groups \n     with people receiving disability benefits and convened a \n     panel of disability experts.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       DI and SSI the two largest federal programs providing cash \n     and medical assistance to people with disabilities--grew \n     rapidly between 1985 and 1994, with the enrollment of \n     working-age people increasing 59 percent, from 4 million to \n     6.3 million, and the inflation-adjusted cost of cash benefits \n     growing by 66 percent. Administered by SSA, DI and SSI paid \n     over $50 billion in cash benefits to people with disabilities \n     in 1994. To be considered disabled by either program, an \n     adult must be unable to engage in any substantial gainful \n     activity because of any medically determinable physical or \n     mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or \n     that has lasted or can be expected to last at least 1 year. \n     Moreover, the impairment must be of such severity that a \n     person not only is unable to do his or her previous work, \n     but, considering his or her age, education, and work \n     experience, is unable to do any other kind of substantial \n     work that exists in the national economy.\n       Both programs use the same definition of disability but \n     differ in important ways. DI, established in 1956, is an \n     insurance program funded by payroll taxes paid by workers and \n     their employers into a Social Security trust fund. The \n     program is for workers who, having worked long enough and \n     recently enough to become insured under DI, have lost their \n     source of income because of disability. Medicare coverage is \n     provided to DI beneficiaries after they have received cash \n     benefits for 24 months. Almost 4 million working-age people \n     (aged 18 to 64) received about $34 billion in DI cash \n     benefits in 1994.\\3\\\n       In contrast, SSI is a means-tested income assistance \n     program for disabled, blind, or aged individuals regardless \n     of their participation in the labor force. Established in \n     1972 for individuals with low income and limited resources, \n     SSI is financed from general revenues.\\4\\ In most states, \n     SSI entitlement ensures an individual's eligibility for \n     Medicaid benefits. In 1994, about 2.36 million working-age \n     people with disabilities received SSI benefits. Federal \n     SSI benefits paid to SSI beneficiaries with disabilities \n     in 1994 equaled $18.9 billion.\\5\\\n\n\n              caseloads have changed since the mid-1980's\n\n       The composition of the DI and SSI caseloads has undergone \n     many changes during the last decade. Between 1985 and 1994, \n     DI and SSI experienced an increase in the proportion of \n     beneficiaries with impairments--especially mental \n     impairments--that keep them on the rolls longer than in the \n     past. By 1994, 31 percent of DI beneficiaries and 57 percent \n     of SSI working-age beneficiaries had mental impairments--\n     conditions that have one of the longest anticipated \n     entitlement periods (about 16 years for DI). In addition, the \n     beneficiary population has become, on average, modestly but \n     steadily younger since the mid-1980s. The proportion of \n     working-age beneficiaries who are middle aged (aged 30 to 49) \n     has steadily increased--from 30 to 40 percent for DI, and \n     from 36 to 46 percent for\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\n     SSI--as the proportion who are older has declined.\n\n\n          Statute Provides for Returning Beneficiaries to Work\n\n       The Social Security Act states that as many individuals \n     applying for disability benefits as possible should be \n     rehabilitated into productive activity. To this end, people \n     applying for disability benefits are to be promptly referred \n     to state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies for services \n     intended to prepare them for work opportunities. To reduce \n     the risk a beneficiary faces in trading guaranteed monthly \n     income and premium-free medical coverage for the \n     uncertainties of competitive employment, the Congress also \n     established various work incentives to safeguard cash and \n     medical benefits while a beneficiary tries to return to work.\n       Dispite congressional attention to employment as a way to \n     reduce dependence, few beneficiaries leave the rolls to \n     return to work. During each of the past several years, not \n     more than 1 of every 500 DI beneficiaries has been terminated \n     from the rolls because they returned to work.\n\n\n     Technological Advances and Social Change Foster Return to Work\n\n       While DI and SSI return-to-work outcomes have been poor, \n     many technological and medical advances have created more \n     opportunities for some individuals with disabilities to \n     engage in work. Electronic communications and assistive \n     technologies--such as scanners, synthetic voice systems, \n     standing wheelchairs, and modified automobiles and vans--have \n     given greater independence to some people with disabilities, \n     allowing them to tap their work potential. Advances in the \n     management of disability--like medication to control mental \n     illness or computer-aided prosthetic devices--have helped \n     reduce the functional limitations associated with some \n     disabilities. These advances may have opened new \n     opportunities, particularly for some people with physical \n     impairments, in the growing service sector of the economy.\n       Social change has promoted greater inclusion of and \n     participation by some people with disabilities in the \n     mainstream of society, including children in school and \n     adults at work. For instance, over the past 2 years, people \n     with disabilities have sought to remove environmental \n     barriers that impede them from fully participating in their \n     communities. Moreover, ADA supports the full participation of \n     people with disabilities in society and fosters the \n     expectation that people with disabilities can and have the \n     right to work. ADA prohibits employers from discriminating \n     against qualified individuals with disabilities and requires \n     employers to make reasonable workplace accommodations, unless \n     it would impose an undue hardship on the business.\n\n\n            current program structure impedes return to work\n\n       The cumulative impact of weaknesses in the design and \n     implementation of the disability programs is to understate \n     beneficiaries' work capacity and impede efforts to improve \n     return-to-work outcomes. Despite a changing beneficiary \n     population and advances in technology and medicine that have \n     increased the potential for some beneficiaries to work, the \n     disability programs have remained essentially frozen in time. \n     Weaknesses in the design and implementation of the DI and SSI \n     programs, summarized in table 1, have impeded identifying and \n     encouraging the productive capacities of those who might \n     benefit from rehabilitation and employment assistance.\n\n    TABLE 1.--SUMMARY OF PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION WEAKNESSES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Program area                           Weakness\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisability determination.................  ``Either/or'' decision gives\n                                            incentive to promote\n                                            inabilities and minimize\n                                            abilities.\n                                           Lengthy application process\n                                            to prove one's disability\n                                            can erode motivation and\n                                            ability to return to work.\nBenefit structure........................

SSA \n     maintains a Listing of Impairments for medical conditions \n     that are, according to SSA, ordinarily severe enough in \n     themselves to prevent an individual from engaging in any \n     gainful activity. About 70 percent of new awardees are \n     eligible for disability because their impairments meet or \n     equal the listings. But findings of studies we reviewed \n     generally agree that medical conditions are a poor predictor \n     of work incapacity.\\6\\ As a result, the work capacity of DI \n     and SSI beneficiaries may be understated.\n       While disability decisions may be more clear-cut in the \n     case of people whose impairments inherently and permanently \n     prevent them from working, disability determinations may be \n     much more difficult for those who may have a reasonable \n     chance of work if they receive appropriate assistance and \n     support. Nonmedical factors may play a crucial role in \n     determining the extent to which people in this latter group \n     can work.\n\n\n  Program Weaknesses Impede Efforts to Improve Return-to-Work Outcomes\n\n       The ``either/or'' nature of the disability determination \n     process creates an incentive for applicants to overstate \n     their disabilities and understate their work capacities. \n     Because the result of the decision is either full award of \n     benefits or denial of benefits, applicants have a strong \n     incentive to promote their limitations to establish their \n     inability to work and thus qualify for benefits. Conversely, \n     applicants have a disincentive to demonstrate any capacity to \n     work because doing so may disqualify them for benefits. \n     Furthermore, the documentation involved in establishing one's \n     disability can, many believe, create a ``disability mind-\n     set,'' which weakens motivation to work. Compounding this \n     negative process, the length of time required to determine \n     eligibility can erode skills, abilities, and habits necessary \n     to work.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Intervene as soon as possible after a disabling event;\n       Identify and provide necessary return-to-work services and \n     manage cases; and\n       Structure cash and medical benefits to encourage return to \n     work.\n       The practices underlying these strategies are summarized in \n     table 2.\n       Disability managers we interviewed emphasized that these \n     return-to-work strategies are not independent of each other \n     and work most effectively when integrated into a \n     comprehensive return-to-work program. Return-to-work \n     strategies and practices may hold potential both for \n     improving federal disability programs by helping people with \n     disabilities return to productive activity in the workplace \n     and, at the same time, for reducing program costs.\n\n TABLE 2: STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES IN THE DESIGN OF RETURN-TO-WORK PROGRAMS OF THE U.S. PRIVATE SECTOR AND OTHER\n                                                    COUNTRIES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Strategies                                                Practices\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntervene as early as possible after an actual or potentially disabling event.

Advocates of early intervention believe that \n     the longer an individual stays away from work, the less \n     likely return to work will be. Studies show that only one in \n     two workers with recently acquired disabilities who are out \n     of work 5 months or more will ever return to work. Disability \n     managers believe that long absences from the workplace can \n     reduce motivation to attempt work.\n       Setting return-to-work goals soon after the onset of \n     disability and providing timely rehabilitation services are \n     believed to be critical in encouraging workers with \n     disabilities to return to the workplace as soon as possible. \n     Contacting a hospitalized worker soon after an injury or \n     illness and then continuing to communicate with the worker \n     recovering at home, for instance, helps reassure the worker \n     that there is a job to return to and that the employer is \n     concerned about his or her recovery.\n\n\n     Identifying and Providing Return-to-Work Services Effectively\n\n       Another common strategy is to effectively identify and \n     provide return-to-work services. This approach involves \n     investing in services tailored to individual circumstances \n     that help achieve return-to-work goals for workers with \n     disabilities while avoiding unnecessary expenditures.\n       In an effort to provide appropriate services, many in the \n     private sector strive to identify the individuals who are \n     likely to be able to return to work and then identify the \n     specific services they need. In doing so, each individual \n     should be functionally evaluated after his or her medical \n     condition has stabilized to assess potential for returning to \n     work. When appropriate, the private sector uses case \n     management techniques to coordinate the identification, \n     evaluation, and delivery of disability-related services to \n     individuals deemed to need such services to return to work. \n     Transitional work allows workers with disabilities to ease \n     back into the workplace in jobs that are less physically or \n     mentally demanding than their regular jobs.\n       The private sector also stresses the need to ensure that \n     physicians and other medical service providers understand the \n     essential job functions of workers with disabilities. Without \n     this understanding, the worker's return to work could be \n     delayed unnecessarily. Also, if an employer is willing to \n     provide transitional work opportunities or other job \n     accommodations, the treating physician must be aware of and \n     understand these accommodations.\n\n\n               Work Incentives Facilitate Return to Work\n\n       Finally, disability managers responding to our survey \n     generally offered incentives through their programs' cash and \n     medical benefit structure to encourage workers with \n     disabilities to return to work. Disability managers believe \n     that a program's incentive structure can affect return-to-\n     work decisions. The level of cash benefits paid to workers \n     with disabilities can affect their attitudes toward returning \n     to work because, if disability benefits are too generous, the \n     benefits can create a disincentive for participating in \n     return-to-work efforts. Disability managers also believe \n     employer-sponsored medical benefits can provide an incentive \n     to return to work if returning is the way that workers with \n     disabilities in the private sector can best ensure that they \n     retain medical benefits.\n       Although the structure of benefits plays a role in return-\n     to-work decisions, disability managers emphasized that well-\n     structured incentives are not sufficient in themselves for a \n     successful return-to-work program. Incentives must be \n     integrated with other return-to-work practices. Disability \n     managers also generally advocated including a contractual \n     requirement for cooperation with a return-to-work plan as a \n     condition of eligibility for benefits. They believed such a \n     requirement helps motivate individuals with disabilities to \n     try to return to work.\n\n\n    Return-to-Work Outcomes Could Be Improved Through Restructuring\n\n       Return-to-work strategies used in the U.S. private sector \n     and other countries reflect expectations that people with \n     disabilities can and do return to work. The DI and SSI \n     programs, however, are out of sync with this return-to-work \n     focus. Improving the DI and SSI return-to-work outcomes \n     requires restructuring these programs to better identify and \n     enhance beneficiary return-to-work capacities. While there is \n     opportunity for improvement, it should be acknowledged that \n     many beneficiaries will be unable to return to work. In fact, \n     almost half of the people receiving benefits are not likely \n     to become employed because of their age or because they are \n     expected to die within several years. For others, work \n     potential is unknown; but research suggests that successful \n     transitions to work may be more likely for younger people \n     with disabilities and for those who have greater motivation \n     and more education.\\7\\\n       Studies have shown that a meaningful portion of DI and SSI \n     beneficiaries possess such characteristics. The DI and SSI \n     disability rolls have been increasingly composed of a \n     significant number of younger individuals. Among working-age \n     SSI and DI beneficiaries, one out of three is under the age \n     of 40 \\8\\ In addition, in 1993, 35 percent of 84,000 DI \n     beneficiaries expressed an interest in receiving \n     rehabilitation or other services that could help them return \n     to work, an indication of motivation. Moreover, a substantial \n     portion--almost one in two--of a cohort of DI beneficiaries \n     had a high school degree or some years of education beyond \n     high school.\\9\\ The literature also suggests that lack of \n     work experience is a significant barrier to \n     employability.\\10\\ A promising sign is that about one-half of \n     DI and one-third of SSI working-age beneficiaries had some \n     attachment to the labor force during the 5 years immediately \n     preceding the year of benefit award.\\11\\\n       Even those who may be able to return to work will face \n     challenges. For example, some may need to learn basic skills \n     and work habits and build self-esteem to function in the \n     workplace. Moreover, the nature of some disabilities may \n     limit full-time work, while others may cause logistical \n     obstacles, such as transportation difficulties. Finally, \n     employer resistance to hiring people with disabilities and \n     tight labor market conditions, particularly for low-wage \n     positions, could constrain employment opportunities.\n       Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons to try new \n     approaches. As mentioned, our review of the disability \n     determination process shows that the work capacity of an \n     individual found eligible for DI and SSI benefits may be \n     understated. And this country has experienced medical, \n     technological, and societal advances over the past several \n     years that foster return to work. But weaknesses in the \n     design and implementation of the DI and SSI programs mean \n     that little has been done to identify and encourage the \n     productive capacities of beneficiaries who might be able to \n     benefit from these advances.\n       Restructuring of the DI and SSI programs should consider \n     the return-to-work strategies employed by the U.S. private \n     sector and social insurance programs in Germany and Sweden. \n     Lessons from these other disability programs argue for \n     placing greater priority on assessing return-to-work \n     potential soon after individuals apply for disability \n     benefits. The priority in the DI and SSI programs, however, \n     is to determine the eligibility of applicants to receive cash \n     benefits, not to assess their return-to-work potential. In \n     conjunction with making an early assessment of return-to-work \n     potential, the programs should place greater priority on \n     identifying and providing, at the earliest appropriate time, \n     the medical and vocational rehabilitation services needed to \n     return to work. But under the current program design, medical \n     and vocational rehabilitation services are provided too late \n     in the process. Finally, the programs should be designed to \n     ensure that cash and medical benefits encourage beneficiaries \n     to return to work. Presently, however, cash and medical \n     benefits can make it financially advantageous to remain on \n     the disability rolls, and many beneficiaries fear losing \n     their premium-free Medicare or Medicaid benefits if they \n     return to work.\n       Although SSA faces constraints in applying the return-to-\n     work strategies of other disability programs, opportunities \n     exist for better identifying and providing the return-to-work \n     assistance that could enable more of SSA's beneficiaries to \n     return to work. Even relatively small gains in return-to-work \n     successes offer the potential for significant savings in \n     program outlays.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       In our April 1996 report, we recommended that the \n     Commissioner take immediate action to place greater priority \n     on return to work, including designing a more effective means \n     to identify and expand beneficiaries' work capacities and \n     better implementing existing return-to-work mechanisms. In \n     line with placing greater emphasis on return to work, we \n     believe that the Commissioner needs to develop a \n     comprehensive return-to-work strategy that integrates, as \n     appropriate, earlier intervention, earlier identification and \n     provision of necessary return-to-work assistance for \n     applicants and beneficiaries, and changes in the structure of \n     cash and medical benefits. As part of that strategy, the \n     Commissioner needs to identify legislative changes that would \n     be required to implement such a program.\n       \\1\\ This testimony is based on SSA Disability: Program \n     Redesign Necessary to Encourage Return to Work(GAO/HEHS-96-\n     62, Apr. 24, 1996) and a forthcoming GAO report on return-to-\n     work strategies in the U.S. private sector, Germany, and \n     Sweden.\n       \\2\\ The estimated reductions are based on fiscal year 1994 \n     data provided by SSA's actuarial staff and represent the \n     discounted present value of the cash benefits that would have \n     been paid over a lifetime if the individual had not left the \n     disability rolls by returning to work.\n       \\3\\ Included among the 3.96 million DI beneficiaries are \n     671,000 who were dually eligible for SSI disability benefits \n     because of the low level of their income and resources.\n       \\4\\ Reference to the SSI program throughout this testimony \n     addresses blind or disabled, not aged recipients.

In the GAO report is an analysis of this program. But \nthey also looked at U.S. private and social insurance programs to find \nout, are there American companies that are trying to deal with this \nwith employees, and are there other States trying to do it?\n  Look at this. We can look at the percentages of working-age persons \nwith disabilities. We will see West Virginia is 12.6; then 11, in \nLouisiana; 10 in Maine; Oklahoma, 10.2; Oregon, 10.\n  Now, take the percent working and the percent not working. The \npercent working is 20 percent--24, 28, 23, 23. Maine has 37 percent \nworking; Oklahoma, 34; and Oregon has 42 percent working--42 percent \nworking.\n  Then we look at the percent not working--57 percent. Some other \nStates are almost 80 percent.\n  Don't you think we ought to look at the States that have large \nnumbers of people with disabilities who are working and find out how \nthey are getting people to work? And find out what is not happening in \nStates where they are not getting them to work? That is what we did in \nthis legislation. What we are finding out is, in those States, in the \nprivate sector, they are maintaining the insurance aspects of the \nhealth care and also providing the financial incentives to be able to \ngo to work. That is just in some of our States.\n  We are hopeful we can move with these incentives to get to every \nState. Some States are making dramatic improvements, and others are \nnot. The lessons are very clear, and we have included that in the \nlegislation. If we look at what is happening in other countries, in two \ncountries we find the absolutely extraordinary results they have from \nhaving similar incentives and disincentives that we have tried to \nincorporate in this legislation and that are referred to by the GAO as \nbeing very successful.\n  I would like to believe the importance of this is to make sure those \nAmericans with some disability are going to be included in the great \nAmerican dream, that we decided as a nation we not only are not going \nto discriminate but we are going to encourage policies that will make \nit possible for those with disabilities to be part of the American \ndream. What we are attempting is to do it in ways that have \ndemonstrated effectiveness.\n  The principal reasons they have been effective are along these lines. \nThey have been happening because we have seen new medical technology \nwhich has been very helpful when carefully and effectively pursued. I \nthink we all understand the costs of medical technology. In this \nparticular area, there are some great opportunities for people, by the \nuse of medical technology, to get back to work. It is working, and it \nis effective; it is cost effective.\n  We are also finding, for one reason or another--I will not take the \ntime now--a number of those going on the disability rolls have been \nyounger individuals than we were considering probably 20 years ago.\n  Another interesting corollary is, most of those individuals have a \nhigher achievement in completion of high school and college, for \nreasons I will not bother taking up the time of the Senate with at this \ntime. We are talking about younger individuals who are more adaptable \nfor these training programs, newer kinds of technology out there, and \nwhere that is accessible, more effective training programs such as we \npassed last year with our one-stop shopping and incentive programs, \nwith financial incentives in the private sector that are going to be \neffective programs getting people working. We have brought all of these \nelements together. We followed the examples that have been pointed out \nto us as effective and incorporated those in this legislation.\n  We believe this will have a dramatic and positive impact, most \nimportantly on the ability of individuals to go to work and be useful \nand productive, constructive members of our society and live happier \nlives in their own personal situations and the members of their family, \nbe more productive in the general economy, in what they are able to add \nto the economy, without these false disincentives out there, reducing \nthe financial burden on the trust funds which are paying out to the \ncommunity, and ultimately seeing a dramatic reduction in burden to the \nStates' financial situation for funding as well as to the Federal \nGovernment. This, we believe, is a win-win-win situation all the way \nalong the line.\n  I could take further time. I know there are others who want to speak \nto the underlying measure. But we believe very deeply in this \nlegislation, which has been carefully thought through by individuals \nwho will be most affected by it. That has been enormously important. \nVery often we draft and shape legislation in a way we think is best, \nbut this is legislation that has emerged from the grassroots level. We \nunderstand the difficulty of getting everyone to agree to different \nproposals.\n  We have harmony among the community that represents 300 different \norganizations. It is an extraordinary initiative, an extraordinary \nresult that is so powerful in terms of what we hope to achieve.\n  This is really a service to the country. We want the kind of America \nthat is going to say to those individuals who are faced with some \nphysical or mental challenges that we will make sure they will be able \nto participate to the extent their abilities, their interest, their \ncourage, and their determination permit them. We want to eliminate or \nknock down those barriers which one way or the other inhibit their \nability to move forward.\n  We have been attempting to do that in a number of ways, but there is \nnothing that is going to do more in opening up the dreams and the hopes \nof these individuals and their families than this piece of legislation.\n  The Americans With Disabilities Act is important in trying to \neliminate discrimination against the disabled. The Work Incentives \nImprovement Act will do the job in terms of eliminating the significant \nfinancial disincentives out there that basically inhibit so many of our \nfellow citizens, who have the ability and dedication and commitment and \ndesire, from moving forward. That is why this legislation is so \nimportant.\n  At another time, I will go through some of the other provisions of \nthe legislation.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that Connie Garner be given the \nprivilege of the floor during the consideration of the energy and water \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. In listening to the remarks of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I am struck by the fact that the people this legislation \nis attempting to help are people who do not have voices here to \nrepresent their interests; is that not generally the case?\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I like to believe there is a \ngreater understanding and awareness of the challenges that disabled \nAmericans have faced in more recent years than there had been for the \nfirst 200 years of our country. Over the last 8 or 10 years, we have \nhad some important changes in attitude on these issues.\n  By and large, the Senator is correct that this has not been an issue \nthat has been in the forefront of legislative or executive action.\n  Mr. REID. I also say there have been some people of good will joining \ntogether around the country attempting to advocate for the disabled, \nbut the people we deal with on a daily basis are usually people who \ncome representing institutions or entities and who are, in effect, well \npaid. They are people who have vast amounts of money tied up in Federal \nprograms.\n  The disabled people the Senator is attempting to help with this \nlegislation are people who have--the Senator is absolutely right--\njoined together in the last decade recognizing the disabled need help. \nBut these are volunteer groups and people, as I said, of good will \naround the country trying to help people who have no representation; is \nthat basically true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. It was not that long ago when we \nhad 5.5 million children who were disabled who never went to schools in \nour country. We have made some progress in opening up the schools of \nour country. We debated the issue of trying to give help and assistance \nto local communities. I am a strong supporter of it. I know the Senator \nfrom Nevada is. I know there are others on both sides of the aisle who \nfeel that way as well.\n  We have made some progress on other issues. I cannot speak further \nwithout recognizing the good work of the Senator from New Mexico in \nregard to mental illness. For many years, those afflicted by the \nchallenges of mental illness were kept aside in our own communities, \nand in terms of debate and discussion, there has been a general \nreluctance to talk about some of their special needs.\n\n  The Senator is quite correct. The willingness to talk about these \nissues has been in a more recent time. I can even speak of that with \nregard to my own family with a sister who is mentally retarded and \nhaving seen the evolution and the changes which have taken place in how \npeople react and respond to those who are mentally retarded.\n  We have come a long way, but the Senator is quite correct, by and \nlarge, these individuals and the communities are hard pressed with the \nday-to-day activities and do not have a great deal of time to come \nhere, although I note both Senator Reid and Senator Domenici would say \nthat when they do come here and when they do speak, there are a few \nmore eloquent voices and compelling voices for the cause of social \njustice.\n  Mr. REID. I want to say one additional thing while the Senator is on \nthe floor, and that is, the community of disabled persons around the \ncountry have been very fortunate to have Senator Kennedy as a \nspokesperson on their behalf. But I also want to mention something in \nwhich your family has been involved. It certainly has shown to me, \nhaving been involved in a number of Special Olympic programs in my own \nState, how the disabled enjoy life just as much as anyone else. There \nis no example better than athletics. I commend and applaud the Senator \nand his family for the great work they have done with the Special \nOlympics program, which is now a worldwide program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I appreciate that. As a matter of \nfact, they are having the International Special Olympics on June 27 and \n28 in North Carolina this year. There will be more than 130 countries \nparticipating in those games. That cause still goes on.\n  It is a great tribute not only to the athletes but to the parents, \nthe teachers, to the volunteers, and States all over the country that \nhave been supportive of that program. I know the Senator has been a \nsupporter of the program, and I think any of those individuals who \nwatch those programs cannot leave the field without feeling an \nextraordinary sense of inspiration. That is, I believe, enormously \nmoving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator from Massachusetts finished?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am finished. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Kennedy, I commend him for what he is \ndoing. I remind the Senate that the last time I looked, this bill had \n33 Republicans on it and was led on the Senate side by the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. He is one of the leaders, not just Senator \nJeffords from the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  Frankly, what has happened is, though we pass laws with reference to \nhelping people who are disabled, either because of physical \ndisabilities or mental disabilities, a lot of our terribly mentally \nhandicapped do participate in disability programs.  What they do not \nparticipate in very well is the training programs for them. We are just \ngetting that started.\n\n  But essentially we pass laws saying let's help them. Then we forget \nabout them for about 15 or 20 years, which is what happened here. We \nfind that in many respects the law has arbitrary finalization of \nbenefit dates that hurt instead of help. Instead of encouraging that a \nperson who is disabled go to work, if anybody is experienced with the \nold law, before we change it, what the people will be telling them is: \nBe careful, because if you try to go to work and get off, they take you \noff so quick and for such a tiny amount of earnings that sometimes that \njob finishes because the disabled do not have the propensity to have 6-\nyear-long jobs; sometimes it is 6 months, 5 months.\n  In the case of the mentally ill, sometimes a schizophrenic works 1 \nmonth. This program, unless we change it, does not work for them, \nbecause they get taken off the benefit list too quickly. Then it is \nhard to get back on. So a parent may say: Let's just not ask Jimmy to \ngo to the Green Door and get trained over here to get a job. They say: \nLet's just leave that alone and talk to him about volunteering, not \nearning money. But I tell you, to the extent we are encouraging that, \nwe are doing a very bad thing for disabled people.\n  You will find across the board, for the disabled people, young or \nold, the most important thing going is for them to get a job. You \ncannot imagine how important it is for them to get a paycheck. It is \namong the most intriguing psychological things that happens to a \ndisabled person--when they earn their own money--that you have ever \nseen.\n  Why should we have laws that help them but at the same time \ndiscourage them from getting a job because they may get kicked off the \nrolls too quickly, or they cannot get on quickly enough after they get \nunemployed? Let's change that and make it common sense.\n  I understand these laws are good laws, the ones we are changing. They \nput America in the vanguard when we passed them. They are good. But in \nthe meantime, we are finding that nothing is as good as a job. These \njobs do not pay a lot but pay just enough to qualify people under the \nold law to get off the rolls. So it is not as if it is rich people who \nare getting on and off the rolls, people earning $100,000; it is people \nearning minimum wage. In some instances, they even have youth jobs that \nare at less than minimum wage, and all of a sudden they qualify--no \nmore aid--and they are worse off than they were before. That is what \nthis is; the essence of it is to try to fix those things. We ought to \nfix them.\n  It does not belong on this bill that Senator Reid and I are managing. \nSenator Kennedy has not said it does. But, look, if you cannot resolve \nit, we are going to do what has to happen here. I hope the Republican \nleadership would get together--actually, they are in the forefront. I \nam assuming that the chairman of the Finance Committee is not here \ntoday. He would probably be here. He wants to make sure it is done \nright. He has to find offsets, does he not? There are offsets.\n  This bill is going to be neutral budgetwise. We are going to pay for \nit. It is not that we are going to add to the debt, or use up the \nsurplus or use the Social Security trust fund--none of those.\n  Frankly, I am very hopeful that our bill has served a purpose. There \nhas been a nice debate. There is nobody here who needs the Senate any \nmore\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\nthan we do right now. Nobody is offering amendments. We are waiting. It \nis all right with me if they do not. It is a fine discussion.\n  I thank the Senator. It is good to get an opportunity to comment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will not take much time.\n  The Senator has it absolutely right. We built in the program the \nability to provide the medical and some income for people who have the \ndisabilities and said that if they make over $500, they lose the \ninsurance and they lose the additional kind of insurance, that they \nwould be able to receive income, and they are just dropped out.\n  Very few of the families can be assured they can get a job after a \ntraining program where they would be able to offset their total medical \nexpenses if they are able to get health insurance. They probably are \nnot able to get it because they have a disability. The fact of the \nmatter is, the insurance companies, by and large, do not include them.\n  I have a son who lost his leg to cancer and is a very healthy young \nperson, but there is not a chance in the world he can get insurance. He \nhas insurance only as a part of a much larger group. That happens to \nindividuals who have any kind of disability. So they are out behind the \n8-ball.\n  What we are saying is, continue their health care. OK, we can phase \nout or eliminate their income. They would be willing to take a chance \non that. They will go out and try to pull their own weight. They are \nglad to do it. They will do it, and they will do it very well.\n  They have a desire to do it and the ability to do it. We have \nprovided these incentives and training programs to enable them to be \nmore creative to do it. There are more examples in a number of the \nStates about how to do it. There are a number of examples in different \ncountries on how to do it. We are going to do it in ways that are \nfinancially responsible.\n  The Senator made an excellent statement. I thank him for his \nsponsorship, as well as the Senator from Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, before Senator Kennedy leaves the \nfloor, I will just make a comment. He mentioned those disabled because \nof severe mental illnesses: manic depression, schizophrenia, severe \nchronic depression.\n  I say to the Senator, I introduced the parity bill with Senator \nWellstone to try to get more insurance coverage resources applied to \nthese serious illnesses. I want to share with the Senator, since we are \ntalking about disabilities, a notion that came to me with reference to \nseverely mentally ill people.\n  I said, what would happen if the United States, by definition, had \ndecided we would not cover, under health insurance, illnesses of the \nheart because we did not want to cover illnesses of the brain? The \ncomplicated vessels are the heart and the brain. What if 30 years ago, \nas we produced the list of coverable illnesses, we said no coverage for \nheart conditions. Guess what would have happened. None of the \nbreakthroughs in treating the heart would have ever occurred because \nthere would not have been enough resources going into it for the \nresearchers and the doctors to make the breakthroughs.\n  As a matter of fact, we would not have invented angioplasty and all \nthose other significant techniques. What would have happened in the \nmeantime is that hundreds of thousands of Americans would be dying \nearlier than they should. That would be along with what I just said.\n  When we say insurance companies should not cover schizophrenics, who \nhave a brain disease, diagnosable and treatable, that we should not \ncover them, then are we not saying the same thing about a very serious \nphysical frailty that hits between 5 and 15 million Americans during \nany given year, from the very young to the very old, with the highest \npropensity between 17 and 25 years of age for schizophrenia, manic \ndepression, and the like?\n  It seems to me that sooner or later, if we are going to call \nsomething ``health insurance,'' it ought to cover those who are sick, \nwouldn't you think?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Why do we call health insurance ``health insurance'' \nand leave out a big chunk of the American population? Because the \ndefinition chooses to will away an illness. You define it so it does \nnot exist, right? No. It exists. Families go broke. Their kids are in \njails instead of hospitals. Because once they get one of these \ndiseases, there is no way to help them, because there are no systems, \nbecause there are not enough resources. The resources come from the \nmass coverage by insurance. That is what puts resources into illnesses \nand cures.\n  So I just want to assure you, we are going to proceed this year. We \nare going to proceed with this parity bill. We are going to have a vote \nhere. I do not know which bill yet, but we are going to have a good \ndebate. We are asking the business community to get the price tag. We \ndo not want to hear any of this business that it is going to break us.\n  We want to know, based on history, what is it going to cost? Then we \nare going to let the Senators and the public decide: Is that too much? \nWhat if it isn't too much in the minds of most Americans and Senators? \nThen it seems to me the marketplace will have to adjust to it.\n  Obviously, if I have a chance, I would like to talk about this. I \nwould like to do it on the floor of the Senate so a lot of other \nAmericans hear about it. I would like to do it when somebody is here to \ntalk about the significance of this.\n  This is important business, the disabled in this country, whether \nthey are disabled physically or disabled mentally. If we are going to \nhave a real society that is proud of being free--and we have put so \nmuch emphasis on that--then we cannot leave out big chunks of the \npublic with arbitrary laws or a failure to have insurance companies \ntake care of the responsibilities of health coverage for disabled \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the good Senator knows, we have such coverage for all \nMembers of the Senate. Federal employees have it, over 11 million have \nit, and other groups have that as well. We find that it is suitable for \nMembers of Congress and for the administration, other Federal \nemployees.\n  I underline that I do not think we have health insurance worth its \nname if it doesn't meet the standard that the Senator from New Mexico \nhas outlined here. I think it is basic and fundamental. There may have \nbeen troubles with the Clinton health insurance program, but the \nPresident has recently announced that he will issue an executive order \nto provide mental health parity.\n  I say to the good Senator, my friend--I have heard him speak \neloquently, as well as our friend Senator Wellstone, and others speak \non this issue--I pledge to him that I look forward to working with him. \nI think it is enormously important. I commend the Senator for what was \ninitiated previously when we were dealing with this issue in related \nform on the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation a few years ago. We want to \nsee that and other legislation actually implemented. I commend him and \nlook forward to working with him.\n  Finally, I would like to state my support for the efforts of my good \nfriend and colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, who has long been a \nchampion of the need for better and more comprehensive approaches to \nsuicide prevention. Suicide claims over 30,000 lives each year in this \ncountry; it is the eighth leading cause of death overall and the third \nmajor cause of death amongst teenagers from 15-19. It is an issue \nclearly associated with mental health parity. If better access to \nmental health services were available for all persons who have \npsychiatric conditions, the suicide rate would be dramatically reduced. \nIt is time to provide mental health parity and to prevent these \nunnecessary family tragedies.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, even though this is the energy and water\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\nbill, I am glad we are going to have this conversation this afternoon \nabout mental health.\n  An area I have worked on that is now receiving more attention is \nsuicide. Thirty-one thousand people each year in the United States kill \nthemselves. What if 31,000 people were killed in some other manner? We \nwould focus a lot of attention on it.\n  There are almost as many people killed in car wrecks every year. We \nhave airbags and we have speed limits. We do all kinds of things to \nprevent people from being killed in automobile accidents. We have even \ndone a much better job in recent years trying to stop people from \ndriving under the influence of alcohol.\n  Suicide is a very difficult problem in America today. During the time \nwe have been on this bill--it is now 3:30 eastern time; we started at \n1--about 12 people in the United States have killed themselves. So it \nis an issue I hope we will spend more time on.\n  For the first time in the history of the country we are spending \nmoney to find out why people commit suicide. We don't know why. An \ninteresting fact is that the 10 leading States in the United States for \nsuicide are western United States, States west of the Mississippi. We \ndon't know why this is, but it is now being studied by the Centers for \nDisease Control. We appropriated money last year to try to focus on \nthis.\n  Not only is this, of course, terrible for the person who dies, but \nwhat it does to the victims, the people who are the survivors.\n  I am happy to hear the discussion this afternoon about mental health \ngenerally. I want to talk about suicide specifically. It is an area \nthat we really have to focus some attention on and get Members of the \nCongress to agree that we have to do something about this. It is an \nissue that is crying for an answer. I hope that in the years to come we \ncan do much more than we have done in the past, which wouldn't take \nvery much, but it is an area in which we need to do much more. I hope \nwe can do that.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. REID. I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my good friend, the ranking member on this \nsubcommittee, we have a good, bipartisan bill. I hope we can make the \npoint that we worked together to make it bipartisan, because I think \nthat is the way we get a bill that we can get through here and can \nsustain.\n  Commenting on your last statement and your efforts with reference to \nsuicide, that is not unrelated to what I was discussing at all.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know the numbers, but I am going to guess that \n60 to 70 percent of the suicides are probably found to be caused by a \nmental illness, most of them by severe depression. Frankly, one of the \nreasons we have so many suicides is because we have not created a \nculture among our medical people and among those who help our medical \npeople of properly diagnosing such things as depression.\n  One of the reasons we don't have a culture that does the diagnosis \nright is because it is not covered by insurance. As a consequence, \nthere are not enough resources put in at the grassroots where doctors \nare getting paid for this and universities can do research on it, \nbecause it is worthwhile to the doctors to become experts in this. We \nare doing a little more than we did in the past but not enough from the \nstandpoint of real mass involvement.\n  Young people in particular are the majority victims of the suicide \nnumbers, which is such a shame. Many of those 21,000 are kids; right?\n  Mr. REID. Thirty-one thousand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Teenagers, 31,000; they are not in the senior citizen \nnumbers. There is a small percentage, but the big percentage are in the \nabsolute throes of starting a great life. If we could do a better job \nwith diagnosing depression, we would have medication and therapy \npreventing many of those 31,000.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. REID. I think one of the reasons we have made more progress on \nsuicide and other mental health problems in recent years is because \npeople who have problems with depression, people who are survivors of \nsuicides are willing to talk about it. It wasn't many years ago----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is true.\n  Mr. REID.--For example, my father, who committed suicide, wouldn't \nhave been able to be buried in the cemetery. My father would have to \nhave been buried someplace else because suicide was considered sinful, \nwrong.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. REID. So I believe clearly that the Senator is absolutely right. \nThe Senator and I, as an example, are willing to talk about some of our \nexperiences with mental health problems. As a result of that, it is not \nsomething people tend to hide as much as they used to. We recognize \nthat depression is a medical condition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have it.\n  Mr. REID. It is no different than if you have pneumonia. Depression \nis like pneumonia. We are learning how to cure depression. We learned \nsome time ago how to cure pneumonia. So the more that we talk about \nthis, the more people are willing to say: I think I am just depressed. \nI need some help. Is there somebody who can help me.\n  The fact of the matter is, as the Senator said, we did some hearings \non depression and suicide. With suicide, they had really an interesting \nprogram in the State of Washington where one city developed an outreach \nprogram with mail carriers. When someone would go to deliver mail, \nespecially in areas where there were senior citizens--sometimes the \nonly contact a senior would have was with the mail carrier--the mail \ncarrier was trained to recognize symptoms of depression and, \nconsequently, suicide and saved a lot of people.\n  I remember a hearing we had in the Aging Committee; a woman who wrote \npoems came in. She showed us a poem she wrote when she was depressed \nand when she wanted to kill herself and a poem she wrote afterwards. I \ncan't remember the poem--I am not like Senator Byrd--but I can remember \nparts of it where she talked about the snow was like diamonds in her \nhair.\n  If we could do a better job of recognizing depression, talk about \nthat one, mental illness, depression, think of the money we would save. \nWe would have a much more productive society. The workforce would be \nmore productive. The gross national product would go up as a result of \nthat.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, having just returned from Minnesota, I want to speak \non the floor for a few short minutes, first of all, in support of the \namendment that my colleague, Senator Kennedy, introduced, which is \nreally the Work Incentives Improvement Act, S.331, which he has done so \nmuch work on, along with Senator Jeffords.\n  My understanding is--it could be that my colleague, Senator Reid of \nNevada, spoke about this--Senator Kennedy came to the floor and said: \n``Listen, we want some action on this bill.'' We do want action on \nthis. We have 78 Senators who are cosponsors of the Work Incentives \nImprovement\n  Seventy-eight consponsors means, by definition, that this is a strong \nbipartisan effort.\n  The reason for this bill, with all of its support, is really all \nabout dignity. For Senators who talk about self-sufficiency and self-\nreliance and people being able to live lives with dignity, that is what \nthis is about.\n  I am sure the Chair has experienced this, when you are back home and \nyou talk to people in the disabilities community over and over again, \nyou hear people telling you that they are ready to go to work if only \nthey could be sure they wouldn't lose their health insurance--insurance \nthey literally need to live. I don't know, but I think the unemployment \nrate among people with disabilities is well above 50 percent; the \npoverty rate is also above 50 percent. The problem is, when people in \nthe disabilities community work, they\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\nlose the medical assistance they have now.\n  What this piece of legislation says is that we want people to be able \nto live at home in as near a normal circumstance as possible, with \ndignity. That is what the Work Incentives Improvement Act is all about.\n  I come to the floor to say to my colleague, Senator Kennedy, that if \nhe wants to force the issue on this bill that we have before us, the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bill, I am all for that. If we can get \nsome kind of a commitment from Senators as to whether we can bring this \npiece of legislation up freestanding, have an up-or-down vote--78 \nSenators are cosponsors--then I am for that.\n  Those of us who feel strongly about this issue and have met with \npeople back home and heard their pleas really want to respond to the \nconcerns and circumstances of their lives. It is very moving to meet \nwith people in the disabilities community, to have people say to you: \nIf you could do this, it would help us so much.\n  We are running out of patience; we really are. For colleagues who are \nblocking this and getting in the way of our being able to bring this to \nthe floor and having a vote on this, be it unanimous consent, or be it \n78 to 22, or 99 to 1 or whatever the case might be, so be it. I do not \nmind the 1; I have been on the losing end of a couple 99 to 1 votes in \nthe last two months. If a Senator feels strongly about that, and it is \nhis or her honest opinion that this legislation shouldn't pass, fine. \nHe or she has the right to speak out, to try to persuade others and to \nvote his or her conscience. What I don't like is the way in which this \npiece of legislation has been held up so that it is not possible to \ndebate it and vote on it at all. That, I think, is unconscionable.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. As the Senator was traveling here from Minnesota by air, \nSenator Kennedy gave a very moving presentation about the necessity for \nthis legislation, which, when he finished, caused the two managers of \nthis legislation to talk about some of the work you and Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Domenici and this Senator joined in, dealing with mental \nhealth parity. It was a very good discussion, stimulated by Senator \nKennedy's presentation on this legislation, which is so badly needed.\n  Senator Kennedy has indicated that he filed this amendment on this \nlegislation in the hope of focusing attention on this issue. If we have \nso much support--we have almost 80 Senators supporting this \nlegislation--it would seem that we should figure out a way to pay for \nit. That is the problem. I think that will come to be, as Senator \nKennedy has talked to the majority leader and other people who \nrecognize that they control the ebb and flow of legislation on this \nfloor. In short, I say to the Senator, I think Senator Kennedy did the \nright thing in filing this amendment on this legislation, or any other \nlegislation. If it doesn't work out on this bill, he might have to do \nit on the next bill, but I support the efforts of the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, again, I appreciate the comments of \nSenator Reid of Nevada. I think all of us feel strongly about this and \nare prepared to fight it out. We have waited long enough for the men \nand women, the young people and the elderly people with disabilities \nwho want to work and who will lose health care coverage. We ought to \npass this legislation, and the sooner the better.\n  I will yield the floor in a moment. I wasn't here for the colloquy or \nthe suggestion about our mental health parity legislation. I am looking \nforward to this journey with Senators Domenici, Reid, and Kennedy--and \nmaybe I am really being presumptuous, but I hope Senator Collins and \nothers as well, because I think the time has come for this idea. I \nthink you can make a pretty strong case there that there is entirely \ntoo much discrimination when it comes to coverage for those struggling \nwith mental illness. This cuts across a broad section of the \npopulation.\n  I am extremely hopeful that we will be able to pass this legislation, \nwhich would make a huge positive difference in the lives of so many \npeople. I want to say on the floor that I am also committed to trying \nto do more when it comes to substance abuse treatment. We have the same \nproblem there, where people have pretty good coverage for physical \nillnesses, but for somebody struggling with alcoholism, it is a detox \ncenter 2 or 3 days each time a year, and that is it. You know, a lot of \nthese diseases are brain diseases with biochemical connections and \nneurological connections and people's health insurance should cover the \ndisease of addiction just like it covers heart disease or diabetes.\n  Our policy is way behind; it is outdated and discriminatory. The \ntragedy of it is that so many people in the recovery community can talk \nabout the ways in which, when they received treatment, they have been \nable to rebuild their lives and contribute at their place of work, to \ntheir families, and to their communities. This is nonsensical. So these \nwill be separate pieces of legislation on the Senate side. But I am \nvery excited about this effort with Senator Domenici, Senator Reid, \nSenator Kennedy, and others as well. I believe we can pass this mental \nhealth parity legislation. I think what we did in 1996 was a small step \nforward. Now I think we have to do something that will really provide \npeople with much more coverage.\n  Having said that, let me just make one other point. When we talk \nabout this whole issue of parity and trying to end discrimination in \nhealth insurance coverage, one issue we still don't deal with is what \nhappens if people have no coverage at all. When we are saying you ought \nto treat these illnesses the same way we treat physical illnesses, what \nwe are not doing is dealing with those that have no coverage \nwhatsoever. I still think that a front-burner issue in American \npolitics is universal health care coverage and comprehensive health \ncare reform.\n  I have introduced legislation called the Healthy Americans Act. \nSometime I would like to bring it out on the floor and have an up-or-\ndown vote on it. I think we ought to be talking about universal \ncoverage. The insurance industry took it off the table a few years ago; \nI think we should put it back on the table and I am going to work as \nhard as I can to do that.\n  But right now, I wanted to come to the floor and support Senator \nKennedy's effort. Hopefully, we will soon have an up-or-down vote on \nthe Work Incentives Improvement Act. I hope we don't have to keep \nbringing it out as an amendment on other bills so it gets the attention \nit needs. This is a piece of legislation that deserves an up-or-down \nvote now.\n  Finally, also in the spirit of amendments, I will keep bringing back \nthe welfare tracking amendment, because the more I look at the studies \nthat are coming out and the more I talk to people in the field, the \nmore strongly I feel that as policymakers we ought to at least have \nsome evaluation of what we have done. I think it is a terrible mistake \nnot to do so. My amendment lost by one vote last time. I will bring it \nback, and I hope to get a couple more votes. It does nothing more than \njust say to Health and Human Services let's get from the States data \nevery year so we know what is happening to the women and children, so \nwe can have a sense of what kind of jobs they have, at what wages, and \nwhether there is child care for children. We need to do that. It is a \nterrible mistake not to have that knowledge.\n  I want to mention to colleagues that I will be bringing this \namendment out within the next week--if not this week, next week--and I \nam hoping this time to somehow get a majority vote for it. I think it \nis reasonable and we should do it. I don't think we should turn away \nfrom this. It is important to know, especially because in the next \ncouple of years, by 2002, in every State in the country, benefit \nreductions will have been fully felt. I think we ought to know how we \nare doing before that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to Senator Domenici, I look forward to this work \non the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6939-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6939-S6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, as one who voted against the air war \nand called for the suspension of bombing on the grounds that it was not \nworking, I rise to acknowledge clearly, and indeed even joyfully, that \nwe have reached a significant milestone and have turned a significant \nand most welcome corner in our humanitarian effort to stop the butchery \nin the Balkans. I congratulate President Clinton, Secretary Cohen and, \nof course, the men and women of all ranks in the U.S. military for \ntheir ability to project American military power for good in a distant \nland.\n  I also congratulate Secretary Albright for her ability to hold \ntogether an occasionally fractious coalition. With the bombing stopped \nand NATO troops moving unopposed into Kosovo, it is certainly a time \nfor celebration. It is not, however, a time to suggest that the \nproblems of the Balkans are at an end, or even that the end is in \nsight. There have been many mentions of Winston Churchill in the last \nfew months. I am reminded of one of Churchill's comments from World War \nII, made as he celebrated America's entry into that war:\n\n       It is not the end of the war. It is not even the beginning \n     of the end. But it is the end of the beginning.\n\n  Let us review where we have been, where we are, and what we still \nhave to do before there is peace in the Balkans.\n  First, where we have been. As happy as we are with today's headlines, \nlet us remember that we failed to meet our initial objectives. \nSecretary Albright told us that we had to bomb to prevent widespread \natrocities in Kosovo and a flood of refugees over its borders into \nneighboring countries. The bombing failed to do that, and the resultant \nhuman suffering has been immense and is continuing.\n  Even at this point, let us not deceive ourselves about the \neffectiveness of the bombing. One of the reasons I was wrong in \nsuggesting that the bombing would not work was that I did not know that \nthe Kosovar Liberation Army would mount a serious offensive on the \nground. It failed. But it caused the Serbian military to leave its \nhidden sanctuaries in order to repulse the Kosovars. Only then, while \nthe Serbian military was engaged in ground action,\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\nwas the force of NATO air power able to inflict heavy damage in the \nfield. Prior to that, the results of our bombing on Serb military \ncapacity were frustratingly meager. I find it interesting that the KLA \noffensive was neither foreseen in advance, nor now, in our jubilant \nmood, widely reported after the fact. Those who claim that the bombing \nworked all by itself need to take a second look at what really \nhappened.\n  Next, where are we now? The refugees are still not back in their \nhomes, in their villages. Their homes are still not rebuilt. Their \neconomy, which will permit them to feed themselves, is still in \nshambles. Further, the Kosovar Serbs, as opposed to the Kosovar \nAlbanians, are now in fear of their lives, and a new flood of refugees \nis flowing north. Their numbers are far fewer than those of the \nreturnees, but the Serbian refugees entering that part of Yugoslavia \nwill swell the ranks of the still-unsettled refugees that came there \nfrom Bosnia, where any form of long-term peace is still elusive. The \nYugoslav economy--indeed, the regional economy--including neighboring \ncountries such as Romania, is in shambles in no small part because of \nour attacks on the infrastructure in and around Belgrade.\n  Winter comes early in the Balkans and the prospects of widespread \nsuffering remains high. So what do we still have to do? Our first \npriority should be the humanitarian relief required to alleviate the \nsuffering in both parts of Yugoslavia, Serbia as well as Kosovo. Hand \nin hand should be efforts to repair the damage the bombing has done so \nthat the economic activity that is the only hope for self-sufficiency \ncan begin. But our hardest challenge is to keep the killing from \nbreaking out again on both sides. It may be easy for some to say that \nthe Serbs deserve whatever revenge the Kosovar Albanians will mete \nout, and that they only get what they asked for simply by being Serbs.\n\n  That is the attitude held by most ethnic groups in the region that \ngot us into this mess in the first place. It should be repugnant to all \nAmericans. All of them should celebrate the ethnic diversity from which \neach one of us comes.\n  The biggest long-term burden NATO's occupying force bears is the \nresponsibility to see that no new round of ethnic hatred and \nretaliation takes place, whoever initiates it and whatever its supposed \njustification.\n  In sum, this is the time to be glad, because, with an unexpected and \nstrong assist from the Kosovar Liberation Army, we made a deal whereby \nthe bombing has been stopped and the rebuilding can start. It is not a \ntime to cry, ``Hurrah, we won,'' and then walk away from the immense \nhumanitarian tragedy we were unable to prevent and to which in some \ndegree our bombing contributed.\n  Above all, it is not a time for us to think there are any easy \nanswers or short-term solutions or that the antagonisms of the region \nare easily divided into good guys and bad guys. Americans must \nrecognize that we are in Kosovo for a very long haul now and working \nagainst very long odds if we are ever going to help the various \nfactions achieve any hope of living peacefully side by side. In our \ntime of congratulations, let us recognize that we are only ``at the end \nof the beginning.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I rise today to join a bipartisan chorus of \nSenators who have requested we take up action on Senate bill S. 331, \nthe Work Incentives Improvement Act.\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation would remove a significant \nbarrier that individuals with disabilities face when they are trying to \nreturn to the workforce. The significant barrier is continued access to \nhealth care if they leave SSDI or SSI programs. Currently, individuals \nwith disabilities who are eligible for Social Security disability \ninsurance, SSDI, or supplemental security income, SSI, face the dilemma \nof losing their Medicare and Medicaid health benefits simply because \nthey return to work.\n  This is regrettable. According to surveys, about three-quarters of \nindividuals with disabilities in the United States who enroll in SSI or \nSSDI want to work. Sadly, less than one-half of 1 percent are actually \nable to make the transition because--this is a major reason--they are \nafraid once they lose their health care they will be unable to support \nthemselves. Whatever they earn by working they lose by forfeiting their \nhealth care.\n  We can correct this situation by simply extending eligibility to \nMedicare and Medicaid for these individuals. We can provide them a \nhelping hand to move from unemployment to contributing to our economy \nand to our society.\n  With the Americans With Disabilities Act, we passed legislation to \ncombat discrimination and remove physical barriers from the workplace. \nNow we have a chance to lift a health care roadblock which is stopping \nmany people from moving from a place of unemployment to one in which \nthey are fully participating in our economy.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, there are more than 40,000 \nindividuals with disabilities who are eligible for SSI or SSDI. These \nindividuals could benefit immediately from this work incentives bill. \nAcross the country, there are about 9.5 million people who are \nsimilarly situated who could benefit from this legislation.\n  In addition to the simple argument about fairness and giving everyone \nthe chance to fully use their talents to benefit not only themselves \nbut their community, there is another compelling reason. We are all \nfamiliar with the solvency crisis with respect to Social Security but \nwhat is less familiar is that with respect to our disability insurance \nfund--which is part of Social Security--there is also a crisis. Indeed, \nwhile the old age and survivors portion of Social Security will be able \nto pay full benefits until the year 2036, the disability insurance \nportion becomes insolvent 16 years earlier, in 2020.\n  If we help disabled workers return to the workforce, we will, in \neffect, also be reducing the cash payments out of this disability \ninsurance fund which will give it longer solvency, which will be a way \nto address a problem that is lurking just over the horizon in the year \n2020.\n  For economic reasons, as well as our commitment to the basic ideal of \nallowing Americans to use all of their talents, this legislation makes \na great deal of sense.\n  Now, we have seen this legislation proposed under the able leadership \nof Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy. This Work Incentives \nImprovement Act was nearly adopted at the end of last Congress because \nof their effort. I was a very proud cosponsor of that version. This \nyear, Senators Roth and Moynihan have also stepped up to take major \nleadership roles. Indeed, we have more than 70 cosponsors. This is a \npiece of legislation that is bipartisan, with strong support in both \ncaucuses. Because of this support, because of the efforts of the \nleadership of Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, this bill passed the \nFinance Committee on March 4, 1999, but we have been waiting for \nseveral months to bring it to the floor, to get it passed, and to give \ndisabled Americans a chance at better employment.\n\n  In March, we were able to take another bill with bipartisan support, \nthe Ed-Flex bill, and work through the problems. The reason we were \nable to do that was we decided to act, we decided not to let \nlegislation be bottled up, but to move it to this floor, and from this \nfloor to the President for his signature.\n  We have today with respect to this disability legislation twice the \ninherent support in terms of numbers of Senators, and it also has \ngrassroots support with more than 100 groups endorsing this bill. This \nsupport runs the gamut from advocacy groups for disabled Americans all \nthe way to the insurance industry. With this type of support, both \nwithin this Chamber and across the country, we should be able to move \nthis just as we moved the Ed-Flex legislation a few months ago.\n  Also, I was pleased to note that in a May 28 edition of the \nWashington Post,\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\nthe majority leader indicated he was satisfied with the status of this \nbill and ready to move to the floor. It is my hope we can adopt this \nlegislation, that we can bring it here, that we can debate it, and we \ncan move it forward. If we do so, we will be providing an opportunity \nfor disabled Americans all across this country to use their talents for \ntheir own benefit and to contribute to the communities and to this \nNation. That, I think, is the essence of why we are here--for wise \nlegislative policies that allow Americans to use their talents to \nbenefit themselves and this country.\n  I hope we adopt this very quickly. That means, of course, we schedule \nthis legislation; that we will, in fact, bring to the floor the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act for a vote. If we do so, we will be doing \nthe work we were sent here to do by our constituents.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

We are working on a number of \namendments. There is probably one that is going to require a vote \ntomorrow. But they won't be ready this evening in any event. We knew \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I only say to my friend, the manager of this \nbill, that the amendments are now in. We, together with our staff, have \nworked very hard to see what we can do to accept amendments. Some of \nthem are just not acceptable. We have tried every way possible. But \nsome of them are not authorized, and there are various other reasons we \ncan't accept a number of the amendments. I hope people will understand \nthat some of these we can't accept.

REIMER\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service, \nsacrifices, and numerous contributions to the security of our nation \nthat United States Army Chief of Staff, General Dennis J. Reimer has \nmade throughout his career as a soldier and a leader.\n  As have many of our nation's greatest warriors, General Reimer began \nhis Army career as a Cadet at the United States Military Academy. \nLeaving his hometown of Medford, Oklahoma and arriving on the banks of \nthe Hudson River on what must certainly have been a hot day in July of \n1958, I suspect that the last thought that crossed the mind of a young \nDennis Reimer was that he would one day hold the highest job a soldier \nin the United States Army can hold. Yet that is just what destiny had \nin store for this tall, unassuming, and plain speaking westerner.\n  In 1962, when Dennis Reimer graduated from West Point and was \ncommissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Field Artillery, we were well \ninto the ``Cold War'', the French had lost their war in Indochina, and \nthe United States had not yet established a large military presence in \nSouth Vietnam. As events unfolded and a policy to contain communism was \nestablished, it was not long before we did begin to commit troops to \nSoutheast Asia. Among the hundreds of thousands of soldiers to \neventually serve in Vietnam was Dennis Reimer, who spent two combat \ntours in Vietnam, one as an advisor to the Army of the Republic of \nVietnam and the second as an executive officer for an artillery \nbattalion in the 9th Infantry Division. The American military \nexperience in Vietnam unquestionably influenced the professional and \npersonal outlooks of anyone who served in that theater, and the lessons \nlearned in Vietnam would serve Dennis Reimer, the Army, and that nation \nwell in the following years.\n  One can assess the career of a soldier very quickly by looking at his \nor her uniform, and General Reimer's ``Class A's'' reveal that he is a \nsoldier's soldier, someone who never shied away from a challenge, and \nan officer who believed in leading by example. He wears the coveted \n``Ranger'' tab on his left shoulder, a mark of a man who has proven \nhimself to be a tough, resourceful, and diligent soldier. The 9th \nInfantry Division patch on his right shoulder tells people he went to \nwar with this unit. The Combat Infantryman's Badge he wears on his left \nchest indicates that he participated in combat operations; the Purple \nHeart that he was wounded in action; and, the Bronze Star with ``V'' \nfor Valor Device and the Distinguished Flying Cross both stand as \ntestament to the fact that he is a hero. He has also earned some of the \nnation's most respected decorations including the Defense Distinguished \nService Medal, the Distinguished Service Medal, two Legions of Merit, \nand five additional Bronze Stars.\n  It has been a long road that Dennis Reimer has traveled from West \nPoint's Trophy Point where he entered the Corps of Cadets, to the ``E'' \nRing of the Pentagon where he now commands every single soldier in the \nUnited States Army. His journey has taken him to many different \nassignments in many different places, all of which helped to prepare \nhim for his job as Chief of Staff of the Army. In the field, he served \nas a commander at the company, battalion, and division levels; and, he \nwas the Chief of Staff, Combined Field Army and Assistant Chief of \nStaff for Operations and Training, Republic of Korea/United States \nCombined Forces Command. His assignments to the Pentagon were also \ninvaluable as he benefitted from firsthand exposure to how the \nDepartment of the Army works as an institution. Clearly he has drawn on \nhis experiences as the aide-de-camp to Chief of Staff of the Army \nGeneral Creighton Abrams, and he no doubt learned many lessons at the \nside of this impressive soldier and mentor. In short, General Dennis \nReimer was probably one of the best prepared individuals to have served \nas Chief of Staff of the Army and the legacy he leaves is one that is \nimpressive and noteworthy.\n  The past four-years have been busy ones for General Reimer as he \ndischarged his duties as the Army's head soldier and worked to \nrepresent the interests of his people and service in the halls of \nCongress. During his watch, he has helped to define just what the post-\nCold War Army will look like, what its missions will be, and how it \nwill fight and win on the battlefields of the future. General Reimer \nhas been a tireless advocate for the modernization of the Army by \nchampioning new weapons systems that will continue to give our troops \nthe tactical and technological advantage they require to overwhelm any \nand all potential enemies. An expert in efficiencies, he has dedicated\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\nhimself to finding ways to doing more with less, an important objective \nin an era when sadly there are fewer and fewer dollars for defense. He \ncommitted himself to effectively integrating Reserve and National Guard \nelements into the total force, and General Reamer's efforts have gone a \nlong way toward creating what is truly a ``Total Army''. Finally, when \nhis former superior, General Abrams said that ``The Army is not made up \nof people, the Army is people,'' General Reimer was listening. As Chief \nof Staff, he was always watching out for his soldiers, never forgetting \nthat ``Soldiers are our credentials,'' and our nation's greatest asset. \nWithout well trained, motivated, and intelligent soldiers, our tanks, \nguns, weapons, and aircraft are all worthless.\n  On June 21, 1999, General Dennis J. Reimer will retire from the \nUnited States Army, having fulfilled the prediction of an anonymous \neditor of the Howitzer who said in 1962 that ``. . . we're sure Denny \nwill make it to the top.'' He has certainly done that and more, proving \nbeyond a doubt that he is truly a ``Can Do'' soldier, leader, and \nAmerican. I have no doubt that General Reimer is far from finished in \nfinding ways to serve and make a difference, and I am confident that \nhis future will be as bright and successful as his past has been. \nGeneral Reimer, I salute you for your service, your sacrifices, and \nyour patriotism and I wish you and your wife health and happiness in \nthe years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6943-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SESQUICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE MACON BEACON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I want to pay tribute to The Macon \nBeacon, a newspaper in Macon, MS, on the occasion of its \nsesquicentennial celebration.\n  This is a special event for Mississippi and for the city of Macon. \nMedia exists to report what actually happens locally, nationally and \nglobally. For 150 years, the Beacon has been reporting facts relevant \nto the lives of Noxubee County residents. The Beacon reached the \nSesquicentennial milestone because it is a reliable source of \ninformation for its community.\n  I want to tell my colleagues a brief history of this historic yet \nvibrant newspaper. The Macon Beacon paper was founded in July 1849, for \nthe people of Noxubee County, Mississippi. The county was established \nonly 16 years before in 1833. The Beacon is the third oldest newspaper \nin Mississippi. It even has the distinction of being Noxubee County's \noldest continuous business. This demonstrates the Macon Beacon's \ncontinued importance to the people of Noxubee County.\n  E.W. and Henry C. Ferris founded The Macon Beacon in 1849 and it \nremained in the Ferris family for the next 123 years. Its editorship \npassed down through the Ferris family from Henry to his son, Phillip, \nand then to his son Douglas. Douglas recruited a cousin, Brooke Ferris, \nto continue the family's leadership in the business. This is an amazing \nand honorable family legacy.\n  In 1972, upon Mr. Brooke Ferris's retirement, Mr. Jim Robbins \npurchased The Macon Beacon. The Robbins family of Macon, Mississippi, \ncontinued to publish the newspaper until 1993. Then Mr. Scott Boyd \nbought it and he continues to publish The Macon Beacon today.\n  The First Amendment to the Constitution indicates the importance of a \nfree and vigilant press to our democratic republic. The Macon Beacon \nhas lived up to these expectations by faithfully reporting community \nevents for 150 years. The Macon Beacon has survived and flourished \nthrough three major wars, including the War Between the States, and the \nGreat Depression. Each edition of The Beacon is eagerly awaited by the \nnewspaper's 3,100 subscribers, more than a fourth of the county's \npopulation.\n  In the words of its founding editor, Mr. Henry C. Ferris, The Macon \nBeacon is ``a semi-public institution dedicated to the service of the \npeople.'' I want to congratulate The Macon Beacon on the celebration of \n150 years of dedicated service to Noxubee County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6943-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKS TO SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to say farewell to a \nwonderful group of young men and women who have served as Senate pages \nover the last five months, and thank them for the contributions they \nmake to the day-to-day operations of the Senate.\n  This particular group of pages has served with distinction and has \ndone a marvelous job of balancing their responsibilities to their \nstudies and to this body.\n  Page life is not easy. I suspect few people understand the rigorous \nnature of the page's work. On a typical day, pages rise early and are \nin school by 6:15 a.m. After several hours in school each morning, \npages then report to the Capitol to prepare the Senate Chamber for the \nday's session. Throughout the day, pages are called upon to perform a \nwide array of tasks--from obtaining copies of documents and reports for \nSenators to use during debate, to running errands between the Capitol \nand the Senate office buildings, to lending a hand at our weekly \nconference luncheons.\n  Once we finish our business here for the day--no matter what time--\nthe pages return to the dorm and prepare for the next day's classes and \nSenate session and, we hope, get some much-needed sleep. Even with all \nof this, they continually discharge their tasks efficiently and \ncheerfully.\n  Aside from their normal day-to-day duties, this class in particular \nhas had some extraordinary experiences as they witnessed firsthand the \ndemocratic process with all of its strengths and its imperfections. On \ntheir first day as Senate pages, they were thrown into the middle of \nthe impeachment debate. As their semester here progressed, they \nwitnessed several historic debates such as whether to send our \ncountry's armed forces into an international conflict far from home. \nAnd they watched our country struggle through the aftermath of \ntragedies such as Littleton, Colorado and the Senate's efforts to pass \nmeaningful gun control legislation.\n  I hope every person in this page class gained some insight into the \nneed for individuals to become involved in community and civic \nactivities. By living and working together, they have gained knowledge \nabout the political process that they could not obtain from a textbook \nalone. The future of our nation strongly depends on the generations who \nwill follow us in this august body. I look forward to the possibility \nthat one or more of this fine group of young people will return as a \nmember of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, with your permission, I would like to insert in the \nRecord the names and states of each of the Senate pages to whom we are \nsaying goodbye. They are: Derek Alsup, New Hampshire; Devin Barta, \nWisconsin; Halicia Burns, Michigan; Richard Carroll, Delaware; Micah \nCermele, Alabama; Cathryn Cone, Missouri; Clay Crockett, Michigan; \nDanielle Driscoll, California; Mark Hadley, Virginia; Patrick Hallahan, \nNew Jersey; Jessica Lipschultz, Idaho; Jennifer Machacek, Iowa; Brendan \nMcCann, Virginia; Mark Nexon, Vermont; Chandra Obie, Montana; Stephanie \nStahl, South Dakota; Marian Thorpe, West Virginia; Stephanie Valencia, \nNew Mexico; and George Vana IV, Vermont.\n  I'm sure all my colleagues join me in thanking these fine young men \nand women, and wishing them well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6943-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6943-S6944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to \nrealize that 30 years of federal deficits have taken their toll on the \nfederal budget.\n  Likewise, two budget ``surpluses,'' although a step in the right \ndirection, will scarcely make a dent on the actual federal debt \noppressing both the government and the people. In fact, it does very \nlittle, but constrict the actual increase of the federal debt.\n  Even if the projected estimates from the Office of Management and \nBudget are correct, a surplus for 11 consecutive years will go hand-in-\nhand with a ``gross federal debt'' that will inch closer and closer to \na 6 trillion dollar figure!--Now that, Mr. President, is a couple I do \nnot particularly like to envision. But that is where we are. We are in \na quagmire of debts.\n  I have heard comments that we--the Congress and this Administration--\nhave taken steps to cut the federal deficit, but what is not being said \nis that\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\nthe budget ``surplus'' has little effect on the federal debt. We have \nindeed managed to cut the deficit out of the equation, but the answer \nto the relevant question--are we reducing the total federal debt at the \nsame time--is NO. The surplus only cuts the debt's rate of growth.\n  With these thoughts in mind, Mr. President, I begin where I left off \non Thursday:\n  At the close of business, Friday, June 11, 1999, the federal debt \nstood at $5,606,704,532,050.51 (Five trillion, six hundred six billion, \nseven hundred four million, five hundred thirty-two thousand, fifty \ndollars and fifty-one cents).\n  One year ago, June 11, 1998, the federal debt stood at \n$5,496,698,000,000 (Five trillion, four hundred ninety-six billion, six \nhundred ninety-eight million).\n  Fifteen years ago, June 11, 1984, the federal debt stood at \n$1,519,173,000,000 (One trillion, five hundred nineteen billion, one \nhundred seventy-three million).\n  Twenty-five years ago, June 11, 1974, the federal debt stood at \n$472,107,000,000 (Four hundred seventy-two billion, one hundred seven \nmillion) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--\n$5,134,597,532,050.51 (Five trillion, one hundred thirty-four billion, \nfive hundred ninety-seven million, five hundred thirty-two thousand, \nfifty dollars and fifty-one cents) during the past 25 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6944-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WELCOME TO THE BOY SCOUTS FROM MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, the late Admiral James W. (Bud) Nance was \neulogized in late May by an eloquent friend who knew Bud well, a friend \nwho had worked with Bud on many occasions beginning with their \nrespective responsibilities with President Reagan during the eight \nyears of the Reagan presidency.\n  That eloquent friend is a friend of many of us, a remarkable American \nwho understands the miracle of this great country, Richard V. Allen, \nChairman, The Richard V. Allen Company.\n  Mr. President, Dick Allen was speaking at a dinner on behalf of a \nnon-profit foundation at Wingate University. He began by paying his \nrespects to ``fifteen distinguished directors'' of the foundation, \namong them the Honorable Roger Milliken identified by Mr. Allen as \n``the champion of good causes''.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I shall pick up, verbatim, Mr. Allen's \nremarks, and I ask that the remainder of those remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       But another of these distinguished persons is not with us \n     this evening, and it is about him--a very special person--\n     that I am honored to speak some heartfelt words.\n       I refer of course, to Admiral James W. Nance, an \n     extraordinary patriot who was laid to rest yesterday morning \n     at Arlington National Cemetery, perhaps the Senator's closest \n     confidant after Mrs. Helms, and with whom I was privileged to \n     have a close relationship for nearly two decades.\n       It is not possible to convey either the depth of sorrow \n     reigning over Washington in the week since Bud Nance departed \n     this earth, nor is it possible to capture in words the \n     grandeur of the successive honors and tributes so justly \n     showered upon him in recent days as we celebrated his \n     extraordinary career, his lifetime with his loving family and \n     with us.\n       Bud Nance and Jesse Helms are two distinct persons, friends \n     since they were little boys and friends for life, men who \n     knew and understood each other as stalwart loyalists to God, \n     Family and Country, and who fought side by side for \n     freedom, democracy and just causes. But to evoke the name \n     of one is to remind us of the other, and this had a \n     special meaning for me.\n       In 1980, following the Reagan landslide and during the \n     transition, the Chairman-designate of the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee called to ask if I would meet with a recently \n     retired Admiral. As the Chairman put it, ``this is a good ole \n     boy I've known for a long time, he's worked in the Pentagon \n     and he knows how to fly planes on and off aircraft \n     carriers.'' The Senator told me he might be interested in \n     ``some kind of junior staff job at the NSC,'' and would I \n     just talk with him.\n       Bud Nance came aboard the Transition Team steaming at \n     thirty knots, said he liked tough assignments and could \n     execute them well. For starters, I asked him to work with my \n     own long-time friend, Gene Kopp, in ``revamping the Carter \n     National Security Council staff.'' Bud said: ``Oh, I get it, \n     I'm supposed to be just like a vacuum cleaner, just blow `em \n     all out of there?'' And he did just that!\n       Yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who \n     graciously attended the services for Bud and was here \n     tonight, reminded me that Bud had invited her--she was then \n     an assistant to Zbigniew Brzezinski, my predecessor--in for \n     an interview, since he was meeting with all departing staff \n     members, some of whom, incredibly, thought they should be \n     kept on. She recalls saying to him, ``Why are you \n     interviewing me? I don't want to work with you people \n     anyway!!'' As it turned out, she was right!\n       Bud Nance was just the best associate and the hardest \n     working man a fellow could ever have. He insisted on doing \n     heavy lifting, and served his President faithfully and well. \n     On one occasion, in the summer of 1981, the Navy was running \n     an operation into the Gulf of Sidra, near Libyan waters, to \n     establish freedom of navigation there. I was in California \n     with President Reagan. Bud insisted on sleeping the night in \n     the Situation Room, in order to supervise the operation. At \n     about midnight on the West Coast, I got the call from Bud, \n     who in a matter of fact tone said, ``Dick, we sent our \n     carrier in there, and two Libyan fellas came flyin' out at us \n     in Russian Migs. We put up our planes, and now the Libyans \n     ain't flying any more because they locked their radars onto \n     our boys, and their planes got all tore up by our missiles, \n     and those Libyan boys are definitely down in the drink. Now, \n     if I was you, I'd be callin' the President, and I'm goin' \n     home to get some sleep.''\n       If I were to recite the extraordinary career and \n     accomplishments of this very special man, I'd merely repeat \n     what more than twenty Senators of both parties related so \n     eloquently in their speeches under a Special Order on \n     Tuesday--filling fifteen solid pages of the Congressional \n     Record, and what was said so movingly by his granddaughter \n     Catherine and son Andrew at yesterday's services.\n       Leaving the White House in 1982, Bud went to work for \n     Boeing until Senator Helms asked him to come up to the Hill \n     and take charge of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1991. \n     After the Navy, after The White House, after Boeing, he \n     again accepted the call of duty. Everyone knows the basis \n     on which he agreed to go to work again--he declared that \n     he would work for free year, saying that his pension and \n     social security were quite enough, thank you, and \n     ``America has been good to me.'' He was not permitted to \n     do that, and had to accept minimum wage of $2.96 a week, \n     later raised by cost of living increases, he was forced to \n     accept the munificent sum of $4.53 a week.\n       Each of us who knew, respected and loved him will miss him \n     very much.\n       Yesterday, the motorcade that left the Lewinsville \n     Presbyterian Church in McLean enroute to Arlington Cemetery \n     stretched for nearly two miles. The cannon fired their \n     salute, the rifles cracked, the bugler played Taps, the Honor \n     Guard stood by, and Bud's pastor asked us to stand for the \n     flyover.\n       North across the Potomac they came, four magnificent F-18 \n     jets, flying in precise formation; as they roared directly \n     over the assembled mourners, three proceeded straight ahead \n     while one ignited his afterburner, peeled off in a long and \n     beautiful arc, flying straight up into the heavens, \n     symbolizing Bud's career and the passage to his Maker. It was \n     a profound moment, reminiscent of how much Bud liked that \n     little placard that used to rest on President Reagan's desk \n     with the inscription,\n       ``There's no limit to what a man can do or where he can go \n     if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.''\n       Bud never minded at all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6944-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6944-S6945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GREGG:\n       S. 1217.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of \nlegislation that is extremely important to a small town in north \ncentral Montana. Landusky is a small agriculture community just south \nof the Fort Belknap Reservation and just north of the Charles M. \nRussell National Wildlife Refuge. Unfortunately, an oversight which may \nseem small in the eyes of those used to the hustle and bustle of \nWashington D.C. places the Landusky school district in a difficult \nposition.\n  The legislation I am introducing today corrects this oversight by \nconveying the surface and mineral estates of two lots the school has \noccupied for a number of decades. The legislation is strongly supported \nby the town of Landusky and the Bureau of Land Management. It is \nimperative that we move quickly on this legislation. I would like \nnothing more than to have the students of Landusky return to school \nthis fall with the knowledge that the problems facing a small town in \nMontana are worthy of our attention and we were willing to move forward \nand ensure that their school's future is as bright as their \nown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. CON. RES. 39\n\n       Whereas 10 percent of the citizens of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran are members of religious minority groups;\n       Whereas, according to the State Department and \n     internationally recognized human rights organizations, such \n     as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, religious \n     minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran--including Sunni \n     Muslims, Baha'is, Christians, and Jews--have been the victims \n     of human rights violations solely because of their status as \n     religious minorities;\n       Whereas the 55th session of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights passed Resolution 1999/13, which expresses \n     the concern of the international community over ``continued \n     discrimination against religious minorities'' in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran, and calls on that country to moderate its \n     policy on religious minorities until they are ``completely \n     emancipated'';\n       Whereas more than half the Jews in Iran have been forced to \n     flee that country since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 \n     because of religious persecution, and many of them now reside \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the Iranian Jewish community, with a 2,500-year \n     history and currently numbering some 30,000 people, is the \n     oldest Jewish community living in the Diaspora;\n       Whereas five Jews have been executed by the Iranian \n     government in the past five years without having been tried;\n       Whereas there has been a noticeable increase recently in \n     anti-Semitic propaganda in the government-controlled Iranian \n     press;\n       Whereas, on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover 1999, \n     thirteen or more Jews, including community and religious \n     leaders in the city of Shiraz, were arrested by the \n     authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       Whereas, in keeping with its dismal record on providing \n     accused prisoners with due process and fair treatment, the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran failed to charge the detained Jews \n     with any specific crime or allow visitation by relatives of \n     the detained for more than two months: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     Clinton administration should--\n       (1) be commended for supporting Resolution 1999/13, and \n     should continue to work through the United Nations to assure \n     that the Islamic Republic of Iran implements that \n     resolution's recommendations;\n       (2) condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the recent \n     arrest of members of Iran's Jewish minority and urge their \n     immediate release;\n       (3) urge all nations having relations with the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran to condemn the treatment of religious \n     minorities in Iran and call for the release of all prisoners \n     held on the basis of their religious beliefs; and\n       (4) maintain the current United States policy toward the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran unless and until that country \n     moderates its treatment of religious minorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6947-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6947-S6948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION--DESIGNATING DECEMBER 12, 1999, AS ``NATIONAL \n                       CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Byrd, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Craig, Mr. \nSmith of Oregon, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Abraham) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates December 12, 1999, as ``National Children's \n     Memorial Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\n     United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities in remembrance of the many infants, children, \n     teenagers, and young adults of families in the United States \n     who have died.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \nwould set aside December 12, 1999, as the National Children's Memorial \nDay to remember all the children who die in the United States each \nyear. While I realize the families of these children deal with the \ngrief of their loss every day, I would like to commemorate the lives of \nthese children with a special day as well.\n  This will be the second year we will have designated the second \nSunday in December as National Children's Memorial Day. As I stated \nlast year, I have had many constituents share their heart wrenching \nstories with me about the death of their son or daughter. I have heard \nheroic stories of kids battling cancer or diabetes, and tragic stories \nof car accidents and drownings. Each of these families has had their \nown experience, but they must all continue with their lives and deal \nwith the incredible pain of losing a child.\n  The death of a child at any age is a shattering experience for a \nfamily. By establishing a day to remember children that have passed \naway, bereaved families from all over the country will be encouraged \nand supported in the positive resolution of their grief. It is \nimportant to families who have suffered such a loss to know that they \nare not alone. To commemorate the lives of these children with a \nspecial day would pay them an honor and would help to bring comfort to \nthe hearts of their bereaved families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6948-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO \n               UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Brownback) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 119\n\n       Whereas in an Emergency Special Session, the United Nations \n     General Assembly voted on February 9, 1999, to pass \n     Resolution ES-10/6, ``Illegal Israeli Actions In Occupied \n     East Jerusalem And The Rest Of The Occupied Palestinian \n     Territory,'' to convene for the first time in 50 years the \n     parties of the Fourth Geneva Convention for the Protection of \n     Civilians in Time of War;\n       Whereas such resolution unfairly places full blame for the \n     deterioration of the Middle East Peace Process on Israel and \n     dangerously politicizes the Geneva Convention, which was \n     established to deal with critical humanitarian crises; and\n       Whereas such vote is intended to prejudge direct \n     negotiations, put additional and undue pressure on Israel to \n     influence the results of those negotiations, and single out \n     Israel for unprecedented enforcement proceedings which have \n     never been invoked against governments with records of \n     massive violations of the Geneva Convention; Now therefore be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, that the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Department of State for the vote of the \n     United States against United Nations General Assembly \n     Resolution ES-10/6 affirming that the text of such resolution \n     politicizes the Fourth Geneva Convention which was primarily \n     humanitarian in nature;\n       (2) urges the Department of State to continue its efforts \n     against convening the conference; and\n       (3) urges the Swiss government, as the depositary of the \n     Geneva Convention, not to convene a meeting of the Fourth \n     Geneva Convention.\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a \nresolution regarding a deplorable vote by the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations in February 1999. At that time a resolution was passed \nrecommending a convening of the Fourth Geneva Convention. This \nConvention protects civilians living in territory occupied by a hostile \nforce.\n  In February, the Palestine Liberation Organization supported by the \nArab Group and the nonaligned Movement successfully and wrongly argued \nthat the Convention should meet to adopt measures that would stop \nIsrael from building in what they termed the ``Occupied Palestinian \nTerritory including Jerusalem.''\n  Only Israel and, I am proud to say, the United States voted against \nthis United Nations Resolution, which carried by a vote of 115 to 2 \nwith five abstentions. Unfortunately, with such a lopsided vote, we now \nface a situation in which the Swiss Government, as depositary of the \nGeneva Convention, has been asked to convene this conference on July \n15, 1999.\n  This resolution, sponsored by Senators Schumer, Brownback and I, \ncommends our Department of State for its strong opposition to the \nUnited Nations action and, in addition, asks the Swiss Government to \nrefrain from holding this politicized convention. We intend to send a \nclear signal to the United Nations General Assembly about the \ninappropriateness of this resolution and urge our government to \ncontinue to work for the cancellation of the scheduled \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6948-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION--REQUESTING THAT THE PRESIDENT RAISE THE ISSUE OF \n       AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY AT THE JUNE G-8 SUMMIT MEETING\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Fitzgerald) submitted the following; which \nwas considered and agreed to.\n\n                              S. Res. 120\n\n       Whereas biotechnology is an increasingly important tool in \n     helping to meet multiple agricultural challenges of the 21st \n     century;\n       Whereas genetically modified crops are helping to control \n     weeds, insects, and plant diseases to increase crop yields \n     and farm productivity, and to enhance the quality, value, and \n     suitability of crops for food, fiber, and other uses;\n       Whereas agricultural biotechnology promises environmental \n     benefits by reducing, or perhaps eliminating, the need for \n     chemical pesticides, by improving the efficient utilization \n     of fertilizer, thereby protecting water quality, and by \n     conserving topsoil by reducing the need for tillage;\n       Whereas in recent years farmers have rapidly adopted \n     agricultural biotechnology, with worldwide acreage of \n     genetically modified crops growing from 4,300,000 acres in \n     1996, to 69,500,000 acres in 1998, which is more than a 16-\n     fold increase;\n       Whereas American farmers planted biotech crops on about 38 \n     percent of the soybean acreage, 25 percent of the corn \n     acreage, and 45 percent of the cotton acreage, and within a \n     few years over half of the agricultural crops grown in this \n     country may be genetically modified;\n       Whereas increased agricultural productivity attained \n     through greater use of biotechnology, in both developed and \n     developing countries, holds a great deal of potential for \n     meeting the nutritional needs of the world's population, of \n     which at least 800,000,000 currently suffer from hunger or \n     malnutrition;\n       Whereas despite the widespread adoption and extensive \n     global benefits of biotechnology, marked differences among \n     countries in their regulatory approaches are limiting \n     substantially the use of, and trade in, agricultural \n     biotechnology products;\n       Whereas an open international trading system for products \n     derived from plant and animal agricultural biotechnology \n     would make a broad array of improved products more \n     affordable, including agricultural and food products, \n     pharmaceuticals, and consumer products such as apparel, \n     paper, cosmetics, soaps, and detergents;\n       Whereas because of the importance of international trade to \n     the strength of the farm economy and the entire food and \n     agriculture sector, any unwarranted restrictions on trade in \n     biotechnology products could seriously disrupt the farm \n     economy and unjustifiably force farmers to choose between \n     using agricultural biotechnology and exporting their \n     production; and\n       Whereas the threat to agricultural production and trade \n     from restrictions on products derived from modern \n     biotechnology has become serious enough to warrant the \n     attention of world leaders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) as the world trading system moves toward a reduction of \n     tariff and nontariff barriers, all countries should work to \n     ensure that scientifically unfounded new barriers are not \n     erected;\n       (2) the President should raise at the June 1999, G-8 Summit \n     the important issues surrounding the use of, and trade in, \n     agricultural biotechnology ; and\n       (3) as world leaders prepare for a new round of \n     negotiations on agriculture in the World Trade Organization, \n     the G-8 Summit is an appropriate forum to seek a consensus \n     with the major trading partners of the United States \n     regarding--\n       (A) recognition of the global benefits of agricultural \n     biotechnology, especially in meeting the nutritional needs of \n     millions of people in developing countries;\n       (B) increasing consumer knowledge and understanding of \n     agricultural biotechnology and its benefits; and\n       (C) the adoption of rational, scientifically-based systems \n     for the regulation of biotechnology products and for \n     eliminating unjustified barriers to the use of biotechnology \n     products in international trade.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6949-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n   SENATE RESOLUTION--AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care is important to all Americans.\n       (2) Health care is particularly important to individuals \n     with disabilities and special health care needs who often \n     cannot afford the insurance available to them through the \n     private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the \n     private sector, and are at great risk of incurring very high \n     and economically devastating health care costs.\n       (3) Americans with significant disabilities often are \n     unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage \n     of the services and supports that enable them to live \n     independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Personal \n     assistance services (such as attendant services, personal \n     assistance with transportation to and from work, reader \n     services, job coaches, and related assistance) remove many of \n     the barriers between significant disability and work. \n     Coverage for such services, as well as for prescription \n     drugs, durable medical equipment, and basic health care are \n     powerful and proven tools for individuals with significant \n     disabilities to obtain and retain employment.\n       (4) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing \n     health care and related services is one of the greatest \n     barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their \n     employment, earning potential, and independence.\n       (5) Individuals with disabilities who are beneficiaries \n     under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) risk losing medicare or medicaid \n     coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that \n     is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of \n     cash benefits associated with working.\n       (6) Currently, less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of social \n     security disability insurance and supplemental security \n     income beneficiaries cease to receive benefits as a result of \n     employment.\n       (7) Beneficiaries have cited the lack of adequate \n     employment training and placement services as an additional \n     barrier to employment.\n       (8) If an additional \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the current \n     social security disability insurance (DI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) recipients were to cease receiving \n     benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social \n     Security Trust Funds in cash assistance would total \n     $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of the individuals.\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide health care and employment preparation and \n     placement services to individuals with disabilities that will \n     enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on cash \n     benefit programs.\n       (2) To encourage States to adopt the option of allowing \n     individuals with disabilities to purchase medicaid coverage \n     that is necessary to enable such individuals to maintain \n     employment.\n       (3) To provide individuals with disabilities the option of \n     maintaining medicare coverage while working.\n       (4) To establish a return to work ticket program that will \n     allow individuals with disabilities to seek the services \n     necessary to obtain and retain employment and reduce their \n     dependency on cash benefit programs.\n\n         TITLE I--EXPANDED AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention \nto the fact that last week the Senate voted to provide an additional \n$300 million for medical research in the Fiscal Year 2000 Department of \nDefense Appropriations bill. I joined with several of my colleagues in \nurging that critical funding for cancer research be included in the \nbill.\n  Included in this account are $175 million for breast cancer research, \n$75 million for prostate cancer research, and $50 million for other \nmedical research including ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and \nchildhood asthma.\n  In recent years, the DOD's Department for Health Affairs has made \ngreat strides in innovative medical research. The DOD Breast Cancer \nResearch Program is an excellent example of these advancements. During \nits six years in existence, the program has grown from a small isolated \nproject to a well-funded, efficient, and effective part of the cancer \nresearch community.\n  As was recommended by the Institute of Medicine, the program is \noverseen by a group of scientists and patient activists, which helps \nthe program keep up with advancements of the scientific community. This \nstructure has fostered a program praised for its innovation, \nflexibility, and efficiency.\n  Approximately 90 percent of the program's funds are devoted to \nresearch grants. The DOD Breast Cancer Research Program grants have \nencouraged scientific research to extend beyond traditional research. \nSpecifically, Innovative Developmental and Exploratory Awards (IDEA) \ngrants are targeted for innovative research efforts that explore new \napproaches in areas that offer the greatest potential.\n  The program also incorporates consumer and community needs in its \nresearch priorities. By including consumer advocates in decision-making \nand by bringing clinical trials into the community, the program has \nintegrated the goals of advocates, scientists, and patients. This \nunique approach has proven successful both in the research the Program \nhas produced and the future research it has inspired.\n  Similar to the Breast Cancer Research Program, the DOD Prostate \nCancer Research Program is conducted according to the model established \nby the Breast Cancer Program. According to the American Cancer Society, \napproximately 179,300 American men will develop prostate cancer this \nyear, and about 37,000 will die of this disease. Though I am encouraged \nby the news that the survival rate for this type of cancer has \nincreased from 50% to 85%, we clearly can and must do more.\n  Replicating the much-praised Breast Cancer Program mission and \nstructure, prostate research encourages innovation while creating a \npartnership between advocates and scientists. Research grants are \ndesigned to stimulate innovative research and to bolster the national \neffort against prostate cancer.\n  As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I am very familiar with \ncurrent cancer research efforts. The DOD cancer research programs are \nsome of the most innovative and effective public-private partnerships \nthat our country has in the battle against cancer. I am confident that \ncommitment to this program will strengthen our nation's cancer research \nprogram and help to stop the spread of this dread disease.\n  The additional funding in the DOD appropriation bill is compatible \nwith other progressive funding sources that have been explored in \nrecent years. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp, which I sponsored in \nthe Senate, has raised $6.6 million for breast cancer research. Thirty \npercent of these funds go to the DOD program.\n  With the work of research programs across the country, we have made \nsome progress in the war on cancer: new cancer cases and deaths in the \nUnited States fell between 1990 and 1996; survival time has been \nextended dramatically for some cancers; we have improved therapies with \nfewer adverse side effects; and there is increased cancer screening and \ndetection.\n  And yet, sadly, we have a long way to go. Cancer is the second \nleading cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. The \nAmerican Cancer Society estimates that over 1.2 million new cancer \ncases are expected to be diagnosed in 1999 and about one half million \nAmericans are expected to die of cancer this year alone.\n  But we must look at these disturbing statistics as an opportunity. \nWhat these statistics tell us is that we need to multiply, accelerate, \nand intensify our war on cancer. The additional $300 million for \nmedical research in the Department of Defense Appropriations bill sends \na strong signal that we are committed to combating this destructive \ndisease. The Senate should be proud of sending this powerful \nmessage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6966-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF JOHN JERMAIN SLOCUM, JR.\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. \nJohn Jermain Slocum, Jr., who has served at the Preservation Society of \nNewport County in Newport, Rhode Island, and is retiring as President \nand Chairman of the Board.\n  Jerry Slocum's work is well known to me. I have had the pleasure of \nknowing the Slocum family for many years. Rhode Island has benefited \ngreatly from their involvement in the community. In fact, during my \nyears as Governor, Jerry assisted me in a variety of functions. Among \nhis duties in my office, Jerry worked as a drafter of proclamations and \nhandled constituent services. In this capacity, Jerry displayed the \nqualities of a problem solver and a facilitator, which are very \nimportant in the workplace.\n  When Jerry joined the Preservation Society of Newport County in 1990, \nhe brought with him the support and appreciation of historic houses \ninstilled in him by his parents. Since becoming President, the Society \nhas expanded its number of historic structures from 18 to 23--not an \neasy feat! The Society now hosts structures ranging from the Hunter \nHouse, built in 1748, to the Vanderbilt family's Newport summer house, \nthe Breakers, to its newest acquisition, the Isaac Bell House.\n  However, Jerry did not stop there. During his tenure, the educational \nprograms offered by the Society have expanded to include: its annual \nInternational Symposium, the John Winslow Lectures, the Noreen Stonor \nDrexel Lecture Series and the Newport Flower Show. Jerry Slocum \ncertainly is a believer in community involvement. He has worked \ntirelessly to extend the outreach of the Society and its facilities to \nthe community, and in doing so, he has drawn people to Newport from \nacross the country.\n  This hard work and dedication has brought the Society national \nrecognition. In 1998, the National Trust for Historic Preservation \nawarded the Preservation Society with a stewardship award for its \nexceptional contribution to preserving the historic and architectural \nheritage of Newport. Also, various properties of the Preservation \nSociety have been recognized and used in films such as ``The \nBuccaneers,'' ``Mr. North,'' and the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film, \n``True Lies.''\n  As Jerry prepares for his private life away from the duties of his \nterribly demanding job, I want to congratulate and thank him for all \nthat he has given to the Society and the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6966-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6966-S6967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE PROVIDENCE BRUINS\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, for the first time since the \nAmerica's Cup left Newport for Fremantle in 1983, Rhode Island is home \nto a championship trophy. With a 5-1 victory over the Rochester \nAmericans last night, the Providence Bruins won the esteemed Calder Cup \nas the 1999 Champions of the American Hockey League. The P-Bruins have \nwon the hearts of sports fans in Rhode Island since professional hockey \nreturned to the state in 1992 after a 16-year hiatus.\n  But this victory was much deserved for a team that truly turned \nitself around. In winning the Calder Cup, the 1999 Providence Bruins \nbecame one of\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\nonly four teams in AHL history to have gone from last place to first in \none season. Under the able leadership of Coach Peter Laviolette and \nassistant Bill Armstrong, the Providence Bruins amassed a 56-20-4 \nrecord--tops during the regular season--then ran off a perfect 10-0 \nrecord at home in the playoffs. In winning the Calder Cup, this Bruins \nteam can rightly boast that they are among the best in the history of \nthe league.\n  While this championship was very much the team's victory, a special \nacknowledgment belongs to Peter Ferraro, who, as the Providence Bruins' \nleading scorer in the playoffs with nine goals, won the Most Valuable \nPlayer honor for the 1999 series. The Providence Bruins' determination \nand great Championship victory exemplify the dedication of the entire \nteam, and their efforts have been appreciated by the people of Rhode \nIsland, who have flocked to their games throughout the season. All of \nRhode Island takes justifiable pride in the Providence Bruins' victory, \nand we wish them continued success as they strive to repeat as winners \nof the Calder Cup next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6967-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KATE M.

This \nimpressive young woman is well-deserving of the title of Presidential \nScholar. I wish to commend Kate for her outstanding achievement.\n  As a student at Manchester High School West in New Hampshire, Kate \nhas served as a role model for her peers through her commitment to \nexcellence. She will graduate as a co-valedictorian with a 3.9 grade \npoint average. Kate's positive attitude has endeared her to both \nteachers and students.\n  Kate's determination promises to guide her in the future. She will \nattend Harvard University in the fall and will be faced with many new \nchallenges.

DENTON LOTZ\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the commencement speaker at a \nleading university in my state, Campbell University at Buies Creek, \nN.C., was one of the most impressive and meaningful addresses that I \nhave ever heard or read.\n  It was delivered by Dr. Denton Lotz, General Secretary to the Baptist \nWorld Alliance. Dr. Lotz's subject was ``New Hope for Destroyed \nFoundations''.\n  Campbell University is a truly remarkable institution whose \npresident, Dr. Norman Adrian Wiggins, is one of the Nation's most \nrespected educators.\n  Incidentally, in addition to his responsibilities as president, Dr. \nWiggins serves as Professor of Law. I am obliged to add a personal note \nhere: Campbell University's law school is the only law school in North \nCarolina not one of whose graduates has flunked the State Bar Exam for \nthe past several years.\n  But I digress. My purpose today is to ask that the text of Dr. \nDenton's commencement address at Campbell University be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n New Hope for Destroyed Foundations--Campbell University Commencement \n                  Sermon Delivered by Dr. Denton Lotz\n\n``If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?'' Psalm \n                                  11:3\n\n       Bob Dylan reminded his generation and ours that ``the \n     answer is blowing in the wind.'' But is it? Is it not rather \n     like the prophet Hosea of old said that we have sown the wind \n     and reaped the whirlwind? (Hosea 8:7) How many litanies this \n     spring shall we hear of Littleton, Colorado and why and how \n     children could lose all sense of values and go on a killing \n     spree? How many times have we read of parental \n     irresponsibility, the school's fault, youth are not \n     listening, and the litany goes on?\n       What happened in Littleton, Colorado is symbolic of a \n     generation whose foundations have been destroyed. But, this \n     is not only the problem of this generation. It is the history \n     of the 20th century, with the gas warfare of World War I and \n     the gas chambers of World War II. As we enter the 21st \n     century, the President's dream of a new world order has faded \n     and bombs are falling on the Serbian dictator Milosvic, \n     ethnic cleansing continues, children and women suffer. Man \n     experiences the cruelest of deaths. We seem to be able to \n     solve the Y2K computer problem, but deep within humanity \n     there is something that is wrong. The Psalmist spoke of this \n     something as ``destroyed foundations''.\n       Indeed when one considers our society we see a number of \n     destroyed foundations: in the family, in the world, and in \n     the church.\n       (1). The family was long considered the pillar of a just \n     and moral society. Home was the one place you could always \n     go. But, today 60% of new marriages will end in divorce. The \n     result has been a generation of you people without \n     foundations. It is said that 3 in 4 teen suicides are the \n     result of divorce, and 4 in 5 psychiatric admissions. But not \n     only divorce has broken up the family; the community is \n     broken apart. All the blessings of modern society have not \n     brought us together but have divided us. On a warm summer day \n     in Havana, Cuba I saw this. There was no air conditioning, as \n     a result people sat on their porches, children played \n     together in the streets, people talked to one another. Our \n     modern blessings have caused us to close our doors, turn on \n     the air and sit in front of the TV . . . cut off from \n     community, alone and isolated.\n       (2). The same is true for the church. Modern media has made \n     religion an entertainment business. Like Kirkegaard's famous \n     geese, we come to Church on Sunday morning and waddle home \n     and that's the end of it. Theological controversy within and \n     hypocrisy without have diminished the role of the Church. \n     When great tragedies strike, no longer is the pastor the \n     counselor, but immediately TV goes to Hollywood and our \n     favorite guru TV actor tries to console society which, \n     without God and without hope, has pretty much made a mess of \n     things!\n       (3). And the government suffers the same fate. Government \n     in Washington is not trusted. Righteous laws proposed by \n     unrighteous legislators confuse the population. Indeed the \n     strong foundations of the capitol building are now guarded by \n     armed policemen, guard dogs, and metal detecting devices. \n     Everything seems to be falling apart. This spring even the \n     Washington cherry trees were not immune. Unknown and uncaught \n     beavers were chopping down cherry trees every night, until \n     they were finally caught. It is a symbol of our day. The \n     strong trees of justice, of equality, of morality seem to \n     being chopped down. Is there any hope?\n       Well, if it is any comfort, we are not the first generation \n     to experience destroyed foundations. It seems to be the \n     plight of humanity. Indeed it is the human story. It is what \n     history is all about. Destroyed foundations, and rebuilding \n     new foundations that will withstand the next assault. This \n     seems to be the fate of modern man. Rousseau expressed it \n     well in explaining the agitated street life of Paris. He \n     called it the social whirlwind. One of his heroes says:\n       ``I'm beginning to feel the drunkenness that this agitated, \n     tumultuous life plunges you into. With such a multitude of \n     objects passing before my eyes. I'm getting dizzy. Of all the \n     things that strike me, there is none that holds my heart, yet \n     all of them together disturb my feelings, so that I forget \n     what I am and who I belong to.'' (Cox, Religion in the \n     Secular City, p. 182)\n       Does that sound familiar? Isn't that our plight today? The \n     dizziness of it all. The Psalmist knew the problem, as did \n     men and women of old and thus the question, ``If the \n     foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?''\n       I. False answers: The first advice the Psalmist gets is \n     simply to run away: ``Flee like a bird to the mountains; for \n     lo, the wicked bend the bow, they have fitted their arrow to \n     the string, to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.'' A \n     modern interpretation may sound like this: ``Let's escape \n     from it all and have a great weekend and forget all our \n     problems. The trenchcoat mafia may abound and have its sight \n     on us, but we are going to drink and be merry and have a \n     ball.''\n\n[[Page S6968]]\n\n       As you now enter the work force there are going to be many \n     temptations put upon you. You also will be confronted with \n     destroyed foundations and there will be many who give the \n     advice, ``Flee like a bird to the mountains.'' The \n     temptations to flee today are many, but three stand out:\n       1. Materialism: The foundation may be destroyed but I am \n     going to make my mark in life by getting rich. This \n     philosophy escapes the problems of society by fleeing to \n     materialism. It accepts the creed of Milliken and his lot, \n     ``He who has the most toys in the end wins.'' What a folly! \n     What a poor foundation upon which to build one's life. \n     Materialism in the end becomes greedy and consumes the \n     possessors so that all values are lost except one's own big \n     ego. Materialism will not bring back lost love. Materialism \n     will not warm the stomach of a hungry child. Materialism will \n     not bring peace to our troubled cities. Materialism will not \n     bring racial justice. Indeed when the foundations are \n     destroyed the rush towards materialism is only a sign of the \n     foundation that has destroyed us.\n       2. Pleasure and sports: When the foundations are destroyed \n     there is the temptation to run to pleasure and sports to halt \n     the further decay of crumbling foundations. Indeed, Edward \n     Gibbons in his ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' lists \n     this as one of the five basic reasons why great civilizations \n     die: ``The mad craze for pleasure; sports becoming every year \n     more exciting, more brutal and more immoral.'' This indeed is \n     a social commentary on our present situation. Wrestling and \n     boxing without rules is the new big sport. Two combatants \n     actually try to kill one another. We have become mad when our \n     athletes are paid exorbitant salaries and our teachers, \n     police, and servants of society become paupers. What kind of \n     a value is that . . . and so the Psalmist warns of those who \n     say flee like a bird to the pleasure mountain of sports . . . \n     for in the end it means destruction!\n       3. Ghettoism and Quietism: This is the last resort of the \n     religious. We will flee to the mountain and make ourselves a \n     little retreat center to escape from the evils of the world. \n     When religion becomes quietist it truly becomes sectarian and \n     useless to a needy world! Indeed we too have heard the cynics \n     ask what can one do when the foundations are destroyed and we \n     have been tempted to fleet like a bird to the mountain! The \n     tragedy of this type of ghetto religion is that it is so \n     heavenly mined that it is no earthly good. It was the \n     temptations of Jesus' disciples to flee to the mountain and \n     build a retreat center and have warm fuzzy feelings. But, \n     Jesus said, No! Go back down into the valley and where you \n     see my people who are hungry feed them!, where they are \n     naked, clothe them!, where they are thirsty, give them to \n     drink!, where they are sick, visit them! where they are in \n     prison go to them!'' And then you will ``inherit the kingdom \n     prepared for you from the foundation of the world!'' \n     (Matt25ff.)\n       II. What can the righteous do? And so the Psalmist \n     disregards the advice of his friends to flee like a bird to \n     the mountains. And our advice to you is also to beware of \n     those who tell you to flee like a bird. What shall we do \n     then? Not that we are the righteous ones? But, we who would \n     follow a righteous God, what shall we do? How do we answer \n     the question, ``If the foundations are destroyed, what can \n     the righteous do?''\n       1. Take refuge in God? ``The Lord is in his holy temple. . \n     . his eyes behold the children of men . . . '' From days of \n     old until today, men and women of faith have not fled to the \n     mountains, but they have fled to God. The Psalmist knew that: \n     ``God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in time \n     of trouble. Therefore we will not fear though the earth \n     should change, through the mountains shake in the heart of \n     the sea . . . Why? There is a river whose streams make glad \n     the city of God.'' (Psalm 46f)\n       What do you do when the foundations are destroyed! You go \n     the temple! You take refuge in God! God is not dead. He lives \n     and because He lives you can indeed face destroyed \n     foundations but not only that, you can regain strength to \n     rebuild the fallen foundations of your life! And thus the \n     Psalmist very simply advises us, ``Take refuge in God! Go to \n     the temple and pray!''\n       Every student generation seeks a new experience of God. \n     Every student generation feels alienated from their roots and \n     their spiritual heritage and thus is seeking new ways. No \n     wonder there are so many sectarian movements out there . . . \n     all vying for the new age market. But in the end, they are \n     not historical faith, but faith built upon an illusion. \n     Therefore, go to the temple, go to church and pray! I \n     remember students at Harvard were concerned about \n     spirituality in my student days. And so every Thursday noon \n     we gathered in the cafeteria to hear professors witness to \n     their pilgrimage of faith. I particularly remember one \n     professor who had just lost his little girl who accidentally \n     hung herself. The professor warned the students: ``If you do \n     not pray daily, one day you will have to learn how to pray!''\n       Korean Christians pray every morning at 4:30. Their \n     churches are full because during their suffering they \n     experienced the power of prayer! When the foundations are \n     destroyed the first thing one does is go to the temple to \n     pray and there one finds that God is our refuge and strength!\n       2. Cease to do violence! The Psalmist teaches us that God \n     is a judge. His burning love is shown in his fiery justice! \n     God is a God of justice and righteousness who demands the \n     same from his people. He will judge the earth with equity and \n     demands justice. And therefore the Psalmist warns us, ``his \n     soul hates him that loves violence . . . '' (Ps.11:5) The USA \n     has become a very violent society. And the media thinks it \n     has nothing to do with it. Our children, before they are 18, \n     will have seen on television 18,000 acts of violence. Like a \n     drip of water on a stone, drip, drip, drip, it continually \n     wears at the fabric of our society until we are worn down and \n     violence becomes a way of life!\n       The corollary to God hating violence is his demand for \n     justice. No theologian of the 19th century captured this \n     understanding of God as a God of justice more than President \n     Abraham Lincoln. In his Second Inaugural address he painfully \n     warned a country engaged in civil war: ``The Almighty has His \n     own purposes: `Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it \n     must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom \n     the offense cometh!' . . . Fondly do we hope--fervently do we \n     pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. \n     Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth \n     piled upon the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of \n     unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood \n     drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the \n     sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must \n     be said `the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous \n     altogether.' ''\n       What do you do when the foundations are destroyed! Cease to \n     do violence! Remember that God demands justice!\n       3. Do righteous deeds! Finally, the Psalmist considering \n     the alternatives before him is confronted with the final \n     challenge. He cannot flee to the mountains, that is the easy \n     way out. Rather he will go to the temple and take refuge in \n     God, he will cease to do violence . . . and now finally, we \n     hear the final command, ``Do righteous deeds!'' If indeed we \n     have prayed and sought God's counsel and refuge. If indeed we \n     have ceased to do violence, then our lives must show it! This \n     is the command of which the prophet Amos reminded his \n     generation, ``What does the Lord require of thee, but to do \n     justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.'' \n     (Mich. 6:8) Religion that does not issue in a changed \n     behavior, changed heart, and changed action is not worth its \n     salt. Religion which contemplates its own navel and is \n     concerned about its own ego, is not a faith worth living, it \n     is not biblical faith, but a neurotic form of ego-tripism. \n     Biblical faith calls for action, not escapism.\n       This is what we do when the foundations around us are \n     crumbling and destroyed. We do righteous deeds! In a little \n     village in Kenya I remember after one Sunday morning service, \n     the poor old women in a corner collecting what coins they had \n     to help feed a refugee from Somalia. In Bangladesh, some \n     struggling to make it from day to day, the women collect the \n     least coin to help others. In India, every day Baptist women \n     save a little of their monthly allotment of rice to help \n     those in need. Indeed these random acts of kindness are \n     fulfilling the Biblical command to be holy as god is holy.\n       III. What do the righteous do when the foundations are \n     destroyed? Isn't there a missing link? Indeed we understand \n     that we must go to the temple, that God is our refuge, that \n     we must cease to do violence and beware of God's justice, but \n     how can we do righteous deeds? How can we flee to God? What \n     is missing? The foundation upon which all of these actions \n     are executed! The Apostle Paul stated very clearly that there \n     needs to be a foundation for our action and therefore he \n     boldly announces: ``For no other foundation can any one lay \n     than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ.'' (ICor.3:11) \n     Paul knows the temptation to flee like a bird to the \n     mountain. He knows the temptations of materialism, pleasure \n     and escapism. He knew this as a Pharisee until one day all of \n     his foundations were destroyed, existentially, spiritually \n     and physically. When he met Christ on the Damascus road his \n     whole life was turned around. He was a changed person with a \n     new foundation. He knew now that the city he was looking for \n     was not the secular city with all its dizzy attractions but \n     without foundations. He was now looking for that city which \n     has foundations whose builder and maker is God (Heb.11:10)\n       As a soon to be graduate you will have learned many facts. \n     You will know many things. But, this does not make you wise! \n     Wisdom is knowing the foundation which undergirds all of \n     knowledge! Western civilization was built upon faith: faith \n     in the incarnation of God in His Son Jesus Christ. All of the \n     great achievements of the human spirit came from the freedom \n     of the Spirit through Christian intellect. The idea of the \n     university was that all knowledge was of God and therefore \n     the Universe should be studied because it was the handiwork \n     of God. All of Western civilization, great concern for the \n     arts, for freedom, for justice, for feeding the poor and \n     hungry, from where did these freedoms come? Are they not \n     rooted in the Bible? Is Christ not the source of freedom and \n     justice? Modernism since the Enlightenment thinks that it can \n     understand humankind without God, And precisely because it \n     has attempted to explain the world without God, it has become \n     a godless world with no hope and no future. H. Richard \n     Niebuhr commented upon this when he said that such faith was \n     weak because ``It preached that a God without wrath brought \n     men without sin, into a kingdom with judgment through the \n     ministrations of a Christ without a Cross.'' And so it is \n     today. Western civilization\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\n     wants all the blessings of Christianity without Christ. And \n     like fruit cut from the stem it will rot.\n       What do you do when the foundations are destroyed? You \n     build upon the foundation which will endure. And that is why \n     for two thousand years the Church has pointed not to itself \n     but to Jesus Christ!\n       And thus we close with the Psalmist question, ``If the \n     foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?'' Go to \n     the temple and pray to God as your refuge! Cease to do \n     violence! Do righteous deeds! Put your faith in the only \n     foundation for life, even Jesus Christ our Lord! \n     Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6969-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BUSINESS COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE TO KOSOVAR REFUGEES\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend members \nof the American and international business communities who are \nproviding resources and technical expertise to help the United Nations \nand other international relief organizations alleviate the suffering of \nhundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees.\n  Today, as we embark on the initial stages of a peace agreement, \nhundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees remain scattered across the \nglobe. Slobodan Milosevic and his troops have driven these victims out \nof their country, separated families, destroyed homes, and stripped the \nrefugees of their personal identification papers. The United Nations \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that over 800,000 people \nhave been forced to flee Kosovo since the Serb Army intensified ethnic \npurges two and a half months ago.\n  Refugee situations are always difficult. The Kosovar situation, \nhowever, has been exacerbated and complicated greatly by Milosevic's \nattempts at ``identity erasure.'' Servian soldiers have stripped the \nKosovars of all identification documents and systematically destroyed \ncivil records. Adding to the complexity of the situation, the refugees \nare spread over 30 different countries.\n  Companies such as Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Microsoft, Securit World, \nEricsson, and ScreenCheck are partnering with the Red Cross, UNHCR, the \nInternational Organisation for Migration and other international \norganizations on projects that will register the refugees, provide them \nwith identification documents, and reunite them with their families. \nThese companies are providing technical expertise, equipment, personnel \nand other resources that are allowing the refugees to be registered and \nlocated much more efficiently and effectively than ever before.\n  We are certainly witnessing a situation where the Internet and other \nrecent technological innovations are providing solutions for real life \nproblems. For example, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Securit \nhave developed and provided systems that allow refugees to be \nregistered, added to an international database, and to obtain \nidentification cards--all within minutes. Further, the Red Cross is \nworking with Compaq and Ericsson to launch the Family News Network, \nwhich is the first Internet-based refugee tracing system.\n  These companies are to be commended for their contributions to help \nrestore the Kosovar community. It is my hope that in the future more \nmembers of the business community will enter into such beneficial \npartnerships to help address problems facing our country and our \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6969-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BEDFORD MEMORIAL SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to \nhonor the Bedford Memorial School for being selected as the 1999 Top \nElementary School of the Year by the Excellence in Education Committee. \nThe ``Excellence in Education'' award is an annual program designed to \nidentify one elementary, middle, and secondary school that is \nrepresentative of the many outstanding schools in New Hampshire.\n  The Bedford Memorial School was chosen for this honor because of the \ndedication and commitment to education by its teachers, parents, and \nstudents. Its exemplary partnership with home and community and \noutstanding mentoring program for all staff has created an environment \nconductive to the development of young minds.\n  I admire this school's commitment to excellence. Over the last five \nyears they have taken on challenging initiatives, participated in goals \nsetting, created a community school council, and forged school-business \npartnerships. Student focus is also one of Bedford Memorial's \nstrengths. The many co-curricular programs, an excellent special \neducation department, and a gifted program are able to serve the \nstudents' individual needs. The school's success is epitomized in the \nschool's motto ``The partnership of home, school, and community is \nessential to achieve our goal of academic excellence.''\n  The teahers, parents, and students of this school hold a special \nplace in my heart. Over the years, Mary Jo and I have visited the \nBedford Memorial School many times, had the chance to meet both \nstudents and faculty, and have had the honor of teaching several \nclasses there. This close involvement with the school has allowed me to \nwitness, first-hand, the quality of education that is provided at this \nschool.\n  The honor of being named Top Elementary School of the Year is a \nfitting end to an era for Bedford Memorial School. I am confident that \nas they take on additional grades and students, their school spirit \nwill only continue to grow.\n  As a former teacher and school board member, I understand the \ntremendous impact teachers have on a child's life. The Bedford Memorial \nSchool is a testament to the tradition of molding students into \nsuccessful adults. I wish to offer my most sincere congratulations and \nbest wishes to the Bedford Memorial School. The school's achievements \nare truly remarkable. I feel honored to have had such a close \nrelationship with the Bedford Memorial School and represent them in the \nUnited States Senate. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6969-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I am introducing legislation on behalf \nof myself, Senators Kyl, DeWine, Hagel, and Kohl, a bill referred to as \nthe Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999.\n  I do this in my capacity not only as a Senator from Iowa but as \nchairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus of the Senate--a \ncaucus that has had a tradition of working in a very bipartisan way on \nlegislation and oversight hearings.\n  Methamphetamine is emerging as a new major drug problem across the \nentire country. It is one of the most dangerous drugs currently \navailable. Its use destroys individuals and its production harms the \nenvironment. It is a problem that disproportionately affects rural \nAmerica, even in our most urban States.\n  Methamphetamine is not a new drug in this country, but its growing \nuse is very much a new problem. As the chart shows, meth has been \naround our country since the early 1980s, but its use then was largely \nconfined to biker gangs and with a very limited market. Even then, much \nof the meth was produced in homemade labs in this country. Very little \nof it came out of Mexico and not so much in rural America.\n  The chart shows the city of Philadelphia with lots of examples of use \nof meth and meth laboratories. The numbers were few then and medical \ncases of meth-related problems were limited.\n  In San Francisco, for example, there were only 65 medical cases of \nmeth-related problems, even in the year 1984. Let me assure Members \nthat very low level activity situation for methamphetamine was not \ngoing to last very long because it began to change in the late 1980s \nand early 1990s.\n  During that period of time, Mexican criminal gangs began to become \nmore\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\ninvolved, taking over production and marketing from the biker gangs in \nAmerica. In doing so, they began to rapidly expand the availability of \ndrugs and at the same time lowering the costs. Use began to grow, as it \nwill, when drugs became widely available at affordable prices. It will \nalso grow if there is a perception of low risk with that drug.\n  Somehow--and wrongly so--meth got a reputation for being harmless. It \nis simple. Most new drugs start that way. They are pushed on \nparticularly young people as safe and OK. Of course, it is a lie. But \nit is common enough. Thus, it should come as no surprise that as meth \nuse increased and spread beyond the Western States, along with this, so \ndid reports of meth-related medical problems.\n  In 1989, medical cases in San Francisco reached 1,125, or 17 times \nthe 1984 level of 65 which I already mentioned. The number of lab \nseizures increased, as well.\n  Remember, on this chart, the previous chart, and the next chart I \nwill show, the red lines show an expanding importation of \nmethamphetamine into our country with some from outside of Mexico, but \nmost of the lines coming from Mexico and spreading all across our \ncountry--it is now beginning to reach the West and the Midwest--not so \nmuch in the East where it was when it started with biker gangs, but all \nover the United States.\n  While most of the drug is produced in Mexico by Mexican criminal \ngangs, there is a growing domestic production, much of this in rural \nareas. It is devastating.\n  Looking again at the chart previously shown, from 1982 to 1985, we \nhad very little meth coming from Mexico into the United States. Most of \nwhat we had was domestic production. The numbers here in green \nillustrate the dimension of medical-related meth problems that are \nreported in the media. It also relates, to some extent, to the lab \nbusts in that particular case. But from 1982 to 1985, it was very much \nlimited to biker gangs being involved in that, very little out of \nMexico.\n\n  Then you go to the period of the late 1980s, early 1990s. You see \nmore red lines, meaning quantity and diverse distribution coming out of \nMexico, some from Korea, probably some from other countries we will not \nshow on this particular map but still, relatively little. Then after \n1994, you see a very dramatic acceptance of meth use, but also most of \nit coming from Mexico and most of it from that source just finding \nitself spread all across the United States, so very much a growing \nproblem, very much a problem of Mexican sources and cartels being the \nsource of our problem in this country.\n  In 1998 we had 321 methamphetamine labs found in my State of Iowa. \nThis was more than double the year before. As of the first quarter this \nyear, over 170 labs have been found in my State. If you multiply that \nby 4, you are going to see Iowa doubling the trouble of meth again in \nlocal production. That is what we know about. It does not account for \nthe flow of meth from Mexico.\n  I know many other States in the West and the Midwest can tell a very \nsimilar story. We know this is a problem that is moving eastward. We \nare becoming a producing country for this dangerous drug. You can get \nthe formula for producing meth off the Internet, and many of the \nchemicals to produce it can be found in local hardware stores and \npharmacies. One of the common chemicals used in production is \nincreasingly being stolen from farms.\n  The problem of production and use is growing worse. As it does so, it \nleaves in its wake broken homes and ruined lives. It is known on the \nstreet as crank, ice, speed, or meth. However it is named, the drug \nhooks users from all socioeconomic backgrounds. What is worse, medical \nexperts and law enforcement officials point to younger and younger \nusers. This is one of the most dangerous drugs we have ever seen. It is \nhighly addictive, and it is a brain toxin. It attacks important \nfunctions of the brain, and, over time, prolonged use poisons these \nfunctions, in some cases permanently. The word on the street is that \nmeth is a safe drug, but in fact it is a very vicious drug.\n  The physiological side effects of meth include brain damage, heart \nattacks, and seizures. It can cause insomnia and lead to paranoia as \nwell as violent, erratic behavior. It has made routine police \nencounters with motorists more dangerous, and it has made investigating \nlab sites a risky undertaking. This highly dangerous, addictive \nstimulant disrupts homes, schools, workplaces, hospital emergency \nrooms, and even our courts. Worse yet, the production creates toxic \nwaste dumps that endanger the environment and public safety.\n  Much of this problem disproportionately affects rural communities. \nEven in our most urban States, the threat is just overwhelming to local \nresources that have to bear the brunt of fighting the methamphetamine \nproblem, because few small communities such as we have in rural America \ncan cope with the explosion of users, pushers, and labs.\n  So those of us introducing this legislation--as I said, Senators Kyl, \nDeWine, Hagel, and Kohl, and I--are then introducing this Rural \nMethamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999 today because we cannot turn a \nblind eye to this threat anymore. Passage of this legislation will move \nus forward in our efforts to protect our children and our future from \nthe ravages of meth.\n\n  There are several key areas where this legislation will improve our \nability to respond to the threat.\n  First, we need to get a handle on what the problem is. This \nlegislation requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nreport to Congress on how drug use, and particularly methamphetamine \nuse, is different in rural versus urban settings. Today we can break \ndrug use down into patterns by sex, by age, region of the country, \neducation, and the type of drug use. We have some idea when kids--and \nthey are kids--first try drugs. I believe there is a more serious \nproblem in rural America today than there has ever been. Meth \nproduction and use disproportionately affect rural areas, even in large \nurban States such as California.\n  Meth is often called the poor man's cocaine, because it is most \nwidely used in blue-collar communities, rural areas, and small to mid-\nsized cities. Yet our resources and focus tend to go to large urban \nareas, because that is where we can more easily document the problem.\n  After getting a better handle on the problem with better statistics \non a national basis from our Secretary of HHS, we, second, suggest the \nAttorney General, through this legislation, provide the Congress with \nan annual strategy on how to deal with the problem systematically and \ncoherently. This will establish a benchmark to guide future research \nand action. As part of this problem, this strategy is meant as a \nmechanism for tracking both use and the proliferation of meth labs. We \ndo establish, then, this mechanism to do it. This will require the \nadministration to relate resources to action. We do not see that \nconnection today in a coherent way.\n  In addition, the legislation will support the creation of rapid \nresponse teams at the Federal level to provide language and \nintelligence-collection expertise to communities that must deal with \nforeign-based meth gangs.\n  Next, the legislation will increase resources to provide training in \nmeth lab cleanup as well as increased funding to the Drug Enforcement \nAgency so it can improve assistance for lab cleanup and disposal. That \nis not something a lot of States are waiting for the Federal Government \nto do, but it is being done on an ad hoc basis, State by State. In my \nparticular case, the State of Iowa has set up two teams with the \nresources to help in this cleanup, because it is such a dangerous \nenvironment.\n  One of the problems with meth is we have this proliferation of home \nmeth labs, large and small. They are toxic waste dumps filled with \ndangerous chemicals. Handling these labs requires special training and \nequipment. My legislation will create a number of regional training \ncenters to help struggling communities deal with the explosion in meth \nproduction.\n  The legislation would enhance the ability to provide training to \nlocal police and sheriffs to meet this challenge.\n  Finally, this legislation will increase penalties for trafficking \nanhydrous ammonia, one of the major components in one method of \nproducing meth, across State lines and would provide assistance for \nresearch methods for making\n\n[[Page S6971]]\n\nanhydrous ammonia useless in meth production.\n  The intent of this legislation is to address a problem that is \ngrowing and spreading across the country, one that disproportionately \naffects small and mid-sized cities and rural areas.\n  I urge my colleagues in this body to join in supporting the \nMethamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999 and respond now to this \nchallenge before it grows worse and before it spreads any further if, \nin fact, it can spread much further.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6971-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Reserving the right to object, let me say the whole \nidea, obviously, behind this amendment or any other amendments would be \nsimply to address what I think we all recognize is an important issue--\nthe Social Security lockbox. The only reason Democrats have been voting \nagainst cloture is simply because we have been ``locked out'' of our \nopportunity to offer amendments, such as an amendment which would \nprovide for the Medicare lockbox as well as Social Security.\n  I am disappointed in our inability to lay an amendment down tonight. \nI think we can accommodate our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nWe would agree to a limited number of amendments.

It is a fitting and appropriate \ntribute to have this legislation honoring Dr. King pass the full Senate \non Flag Day which is being commemorated today.\n  This legislation will amend the Flag Code to add the Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. holiday to the list of days on which the American flag should \nbe displayed nationwide.\n  It is a testament to the greatness of Martin Luther King, Jr., that \nnearly every major city in the U.S. has a street or school named after \nhim. Dr. King, a minister, prolific writer and Nobel Prize winner \noriginated the nonviolence strategy within the activist civil rights \nmovement. He was one of the most important black leaders of his era and \nin American history.\n  When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968, he had \nalready transformed himself as a national hero and a pioneer in trying \nto unite a divided nation. He strove to build communities of hope and \nopportunity for all and recognized that all Americans must be free to \ntruly have a great country.\n  Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless \nof their race, color or creed. His holiday came about due to the work \nof many determined people who wanted all of us to\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\npause to remember his legacy.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 120) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n       Whereas biotechnology is an increasingly important tool in \n     helping to meet multiple agricultural challenges of the 21st \n     century;\n       Whereas genetically modified crops are helping to control \n     weeds, insects, and plant diseases to increase crop yields \n     and farm productivity, and to enhance the quality, value, and \n     suitability of crops for food, fiber, and other uses;\n       Whereas agricultural biotechnology promises environmental \n     benefits by reducing, or perhaps eliminating, the need for \n     chemical pesticides, by improving the efficient utilization \n     of fertilizer, thereby protecting water quality, and by \n     conserving topsoil by reducing the need for tillage;\n       Whereas in recent years farmers have rapidly adopted \n     agricultural biotechnology, with worldwide acreage of \n     genetically modified crops growing from 4,300,000 acres in \n     1996, to 69,500,000 acres in 1998, which is more than a 16-\n     fold increase;\n       Whereas American farmers planted biotech crops on about 38 \n     percent of the soybean acreage, 25 percent of the corn \n     acreage, and 45 percent of the cotton acreage, and within a \n     few years over half of the agricultural crops grown in this \n     country may be genetically modified;\n       Whereas increased agricultural productivity attained \n     through greater use of biotechnology, in both developed and \n     developing countries, holds a great deal of potential for \n     meeting the nutritional needs of the world's population, of \n     which at least 800,000,000 currently suffer from hunger or \n     malnutrition;\n       Whereas despite the widespread adoption and extensive \n     global benefits of biotechnology, marked differences among \n     countries in their regulatory approaches are limiting \n     substantially the use of, and trade in, agricultural \n     biotechnology products;\n       Whereas an open international trading system for products \n     derived from plant and animal agricultural biotechnology \n     would make a broad array of improved products more \n     affordable, including agricultural and food products, \n     pharmaceuticals, and consumer products such as apparel, \n     paper, cosmetics, soaps, and detergents;\n       Whereas because of the importance of international trade to \n     the strength of the farm economy and the entire food and \n     agriculture sector, any unwarranted restrictions on trade in \n     biotechnology products could seriously disrupt the farm \n     economy and unjustifiably force farmers to choose between \n     using agricultural biotechnology and exporting their \n     production; and\n       Whereas the threat to agricultural production and trade \n     from restrictions on products derived from modern \n     biotechnology has become serious enough to warrant the \n     attention of world leaders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) as the world trading system moves toward a reduction of \n     tariff and nontariff barriers, all countries should work to \n     ensure that scientifically unfounded new barriers are not \n     erected;\n       (2) the President should raise at the June 1999, G-8 Summit \n     the important issues surrounding the use of, and trade in, \n     agricultural biotechnology ; and\n       (3) as world leaders prepare for a new round of \n     negotiations on agriculture in the World Trade Organization, \n     the G-8 Summit is an appropriate forum to seek a consensus \n     with the major trading partners of the United States \n     regarding--\n       (A) recognition of the global benefits of agricultural \n     biotechnology, especially in meeting the nutritional needs of \n     millions of people in developing countries;\n       (B) increasing consumer knowledge and understanding of \n     agricultural biotechnology and its benefits; and\n       (C) the adoption of rational, scientifically-based systems \n     for the regulation of biotechnology products and for \n     eliminating unjustified barriers to the use of biotechnology \n     products in international trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/14/senate-section/article/S6972-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AUTHORIZATION OF TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
