Mr. President, today we had this time reserved to \ndiscuss an amendment that I was planning to offer dealing with the \nlifting of economic sanctions on India and Pakistan. I did so in the \nbelief, actually in the hope, that the bilateral relationship between \nIndia and Pakistan had improved in the wake of the Lahore summit. The \nsummit seemed to imply that.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.\n\n  According to Indian news agencies Indian helicopter gun ships, backed \nby MiG-17 fighter aircraft from India's air force bombed the troubled \nstate of Kashmir, marking the most serious escalation of tensions on \nthe Indo-Pakistani border in the last several years. As a result, I \nhave reconsidered the wisdom of offering my amendment on India and \nPakistan at this time.\n  It is important that I note here today that I strongly believe in the \nlong term importance of easing economic sanctions on both of these \nnations. I also believe that the United States ignores at its peril \nthese two vital countries. That reality is highlighted all the more by \nyesterday's release of the Cox report on China which, if nothing else, \nhas clearly shown that China is a serious threat in South Asia--not to \nspeak of a threat to our fundamental values around the world--and that \nwe need to broaden our relationship with India in the South Asian \nsubcontinent.\n  I hope to revisit this issue in the near future. Let me emphasize \nthat I will not feel comfortable doing so until there is a serious de-\nescalation of tension on the subcontinent.\n  I just wanted to point this out and to enter into the Record an \nAssociated\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\nPress story about India launching airstrikes into Kashmir against \ninfiltrators. I think we have a lot to learn yet about what \nspecifically took place. Those details are sketchy and not coming in at \nthe present time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       India Launches Air Strikes in Kashmir Against Infiltrators\n\n                            (By Arthur Max)\n\n       Dras, India (AP).--Indian air force jets and helicopters \n     fired on suspected guerrillas in the disputed Kashmir \n     province today, marking the most serious escalation of \n     fighting in the region since India and Pakistan tested \n     nuclear weapons last year. Pakistan charged that Indian \n     aircraft bombed its territory in the raids today and an army \n     spokesman said the country is ready for ``all \n     eventualities.''\n       ``We think it is a very grave escalation and Pakistan armed \n     forces reserves the right to respond,'' said Brigadier Rashid \n     Quereshi, a military spokesman told The Associated Press. \n     India said the attacks occurred solely on its own territory \n     and that they were aimed at what it called Afghan mercenaries \n     supported by Pakistani forces. The forces had moved into the \n     Indian-controlled Himalayan region earlier this month and \n     posed a threat to Indian supply lines in the Himalayan state, \n     Indian officials said.\n       ``This is the start of operations and they will continue \n     until our defense forces reoccupy our territories. Any \n     escalation of this conflict will be entirely the \n     responsibility of Pakistan,'' the Defense Ministry said in a \n     statement in New Delhi.\n       Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said that Pakistan \n     knew nothing about the infiltrators. ``No one knows where \n     they come from and who they are,'' he said.\n       Quereshi said the army rejected Indian claims. He said the \n     Pakistan army suspects India wants to occupy Pakistan \n     territory in that area.\n       India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over \n     Kashmir, which is divided between them by a U.N.-monitored \n     cease-fire line. More than 15,000 people have been killed in \n     fighting between rebels and security forces in Indian-held \n     Kashmir in the last 10 years.\n       Pakistan and India, which were partitioned when they gained \n     independence from Britain in 1947, tested nuclear weapons in \n     May 1998, prompting fears of a nuclear arms race in the \n     subcontinent. Both countries claim all of Kashmir. India \n     accuses Pakistan of sending militants across the border.\n       A Pakistani army spokesman said the Indian allegations that \n     elite troops were aiding militants was ``complete rubbish.''\n       Indian Maj. Gen Joginder Jaswant Singh told reporters in \n     New Delhi that the infiltrators have taken up positions four \n     miles inside India in the Dras, Batalik, Kaksar and Mashkok \n     mountains of northern Kashmir.\n       Intelligence reports, backed by photos taken by Indian \n     satellites, showed at least 600 infiltrators, Singh said. The \n     reports also said they have anti-aircraft missiles, radar, \n     snowmobiles and sophisticated communications equipment.\n       The air force joined the operation because the infiltrators \n     had occupied positions at altitudes of up to 16,000 feet, \n     said Air Commodore Subash Bhojwani, director of offensive \n     operations.\n       In Dras, 100 miles from the state capital of Srinagar, \n     Indian army officers said the target of today's attack was \n     some 70 infiltrators who had entrenched themselves on the \n     slopes of the snowcapped hills, looking down at Indian army \n     convoys, 2,700 feet below.\n       Their command of the heights handicapped Indian soldiers \n     trying to evict them, officers told The Associated Press.\n       Army officers in the area said the infiltrators must have \n     taken months to occupy the posts. They said Indian forces \n     could take three to six months to clear them.\n       The attacks were carried out within Indian-occupied \n     regions, Indian Brig. Mohan Bhandari said. Troops were \n     expected to take over the intruders' positions once they \n     retreat, officials said.\n       The exchange of mortar and heavy artillery fire in the \n     Kargil and Dras regions has left at least 160 people dead, \n     Bhandari said. Thousands of residents of the region have fled \n     to safe villages along the Suru River.\n       The attack came a day after Prime Minister Atal Bihari \n     Vajpayee said all steps including airstrikes would be taken \n     to push back the infiltrators. Vajpayee said he warned his \n     Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, to withdraw the \n     intruders in a telephone conversation Monday.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to simply note again that we \nheld a hearing yesterday on what is taking place in India and on \nmilitary and political issues. The United States needs to broaden its \nrelationship with India. We have a broad-based relationship with China \nwhich has been strained and stressed. China is an authoritarian \ncountry. India is a democracy. There are a number of places that we are \nsanctioning India where we don't sanction China at all. Yet these are \ncomparable-sized countries. One has a democratic tradition, the other \nan authoritarian. There are a number of problems in China that we \naren't experiencing with India.\n  We need to broaden this relationship with India and with Pakistan. It \nis just that at the present time, given what has just taken place in \nthe escalating of tension in this subcontinent by Indian military \nforces, I don't feel comfortable offering this amendment.\n  I look forward to working in good faith with all of my colleagues to \naddress the United States-South Asian relationship. I note to Members \nof the Senate that we will be holding hearings in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to look further into what we need to do in building this \nstronger relationship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 10 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator may proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S5980-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5980-S5981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR FORCED LABOR IN AN AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to call your attention to a \nscandal in an American commonwealth. It is a scandal that involves \nforced labor and sex trade workers. It's not a pretty picture. It is a \npicture of a tropical paradise destroyed by greed and corruption.\n  In the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, foreign workers \nhave been imported in mass to assemble goods for export to the United \nStates. Taking advantage of loopholes in our immigration and labor \nlaws, foreign businessmen use the Mariana Islands as a base to export \ngarments to the United States. These foreign businessmen pay no export \ntaxes, and their goods are not subject to textile quotas. Their workers \nare paid below minimum wage levels, if paid at all, and often live in \ndeplorable conditions.\n  Women from Asia and Russia are imported with the promise of high \npaying jobs in the United States only to find themselves marooned with \nno means of escape, forced to work as prostitutes in the booming \nMariana sex trade.\n  This long-running scandal has been exposed once again by the Global \nSurvival Network. This American-based nongovernmental organization \nwhich uncovers human rights violations sent an undercover team to the \nCNMI to gather evidence on the continued use of forced labor in the \ncommonwealth. They have just issued their report which was the subject \nof an ABC News segment on ``20/20.'' If you did not see the television \nbroadcast, please read the report which I am sending to every Senator.\n  Entitled ``Trapped: Human Trafficking for Forced Labor in The \nCommonwealth of The Northern Mariana Islands (a U.S. Territory),'' the \nreport demonstrates in disturbing detail the continued trafficking of \nhumans for indentured labor in factories and sex trade emporiums in the \nMarianas. Implicating organized crime groups from the People's Republic \nof China, South Asia, and Japan, the report estimates that there are \nabout 40,000 indentured workers in the CNMI, earning about $160 million \nin profits for criminal syndicates.\n  Indentured workers are being used to manufacture ostensibly as ``Made \nin the USA'' garments for export to the United States. None of these \ngoods are required to be shipped to the U.S. on U.S.-flag ships in \naccordance with the Jones Act. This duty-free, quota-free zone in which \nforeign workers produce high value goods at below minimum wage is an \nentirely legal scheme for Chinese and other foreign manufacturers to \nbypass American textile quotas.\n  The report also graphically details the increasing use of CNMI's \nloose immigration standards to make this former tropical paradise a \nmajor center for the booming Asian sex trade. Women from Asia and \nRussia are being lured to the Northern Marianas with promises of work \nopportunities in the United States only to find themselves imprisoned \non islands from which there is no escape unless they agree to their \nemployer's demands that they become prostitutes and sex hostesses. This \nsick trade in prostitution must be stopped.\n  Loopholes in the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938 need to be\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nplugged as soon as possible. I hope you will join me in ending this \ndeplorable situation in which men and women are being used virtually as \nslaves on an American commonwealth.\n  Their report makes many important recommendations. Let me call your \nattention to four key issues which the Congress could and should act \nupon this year:\n  Extend the Immigration and Nationality Act to the CNMI;\n  Extend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to the CNMI;\n  Revoke the CNMI's ability to use the ``Made in the USA label'' unless \nmore than 75 percent of the labor that goes into the manufacture of the \ngarment comes from U.S. citizens and/or aliens lawfully admitted to the \nU.S. for permanent residence, and other appropriately legal \nindividuals; and\n  Revoke the CNMI's ability to transport textile goods to the United \nStates free of duties and quotas unless the garments meet the above \ncriteria.\n  This week's report prepared by the Global Survival Network is not the \nfirst analysis raising concerns about conditions in the CNMI. In recent \nyears, a chorus of criticism has surfaced about the Commonwealth.\n  For example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that \nthe CNMI has no reliable records of aliens who have entered the \nCommonwealth, how long they remain, and when, if ever, they depart. A \nCNMI official testified that they have ``no effective control'' over \nimmigration in their island.\n  The bipartisan Commission on Immigration studied immigration and \nindentured labor in the CNMI. The Commission called it ``antithetical \nto American values,'' and announced that no democratic society has an \nimmigration policy like the CNMI. ``The closest equivalent is Kuwait,'' \nthe Commission found.\n  The Department of Commerce found that the territory has become ``a \nChinese province'' for garment production.\n  The CNMI garment industry employs 15,000 Chinese workers, some of \nwhom sign contracts that forbid participation in religious or political \nactivities while on U.S. soil. China is exporting its workers, and its \nhuman rights policies, to the CNMI. Charges of espionage by China and \nsecurity lapses in U.S. nuclear weapons labs have justifiably raised \nserious concerns in Congress. Every Member of Congress should be \nequally concerned with the imposition of Chinese human rights standards \non American soil.\n  The CNMI is becoming an international embarrassment to the United \nStates. We have received complaints from the Philippines, Nepal, Sri \nLanka, and Bangladesh about immigration abuses and the treatment of \nworkers.\n  Despite efforts by the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations to \npersuade the CNMI to correct these problems, the situation has only \ndeteriorated.\n  After years of waiting for the CNMI to achieve reform, the time for \npatience has ended. Conditions in the CNMI are a looming political \nembarrassment to our country.\n  I urge the Senate to respond by enacting S. 1052, bipartisan reform \nlegislation introduced by my colleagues on the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, Chairman Murkowski and Senator Bingaman.\n  I urge the Senate to move on this measure as quickly as we can.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 1124 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what a difference a year makes. One year \nago last week, the United States Government filed a Sherman Antitrust \nlawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation. This anniversary is a good \ntime to review that lawsuit and to see how radically the universe of \ncompetition has changed in just twelve months.\n  I am not at all unbiased. I believe that the Government was dead \nwrong in bringing this lawsuit. I believe that the lawsuit is bad for \nconsumers, bad for technological innovation, and bad for a marvelous \ncompany that is headquartered in my State.\n  But even an independent analysis would conclude that the case that \nthe Clinton administration brought twelve months ago bears little \nresemblance to the case it now argues. Since then the Government's case \nhasn't been tried in the courthouse as much as on the courthouse steps, \nbypassing the law and aimed directly at public opinion through a \nnational media that delights in highlighting any Microsoft misstep even \nthough it has no relation to any harm to consumers.\n  The administration pursues this case for ideological reasons. This \nadministration is filled with people who are offended by anyone or any \ncompany that is too successful. They believe that it is fundamentally \nunfair that Microsoft does so well. Much of the national media seems to \nshare this view.\n  The administration has, however, miscalculated the views of a \nmajority of Americans. Despite the Government's attempts to turn the \npublic against Microsoft, it continues to be one of the most respected \ncompanies in America, and a majority of Americans believe Microsoft is \nright and the Government is wrong in this current lawsuit.\n  In a recent poll conducted by Citizens for a Sound Economy, 82% of \nthose polled responded that Microsoft is good for American consumers. \nThis survey also found that seven-out-of-ten American consumers feel \nthat technology companies, not the Federal Government, should determine \nwhat features and applications are included in the software that \nconsumers use with their computers.\n  Most Americans understand the value that Microsoft has brought. \nMicrosoft products make nearly every business in America more \ncompetitive. The technology revolution fueled by Microsoft has made \nAmericans secure in their jobs and made more families secure in their \nfuture.\n  Microsoft has also helped usher in the most important change \noccurring on earth: today the power of information has been taken from \na few large centralized institutions and put directly into the hands of \npeople in every town and village across our globe via the Internet.\n  The explosive growth of the Internet will eventually have a \nfundamental impact on every aspect of American life. A recent Newsweek \narticle describes what it calls the ``New Digital Galaxy'' which allows \nconsumers to operate devices from coffee-makers to dishwashers via \nInternet access. This will introduce a vastly different landscape in \nhigh-technology than exists today. Users will not necessarily use \nstationary Personal Computers to access information, but instead rely \non Web phones, palmtop computers and similar technology that is \nadvancing at an exponential rate.\n  The Internet has had the fastest adoption rate of any new medium in \nhistory. Over 50 million users were connected in the first five years. \nTo reach the 50 million user milestone, it took 38 years for radio, 13 \nyears for television, and 10 years for cable. On top of this initial \ngrowth, the number of users continues to increase by an astounding 37% \nper year. It is projected that 200 million people worldwide will be \nconnected to the web in 1999, and half a billion by 2003. To handle the \nvolume, the backbone of the Internet now doubles in capacity every 100 \ndays.\n  Not only is the number of users increasing exponentially, but the \namount of information available to them is also growing at an \nunprecedented level. The International Data Corporation estimates the \nnumber of web pages on the World Wide Web at 829 million at the end of \n1998, and projects that the number grow by 75 percent to 1.45 billion \nby the end of 1999. By 2002, according to IDC, there will be 7.7 \nbillion web pages.\n  What does this mean to the future of global commerce? Considering \nthat 18 million consumers made purchases on the Internet in 1997, and \nthat number is projected to increase to 128 million by 2002, the \npossibilities are limitless. In\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\nreal dollars, this translates into $200 billion in Net-based commerce \nby 2000, and $1 trillion by 2003.\n\n  We can't begin today fully to understand the scope of freedom for \npeople that this information revolution will bring. And all the while \nMicrosoft and its competitors continue to bring better products at \nlower prices to all consumers.\n  While this case has been in the court, we have heard almost no \ndiscussion about whether the dramatic changes of the last year have \nrendered this case moot. I believe they do, and here's why.\n  In the presence of a company exerting real monopoly power, \ncompetitors would be stifled, prices would rise, choices would be \ncurtailed, consumers would be harmed. In fact, in the last twelve \nmonths the real world for consumers has improved by all of these \nmeasures. Competition in the technology industry is alive and well and \nnipping at the heels of Microsoft--all great news for consumers. Prices \nare down, choices are up, innovation is rampant.\n  The U.S. software industry is growing at a rate more than double that \nof the rest of the economy. The number of U.S. software companies has \ngrown from 24,000 in 1990 to an estimated 57,000 in 1999. The number of \nU.S. software industry employees has grown from 290,000 in 1990 to an \nestimated 860,000 in 1999, with an average rate of growth of 80,000 per \nyear from 1996 to 1999. Do these growth figures sound like they come \nfrom an industry that is dominated by a Monopoly player?\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the industry is thriving. It \nshows that we do not need the government picking winners and losers. \nWhile the nature of the government's case has been forced to change in \nthe last year, the administration seems determined to punish this \nsuccessful company and to use the power of the government to reward \nMicrosoft's competitors. These are the very competitors whose alliances \nhave radically changed the competitive landscape of the Information \nTechnology industry in just the last few months.\n  When the case began, AOL and Netscape were two large successful \ncompanies. Today they're gigantic, teamed with Sun and ready to compete \nin the next frontier of the Information Technology industry--the \nInternet.\n  When the case began, MCI Communications and WorldCom were two \nseparate companies, as were Excite and @Home. Yahoo hadn't yet bought \nGeoCities and Broadcast.com.\n  When the case began AT was a long distance company. Today, AT \ncould influence more than 60% of cable systems in the United States.\n  Microsoft has continued to excel, in spite of simultaneously fighting \noff the government and its competitors. But, far from being stifled, \nMicrosoft's competitors and potential competitors also have increased \ntheir market value by dizzying percentages over the last year:\n  AOL--up 555 percent;\n  Amazon--up 838 percent;\n  Sun Microsystems--up 209 percent;\n  IBM--up 91 percent; and\n  Yahoo--up 455 percent.\n  Microsoft is up 83 percent.\n  To me that's good news, and I hope it happens again this year. But \nthat success leads me to wonder: if these competitors are so injured by \nMicrosoft, why is the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 20% and the more \ntechnologically driven NASDAQ up a more startling 40% since the trial \nbegan?\n  A May 7 article in the Washington Post outlines the previously \nundisclosed lobbying activity on the part of a multi-billion dollar \ncoalition of Microsoft competitors, consisting of Netscape and AOL, as \nwell as ProComp, Sun and Oracle, who collectively have outspent the \nRedmond-based software firm by almost $4 million. The Post story made \nclear that Microsoft has been scrambling just to catch-up.\n  Economist Milton Friedman recently warned about the possible impacts \nof the suit on the high-technology industry as a whole. He pointed out \nthe obvious flaw in the competitors' strategy, which is involving \ngovernment regulators. Mr. Friedman states, ``Silicon Valley is \nsuicidal in calling government in to mediate in disputes among some of \nthe big companies in the area and Microsoft . . . once you get the \ngovernment involved, it's difficult to get it out.'' I couldn't agree \nmore.\n  Mr. President, with the Sherman antitrust action by the government \nagainst Microsoft entering its second year, the only question that \nremains is why this lawsuit continues. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin seeking an answer to that question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S5982-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 394.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of myself, and Senators Warner, Shelby, Murkowski, Domenici, \nSpecter, Thomas, Kyl, and Hutchinson.\n  This package is the product of the serious investigative and \noversight work performed by the relevant committees and other Senators \nwho have devoted considerable attention to the issues of satellite \nexports, Chinese espionage, lax security at DOE facilities, foreign \ncounterintelligence wiretaps, and more. I commend my cosponsors and \nothers for their helpful efforts in this regard.\n  I have stated that the damage to U.S. national security as a result \nof China's nuclear espionage is probably the greatest I have seen in my \nentire career. And, unfortunately, the administration's inattention \nto--or even hostility towards--counterintelligence and security has \nmagnified this breach.\n  It is simply incredible that China has acquired sensitive, classified \ninformation about every nuclear warhead in the U.S. arsenal. But this \napparently is precisely what happened.\n  It is simply incredible that American companies illegally provided \ninformation to the Chinese that will allow them to improve their long-\nrange missiles aimed at American cities. But this apparently is exactly \nwhat happened.\n  It is simply incredible that American exports were delivered to \ncertain Chinese facilities that will assist their weapons of mass \ndestruction program. But this apparently is exactly what happened.\n  It is simply incredible that it took this administration 2 years from \nthe date the National Security Adviser was\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nfirst briefed by DOE officials on the problem of Chinese espionage at \nthe nuclear weapons laboratories, to sign a new Presidential directive \nto strengthen counterintelligence at the labs and elsewhere. But this \napparently is exactly what happened.\n  And, after all this, it is simply incredible that the President would \nclaim that all this damage was a result of actions of previous \nadministrations and that he had not been told of any espionage that had \noccurred on his watch. But this is exactly what the President said in a \nmid-March press conference.\n  As I have stated previously, the Congress must take several steps to \nbetter understand what happened and how it happened, and to lessen the \nlikelihood of a recurrence of such events in the future.\n  First, we must aggressively probe the administration to determine the \nfacts. We know much of what happened. But we don't have all the facts, \nand we certainly don't know why certain events unfolded the way they \ndid. We need to get to the bottom of that.\n  Several committees are exploring aspects of this scandal, and it is \nmulti-faceted: DOE security; whistleblower protections; \ncounterintelligence at the FBI; CIA operations; export controls; \nillegal campaign contributions; the Justice Department; the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, FISA; DOD monitoring of satellite \nlaunches in China; waivers of laws for companies under investigation \nfor illegal activities; and much, much more.\n  Second, we must take all reasonable steps now to remedy problems we \nhave identified to date. Does this mean that the actions recommended in \nthis bill, or in this amendment, will solve the problem of lab security \nfor all time? Of course not. But they do represent important first \nsteps in addressing the myriad problems that have emerged during the \nvarious on-going investigations.\n  For example, we know that security and counter-intelligence at the \nlabs was--and is--woefully inadequate. We can take steps to begin to \nfix that problem.\n  We know that the Clinton Commerce Department failed miserably to \nadequately control and protect national security information as it \nrelates to commercial communications satellites and rocket launchers. \nWe took steps last year in the Defense authorization bill to help \nprotect national security by transferring from Commerce to State the \nresponsibility for reviewing license applications for such satellites.\n  Third, we must hold appropriate executive branch officials \naccountable for their actions. This means we need to understand why \ncertain Clinton administration officials acted the way they did. Why, \nfor example, were DOE intelligence officials told they could not brief \nthe Congress on aspects of this espionage investigation and its \nimplications? Why did the Reno Justice Department refuse to approve a \nwiretap request? Why was a certain suspect's computer not searched \nmuch, much earlier when, in fact, the suspect had agreed several years \nearlier to such a search? And why was a waiver granted for the export \nof a satellite built by an American company that was under \ninvestigation by the Department of Justice and whose head was the \nsingle largest individual contributor to the Democratic National \nCommittee?\n  In posing these and other questions, does this mean the Senate is on \nsome partisan witch-hunt? Absolutely not. I recognize that a full \nunderstanding of this issue requires going back decades.\n  For example, the reports recently issued by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee and the Cox Committee in the House reviewed documents from \nprior administrations.\n  But simply saying that errors were made in previous administrations \ncannot and does not absolve this President and this administration from \nresponsibility. In fact, this administration's record in the area of \nsecurity and counter-intelligence, in its relations with China, and in \nseveral other areas, leaves much to be desired.\n  As I said before, there are some steps we can and should take now. \nFor example, the Defense authorization bill before us now proposes \nseveral important measures regarding Department of Energy security and \ncounterintelligence. Likewise, the intelligence authorization bill \nincludes several legislative proposals on this topic as well.\n  My amendment is entirely consistent with, and indeed builds upon, \nthose two vital legislative measures. Allow me to describe what this \namendment proposes to do.\n  First, it seeks to address the Loral episode, wherein the President \napproved a waiver for the export of a Loral satellite for launch on a \nChinese rocket at the same time Loral was under investigation by the \nJustice Department for possible criminal wrong-doing.\n  This amendment requires the President to notify the Congress whenever \nan investigation is undertaken of an alleged violation of U.S. export \ncontrol laws in connection with the export of a commercial satellite of \nU.S. origin.\n  It also requires the President to notify the Congress whenever an \nexport license or waiver is granted on behalf of any U.S. person or \nfirm that is the subject of a criminal investigation.\n  I am absolutely convinced that had these ``sunshine'' provisions been \nin effect at the time of the Loral waiver decision, I doubt very \nseriously that the President would have issued his decision in favor of \nLoral.\n  Second, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to undertake \ncertain actions that would significantly enhance the performance and \neffectiveness of the DOD program for monitoring so-called ``satellite \nlaunch campaigns'' in China and elsewhere.\n  For instance, under this amendment, the DOD monitoring officials will \nbe given authority to halt a launch campaign if they felt U.S. national \nsecurity was being compromised. In addition, the Secretary will be \nobligated to establish appropriate professional and technical \nqualifications, as well as training programs, for such personnel, and \nincrease the number of such monitors.\n  Furthermore, to remove any ambiguity as to what technical information \nmay be shared by U.S. contractors during a launch campaign, the \namendment requires the Secretary of Defense to review and improve \nguidelines for such discussions. Finally, it requires the Secretary to \nestablish a counter intelligence program within the organization \nresponsible for performing such monitoring functions.\n  Third, my amendment enhances the intelligence community's role in the \nexport license review process. This responds to a clear need for \ngreater insight by the State Department and other license-reviewing \nagencies into the Chinese and other entities involved in space launch \nand ballistic missile programs. In this regard, it is worth noting that \nthe intelligence community played a very modest role in reviewing the \nlicense applications for exports that subsequently were deemed to have \nharmed national security.\n  This section also requires a report by the Director of Central \nIntelligence on the efforts of foreign governments to acquire sensitive \nU.S. technology and technical information.\n  Fourth, based on concerns that China continues to proliferate missile \nand missile technology to Pakistan and Iran, this amendment expresses \nthe sense of Congress that the People's Republic of China should not be \npermitted to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, as a \nmember until Beijing has demonstrated a sustained commitment to missile \nnonproliferation and adopted an effective export control system. Any \nhonest appraisal would lead one to the conclusion, I believe, that \nChina has not demonstrated such a commitment and does not have in place \neffective export controls.\n  Now we know, from documents released by the White House as part of \nthe Senate's investigation, that the Clinton administration wanted to \nbring the PRC into the MTCR as a means of shielding Beijing from \nmissile proliferation sanctions laws now on the books. This section \nsends a strong signal that such an approach should not be undertaken.\n  Fifth, the amendment expresses strong support for stimulating the \nexpansion of the commercial space launch industry here in America. As \nwe have seen recently with a number of failed U.S. rocket launches, \nthere is a crying need to improve the performance of U.S.-built and \nlaunched rockets. This amendment strongly encourages efforts to promote \nthe domestic commercial space launch industry, including through the \nelimination of legal or regulatory barriers to long-term \ncompetitiveness.\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\n  The amendment also urges a review of the current policy of permitting \nthe export of commercial satellites of U.S. origin to the PRC for \nlaunch and suggests that, if a decision is made to phase-out the \npolicy, then launches of such satellites in the PRC should occur only \nif they are licensed as of the commencement of the phase-out of the \npolicy and additional actions are taken to minimize the transfer of \ntechnology to the PRC during the course of such launches.\n  Sixth, the amendment requires the Secretary of State to provide \ninformation to U.S. satellite manufacturers when a license application \nis denied. This addresses a legitimate concern expressed by U.S. \nindustry about the current export control process.\n  I not that each of these recommendations was included in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee's ``Report on Impacts to U.S. National Security \nof Advanced Satellite Technology Exports to the PRC and the PRC's \nEfforts Influence U.S. Policy.'' That report was approved by an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote, so there is nothing partisan whatsoever \nin these recommendations.\n  My amendment also requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an \nannual report on the military balance in the Taiwan Straits, similar to \nthe report delivered to the Congress earlier this year. That report, my \ncolleagues may recall, was both informative and deeply troubling in its \nassessment that the PRC has underway a massive buildup of missile \nforces opposite our friend, Taiwan.\n  Annual submission of this report will assist the Congress in working \nwith the administration in assessing future lists of defense articles \nand services requested by Taiwan as part of the annual arms sales talks \nbetween the U.S. and Taiwan.\n  Eighth, the amendment proposes a mechanism for determining the extent \nto which then-Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary's ``Openness \nInitiative'' resulted in the release of highly-classified nuclear \nsecrets. We already know, for example, that some material has been \npublicly-released that contained highly-sensitive ``restricted Data'' \nor ``Formerly Restricted Data.''\n  While we are rightly concerned about what nuclear weapons design or \nother sensitive information has been stolen through espionage, at the \nsame time we must be vigilant in ensuring that Mrs. O'Leary's \ninitiative was not used, and any future declassification measures will \nnot be used, to provide nuclear know-how to would-be proliferators in \nIran, North Korea, and elsewhere.\n  Ninth, the amendment proposes putting the FBI in charge of conducting \nsecurity background investigations of DOE laboratory employees, versus \nthe Office of Personnel Management as is currently the case. I applaud \nthe Armed Services Committee for including additional funds in their \nbill for addressing the current backlog of security investigations.\n  Tenth, and lastly, the amendment proposes increased \ncounterintelligence training and other measures to ensure classified \ninformation is protected during DOE laboratory-to-laboratory exchanges, \nshould such exchanges occur in the future. For example, having trained \ncounter-intelligence experts go along on any and all visits of lab \nemployees to sensitive countries, is a small but useful step in the \ndirection of enhanced security.\n  Mr. President, I readily concede that this package of amendments will \nnot solve all security problems at the Nation's nuclear weapons \nlaboratories. Nor will it solve the myriad problems identified to date \nin the Senate's on-going investigation of the damage to U.S. national \nsecurity from the export of satellites to the PRC or from Chinese \nnuclear espionage.\n  These are, as I mentioned before, small but useful steps to address \nknown deficiencies. Most of these recommendations stem from the \nbipartisan report issued by the Intelligence Committee.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  In summary, good work has been done by the Cox committee in the House \nof Representatives. They should be commended for the work they have \ndone in this critical area. They should be commended for the fact that \nit has been bipartisan. It would have been easy for them to veer into \nareas or procedures that would have made it very partisan. They did not \ndo that.\n  The same thing is true in the Senate. The Senate has chosen so far \nnot to have a select committee or a joint committee. The Senate has \ncontinued to try to do this in the normal way.\n  We have had hearings by the Intelligence Committee. They have done \nvery good work. Chairman Shelby has been thoughtful and relentless, and \nhe continues in that way. The Armed Services Committee, under Senator \nWarner, the Energy Committee, under Senator Murkowski, Foreign \nRelations, Governmental Affairs--all the committees with jurisdiction \nin this area have been having hearings, they have had witnesses, and \nthey have been coming up with recommendations.\n  As a matter of fact, some of the recommendations that have been \ndeveloped are included in this Department of Defense authorization \nbill. I understand other proposed changes to deal with these security \nlapses and with counterintelligence will be included in the \nintelligence authorization bill that will come up in early June.\n  I do not believe we should rush to judgment. We should make sure we \nunderstand the full ramifications of what has happened. We should not \nsay it has been just this administration or that administration or the \nother administration. This is about the security of our country. I \nagree with Congressman Dicks when he quoted former Senator Henry \nJackson about how, when it comes to national security, we should all \njust pursue it as Americans.\n  This amendment I have just sent to the desk is a further outgrowth of \nsome of the information we have found through some of the hearings that \nhave occurred. There were some provisions in it that I am sure would \nhave evoked some criticism, and we have taken those out, so that we can \ntake our time and deal more thoughtfully with it over a period of time.\n  We are going to have to deal with the Export Administration and the \nfact that law was allowed to lapse back in 1995. But there are some \nthings we can do now. To reiterate, this is what this amendment will \ndo:\n  First, it requires the President to notify the Congress whenever an \ninvestigation is undertaken of an alleged violation of U.S. export \ncontrol laws in connection with the export of a commercial satellite of \nU.S. origin.\n  It will also require the President to notify the Congress whenever an \nexport license or waiver is granted on behalf of any U.S. person or \nfirm that is the subject of a criminal investigation.\n  Second, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to undertake \ncertain actions that would significantly enhance the performance and \neffectiveness of the DOD program for monitoring so-called satellite \nlaunch campaigns in China and elsewhere.\n  Third, the amendment will enhance the intelligence community's role \nin the export license review process and requires a report by the DCI \non the efforts of foreign governments to acquire sensitive U.S. \ntechnology and technical information.\n  Fourth, the amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the \nPeople's Republic of China should not be permitted to join the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime as a member until Beijing has demonstrated a \nsustained commitment to missile nonproliferation and adopted an \neffective export control system.\n\n  The amendment expresses strong support for stimulating the expansion \nof the commercial space launch industry in America. This amendment \nstrongly encourages efforts to promote the domestic commercial space \nlaunch industry. That is why we have seen more of this activity occur \nin other countries, particularly China and even Russia, because we do \nnot have that domestic commercial space launch capability here. We \nshould eliminate legal or regulatory barriers to long-term \ncompetitiveness.\n  The amendment also urges a review of the current policy of permitting \nthe export of commercial satellites of U.S. origin to the PRC for \nlaunch.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary of State to provide information \nto U.S. satellite manufacturers when a license application is denied.\n  The amendment also requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an \nannual report on the military balance in the Taiwan Straits, similar to \nthe report developed earlier this year and was delivered to the \nCongress.\n  The amendment proposes a mechanism for determining the extent to\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\nwhich classified nuclear weapons information has been released by the \nDepartment of Energy. It proposes putting the FBI in charge of \nconducting security background investigations of DOE Laboratory \nemployees versus OPM. It seems to me that really is beyond the \ncapabilities of the Office of Personnel Management. Surely, the FBI \nwould be better conducting the security background investigations. This \ndoes not call for putting the FBI totally in charge of security at our \nLabs, for instance. That is something we need to think about more. I \nhad thought the FBI should be in charge, and there are some limitations \nin that area. That is an area we should think about a lot more. We \nshould work through the committee process. We should think together in \na bipartisan way about how to do it.\n  Clearly, the security at our Laboratories has to be revised. We have \nto have a much better counterintelligence process, and our committees \nare working on that.\n  Last, the committee proposes increased counterintelligence training \nand other measures to ensure classified information is protected during \nDOE Laboratory-to-Laboratory exchanges.\n  These are pieces that I think Senators can agree on across the board. \nThey are targeted at dealing with the problem, not trying to fix blame, \nnot claiming that this is going to solve all the problems. But these \nare some things we can do now that will help secure these Laboratories \nin the future and get information we need and give enhanced \ncapabilities to the intelligence communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to review it. It has been, of course, considered \nby the committees that have jurisdiction. We have provided copies of it \nto the minority, and we invite their participation. I believe this is \nsomething that can be bipartisan and can be accepted, after reasonable \ndebate, overwhelmingly. I certainly hope so. I appreciate the \nopportunity to offer this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority \nleader for this initiative. We have had in his office a series of \nmeetings with the chairmen, as he enumerated, and this piece of \nlegislation has been very carefully crafted drawing from each of the \ncommittees the work they have done thus far.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee, as the majority leader has said, \nhas taken an active role in addressing the issues. I refer colleagues \nto page 462 of our report, which is on each desk. In there, we have a \nsubtitle (D) related to this subject. We are bringing this together.\n  I thought it was important--and I consulted with the majority leader \nthis morning--to lay this down so all Senators have the opportunity to \nview it. Our distinguished colleague, the ranking member, has sent it \nout to the various Departments and agencies of the Federal Government \nfor comment. In the course of the day, as I am sure my colleague from \nMichigan will agree, we will basically try to allow Senators at any \ntime to address this particular amendment by Senator Lott and, indeed, \nthe provisions that we have in our bill.\n  This is an important subject. It is a timely subject. All Senators \nhopefully will strive to achieve bipartisanship because we recognize \nthat this problem goes back several administrations, although I have my \nown personal views that this administration must account for some \nactions which I find very disturbing--in other words, why corrective \nmeasures were not brought about more expeditiously. But time will tell.\n  Also, I believe it is important to recognize that the United States \nof America in the next millennium will be faced with an ever-growing \nand ever-important nation, China. We as a nation must remain engaged \nwith China, whether it is on economic, political, human rights, or \nsecurity issues. China and the United States are the two dominant \nleaders, together with Japan and, indeed, I think South Korea, in that \nregion to bring about the security which is desperately needed.\n  So let us hope that in due course we can, on this bill, put together \na bipartisan package. We already have one amendment in there, and it \npassed our committee with bipartisan support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield while the majority leader is on \nthe floor so I could give a 30-second comment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We welcome the proposal of the majority leader. We have \nworked very closely, on a bipartisan basis, on the committee on what is \nin the bill already and to which the majority leader has made \nreference. We will continue and look forward to working with the \nmajority leader, on a bipartisan basis, on his proposal. The committees \nof jurisdiction and I are reviewing that. We got it last night. We \nwelcome very much these kinds of suggestions and will address them in \nthe same kind of bipartisan approach that the good Senator from \nVirginia, our good chairman, has just made reference to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course.\n  Mr. LOTT. I just say, I appreciate your comments and your attitude. \nIf we have problems, we can address those problems in a bipartisan way \nto deal with the future. And that is my intent. I will be glad to work \nwith you. Thank you for your comments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  If I may note, with a sense of humility, Senator Levin and I are now \nentering the third day on this bill. To the best of my recollection--\nwhich is 21 years that we have been working together on authorizations \nbills--we may have set a record thus far. That record is not \nnecessarily owing to the efforts of the ranking member and myself but \nall Senators in cooperating in moving this bill along; the record being \nwe only had one quorum call, this being the third day.\n\n  We started on a Monday, when ordinarily things do not move as \nquickly; but we had one single quorum call, I think, for about 3 or 4 \nminutes on Monday. Yesterday, throughout, we stayed here until close to \n9 o'clock last night working on amendments. So I thank the Senator, my \ncolleague, my friend from Michigan. I thank all Senators.\n  We just had another Senator come on the floor in a timely way. He is \nright on the split second of when he is due to bring up his amendment.\n  So with the cooperation of other Senators, I am hopeful we can finish \nthis bill tonight. I have discussed that with the majority leader, and \nhe is going to give us total support. We will just drive this engine, \nhopefully into the early hours of the evening, and complete it.\n  But I do bring to the attention of Senators that I will place on the \nmajority leader's desk here, as I manage the bill, three pages of \namendments. There they are. We have to work our way through these \ntoday. My colleague, Mr. Levin, and I will be here throughout the day \nto assist Senators in accommodating them with their desire regarding \nthese amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the chairman would just yield for a comment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I commend him for his leadership, which made our good \nprogress possible. When he points out how few quorum calls we have had \non this bill, the only suggestion I have in addition to the ones he has \nmade is that there is a lot of wood around here to knock on, and we \nneed to knock on wood that this will continue along the lines it has \nwith very few quorum calls and significant progress.\n  I do see the Senator from Nebraska on the floor. We look forward to \nhis offering that amendment. Then I believe at 11:45, under the current \nunanimous consent agreement, we are going to return to the BRAC \namendment and then have a vote on that. That would be the first vote, \nas I understand the UC.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be at 1:45.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on the subject of BRAC, again, the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nReed, the distinguished Senator from Maine--my recollection is there \nwas one other Senator who spoke last night in the debate on the BRAC \nprocess, so we have had a considerable amount of debate. There are 2 \nhours allocated. I am not certain that all 2 hours will be needed. But \nI urge Senators to come over as quickly\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nas possible when that amendment comes up on the schedule, and we can \nhopefully move through that debate and on to other matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 395\n\n     (Purpose: To strike section 1041, relating to a limitation on \n   retirement or dismantlement of strategic nuclear delivery systems)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment of the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 395.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 357, strike line 13 and all that follows through \n     page 358, line 4.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that this piece \nof legislation being considered right now, in my view, of all the laws \nwe write and all the laws we consider, is the one that is most vital. \nIf we do not have a defense that is able to defend not just the United \nStates of America but our interests, all the rest of it is secondary, \nin my view.\n  I am very impressed--I came to this Senate in 1989, and I came to the \nSenate without the experience of having gone to law school. I was \ntrained in other matters. The longer I am here, the more impressed I am \nboth with the law itself and the power of this law. I cannot help but, \nas I begin to describe my own amendment, take a little bit of time to \ndescribe the connection between the law and things people see in their \nlives that they may not see as having been caused by the law itself.\n  We do not have an Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps without this \npiece of legislation, which is, I think--I don't know--500-and-some \npages long, with a report with it as well. This law creates our \nmilitary. It authorizes appropriations to be made. It authorizes us to \ngo out and recruit people to serve in our Armed Forces.\n  We are going into the Memorial Day weekend during which I guess many, \nif not most, of us are going to be called upon to comment upon the \nmeaning of Memorial Day--what does this day mean to us in our lives.\n  For me, it is a time to reflect and say that these 1,360,000 men and \nwomen who are currently serving our Nation, and the half million \nReserve and Guard men and women who are out there as well, are part of \na long tradition of American men and women who have given up their \nfreedom, because in the military they have a different code than we \nhave in the private sector. The standards of justice are different. The \nexpectations are different.\n  In the military, the command structure is such that if I have \ncommand--which I did many, many years ago--if I have command and do \nwell, I get a medal. But if I do poorly, my fitness report will be so \nbad I will be looking for a private sector opportunity. We have a \nresponsibility we cannot delegate. That imposes upon an individual who \nis in the military real burdens that are different from what we have in \nthe private sector--real responsibilities that are completely \ndifferent.\n  A man or woman who serves us today, who serves the cause of freedom \ntoday in our Armed Forces, does something that is much different from \nmost private sector citizens. I begin my comments on this amendment by \nsaluting them, by thanking them for taking what, unfortunately, today \nis almost a nonmainstream action, and that is based upon their love of \ncountry and their love of freedom, saying: We're willing to sacrifice \nour freedom; we're willing to give up rights that most private sector \ncitizens have.\n  Furthermore, nobody should doubt that in normal training operations \nit is possible to be injured or to even lose your life. A lot of these \ntraining operations are dangerous. So they are risking their lives on a \nday-to-day basis. Obviously, they are involved today in Kosovo; they \nare involved in the Balkans; they are involved with containing Saddam \nHussein; they are involved on the Korean peninsula; they are forward \ndeployed in areas around the world where we have interests, not just \ninterests that are only of the United States, but interests in values \nthat we hope will spread worldwide.\n  All of us had the opportunity--I did; I took advantage of the \nopportunity--to sit and listen to Presidents Kim Dae-jung of South \nKorea and Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and Nelson Mandela of \nSouth Africa when each spoke at a joint session of Congress across the \nway in the House of Representatives, and looked down to every \nrepresentative of the people and said: Thank you, American people. You \nput your lives on the line, and we are free in South Korea today as a \nconsequence. You put your lives and resources on the line, and we are \nfree in the Czech Republic because of it. You have put your lives and \nresources on the line in South Africa, and we are free there as well. \nYour efforts enabled us to be free, these three individuals said. Many \nothers have said the same thing.\n  It is not a cliche that freedom is not free. This piece of \nlegislation, this important piece of legislation, has us supporting \n1,360,000 men and women in the military, and half a million Reserve and \nGuard people who are actively involved in the cause of defending \nfreedom in the United States of America and throughout the world. This \nis an extremely important piece of legislation. I argue if we don't get \nthis one right, all the rest of it is secondary. If this piece of \nlegislation, if this law is not written correctly, all the rest of it \ndoesn't matter.\n  I begin my comments this morning praising Chairman Warner and the \nranking member, Senator Levin, who have led the Armed Services \nCommittee to give us this piece of legislation. They understand this \npiece of legislation keeps America safe. This is about security. We \ncan't cut corners. We can't scrimp. We can't say we will just go \npartially there. We have to answer the question: What do we need to do \nto keep the people of the United States safe? How do we keep them \nsecure and try to write laws that accomplish that objective?\n  With great respect to the committee, there is one provision in \nsubtitle D called ``Other Matters'' on page 357 that I am proposing to \nstrike. That language provides a 1-year extension of a requirement that \nI think causes the United States of America to be less safe than it \nwould without this provision. Let me get to it specifically.\n  What this provision does is say that the United States of America \nmust maintain a nuclear deterrent that is at the START I levels, that \nwe have to have warheads deployed, land, sea, air, that are at START I \nlevels; that the President of the United States cannot go below those \nSTART I levels. In the cold war, perhaps even a few years after the \ncold war was ended, when we were trying to err on the side of safety, \nthis made sense because the No. 1 threat then was a bolt out of the \nblue, an attack by the Soviet Union that might occur when we least \nexpected it. We had to maintain an active deterrence and prevent that. \nThe capacity to survive that bolt-out-of-the-blue attack and \ncounterattack was an essential part of our strategy.\n\n  Today, the No. 1 threat is not a bolt-out-of-the-blue attack. The No. \n1 threat today is an accidental launch, a rogue nation launch, or a \nsabotage launch of a nuclear weapon. One of the things that causes me a \ngreat deal of concern in this new era of ours is that I think we in \nCongress and the American people as well have forgotten the danger of \nthese nuclear weapons. We have been talking about new threats to \nAmerica. We have a threat in the form of chemical weapons, a threat in \nthe form of biological weapons, a threat in the form of cyber warfare, \nlots of others things like that, terrorism, that cause people to be \nvery much concerned.\n  My belief is that the only threat out there that can kill every \nsingle American, and thus the threat that ought to be top on our list \nof concerns is nuclear weapons. The nation that possesses the\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\ngreatest threat of all in terms of an accidental launch, a rogue nation \nlaunch, or a sabotage launch is Russia.\n  I appreciate the fine work that Congressman Cox and Congressman Dicks \ndid. They presented a report yesterday. I think they have laid out a \nroadmap that will enable us to change our laws and increase security at \nthe Labs, increase the security of the satellite launches and increase \nthe security, in general, with the transfer of technology through \nexport licenses. I think they gave us a good roadmap, but one of the \nconcerns I have with the report--I think it is unintentional--strike \n``I think.'' It is unintentional--it has left the impression that China \nis a bigger threat to the United States in terms of nuclear weapons \nthan Russia is. Nothing can be further from the truth.\n  In China, they prevent the possibility of an accidental launch by \nsaying we are not going to put our warheads on the missile. According \nto published reports, it would take at least 24 hours and probably a \nminimum of 48 hours, from the moment an order was given to launch, to \nput the warheads on the missiles. In China they have no more, according \nto published reports, than 13 weapons headed in our direction. They are \ncategorized as city busters. They are not as accurate as the Russians \nare. They are not as deadly as the Russians are. They are not as \nlikely, as a consequence of organized systems, to be launched in an \naccidental fashion. Even though they can reach us, even though China is \na serious threat as a consequence of their behavior in the \nproliferation area--and we should not have trimmed in areas of export \nlicenses or satellite launches on Long March or the operations of our \nLaboratories or other areas that would put America at risk--the threat \nassessment today says that the No. 1 threat to us is the threat that is \nposed by Russia as a consequence of their having strategic weapons that \ncould reach the United States in a matter of hours and could reach the \nUnited States in a devastating fashion not through intentional launch \nbut accidental launch, rogue nation launch or sabotage launch.\n  I think that part of the problem in all of this is, again, that we \nhave been lulled into a false sense of security that, well, maybe these \nnuclear weapons aren't that big of a problem. Let me say that in the \nformer Soviet Union, that may have been the case, because their economy \nwas much stronger than it is today. They had a much greater capacity to \ncontrol those weapons systems that they have.\n  One of the reasons, the biggest reason that I want to change this is \nthat I believe we are forcing Russia today to maintain a level of \nnuclear weapons beyond what their financial system will allow them to \nmaintain. They are currently required at START I levels to have 6,000 \nstrategic warheads. Again, according to published accounts from their \nown military people, they would prefer to be at a level of 1,000 or \nlower, because they simply don't have the resources. I can go into some \nrather startling problems that are created as a consequence of that \ninability, but they simply don't have the ability, the resources to \nallocate to maintain those 6,000 warheads as we do. Ours are safe. Ours \nare secure. We have redundant switching systems and all kinds of other \nprotections to make certain that we don't have an accidental launch, to \nmake certain that there is no rogue transfer, to make certain that \nthere is no terrorism that could take over one of these sites and be \nused either against the United States itself or against some other \ncountry.\n\n  One of the baseline problems that we have as Americans is that we are \nthe most open society on earth. We are the most successful society \nmeasured by our economy, measured by our military, measured by even our \ndemocracy, which can be a bit frustrating from time to time. We take \nsides on issues worldwide, which I think we have to do if we want to \ncontinue to fight for the freedom of people throughout this world. But \nas a consequence of all those things, there are lots of people on this \nEarth who hate Americans, who have in their hearts a desire to do \nsignificant damage to us. It is a problem created from our own success. \nSo as we try to decide how we are going to keep our country safe, one \nof the things that I believe we need to think about when it comes to \nRussia is, is it possible for somebody who hates America, who is \nwilling to do damage to America and willing to die in the act of doing \nit--what kind of risk is there as a consequence of a policy under law \nthat requires Russia to maintain a nuclear force that is higher than \neither they can afford or they want to maintain?\n  Well, I will describe a couple of scenarios in length here, but many \nyears ago, sort of a Stone Age time for me, I was trained in the U.S. \nNavy SEAL team. I do not argue that I was an exemplary special \noperations person. I had a relatively short experience in the war \nbefore I was injured, so I didn't have enough time on task to become \nreally good at it. But you always have these sort of imaginary \nfantasies that you are still 25 years of age, and there are times when \nyou sort of think that way.\n  I believe it is possible for somebody who is well trained and well \norganized to raid a silo site of a Russian missile in the Russian \nwilderness and take that site over. You will have a scenario on the \nopposite side that says that it can't be done. I believe it can be \ndone.\n  One of the things that you have to do when you are planning, writing \na law to defend the people of the United States of America, is you have \nto think about that small possibility and you have to plan for it. We \ndidn't expect that the Russians were high probability going to come \nthrough the Fulda Gap during the 40-plus years of the cold war, but we \ndefended against it, and it was an expensive defense because it was \npossible that it could happen.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is possible for a small band of \ndiscontents or terrorists to raid a silo site of a Russian missile in \nthe Russian wilderness. I believe that there are soldiers today in \nRussia who are poorly trained, who are sparsely equipped, and who are \nirate at not having been paid in well over a year in some cases. I \nthink they are vulnerable and easily overtaken, and as a consequence, \nwilling to cooperate in things that would put the United States of \nAmerica at risk.\n\n  What you have to do is sort of then say to yourself: What would \nhappen? Imagine what would happen if that were to occur.\n  Well, I again have to underscore with a story why I think we are \nlulled to sleep by nuclear weapons. In the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, on which I have the honor of serving as a result of \nSenator Daschle appointing me to that and serving on behalf of the \nSenate, I once asked some analysts of the CIA to tell me what the \nimpact would be of a single missile being launched and hitting a U.S. \ncity. The answer was we are really not sure. We haven't thought it \nthrough lately. We don't put it up on our radar screen as being the \nsort of thing to worry about.\n  I find that not only alarming but illustrative of the general \nproblem. We are not thinking about this threat.\n  We are not imagining what could happen in a worse case scenario and, \nas a consequence, we are sort of allowing ourselves to be dragged along \nwith yesterday's policy, not thinking about how we can do this \ndifferently to substantially reduce the threat to the people of the \nUnited States of America, and I believe, by the way, in the process, \nfreeing up resources that could be used on the conventional side where \nthere is much more likely scenarios where American men and women are \ngoing to be called on to defend the cause of freedom and fight for the \ncause of freedom.\n  A single Russian rocket could be launched over the top of the world \nfrom the north, and it would go across the Arctic pole, and in less \nthan an hour it could be in over Chicago. On a bad day, it might come \nwithin 100 yards of its target. On a good day, it would probably come \nwithin 10 to 15 yards of its target. I am talking about something about \nwhich, again, people will say this is alarmist.\n  It is not an alarmist scenario. This is what nuclear weapons do. We \nhave sort of forgotten that, in my view. Back in the 80s, during the \ncold war, all of us understood the danger of nuclear weapons, but today \nI don't think we do. I think we have forgotten what kind of damage they \ncan do.\n  A single nuclear weapon would vaporize everything. The surrounding \nair is instantaneously heated to a temperature of 10 million degrees \nCelsius. It\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nlooks brighter than the sun and shoots outward at a few hundred \nkilometers per second. It would be sufficient to set fire to anything \nin Chicago that is combustible at a distance of 14 kilometers. Anybody \nwithin 80 kilometers would be blinded as a consequence of the blast.\n  After the fireball, the blast effect force follows, traveling out \nfrom ground zero. Those within 3 kilometers, who had not already been \nkilled, will die from the percussive force. At 8 kilometers, 50 percent \nof the people will be killed, and every building within 2 kilometers \nwill be completely destroyed. Major destruction of homes, factories, \nand office buildings would extend out to 14 kilometers.\n\n  In the farthest reaches of the immediate blast zone--encompassing \neverything in Chicago--structures would be severely damaged, and 15 \npercent of the people in Chicago would be dead, 50 percent would be \ninjured, and most survivors would suffer second- and third-degree \nburns.\n  This is the damage that would be done from a single Russian nuclear \nweapon exploded above an American city. This is just one city.\n  Again, I point this out not to be alarmist but to say that this is a \nreal threat. This is not an imaginary threat. This weapons system \nexists. There are 6,000 of these in Russia today that were needed in \nthe cold war; they were needed in a deterrent strategy that the \nRussians had developed. We have drawn down, and they have drawn down to \nthe 6,000 level--a bit higher than that still today. They are drawing \ndown to that 6,000 level.\n  But, again, if you ask either our intelligence or the Russians \ndirectly, they will tell you they don't have the resources to maintain \neven 1,000. They don't have the resources to maintain 1,000, let alone \n6,000-plus, and in the kind of secure environment the people of the \nUnited States of America will need in order for themselves to be safe \nand secure as a consequence.\n  I tell the story out of what I think is a loss of focus on the danger \nof nuclear weapons. I am very concerned that the American people have \nbeen lulled into a false sense of security as a consequence of our \nelected leaders repeatedly telling them the threat no longer exists. In \nthe Presidential campaign of 1996, the President correctly kept saying \nthat for the first time in the history of the Nation we are not \ntargeting the Russians and they are not targeting us.\n  Well, you can retarget in a couple of minutes, max. This retargeting \ntask is a fairly simple task. Critics of the President pointed that \nout, and I think correctly. It caused people to be sort of lulled into \na sense that, gee, this wasn't a problem. If we are not targeting them \nand they are not targeting us, this is great news, so we don't have to \nworry about this threat any longer; thus, we can sort of stop worrying \nabout nuclear weapons. We can worry about other threats that we have to \nthe United States.\n  Again, I am calling my colleagues' attention to this problem not \nbecause I believe there is going to be a deliberate nuclear attack from \nRussia, because I don't think that is likely, or even plausible. \nIndeed, Russia has made extraordinary progress in their effort to \ntransform their economy and political system. Though they have a long \nway to go to complete the transition, they need to be applauded for it. \nBut this transition is going to take decades--back, forward, stop, go. \nIt is going to take a fair amount of time to transition from an old \ncommand economy to a market economy. In the meantime, they are finding \nit increasingly difficult to maintain the military infrastructure they \ninherited from the collapse of the Soviet Union, including, dare I say, \ntheir stockpile of thousands of nuclear weapons--estimated to be close \nto 7,000 on the strategic side and a comparable amount on the tactical \nside. There are 14 storage facilities, according to published reports, \nwhere they store fissile material. We don't know what is going on \ninside those buildings. It is a serious problem that our former \ncolleague, Sam Nunn, has said is a threat not coming from Russia's \nmight but from its military weakness.\n\n  If a single one doesn't bother you, there was an incident that \noccurred recently on September 11, 1998. I appreciate that some will \nsay that Kerrey is dreaming, this isn't a real danger. I don't think \nthere is a greater danger than an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon \nat the United States of America. I think it is the most dangerous \nproblem we face, and it is a scenario that could happen. If it happens, \nI believe we are going to regret not having developed a different \nstrategy than the old arms control strategy that we have had in the \npast. I am not going to describe an alternative strategy. I think one \nis needed, and I think one is more likely to occur if we strike this \nlanguage from the defense authorization bill and allow the President to \ngo below 6,000, similar to what President Bush did in the early 1990s, \ngetting a reciprocal response from Russia as a consequence.\n  Let me describe a real time scenario, a situation that happened on \nthe 11th of September--does the Senator want to say something?\n  Mr. WARNER. I didn't mean to interrupt the Senator, but I am hopeful \nthat we can listen to the important debate. I would like to have the \nopportunity to respond to the Senator so that Senators following this \ndebate can have framed in their minds where we have a difference of \nviews, and I would like to complete this by 11:45 so we can keep on our \nschedule. I hope our colleague will try to accommodate as best he can.\n  This is a very important subject. I share some of the views that he \nhas made. I think what he said is a very important reminder to Senators \non this subject. It has somewhat drifted from the minds of the Senators \ngiven that, regrettably, this stalemate thus far in Russia could move \nto ratification. Let us proceed, hopefully, in a timely way.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me describe an event that occurred on \nSeptember 11, 1998. Maybe colleagues didn't notice it; it was written \nup with a fairly small amount of attention. There was an 18-year-old \nRussian sailor who seized control of a Russian nuclear submarine near \nMurmansk. He killed seven fellow crewmembers and held control of the \nsubmarine for 20 hours. Russian authorities say that there were no \nnuclear weapons aboard the submarine. But it would not be difficult to \nimagine a scenario in which a similarly distraught member of the \nRussian navy might choose to express his frustration by seizing control \nof a submarine loaded with long-range, nuclear-tipped missiles. It is \nwidely recognized that command and control of weapons on Russian \nsubmarines is much more problematic than even with their ground-based \nforces.\n  There was a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, \nwhich conducted an analysis of the effects of an unauthorized launch \nagainst the United States from a--and I emphasize just one--Russian \nDelta IV submarine. This submarine is capable of carrying 16 SS-N-23 \nmissiles. Each of these missiles is equipped with four 100-kiloton \nwarheads. The study examined the consequences of 48 warheads being \ndetonated over eight major U.S. cities. It is likely that this \nscenario may not be right. It is likely that they would say we have 64 \nwarheads and will put one in each State in the United States of \nAmerica--that leaves me 14 more--and they will put a couple in New \nYork, a couple in Florida, a couple in other States. Imagine 64,000 \nkiloton weapons being detonated within a couple of hours in the United \nStates. That is a scenario that could be very real.\n\n  Is such a scenario likely to happen? It is less likely to happen than \nthe sun coming up tomorrow, but it could happen. It is a scenario that \nwe need to think about as we think about the danger of these nuclear \nweapons. And because we don't think about them, it is not likely that \nwe will consider an amendment like this terribly important. We will \nsort of drift along, as I think we are doing now, saying we are going \nto wait for the Duma to ratify START II. They are threatening not to \nratify for every possible reason. I don't know what the next anger \npoint is going to be. I personally don't believe that the ratification \nof START II by the Duma is necessarily terribly important.\n  That we need to look for an alternative way to reduce these threats, \nto me, is painfully obvious if you examine the danger that this threat \nposes to us.\n  When you think about the danger of an accidental or a rogue nation or \na\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nsabotage launch, I think you come immediately to the conclusion that, \nmy gosh, we have far more than we need to keep America safe, and the \nRussians clearly have far more than they need not only to keep their \ncountry safe but to reduce this risk of accidental launch. They do not \ncontrol their weapons in the same way that we do. They don't have the \ncapacity to control them in the same way that we do, as well.\n  Imagine, I ask my colleagues; put it on your radar screen. You have a \nDelta IV submarine with 64 100-kiloton weapons that could be in the \nUnited States in 2 hours. They are not like the Chinese nuclear \nweapons. The Chinese nuclear weapons take several days to get together. \nAgain, part of the published reports is that they have 13 or so aimed \nat the United States--aimed at our cities. They are nowhere near as \naccurate as the Russians, or as deadly as the Russians, and nowhere \nnear as likely to be launched either through an accidental launch or \nthrough an organized effort to come through sabotage and take over a \nsingle facility, or to take over one of these submarines that are much \nmore at risk as a consequence of their lax security.\n  If you do not think the scenario is possible, I would like to quote \nthe words of former a Russian Navy captain following this particular \nincident with the Russian sailor that I described earlier on the 11th \nof September 1998. He said, ``It is really scary that one day the use \nof nuclear arms may depend on the sentiments of someone who is feeling \nblue, who has gotten out of bed on the wrong side and who does not feel \nlike living.'' The probability of this today is higher than ever \nbefore.\n\n  The news has been filled recently with stories regarding nuclear \nweapons. Unfortunately, the stories have been causing us to be \nconcerned about our security relative to the Nation of China. The \nfindings that China, over the past 20 years, has methodically stolen \nU.S. nuclear secrets from our National Laboratories are very \ndisturbing, to put it mildly. We were very lax in our security in our \nLaboratories. We are very lax in our security with our export control \nlicenses. We are very lax in our security in monitoring satellites that \nare being launched on the Long March system of the Chinese, and as a \nconsequence, the United States of America suffers. There is no question \nthat is true. But U.S. security has suffered against a nation with \nconsiderably less capability than Russia and considerably less risk of \nan accidental launch as a result of the way the two nations organize \ntheir weapon systems.\n  In the uproar surrounding this story, I fear that we may be losing \ntouch with reality concerning the size of the threat we face in China \nrelative to the far greater Russian nuclear threat. Press accounts \nindicate that China may have no more than 20 land-based nuclear \nmissiles capable of reaching the United States.\n  Also, again, according to the media, as I said, Chinese nuclear \nweapons aren't kept on continual alert. Their nuclear warheads and \nliquid fuel tanks are stored separate from their missiles. Again, it \nwould take them a considerable amount of time to fuel, to arm, and to \nlaunch these weapons. That just one of these weapons would cause \nimmense pain and devastation to the United States of America ought to \nbe obvious. But, again, it is a much smaller threat than the threat of \nan accidental rogue nation, or a sabotage takeover of a Russian site \nthat could be launched with a devastating impact against the United \nStates of America and would put our people at considerable risk.\n  As of January 1999, my colleagues, with reference to this issue--I \nremember campaigning for the Senate in 1988. In 1988, you had to know \nall of this stuff. You had to know all of these in numbers, because \narms control advocates were asking you, and opponents of arms control \nwere asking. The freeze was going on. The MX missile was being debated. \nIt was a hot issue in 1988.\n  In 1999, it is not a hot issue. It is not on the radar screen. You \nhave to hunt around to find someone who cares about it and asks you \nabout it and express a concern about what I, again, consider to be the \nmost dangerous threat to the people of the United States of America.\n  I repeat that this is the only threat that could kill every single \nAmerican. Just a single Delta IV submarine that I talked about \nearlier--you put 64 100-kiloton weapons on top of 64 sites in the \nUnited States of America, and you are no longer the strongest economy \non Earth.\n  We would have considerably more, to put it mildly, than 4.2 percent \nunemployment. We would not be screaming along with an economic \nrecovery. The stock market would react, I would hazard a guess, rather \nadversely to that piece of news. There would be devastation and \ndestruction and considerable loss of life, and the United States of \nAmerica would be set back a considerable amount of time. We would not \nbe as safe and as secure as we once were, and the world, as \nconsequence, would suffer the loss of our leadership.\n  A single Delta IV submarine owned by the Russians in a very insecure \nenvironment, in my judgment, would set the U.S. back considerably.\n  I keep citing it only because I believe that we have taken nuclear \nweapons, unfortunately, off our radar screen, and we don't think about \nthis much. I say to the distinguished chairman and to the ranking \nmember, Senator Levin, and Senator Smith, who is the chairman of the \nStrategic Subcommittee, that I know each of you are very concerned \nabout this. I am talking about the general population. I would hazard a \nguess that if one of these news media outlets that does polls all the \ntime did a poll and asked the question about whether the Chinese \nnuclear threat is a greater threat to the United States of America than \nthe Russian nuclear threat, it is likely to be that a large number of \nthe people would say yes, given what they have heard recently in the \nnews.\n  China may evolve into a serious military threat to the United States \nin the future. They are unquestionably a proliferator of weapons, and \nall of us should be dismayed and angry at the lax security that we have \ndiscovered through the Cox report and other reports over the last 20 \nyears, and should move with legislation and action to tighten up and \nmake sure that we reduce that threat. But the Chinese threat is nowhere \nnear the danger that the Russian nuclear threat poses to the people of \nthe United States of America.\n  What I am attempting to do with this amendment by striking the floor \nthat we have imposed for 3 years in a row in the defense authorization \nbill--this provision that prohibits the United States from going below \nSTART I force levels until START II enters into force--is that I am \nsuggesting that this floor increases the threat to the United States of \nAmerica because we are waiting for the Russian Duma to ratify START II. \nWe are still, in my view, in the old way of thinking about how to deal \nwith nuclear weapons and how to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons \nand keep the people of the United States of America safe.\n  Let me provide a little bit of history of arms control.\n  Again, the chairman of the committee asked for some time to respond. \nEarlier, I was asked if I was going to wrap this thing up at 11:45. I \nsay to my friend from Virginia that I had much more to say on this \nmatter, and it may be that I am not able to agree to a time agreement \nand have the vote at 11:45. I would like to be able to do that. Maybe \nwhat I should try to do is abbreviate my comments and give the chairman \na chance to respond briefly, if he chooses to do so.\n  I see the chairman of the subcommittee is here. He may have some \nopposing points of view that he would like to offer. I want to give him \na chance to do that. I think it is highly unlikely that I will be able \nto agree to a vote immediately after the BRAC vote at 11:45.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are under a time agreement, are we not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. We want to give the Senator as much \nlatitude as we can. We will find such time as I believe the Senator \ndesires. I am just anxious to frame this issue, because the Senator has \ngiven a brilliant speech, as he always does. I do not say that \nfacetiously. I enjoy listening to my good friend and colleague and \nfellow naval person. But I was listening, and he is making a good \nspeech for ballistic missile defense, which is splendid. I hope that we \nare going to draw\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\non this Record for future debates on ballistic missile defense systems. \nI take note of Senator Cochran's bill now that has become law.\n  But the point I wish to make is that this provision, which the \nSenator wishes to strike, has been in five successive defensive bills. \nIt is in there in accordance with the administration's wishes to try to \nshow to Russia that we mean business about getting START II ratified. \nWere we to strike it, it is this Senator's opinion--I think it is \nshared by the Secretary of Defense, and others--it would weaken the \nefforts to get START II ratified.\n  We have here the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces. All I would ask is, if we could just have a few \nminutes to frame the debate into a focus of Senators following it, I \nthink they can come to some sort of closure in their own minds on this \nissue.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that. Why don't I take \nanother 5 or 10 minutes here.\n  Mr. WARNER. We interrupted the Senator. Would he yield for an \nadditional question on procedure?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe this debate will take longer than 35 minutes, \nand there is no time agreement on this debate. There are others who \nwant to speak on both sides.\n  I address this to the chairman, because this seems to me likely to \ntake more than 35 additional minutes. Since the debate is scheduled to \nrestart on BRAC at 11:45, I wonder whether the chairman might want to \ndelay that for perhaps 15 minutes or half an hour.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fifteen minutes. We had such great cooperation from all. \nWe have a string of Senators ready to be here at 11:45. Let's say we \nwill conclude at 12 noon; is that agreeable?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not suggesting we have a time limit of 12 noon. I am \nsuggesting if we delay the beginning of the BRAC debate until noon, \nthere is at least a chance that this debate could conclude by then. If \nit does, we could vote on this amendment immediately after BRAC.\n  I don't think the Senator from Nebraska is willing or should be \nwilling to agree to a time agreement yet because he has not heard the \ndebate on the other side.\n  I suggest the debate on BRAC begin at noon--we change the unanimous \nconsent--instead of 11:45, and hope that at least there is a chance \nthat this debate could in 35 minutes be completed but not ``bake'' that \ninto the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to accommodate our distinguished colleague. If we \ndon't proceed, I say to my copartner, in getting time agreements, we \nare likely to get this whole bill slowed down.\n  I wonder if we could just enter into a time agreement to debate on \nthis amendment, that it would conclude at 12 noon.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would very much like to accommodate and do that, but my \nproblem is----\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me help. The distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee says 10 minutes; I may take 2 minutes. That is 12 minutes. \nThe Senator would have a full half hour left.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before the Senator from Nebraska answers, if he yields, I \nwill speak for perhaps 5 or 10 minutes on the subject. I know the \nDemocratic leader wants to speak on this amendment, I believe, if \npossible, around 11:30. There may be others, too. We ought to find out \nif there are others before any such agreement is propounded.\n  Mr. KERREY. Again, I appreciate very much what the chairman is trying \nto do. I certainly have no intent to sit out here forever talking. \nEventually I will agree to a time agreement. I am not willing to do \nthat at the moment. I am beginning to lay out a case that has not been \nlaid out before.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will continue with the debate and hope we can begin to \nbring this thing to some proportion of closure. We will take a \nrelatively short time on our side, because it is a bill provision; the \nSenator is on a motion to strike. It is very clear what we are trying \nto do on this side, to help this administration get ratification, help \nAmerica get ratification of START II.\n  That is the sole purpose for this provision. It has been in there 5 \nyears for that purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again I am not trying to make an argument \nhere for or against strategic defense. I will work with Senator Cochran \nto try to fashion some assistance to bring additional Democrats. I \nsupported what Senator Cochran was trying to do.\n  The problem is, missile defense is not prepared today. The problem \nis, we don't have missile defense today. We are not sure when we will \nhave it. I don't want to get into necessarily arguing that. I am saying \nthat within a matter of hours it is possible for the United States of \nAmerica to suffer an attack the likes of which I think very few people \nare imagining.\n  It is a real threat. It is not an imaginary threat. It is a real \nthreat, and it is a threat that is getting larger, not a threat that is \ngetting smaller. It is not the old threat. The old threat--and I \nappreciate what I think the administration's stated policy says. They \nprefer repealing the bill's general provisions that maintain this \nprohibition first enacted in 1998, but maybe the administration \nsupports this amendment and maybe they don't support the amendment.\n  I believe this floor makes it less likely that we will consider an \nalternative to arms control as a method to reduce this threat. I am \nwilling to look at alternatives such as star wars for which I voted. \nThe strategic defense system is not in place today. I don't know when \nit will be in place.\n  In the meantime, the capacity to control Russia's nuclear system is \ndeclining and putting more and more Americans at risk as a consequence.\n  This is the third year, as I understand it, that this provision has \nbeen here.\n  Let me talk about strategic arms reduction. It has been the leading \nedge of our effort to try to reduce the threat. Back in the cold war, \nit was considered to be the only way that we will do it. I am not going \nto go through all the details of the history, but the Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty was signed between the United States and the Soviet \nUnion, START I, in 1991 and entered into force in 1994. It commits both \nsides to reducing their overall force level to 6,000 deployable \nwarheads by December of 2001. Both sides are well on the way to meeting \nthis deadline. The START II treaty signed in January 1993 and requires \nboth the United States and Russia to deploy no more than 3,500 warheads \nby no later than December of 2007. The Senate ratified START II in \n1996, but the Russian Duma has yet to take up the treaty.\n  Section 1041 of this authorization bill extends for another year the \nlimitation on retirement or dismantlement of strategic nuclear weapon \nsystems until the START II treaty enters into effect. Let me put this \nanother way: The bill we are debating allows a foreign legislative body \nthe final say on U.S. nuclear force levels. I do not believe this is \nhow we should set our defense policies. Our military decisions should \nbe based solely on what we need to protect and maintain our national \nsecurity interests.\n  While I understand this provision was originally intended to \nencourage Russian ratification of START II, I think it is time to begin \nto rethink our strategy. For the foreseeable future, START II is dead. \nWe can all make the case that the Duma should have acted, that \nratification was more in their interests than in ours, or that the \nreason it failed was domestic Russian politics. All that is true. But \nwe now need to begin to ask ourselves if the current policy of waiting \nfor Russian action on START II is the best way to confront the dangers \npresented by the Russian nuclear arsenal.\n  I believe the answer is emphatically no. The provision in this bill I \nam trying to strike is forcing the United States to maintain an \nunnecessarily large nuclear arsenal. By keeping more weapons than we \nneed to defend ourselves, we are encouraging the Russians to keep more \nweapons than they can control. That is the heart of the argument that I \nam making.\n  We are keeping more in our arsenal than we need, and as a \nconsequence, forcing the Russians to keep more in their arsenal than \nthey can control, increasing the risk of an accidental launch, a rogue \nnation launch, or a launch that comes as a consequence of an act of \nsabotage.\n  The determinant of adequate U.S. force levels should be left up to \nthe men and women who are in charge of protecting the United States. \nWhile Pentagon officials have said they have\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\nno plans to go below START I levels during fiscal year 2000, they have \nclearly stated their preference for lifting these artificial \nrestrictions. In the recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the current commander in chief of the Strategic Command, \nAdm. Richard Mies, said:\n\n       We believe that we ought to report to you on an annual \n     basis on exactly what we plan to do, but we would prefer not \n     to have the specific mandating of the force levels by \n     delivery systems.\n\n  Our Armed Forces are more than capable of protecting U.S. national \nsecurity with significantly fewer strategic nuclear weapons. In fact, \nGen. Eugene Habiger, former commander of STRATCOM, said:  ``There is no \nreason to stay at the START I level from a military perspective.'' Our \nnuclear policy has become completely detached from the military \nrequirements of defending America, and is now being used simply as a \nbargaining chip with Russian politicians.\n\n  Ironically, this is occurring at a time in which the Russian military \nis having problems maintaining its current force levels. The Russians \nforesee a time, in the near future, when drastic cuts will have to be \nmade. In fact, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has said publicly \nhe sees the future Russian strategic nuclear arsenal in terms of \nhundreds, not thousands, of warheads. There are even some U.S. analysts \nwho have calculated within 10 to 15 years Russia will be able to \nmaintain a force no longer than 200 warheads.\n  I believe it is clearly in the Russian interest to work with the \nUnited States to achieve reciprocal reductions in forces, and I am \ndisappointed the Russian Duma has chosen domestic politics over its \nbest interests. However, it is just as clear that it remains in our \ninterests to work with Russia to find new ways to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons in a parallel, reciprocal, and verifiable manner.\n  We have a historical precedent to show that an adjustment in our \nnuclear forces, based solely on an evaluation of our defense needs, can \nhelp achieve the goal of reducing nuclear dangers. There is a precedent \nfor this. On September 27, 1991, then President George Bush announced a \nseries of sweeping changes to our nuclear force posture. After \nassessing our national security needs, Bush ordered all strategic \nbombers to stand down from their alert status, he de-altered all ICBMs \nscheduled for deactivation under START I, and he canceled several \nstrategic weapons development programs.\n  On October 5--just one week later--President Gorbachev responded with \nreciprocal reductions in the Soviet arsenal.\n  President Bush acted, not out of altruism, but because it increased \nU.S. national security. In his announcement, he said:\n\n       If we and the Soviet leaders take the right steps--some on \n     our own, some on their own, some together--we can \n     dramatically shrink the arsenal of the world's nuclear \n     weapons. We can more effectively discourage the spread of \n     nuclear weapons. We can rely more on defensive measures in \n     our strategic relationship. We can enhance stability, and \n     actually reduce the risk of nuclear war. How is the time \n     to seize this opportunity.\n\n  I believe the same is true today in 1999. The longer we wait to act--\nthe more years in which we extend this legislative restriction--the \nmore likely it is one of these weapons will fall into the hands of a \nperson willing to use it to kill American citizens.\n  In addition to endangering the safety of the American people, our \ncontinued insistence on staying at START I levels is costing the \nAmerican taxpayer. They are paying more to be less safe.\n  Estimates on the annual cost of maintaining our nuclear arsenal vary \nwidely. The Pentagon contends the total cost is in the neighborhood of \n$15 billion a year. A more inclusive figure would put the cost in the \narea of $20 to $25 billion. This represents a significant portion of \nour yearly national security spending. For now, it continues to be \nnecessary to maintain an effective, reliable nuclear force--a force \ncapable of deterring a wide array of potential adversaries.\n  But if, as our military leaders have indicated, we can maintain that \ndeterrent capability at much lower force levels, I am concerned we are \nwasting precious budgetary resources. The Congressional Budget Office \nrecently conducted a study in which it found we could have between \n$12.7 billion and $20.9 billion over the next ten years by reducing \nU.S. nuclear delivery systems within the overall limits of START II. \nBoth the Pentagon and the Armed Services Committee have already \nrecognized that potential savings exist in this area. The bill before \nus allows the Defense Department to decrease the number of Trident \nSubmarines from 18 to 14--producing a significant cost savings in our \ndeterrent.\n  I am sure further savings could be realized with further cuts. I am \ncertain our military has the ability to determine the proper formula in \nwhich we can reduce our nuclear arsenal, save money, and still maintain \na healthy triad of delivery systems that will maintain our deterrent \ncapabilities. I am confident much of this planning has already \noccurred.\n  I am also confident the distinguished members of the Armed Services \nCommittee would be able to find ways in which to redirect these savings \ninto other defense priorities such as preventing the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, combating terrorism and narco-trafficking, \nor improving the readiness of our conventional forces to confront the \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n\n  My amendment does not mandate any reductions in the U.S. strategic \nnuclear arsenal. Rather, it simply eliminates the provision in this \nbill requiring us to maintain our forces at START I levels--a level \nthat is unnecessarily high.\n  The greatest danger facing the American people today is Russian \nnuclear weapons. We have been given a moment in history to reduce this \nthreat. Rather than acting on this opportunity, we are preparing once \nagain to tie our own hands. The rapid pace of change in Russia and \naround the world will not wait for us in the United States Senate to \ndebate for another year whether or not to seize this opportunity. We \nknow what our relationship with Russia is today, We can predict, but we \ncannot know what it will be like in a year, or two, or ten. \nCircumstances may never again be this favorable for reducing the threat \nposed by nuclear weapons. We must act. If we do not, history may judge \nus harshly for our failure.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is here, the \nchairman of the subcommittee. I think what I will do is yield the floor \nand allow my friend to speak for a while, and listen to what is likely \nto be his considered and well-spoken words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I \nindicated I am more than happy to have the Senator from Nebraska finish \nhis remarks, but if he chooses to have me proceed now, I will be happy \nto do that.\n  Section 1041 of this bill, which is in question here in the amendment \nof Senator Kerrey, does prohibit the retirement of certain strategic \ndelivery systems unless START II enters into force. The amendment by \nthe Senator from Nebraska just strikes that entire section, section \n1041.\n  For the last several years, the Defense Authorization Act has \nincluded a provision limiting the retirement of strategic delivery \nsystems. Recently, it has specifically prohibited reductions below 18 \nTrident submarines, 500 Minuteman III ICBMs, 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs, and \n71 B-52s. This year the provision has been modified to allow the Navy \nto reduce the number of Trident submarines from 18 to 14. This change \nwas made after close consultation with U.S. Strategic Command, the \nNavy, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. On April 14, 1999, \nthe Strategic Subcommittee conducted a hearing on this matter. We did \nagree to reduce the number of Tridents from 18 to 14, with my support.\n  The overall intent of the provision is to send a signal to Russia, \nthat if they want the benefits of START II, then they ought to ratify \nthe treaty. I think this is where I part ways, respectfully, with my \ncolleague. This really is a unilateral implementation of START II--or \nto make even deeper reductions that would fundamentally undermine the \narms control process and our national security.\n  I believe I am correct, the Senator supported START II. If he is \ngoing to make unilateral reductions as part of our policy, I do not \nthink it leaves much incentive for the Russian side to do what they \nhave to do to get to START II.\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n  But section 1041 is a very flexible provision. Since it must be \nrenewed each year, there is ample opportunity to take into \nconsideration proposals by the administration and to make our force \nstructure adjustments as necessary.\n  This was demonstrated this year in the way the Armed Services \nCommittee responded to the Navy's proposal, which was to retire four of \nthe oldest Trident submarines.\n  With all due respect, the adoption of the Senator's amendment I \nbelieve could be interpreted as a sign that Congress no longer supports \nthe policy of remaining at START I levels until START II enters into \nforce. It seems to me the Senator is advocating that explicitly, but I \ncould be wrong. I note that the administration does not support such a \nchange in policy and, indeed, the administration's budget request fully \nfunds the forces at the levels specified in the section in question \nthat the Senator wishes to strike, section 1041.\n  The provision does not preclude the administration from making any \nchanges in U.S. force structure that it is currently planning to make. \nSection 1041 does not require the administration to retain any \nstrategic delivery system that it otherwise would retire. It is clear \nthat the principal objective of this amendment is to encourage \nunilateral arms reductions outside the framework of existing arms \ncontrol agreements.\n  My concern is this is a very dramatic departure from existing U.S. \npolicy. Essentially, this approach would amount to an abandonment of, \nor certainly a significant deviation from, the formal arms control \nprocess.\n  I may support a change in U.S. policy that would base our strategic \nforce posture on a unilateral definition of U.S. military requirements \nrather than on the arms control framework, but I believe that as long \nas formal arms control agreements govern our force posture, we ought to \nadhere to a policy of not unilaterally implementing such agreements.\n  Also, just as a bit of a side discussion here, the issue of what has \nhappened now with China may also sound an alarm bell that these \nagreements with the Russians--were the Soviets, now the Russians--may \nnot be the major issue before us if things keep going.\n  One has to remember that an agreement, START I, START II agreements \nwith the then Soviets, now Russians, for arms control reductions \nbetween two countries in a bilateral world, could very well now expand \nto something beyond just the bilateral agreements with the Russians to \nthe Chinese and perhaps to Syria and Libya and even Iran, or some other \nnice countries out there that are now, thanks to the Chinese, going to \nbe receiving a lot of our secrets, if you will, nuclear weapons. That \nfurthers the case for not unilaterally reducing these systems without \nthe Russians agreeing first.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just spoke with Senator Kerrey. I know he \nwill want to say something in response to Senator Smith and what I will \nhave to say. I will take my 5 minutes right now, with his indulgence.\n  I appreciate the spirit of his amendment. In fact, I just advised \nSenator Kerrey I regretted very much having to speak in opposition to \nhis amendment because I admire him as vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee on which I sit. We agree on a great many things. In fact, we \nare introducing legislation as cosponsors today on another matter.\n  But on this matter, I do differ with his approach because it to me \nreflects the approach to defense preparedness, to national security, \nthat has been characterized, as Charles Krauthammer has said, as \n``peace through paper'' rather than peace through strength, which \nRonald Reagan made popular and which we think helped to win the cold \nwar--the notion, in other words, that treaties should define what the \nUnited States of America does to provide for its defense rather than \nthe United States deciding what it must do to provide for its defense \nand then seek through treaties to limit what other countries might do \nand what we might do in the future as a part of that but following what \nour initial determination is with respect to necessities for our \nnational security.\n  This is true with respect to the START I and START II levels of \nnuclear weaponry, our strategic deterrents. The START I levels are \nwhere we are right now, and historically the administration and the \nCongress have taken the view that we need to maintain our START I \nlevels as long as that is the prevailing status of treaties, and that \nis precisely where we are today.\n  START II has not been ratified by the Russian Duma, and until it is \nand until Russia begins to comply with its obligations under START II \nto bring the number of warheads permitted under START I down to levels \nauthorized by START II, we have viewed it important not to unilaterally \nbring our levels from START I down to START II, because holding out the \npossibility that we would stay at START I has been an effective way for \nus to deal with the Russians.\n  Robert Bell, speaking for the administration, has testified that it \nhas been helpful for us to let the Russians know that we are going to \nmaintain our forces at the current levels. While we are willing to \nreduce them to START II levels, it is going to require concomitant \naction by the Russians for us to do that. In other words, if the \nRussians are prepared to go from START I down to START II, then the \nUnited States will be prepared to do that. But until then, we should \nnot be taking the action unilaterally.\n  As a matter of fact, I was going to offer an amendment to this bill \nwhich would ensure that our Trident forces would not be reduced, \nbecause that is also permitted under this bill. The Trident submarine \nforces are the most robust leg of our triad of strategic deterrence \nbecause they are the most secure. Our submarines are nearly impossible \nto track, so they are clearly the most survivable leg of the triad. The \nmajority of our boats in the fleet can carry the D-5 missile, the most \nadvanced missile we have.\n  What I have focused on here is trying to make sure that our country \nmaintains our START I level capability and that we do not begin to \nerode that, simply because it is expensive to do as long as Russia is \nnot willing to reach those same levels.\n  An example of why this is important is that if we were to reduce the \nTrident force, for example, we would be relying upon the B-52s--as a \nmatter of fact, our plan, and I hope our American citizens appreciate \nthat the current defense plan is to use an 80-year-old B-52 bomber into \nthe future as part of the triad for our nuclear deterrence. That is \nrelying upon a very old and not very survivable system, which is why I \nthink we have to maintain the Trident system.\n  Our vulnerable land-based ICBMs are the other leg, and they are also \nquite vulnerable to attack. We ought to be maintaining rather than \ngiving up our Trident forces.\n  Were it not for arms control considerations and a desire for the \nUnited States to implement the START II agreement that has not even \nbeen ratified by the Russian Duma, I do not think we would be taking \nthe step that is being suggested by the Armed Services Committee today \nand the even larger or further step that Senator Kerrey takes to have \nit apply to all of our strategic forces.\n  I have been concerned for a long time about the administration's \ndesire to protect our Nation's security primarily by relying on arms \ncontrol measures, and I said this has been described by Charles \nKrauthammer as ``peace through paper.'' Let me use the words of the \nadministration. Under Secretary of State John Holum explained the \nadministration philosophy in 1994. This is a revealing explanation. He \nsaid:\n\n       The Clinton administration's policy aims to protect us \n     first and foremost through arms control--by working hard to \n     prevent new threats--and second, by legally pursuing \n     development of theater defenses for those cases where arms \n     control is not yet successful.\n\n  That is exactly backward. First, you develop your security forces, \nand then, to the extent that you can do so, you cut back on those \nthrough arms control treaties that are agreed to and implemented by the \nother side. But what you do not do is start out by saying arms control \nis going to drive your development and deployment of national security \nmeasures. It is exactly backward.\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\n  Arms control is not a new idea. In 1139, the Catholic church tried to \nban the crossbow. Like a lot of other well-intentioned arms control \nmeasures, it did not work. The Kellogg-Briand treaty--I know the \nSenator from Virginia, the distinguished, esteemed chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, is not quite old enough to remember that--in \n1929 outlawed war.\n  Well, it does not work. Peace through strength works. Then you do \nwhat you can with arms control.\n  The main point I want to make is that our defense planning should \nproceed on the basis of assessing the threat, evaluating alternative \nmeans to defeat the threat, and funding the requisite weapons systems \nand force structure. We should not permit arms control agreements to \ndrive our defense programs and our force structure. It is particularly \ntrue with respect to the START II treaty which this Senate ratified in \nDecember of 1995. Despite our action, the Russian Duma has refused to \ntake action on it. The likelihood it will do so is highly uncertain. \nSTART II has become a political liability in Russia in spite of its \nadvantages to them.\n  As I said before, I would apply this not only to the amendment \noffered by Senator Kerrey but also to the language in the Senate bill \nwhich would permit the administration to withdraw our nuclear Trident \nforce down to 14 boats. I quoted Robert Bell who stated that the \nprovisions in law requiring the maintenance of the U.S. forces at START \nI levels are helpful in convincing the Russians that the only way that \nU.S. force levels will decline is if the Russian Duma ratified START \nII. While I understand he is going to be taking a new position soon, \nBell is the President's Special Assistant for Arms Control and Defense \nPolicy.\n  I was going to offer an amendment to highlight my concern about a \nprovision of the Defense authorization bill that I believe undermines \nthe strength of America's strategic nuclear deterrent. The specific \nprovision that I am concerned about is paragraph (2) of section 1041 of \nthe bill, which would allow the Clinton administration to reduce the \nnumber of Trident nuclear submarines operated by the U.S. Navy from 18 \nto 14 boats. Unfortunately, I fear the acceptance of this cut by the \nDefense Department was driven primarily by a desire to conform to \nprospective arms control agreements rather than a hard-nosed assessment \nof the best way to respond to current threats, and the best means of \ncompelling Russia to meet its commitments to reduce its nuclear \narsenal.\n  The Trident force, armed with nuclear-tipped submarine-launched \nballistic missiles, forms a critical part of the United States nuclear \ntriad, which also includes long-range bombers and land-based \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. When deployed at sea, Trident \nsubmarines are nearly impossible to track, making them most survivable \nleg of our nuclear triad. Furthermore, the majority of the boats in our \nTrident fleet carry America's most modern missile, the D-5, and our \nmost advanced nuclear warhead, the W88.\n  The bill before the Senate calls for the maintenance of U.S. nuclear \nforces at a level that closely approaches the limits imposed by the \nSTART I treaty. The bill, however, allows the Administration to reduce \nthe number of Trident submarines and instead to rely more heavily on \nthe current fleet of aging B-52 bombers and more vulnerable land-based \nICBMs to maintain U.S. nuclear forces at START I levels.\n  I do not believe a reasonable person could argue that placing greater \nreliance on the venerable fleet of B-52 bombers, which are approaching \none half century old, instead of maintaining the current force of \nTrident submarines would enhance the effectiveness and survivability of \nthe U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent. Were it not for arms control \nconsiderations and a desire to implement the START-2 agreement that has \nnot even been ratified by our Russian treaty partners, I do not believe \nwe would be taking this step.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been concerned for some time \nabout the Clinton administration's desire to protect our nation's \nsecurity primarily by relying on arms control measures in a philosophy \nthat Charles Krauthammer aptly describes as ``Peace thru Paper.'' Under \nSecretary of State John Holum explained this philosophy during a speech \nin 1994, stating,\n\n       The Clinton Administration's policy aims to protect us \n     first and foremost through arms control--by working hard to \n     prevent new threats--and second, by legally pursuing the \n     development of theater defenses for those cases where arms \n     control is not yet successful.\n\n  Of course, as I said before, arms control is not a new idea. After \nall, in the year 1139, the Catholic Church tried to ban the crossbow. \nLike so many other well intentioned arms control measures, this one was \ndoomed to failure from the start. And who can forget the Kellogg-Briand \ntreaty, ratified by the U.S. in 1929, that outlawed war as an \ninstrument of national policy. This agreement and others spawned in its \nwake left the United States and Britain unable to deter and unprepared \nto fight World War II. Yet despite these and many other notable \nfailures, the Clinton administration still looks to arms control as the \nbest way to safeguard our security.\n  The main point that I want to make is that our defense planning \nshould proceed on the basis of assessing the threat, evaluating \nalternative means to deter and defeat the threat, and funding the \nrequisite weapons systems and force structures. We should not permit \narms control agreements to drive our defense programs and force \nstructure. This is particularly true with respect to the START II \ntreaty, which the Senate ratified in December, 1995. Despite the \nSenate's action, the Russian Duma has refused to take action on the \naccord. The likelihood that it will do so is highly uncertain. START II \nhas become a political liability in Russia in spite of its advantages \nto them.\n  Adherence to START I warhead limits, as called for by the Senate in \nits Resolution of Ratification for the START II treaty, and retention \nof the Trident fleet at 18 boats, gives us the best leverage we are \nlikely to have to persuade Russia to move toward ratification and \nimplementation. And the Clinton administration agrees with this point. \nDuring a briefing for Senate staff in January, the President's Special \nAssistant for Arms Control and Defense Policy, Robert Bell stated that \nthe provisions in law requiring the maintenance of U.S. forces at START \nI levels are helpful in convincing the Russians that the only way U.S. \nforce levels will decline is if the Duma ratifies START II.\n\n  The U.S. repeatedly purchased START II ratification with aid or with \nconcessions permitting Russia non-compliance with other arms control \nagreements or with unilateral limits on our own defense programs. In \nfact, Russia seems to be moving even further from the arms control \nframework so dear to this administration. Russian leaders have recently \nspoken of reconstituting Russia's tactical nuclear forces, potentially \nreversing moves that the U.S. and Russia undertook during the Bush \nadministration. On April 30th of this year, the Washington Times \nreported that Russia's Security Council ordered its military to draw up \nplans for the development and use of tactical nuclear weapons in what \nmay be a response to NATO's heightened profile due to its involvement \nin Kosovo. Russia also continues to channel a high proportion of its \ndeclining military budget into its strategic nuclear forces and now \nplaces greater reliance on nuclear forces in its military doctrine. And \nfurthermore, Russia appears to be conducting tests on new nuclear \nweapons. As the Washington Post reported on January 24th of this year, \n``Three small underground nuclear tests Russia conducted last fall have \nprompted some government intelligence analysts to suggest that Moscow \nmay be trying to design a new generation of tactical nuclear weapons.''\n  Nor is Russia the only concern. China is also modernizing its \nstrategic nuclear forces with the benefit of warhead designs stolen \nfrom our nuclear labs and missile technology sold by the Clinton \nadministration. The Cox committee had concluded that these thefts \nenabled China to design, develop, and successfully test modern \nstrategic nuclear weapons and that these designs will make it possible \nto develop multiple independent reentry vehicles or MIRV warheads for \ntheir missiles. As the summary of the Cox committee report notes, ``The \nPeople's Republic of China has stolen design information on the United \nStates' most advanced thermonuclear warheads. Specifically, the\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\nW-88 (Trident D-5 SLBM); W-87 (Peacekeeper ICBM); W-78 (Minuteman III, \nMark 12A, ICBM); W-76 (Trident C-4 SLBM); W-70 (Lance SRBM); W-62 \n(Minuteman III ICBM); W-56 (Minuteman II ICBM). These thefts, primarily \nfrom our national laboratories, began in the 1970s, continued in the \n1980s and 1990s and almost certainly continue today.'' The Cox report \nconcludes by saying, ``These thefts enabled the PRC to design, develop \nand successfully test modern strategic nuclear weapons.''\n  Furthermore, I would point out to my colleagues that rogue states and \ngangster regimes are also working hard on nuclear weapons and the means \nto deliver them. As the Rumsfeld Commission noted last year, the \nstrategic threat to the U.S. from rogue nations is growing rapidly. And \none need only look at last summer's launch of a North Korean missile \nthat overflew Japan that has sufficient range to reach the United \nStates for validation of the Rumsfeld Commission's conclusions.\n  Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to retain the Trident \nfleet at 18 boats. We should remember that the world remains a \ndangerous place and should size our nuclear forces accordingly. As I \nhave outlined before, the Trident fleet is vital to the maintenance of \nour strategic nuclear deterrent. This is too important a step to be \nentrusted to an administration in thrall to its bankrupt Russia policy \nand its naive approach to arms control.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 357, strike line 23 and all that follows \n     through page 358, line 4, and insert the following:\n       (b) Minimum Level for B-52H Bomber Aircraft.--Subsection \n     (a)(1) of such section is amended by striking ``71'' and \n     inserting ``76''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Again, I fully respect the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee and what he is attempting to accomplish. It is my view you \nfirst build your defense structure, and you stick with it until you see \nsigns that the potential adversary has reduced his force structure in a \ncompetent way. Until you do that, you are better off keeping what you \nhave in place rather than unilaterally giving it away.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me say that although we reach \ndifferent conclusions, I completely agree with the Senator from \nArizona. I do not think we should tie our defense policies to arms \ncontrol agreements. I do not think we should do anything other than \nassess the threat and then try to put a force structure together that \nmeets that threat, that keeps that threat as low as is possible. We \nshould not cut corners. We should not get tied up in ideological knots.\n  We should decide what is necessary to keep Americans safe. I do think \nthat it is much more likely that will occur if the U.S. military is as \nstrong as we can possibly make it. There are significant new threats in \nthe world that need to be met. I support the budget that has been \nproposed here.\n  I supported earlier the rampup in pay and other benefits. I think all \nthat needs to be done. I think we have less in our intel budget than is \nnecessary to both collect and analyze and disseminate the information \nto our warfighters and national policymakers.\n  What we are doing, as I see it, with this proposal is saying we are \nnot going to do anything that might be in our interest, that might keep \nour country safer, because the Russians have not ratified START II. We \nare letting the Russians decide what our force structure is going to \nbe.\n  We have been told by former General Habiger, who was the head of \nSTRATCOM, that he thinks the United States of America will be safer and \nmore secure if we went below START I levels. That is his assessment. He \ndid not care what the Russians think about that. He thinks America \nwould be safer and more secure if we did.\n\n  I am not going to read all through it. I will do it later because I \nsee the distinguished Democratic leader is here and would like to make \nsome comments. I am going to read some things that ought to give \nAmericans a great deal of concern about this ``loose nuke'' issue where \nthe Russians are experiencing a deterioration in their capacity to \ncontrol their nuclear weapons, and we are requiring them to be not only \nat a higher level than they need but we are requiring ourselves to be \nat a higher level than we need to be as a consequence of saying we are \nnot going to do anything until the START II Treaty is ratified.\n  Let me set the record clear about the administration's position.\n  Senator Levin, for the record, in the Armed Services Committee, on \nthe 3rd of February, asked General Shelton:\n\n       Would you oppose inclusion of a provision in the Fiscal \n     Year 2000 Defense Authorization Act mandating strategic force \n     structure levels--specific numbers of Trident Submarines, \n     Peacekeeper Missiles and B-52 bombers?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Yes, I would definitely oppose inclusion of [that].\n\n  And a further statement of the administration about their attitude \ntowards the defense authorization bill said:\n\n       The Administration [would] appreciate the bill's \n     endorsement of our plan to reduce the Trident submarine force \n     from 18 to 14\n     boats. . . .\n\n  But they go on to say:\n\n       [W]e prefer repealing the bill's general provision that \n     maintains the prohibition, first enacted in the FY 1998 \n     Defense Authorization Act, against obligating funds to retire \n     or dismantle any other strategic nuclear delivery system \n     below specified levels unless START II enters into force. The \n     Administration believes this provision would unnecessarily \n     restrict the President's national security authority and \n     ability to structure the most capable, cost-effective force \n     possible.\n\n  They have announced no intent to go below START I levels, but they \nhave indicated they prefer not to have this prohibition in there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, we have a \nprevious order at this time to begin debate on amendment No. 393.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak on \nthe Kerrey amendment. Did the Senator from Nebraska want additional \ntime as well?\n  Mr. KERREY. After the other amendment is disposed of, we will come \nback to it, and I will have time then.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If it would be appropriate, I ask unanimous consent to \naddress the Kerrey amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska for his advocacy and his leadership on this issue. This is \nprobably one of the most important debates that we are going to have \nthis year with regard to nuclear proliferation. This amendment could be \none of the most important amendments that we will have the opportunity \nto vote on this year with regard to nuclear proliferation. So his \nadvocacy of this issue and this amendment is greatly appreciated. I am \nvery impressed with his command of the facts as we consider its \nadvocacy this morning.\n  Much of the current debate on national security issues these past \nseveral weeks has focused on two issues, as we all know: Kosovo and the \nalleged Chinese espionage of our national weapons laboratories. That \nconcentration is very understandable.\n  In the first instance, the courageous men and women who make up \nAmerica's military forces are risking their lives daily in the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia to reverse the genocidal policies practiced by \nthat country's leader. That is a just cause.\n  For the sake of hundreds of thousands of refugees made homeless by \nMilosevic's reign of terror, as well as the future of NATO, we simply \ncannot afford to fail.\n  As for the safety of our nuclear secrets, this, too, is an issue of \nvital national security. It is alleged that for the last two decades \nthe Chinese Government has systematically engaged in efforts to gain \naccess to some of our most important nuclear weapons scientists and the \nknowledge they possess.\n  Although all agree that classified information has fallen into the \nhands of the Chinese Government, it certainly\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\nremains unclear who is involved and exactly how much of our national \nsecurity suffered as a result of these activities. The administration, \nthe Congress, and law enforcement agencies are vigorously exploring \nanswers to these troubling questions.\n  But as important as these issues are, as I noted just a moment ago, I \nsubmit there is an issue of equal or greater importance to America's \nimmediate and long-term national security interests, and this amendment \naddresses it. The issue is the U.S.-Russia relationship and the fate of \ntens of thousands of nuclear weapons, and hundreds of tons of nuclear \nweapons material possessed by each side.\n  The Kerrey amendment recognizes the importance of that relationship. \nThe Kerrey amendment proposes that the United States take a small step \nto improve this relationship by acknowledging that the Russian nuclear \narsenal is shrinking, and adopting the view of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff that our security will not be jeopardized if we do the same.\n  I strongly support this amendment and ask my colleagues to join me.\n  It is difficult to point to a period of time since the end of the \ncold war when relations between the United States and Russia have been \nunder greater stress. Protests and public opinion polls in Russia \ndemonstrate that anti-American feeling is on the rise in that country. \nThe tension in this critical relationship has grown as a result of both \nRussia's internal economic and political troubles and actions by this \nGovernment.\n  At the very time the U.S.-Russia relationship is under unprecedented \nstress, the need to work with Russians to reduce the threat posed by \nnuclear weapons and the spread of nuclear weapons material and \nexpertise has never been greater.\n  Nearly a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States \nand Russia still possess roughly 12,000 strategic nuclear weapons, \nthousands of tactical nuclear weapons, and hundreds of tons of nuclear \nweapons material. Even more alarming, both sides keep the majority of \ntheir strategic nuclear weapons on a high level of alert--something I \naddressed in past comments and, for the life of me, cannot understand.\n  And reports are growing that Russia's government lacks the resources \nto properly maintain and control its nuclear weapons, nuclear \nmaterials, and nuclear know-how. Consider these recent events.\n  In September of 1998, roughly 47,000 nuclear workers protested at \nvarious locations around Russia over the Atomic Energy Ministry's \nfailure to provide them their wages for several months. Russian Atomic \nEnergy Minister Adamov told the workers that the government owed the \nministry over $170 million and had not provided a single ruble in two \nmonths.\n  Again late last year, Russian radio reported that the mayor of \nKrasnoyarsk-45, one of Russia's closed nuclear cities, where enough \nnuclear material to build thousands of bombs is stored, warned that \nunless urgent action was taken, a social explosion in the city was \nunavoidable.\n  More recently, guards at nuclear facilities reportedly left their \nposts to forage for food. Others have been reluctant to patrol facility \nperimeters because they did not have winter uniforms to keep them warm \non patrol.\n  At some nuclear facilities, entire security systems--alarms, \nsurveillance cameras, and portal monitors--have been shut down because \nthe facilities' electricity was cut off for non-payment of bills.\n  According to recent testimony by senior Pentagon officials and \nstatements by senior Russian defense officials, Russia's nuclear \nstockpile is faring no better than the workers hired to maintain and \nguard it. According to Assistant Secretary of Defense Ted Warner, \nRussia's force of roughly 6,000-7,000 strategic nuclear weapons will be \ndramatically reduced regardless of whether Russia ratifies START II.\n  By 2005, according to Warner, ``[Russia] will be hard pressed to keep \na force of about 3,500 weapons * * * and by about the year 2010, they \nwill be hard pressed to even meet a level of about 1,500 weapons.'' \nRussian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev recently stated that Russia is \n``likely to have no more than 500 deployed strategic warheads by 2012 \nfor economic reasons.'' Finally, in this weekend's newspapers comes the \nlatest evidence of Russia's nuclear troubles. Under the headline, \n``Russia Faces `New Chernobyl' Disaster,'' the London Sunday Telegraph \nreports,\n\n       What a Russian energy minister has called a Chernobyl in \n     slow motion is unfolding in [Russia's] far north where \n     nuclear submarines are falling to pieces at their moorings \n     and a decaying nuclear power station has been refused \n     European Commission aid to buy vital safety equipment.\n\n  According to the Russian chief engineer at the nuclear plant, ``We \nare in despair.''\n  Mr. President, while U.S.-Russia relations approach their nadir and \nRussia struggles to keep the lid on its nuclear forces and workers, \nwhat has been the response of the majority of the United States Senate?\n  Unfortunately, for the last several years, a majority of the Senate \nopted to legally prohibit the United States government from responding \nby making modest reductions in our forces. A majority in the Senate has \nprevented the U.S. government from reducing our nuclear forces below \nthe START I level until Russia has ratified START II. This majority has \nchosen to include a similar provision in this year's defense \nauthorization. This provision further damages U.S.-Russia relations, \nlocks us in at nuclear weapons levels not needed for our security, and \ndrains much-needed resources away from higher priority defense \nprograms. Senator Kerrey's amendment wisely strikes this provision.\n  As I noted earlier, our relationship with the Russian government and \nRussian people is at a low point. Russians fail to understand our \nactions on several fronts--from NATO enlargement to ballistic missile \ndefense. As Russians look at the inevitable decay of their own \nstrategic nuclear forces, they question why the United States insists \non holding firm at weapons levels Russia can never hope to match, let \nalone exceed.\n  As for whether mandating by law that we retain 6,000 strategic \nweapons, our senior military leaders--current and former--have \ndecisively expressed their opinions on this issue. In testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year, General Hugh \nShelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and this country's \nsenior military leader, opposed just such a requirement. According to \nGeneral Shelton, ``I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language \nthat mandates specific force levels.'' General Eugene Habiger, former \nchief of all U.S. strategic nuclear forces, agreed with General Shelton \nand went farther. General Habiger stated, ``There is no need to stay at \nthe START I level from a military perspective.''\n  The Republican decision to keep our strategic weapons levels at an \nartificially high level also has budgetary ramifications. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that keeping U.S. strategic \nnuclear weapons totals at START I levels will cost the Defense \nDepartment $570 million in FY2000 and nearly $13 billion over the next \n10 years. Resources are incredibly scarce, both in the Defense \nDepartment and in other areas of the government. We should spend every \nnickel necessary to ensure a strong defense. But we shouldn't spend a \nnickel on weapons systems the military tell us they do not need.\n  For all of these reasons, I oppose the provision in the underlying \nbill. I support Senator Kerrey's amendment to strike this provision and \nrestore a modicum of sanity to an increasingly troubled state of \naffairs. I ask my colleagues to do right by this important \nrelationship, by our senior military leaders, and by the U.S. taxpayers \nwho foot the bill for all we do. I ask for our colleagues' support on \nthe Kerrey amendment. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 393\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Under the previous order, debate \nwill now begin on amendment 393.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Warner may wish \nto speak on the Kerrey amendment for perhaps 5 minutes before we move \nto the BRAC amendment. If so, we are trying to reach Senator--Mr. \nPresident, I withdraw that. Are we now on the BRAC amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are now on the BRAC amendment No. 393.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Michigan.\n  I rise today as a strong supporter and original co-sponsor of the \namendment offered by my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Levin, \nto consolidate our defense infrastructure and authorize an additional \nround of base closures.\n  For months, Pentagon officials, military leaders and key Members of \nthe House and Senate have painted a picture of an American military \nforce seriously compromised by years of declining or flat-budgets.\n  No one questions that the integrity of our force structure must be \nfortified, and I strongly support efforts to divert greater funding to \nmodernization and readiness priorities--funding which, in my judgment, \nis critical if we are to continue to maintain the most powerful and \nproficient military force on the planet.\n  And I think we are all cognizant of the grave retention and \nrecruitment problems prevalent throughout the military and the serious \nmorale impacts of this lack of funding. These are real problems in our \nmilitary.\n  Every recent defense-related appropriations measure--including last \nyear's omnibus appropriations bill, the FY 1999 supplemental bill \npassed by this body just last week, and the legislation that is before \nus today--has included billions of dollars that the Pentagon did not \nrequest nor want.\n  Unquestionably, a large part of the problem has been the insistence \nof the Congress to continue the time-honored practice of forcing the \nPentagon to purchase aircraft it does not want, to build ships it does \nnot need, and to maintain military bases that have long outlived their \nusefulness.\n  And every dollar that we spend on these wasteful and unnecessary \nprograms and infrastructure is a dollar that we cannot spend on such \ncritical needs as readiness and quality of life programs for our \nmilitary personnel.\n  Last year, a bipartisan coalition of Senators, led by Senator McCain, \nand others, offered a proposal supported by the Secretary of Defense \nand the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, to shut down military bases that \nhad outlived their usefulness and to save the Pentagon billions of \ndollars. And Remarkably, the Senate said no.\n\n  I am hopeful this body will not make the same mistake twice.\n  The manner in which we fund the Department of Defense borders on the \nabsurd, and continues to undermine our credibility with the American \npeople when it comes to our ability to exercise fiscal responsibility.\n  I am confounded by a Congress that on one hand bemoans the state of \nreadiness of our military, and fights tooth and nail to add billions of \nunrequested dollars to the Pentagon's budget, and yet refuses to heed \nthe advice of our military leaders and make sensible changes to our \ndefense infrastructure.\n  We micromanage the Defense Department to the point where we tell the \ngenerals and the admirals not only how many ships and planes they need \nto provide for our national security, but also where to place these \nships and planes once they are built.\n  It is armchair quarterbacking at its worse.\n  Two years ago, the Congress passed--with great fanfare I might add--a \nbalanced budget agreement that put in place a series of tough spending \ncaps, requiring the Congress to reform its free-spending ways and make \nthe tough decisions that are necessary to maintain fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Over the past two years, I have watched countless members of Congress \nduck, dodge, and evade those tough spending decisions as part of a \nsystematic effort to sustain programs that have no justification and no \npurpose other than to divert funding from other more critical defense \nneeds.\n  The examples are boundless.\n  Last year, we included a $45 million down payment on a $1.5 billion \namphibious landing ship that the Navy told us they had no need for.\n  This year, the Pentagon asked for ten new MV-22 Osprey aircraft, and \nthe bill before us tells them to buy twelve.\n  The Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs tell the Congress that we have over \n23 percent excess capacity in our current base structure and that it is \ntime to consolidate our infrastructure and use the savings to shore up \nour readiness deficiencies.\n  And the Congress says no.\n  We shuttle precious defense dollars to shipbuilding, aircraft, and \nweapon systems programs that the Pentagon has deemed unnecessary and \nunimportant.\n  And unless the pending amendment is passed today, the Senate will \ncontinue to shun the advice of our military leaders, and divert \nprecious dollars away from readiness and modernization programs to \nsupport an infrastructure that is clearly in excess of our needs.\n  Today, we have a modest, bipartisan proposal offered by Senators \nMcCain and Levin, supported by the Secretary of Defense and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, that would unquestionably save billions of dollars \nthat could be used to improve readiness, enhance pay, retirement, \nfamily housing, and other benefits for our military personnel, and \nbolster our national security.\n  For three consecutive years, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff have asked us to allow the Pentagon to close those \nmilitary bases it believes no longer hold operational value.\n  And for three years, the Congress has punted this political football, \nrefusing to make the tough choices that we promised the American people \nwe would make just two years ago.\n  Senator after Senator has come to the Senate floor to lament the lack \nof adequate funding for our Nation's defense.\n  We have heard that the readiness of our forces is at severe risk, \nthat we do not have the funding we need to invest in the weapons \ntechnology of tomorrow, and that personnel problems threaten the \nintegrity of our force structure, both at home and abroad.\n  This Senator believes those concerns are real and legitimate. Just \nlast week, my colleagues approved some $13 billion from the Social \nSecurity trust funds to address some of these needs, I do not question \nthe urgency in addressing all of our modernization, readiness and \npersonnel shortfalls.\n  With that in mind, I cannot understand how the Senate, with a clear \nconscience, can fail to adopt the amendment that is pending before us, \nwhich was requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and which would save \nan estimated $3 billion a year.\n  Not just this year, but $3 billion every year, for years to come.\n  My colleagues, Senator Levin and Senator McCain, have already made \nreference to a letter sent by the Joint Chiefs in support of this \namendment.\n  In that letter, the Joint Chiefs characterize an additional round of \nbase closures as ``absolutely necessary.''\n  Not just a ``good idea,'' Mr. President, but ``absolutely \nnecessary.''\n  While legions of men and women have courageously stepped forward to \ndefend this Nation and serve their fellow Americans, the Congress has \ncontinued to shortchange readiness and quality of life programs to \nfinance questionable programs and weapons systems unrequested and in \nsome cases outright opposed by the Pentagon.\n  There is no greater national security issue at stake than the \nreadiness of our military and our ability to respond to global crisis.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us is politically unpleasant, but \nfiscally prudent and imperative and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that the \nremainder of time be allocated to the Senator from Michigan, who \ncontrols the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, it is my understanding that \nthe Senator from Kansas will address the Senate regarding the BRAC \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished chairman, and I thank the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer for taking my place while I make these \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, I rise to again state my opposition to the BRAC \namendment as it is proposed. Let's get it clear. I understand that my \ncolleagues who are offering this amendment are very sincere in their \nefforts to address the problem of an excess infrastructure, certainly \nwithin the Department of Defense.\n  Let me be absolutely clear that I agree with the assertion that there \nis\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\nexcess infrastructure. I have no quarrel with that. But let me be \nequally clear that until I am confident we can focus the BRAC where \nthere is excess infrastructure and until we can ensure that any savings \nfrom such a BRAC--a lot has been said about the savings--will go toward \nmodernization, or readiness, or procurement, as opposed to funding the \nnumerous expeditions this administration continues to assign our \nmilitary, such as Bosnia and Kosovo, I can't support any additional \nrounds of BRAC at this time.\n  Let me explain in a little bit more detail. ``They'' all understand \nthat there is too much infrastructure for the current force strength. \n``They'' know they need to act to reduce it. But the political costs \nare too high, and ``they'' know the blame for not having another BRAC \ncan be easily passed off to others. We heard a lot of talk about \n``they'' from the proponents of BRAC. Unfortunately, the readiness of \nour Armed Forces suffers because ``they'' are unwilling to act. I would \nlike to get to the definition of who ``they'' are.\n  Most people who follow the excess military infrastructure issue--the \nBRAC issue, if you will--would say that ``they'' are the U.S. Congress. \nSenator after Senator has come to the floor with not really arms \nwaving, but with some pretty tough commentary, pointing the finger at \nthe Congress as being ``they.'' However, let me also point out that a \nstrong case can be made that ``they'' are also the civilian and \nuniformed leadership of the Department of Defense.\n  I am not trying to pick on anybody. I just want to share the \nresponsibility in a fair way. Of course the Congress must approve the \nadditional funds of BRAC, and therefore the responsibility is clearly \non the shoulders of the Senate and the House. I accept that \nresponsibility. The distinguished Presiding Officer does as well. Every \nMember of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the comparable \ncommittee in the House does as well. But the leadership of DOD has not \nshouldered the responsibility, in my personal opinion, to adequately \nprepare for future BRAC rounds. They could, by requiring each service \nto develop a prioritized listing of bases and facilities that are in \nexcess, or the generic description of same, more especially in regards \nto the mission of the base.\n  I know what they are going to say. Their defense is such as, that \nwould be impossible because of the politics of it; it would bias any \nfuture BRAC rounds, and therefore they should not be done until a BRAC \nis authorized.\n  By ``they'' I am talking about the DOD. ``They'' in this particular \ninstance further state that it would be impractical to categorize the \nfacilities by mission since most facilities are multifunctional, and \ntherefore any future BRAC should, as in theory they have in the past, \ninclude all military facilities regarding the BRAC criteria.\n  If we are talking about BRAC, everybody is going to be on the same \ncriteria. Everybody is on the table.\n  Of course, most bases and facilities are multifunctional. After all, \nthey all train, they all have administrative functions, they all have \npublic works tasks, but they all have a clear, primary mission.\n  Additionally, it is a bit disingenuous for the Department of Defense \nto say that all bases would be included, all are on the chopping block \nfor consideration in any future BRAC round. That is rather disingenuous \nit seems to me, even if, for example, the service academies would be on \nthe table, or the Norfolk Naval Base, or Andrews Air Force Base, or \nFort Hood, or Camp Pendleton were on the table for BRAC consideration. \nThat is not reasonable. That is not going to happen. It is not \nreasonable to expect that those, or other key facilities where we must \nhave a primary mission, would be seriously considered for closure or \nfor realignment.\n  It is not unreasonable to expect that a similar listing of definable \nexcess capacity could and should be developed and be the focus of \nfuture reductions of infrastructure rather than, as I have said, before \nthe ``everything is on the table'' approach in regard to BRAC.\n  Many of my colleagues have heard me voice my concern over what I call \n``BRAC purgatory.'' That is, quite simply, what every city in America \nwith a military facility goes through every time a BRAC round is \nmentioned. What that means in real terms is that the city or the \ncommunity involved spends a lot of money from their very limited budget \nto hire so-called ``experts'' or ``consultants'' to help to really \nprotect their base from any future BRAC round.\n  If we can focus BRAC on the primary mission of bases and generically \ndefine what we need, and what we don't need, we will spare many \ncommunities from ``BRAC purgatory.'' We will let them off the BRAC hook \nif their facility is not on the excess infrastructure list. We are \ngoing to save a lot of communities from ``BRAC purgatory,'' and we are \ngoing to save a lot of headaches and a lot of money.\n  I am equally concerned that the Department has failed to develop a \nstrategy for the next round of BRAC. Let me emphasize ``strategy.'' You \njust can't go to a BRAC and put bases on the chopping block. A specific \ninfrastructure strategy is required for at least three reasons.\n  First, as the military approaches the optimum infrastructure, great \ncare is going to have to be made. It will be required to prevent the \ncutting of the essential infrastructures.\n  Second, since the military missions and roles are changing --and, \nboy, are they changing; for example, the Air Force sees itself becoming \nan expeditionary force rather than a garrison force, and that is \nhappening; the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps are all searching for a new \nmission and a new role--I think the Department of Defense-wide \nassessment of the types and the number and the location of the military \nfacilities needed to support the national strategy must be developed. \nThere must be a strategy there.\n  Third, both the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense \nPanel strongly recommended consolidation and joint basing for the \nmilitary to optimize their capability in an atmosphere of reduced \nbudgets and reduced force structure military environment.\n  In isolation, each of those three requirements represents a \ndifficult, a complex, and a contentious undertaking within the military \nand the Department of Defense. However, when taken as a collective \nmandate to shape the future infrastructure needs of the military, such \nan important imperative cannot possibly be accomplished within the \nguidelines of just a simple BRAC. It seems to me that the Department of \nDefense has to have the courage and will to oversee the services and \ndirect actions be taken that would set the correct approach to reducing \nour excessive infrastructure to match our future military strategy. \nThey should do that--not a BRAC commission.\n  The third action that DOD must find the will to take is defining the \nsavings associated with BRAC and establishing a way to funnel those \nmoneys into readiness, modernization, or the procurement or quality-of-\nlife programs. In the April 1998 Department of Defense report on BRAC, \nthey admitted that, ``by their very nature, estimates of savings are \nsubject to some uncertainty.'' That is probably the understatement of \nthis debate. The Department further stated that, ``No audit trail, \nsingle document, or budget account exists for tracking the end use of \neach dollar saved through BRAC.''\n  Let me repeat that. Senator after Senator has come to the floor and \nsaid: Look at the money we are going to save in regard to BRAC. Then \nthey look at the problems with modernization, and procurement, and \nreadiness. Yet no audit trail, no single document, no budget account \nexists for tracking the end use of each dollar saved through BRAC. \nHowever, they assured Congress that, ``The Department is committed to \nimprove its estimates of costs and savings in future rounds of BRAC.'' \n``Oh, we are going to get it right next time.''\n  It seems to me it takes courage to solve that problem, and it takes a \ndedicated effort to set up the processes to track and direct the BRAC \nsavings into the promised accounts. And it will take more than a \n``trust me, it will be much better next time'' assurance before many \nMembers of Congress will let the reported savings, the estimated \nsavings, the reported savings of another round of BRAC simply remain \nunaccounted for, be lost in the bookkeeping of the Department of \nDefense, or, in fact, if there are savings, if we can account for \nsavings, they end up in such\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\nmissions as Kosovo or Bosnia--which have to be funded, by the way, and \nwhich we addressed in regard to emergency funding.\n\n  That is the proper way to fund the final act of courage on the part \nof the uniformed and civilian leadership of DOD--I use the word \n``courage'' in quotes here--that directly impacts the future rounds of \nBRAC politics of the last round.\n  A lot has been said about this. I understand it. I am not going to \nrehash that today. But based on a recent memorandum from the Department \nof the Air Force, it seems to me there is some acquiescence to such \npressure to not really carry out the BRAC action directed in the last \nround. BRAC is a hard sell in Congress under normal times and under the \npurest of motives. But when actions are taken that clearly disadvantage \nothers and violate the BRAC process for political gain, BRAC is a ``no \nsell'' in Congress.\n  For the Department of Defense to simply say that all we need is for \nCongress to authorize additional rounds of BRAC is an easy way to avoid \nthe responsibilities for actions that must be taken by the Department \nof Defense well in advance of any congressional action.\n  It seems to me the Department of Defense can go a long way to helping \nus in regard to the BRAC process if they simply develop the fortitude \nand the decisionmaking to start the process now to correctly and \naccurately shape and define the infrastructure--not to simply put \neverything on the table to save money but be required to support the \nmilitary of the 21st century even if they risk pressure from the White \nHouse or Capitol Hill. Without such a strategy, I cannot support \nanother BRAC round that has a poorly prepared and inadequately staffed \napproach to reducing the excess infrastructure.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote from my colleagues on this matter.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kevin Zumbar, a military \nfellow, and Zach Terwilliger, a legislative intern, in the office of \nChairman Warner, be granted floor privileges for the duration of the \nSenate's debate on S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the BRAC matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have 51 \nminutes and the opponents have 46 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, from 1989 to 1997 the Department of Defense \nreduced the total active-duty military end strength by 32 percent. That \nfigure is going to grow to 36 percent by 2003, over a third reduction \nin our end strength will be achieved by 2003. We are already about a \nthird.\n  Even after four base closure rounds, the reduction in the \nDepartment's base structure in the United States has been reduced only \n21 percent. The Department of Defense analysis concluded that the \nDepartment has about 23 percent excess capacity in its current base \nstructure.\n  Let me give a few examples of that excess that we are now funding, \nspending taxpayers' money supporting, which is no longer needed.\n  The Army will have reduced the personnel at its classroom training \ncommands by 43 percent, but the classroom space has only been reduced \nby 7 percent--personnel reductions, 43 percent in classroom training \ncommands but the space only by 7 percent.\n  Why do we want to maintain all that excess classroom space that is \nnot being used? What is the point of doing that? The answer to me; it \nis pointless. The uniformed military are saying: Please let us close \nit.\n  The Air Force will have reduced the number of fighters and other \nsmall aircraft by 53 percent since 1989, but the base structure for \nthose aircraft will be only 35 percent smaller. The Navy will have 33 \npercent more hangers for its aircraft than it requires.\n  And on and on.\n  Secretary Cohen's report to us documents substantial savings that \nhave been achieved from past base closure rounds. It has been argued \nthat those savings can't be audited. What the CBO says about that \nargument is that firm measures of BRAC savings that were requested by \nthe Congress do not and, indeed, cannot exist. That is because BRAC \nsavings are really avoided costs. They are the difference between what \nthe Department of Defense actually spent and what it would have had to \nhave spent in the absence of the BRAC action. Because the latter is \nnever actually observed, the figures for BRAC savings that the \nDepartment of Defense provides will never be firm measures; they must \nalways be estimates.\n  Then the CBO says--talking about the Department of Defense report on \nsavings--that the report's basic message is consistent with the CBO's \nown conclusion: Past and future BRAC rounds will lead to significant \nsavings for the Department of Defense.\n  That, it seems to me, is the heart of the measure.\n  This is a Congressional Budget Office letter, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Section 2824 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 requests a report from \n     the Department of Defense on the costs and savings associated \n     with the four previous rounds of base closures and \n     realignments. The legislation also requires the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) to review that report. The enclosure \n     fulfills that requirement. In addition, I have enclosed a \n     copy of CBO's response to a letter of April 17, 1998, from \n     Senators Daschle and Lott and Congressman Gephardt.\n       Please contact me if you have any questions. The CBO staff \n     contact is Lauri Zeman, who can be reached at (202) 226-2900.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosures.\n\n Review of the Report of the Department of Defense on Base Realignment \n                              and Closure\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has completed its \n     review of The Report of the Department of Defense on Base \n     Realignment and Closure, as required by section 2824(g) of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. \n     CBO finds that the report provides a clear and coherent \n     summary of why the Department of Defense (DoD) believes that \n     future BRAC rounds are necessary. Moreover, the report's \n     basic message is consistent with CBO's own conclusions: past \n     and future BRAC rounds will lead to significant savings for \n     DoD. Nonetheless, the report is useful primarily as a summary \n     of DoD's position, rather than as an analysis of BRAC issues. \n     Although the roughly 2,000 computer-generated tables that \n     accompany the report contain most of the specific data on \n     past BRAC rounds that the Congress requested, the main text \n     provides little analysis of those data or insight into the \n     number and types of installations that might be closed in the \n     event of future BRAC rounds.\n\n\n                     data provided by dod's report\n\n       DoD's report provides most of the data requested by the \n     law. Yet there were a few instances in which the department \n     was unable to locate specific data or lacked information \n     systems that were flexible enough to organize the data in the \n     form that the Congress requested. For example, DoD was unable \n     to locate the cost and savings estimates that it had \n     originally given to the BRAC commissions, and it was unable \n     to identify the BRAC funds spent on each type of Navy and \n     defense agency installation.\n       The report also omits any specific information about the \n     types and number of bases that might close as the result of \n     future BRAC rounds. One explanation is that DoD may have been \n     unwilling to make such projections because doing so might \n     appear to prejudge the results of the BRAC process.\n       In addition, the firm measures of BRAC savings that were \n     requested by the Congress do not--and indeed cannot--exist. \n     That is because BRAC savings are really avoided costs: they \n     are the difference between what DoD actually spent and what \n     it would have had to spend in the absence of BRAC action. \n     Because the latter is never actually observed, the figures \n     for BRAC savings that DoD provides will never be firm \n     measures, but must always be estimates.\n\n\n            The Cost of Implementing Previous BRAC Decisions\n\n       CBO did not attempt to verify DoD's estimates of the one-\n     time costs of implementing past BRAC decisions. Those one-\n     time costs (which include the costs of transferring or \n     separating personnel, moving equipment, and constructing new \n     facilities) represent actual expenditures and thus are easier \n     to track than savings. Based on its current financial data, \n     DoD concludes that the actual costs of implementing past BRAC \n     decisions\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\n     will be very close to those that it projected at the start of \n     each round. DoD's initial estimate was that it would cost $23 \n     billion to fully implement the four BRAC rounds; today, that \n     estimate is $22 billion.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of review.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Although DoD might be capable of estimating the costs of \n     BRAC decisions very accurately early in the BRAC process, CBO \n     finds that the similarity between DoD's initial BRAC cost \n     estimates and the current ones may be, in part, a self-\n     fulfilling prophecy. The Congress appropriates funds for one-\n     time implementation costs based largely on DoD's budget \n     estimates. Because those BRAC funds are in designated \n     accounts and cannot be used for non-BRAC purpose, BRAC \n     expenditures may adjust to some extent to match the funds \n     available.\n       In addition, not all BRAC-related costs are included in the \n     $22 billion estimate. For example, operating units sometimes \n     bear unexpected costs when services at DoD facilities, such \n     as equipment maintenance, are temporarily disrupted by BRAC \n     actions. The $22 billion figure also excludes any \n     environmental cleanup or caretaker costs that DoD might incur \n     after 2001, when the implementation periods specified by the \n     Congress for the past four BRAC rounds will be complete. \n     Payments made to assist communities and workers adversely \n     affected by based closures are also omitted. (DoD estimates \n     that those costs, which are paid by the Department of Labor, \n     DoD's Office of Economic Adjustment, the Economic Development \n     Administration in the Department of Commerce, and the Federal \n     Aviation Agency, totaled about $1 billion as of 1997.)\n\n\n                   The Savings from Past BRAC Rounds\n\n       Consistent with current BRAC budget documents, DoD's report \n     indicates that when the past four rounds are fully \n     implemented, they will provide annual recurring savings of \n     about $5.6 billion (in constant 1999 dollars). That figure \n     appears to be reasonable. By comparison, CBO estimates that \n     savings could be about $5 billion annually.\\2\\\n       However, DoD's report does not document how the services \n     and defense agencies derived the BRAC savings estimates that \n     underlie the aggregate $5.6 billion figure. Nor does it show \n     that those estimates are consistent with the quantitative \n     model (DoD's COBRA model) that DoD used during past BRAC \n     deliberations and might use in any future BRAC round. \n     Instead, DoD tries to show that its aggregate estimate is \n     credible by presenting a new analysis based on aggregate data \n     and by citing recent audit reports. Neither approach is very \n     successful. For example, the new analysis in DoD's report \n     (which identifies recurring annual savings of $7 billion) is \n     based on the same undocumented estimates of personnel \n     reductions that the defense agencies and military departments \n     use in their BRAC budgets. Because reductions in personnel \n     costs account for over 80 percent of estimated BRAC savings, \n     using those personnel numbers ensures that DoD's new estimate \n     of savings will not differ widely from the estimates in the \n     BRAC budget documents. Because the new analysis depends on \n     those budget estimates it cannot be used to verify them.\n       DoD's use of audits to verify BRAC savings also suffers \n     from serious weaknesses. For example, the DoD Inspector \n     General's audit of 1993 BRAC actions found that savings \n     exceeded DoD's budget estimates by about $1.7 billion over \n     the six-year implementation period.\\3\\ Yet almost all of that \n     $1.7 billion in additional savings came from a few special \n     situations in which the effects of BRAC actions were \n     confounded with those of imposed budget cuts, reductions in \n     workload, or reductions in force structure. An audit can \n     compare what DoD spent at different bases before and after \n     BRAC actions, but--unlike models such as COBRA--it cannot \n     disentangle the effects of BRAC from those of other factors.\n\n\n                      estimates of excess capacity\n\n       DoD's report indicates that the department will have excess \n     capacity of over 20 percent at its U.S. bases after \n     completing the four BRAC rounds. In its analysis, DoD \n     compared the size of specific types of forces or workloads \n     (measured, for example, by the number of aircraft or assigned \n     personnel) with the size of the base structure that supports \n     those forces or workloads (measured by the square feet \n     of buildings or of apron space at airfields). DoD then \n     estimated the amount of excess capacity by calculating the \n     percentage reduction in the base structure that would \n     result in the same ratios of forces to base structure that \n     existed in 1989.\n       That approach is reasonable and, at least in the aggregate, \n     yields a credible estimate. Yet it may not provide good \n     estimates for particular categories of installations. DoD's \n     estimates of the excess capacity for different categories of \n     bases would be more credible if they were tested using a \n     wider variety of indices for the size of forces and the base \n     structure. The department's use of 1989 as a baseline may \n     also be inappropriate for some types of installations. On the \n     one hand, that approach could overstate the size of the \n     required base structure--DoD might have had excess capacity \n     in 1989, or it might need fewer bases today because it has \n     consolidated service programs into defensewide activities. On \n     the other hand, the approach could understate the amount of \n     capacity required if some types of base support are truly a \n     fixed cost, required regardless of the size of the force.\n\n\n         The Costs and Savings from Possible Future BRAC Rounds\n\n       According to DoD's report, additional BRAC rounds in 2001 \n     and 2005 would, together, save $3.4 billion (in constant 1999 \n     dollars) every year after 2011. In addition, the report \n     implies that the cumulative savings from those rounds would \n     outweigh the one-time implementation costs before 2011. To \n     make those estimates, DoD assumed that the annual profile of \n     costs and savings for each of the two proposed BRAC rounds \n     over their six-year implementation periods would match the \n     average profile for the 1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds combined, \n     adjusted for inflation.\n       Those assumptions are reasonable for planning. DoD may not \n     be able to provide better estimates until the specific bases \n     that would be affected by proposed future BRAC rounds are \n     identified. Yet savings from future rounds could be less than \n     DoD predicts if the excess bases that have not already been \n     closed are those for which closure costs would be relatively \n     high or recurring annual savings relatively low. Such a \n     pattern could also extend the time required before the \n     savings from the additional BRAC rounds would outweigh the \n     costs. Yet even in that case the ultimate savings from future \n     rounds could still be significant.\n\n\n       Improving Estimates of Costs, Savings, and Excess Capacity\n\n       DoD's report provides a clear summary of the department's \n     perspective on BRAC issues and on the need for additional \n     base closures. But it provides little new evidence or insight \n     into those issues. A more substantive report would have \n     provided documentation for the estimates of BRAC savings that \n     were submitted with the budget for fiscal year 1999 and a \n     more detailed analysis of capacity issues.\n       In the future, DoD plans to keep better track of BRAC \n     documents and of expenditures at bases before and after BRAC \n     actions. Those steps would be useful. To the extent that \n     implementation costs reflect actual DoD expenditures, \n     improved financial records could contribute directly to the \n     department's ability to assess BRAC costs. For example, DoD \n     could extend its efforts to track the costs of BRAC rounds \n     beyond the six-year implementation period in order to fully \n     account for long-term caretaker and environmental costs.\n       Yet better recordkeeping, by itself, will not allow DoD to \n     identify the extent of BRAC savings in a period when bases \n     are undergoing large changes in budgets, forces, and \n     workloads unrelated to BRAC. Instead, formal statistical \n     models are needed to disentangle the effects of BRAC and non-\n     BRAC factors on expenditures. In addition, DoD could improve \n     the credibility of its savings estimates by better \n     documenting the assumptions and methodologies used to \n     generate them. The DoD Inspector General's audit of the \n     savings from 1993 BRAC actions revealed that the services and \n     defense agencies were often unable to explain how they \n     derived the savings estimates submitted in their budget \n     documents. The Congress might want to request that such \n     documentation accompany all future BRAC budget exhibits. Such \n     a requirement might encourage DoD to place greater emphasis \n     on the quality and consistency of its estimating procedures.\n       In addition, DoD could provide better insight into capacity \n     issues by developing a master plan for its base structure. \n     Such a plan might be based on explicit estimates of \n     requirements rather than presuming that the ratio of forces \n     to base structure that existed in 1989 remains appropriate. \n     For example, the plan could use standards reflecting the \n     number of acres of land that combat units need for training \n     or the number of square feet of office space an \n     administrative worker requires. Standards could be developed \n     that are appropriate to different types of forces and for \n     forces stationed in the United States and overseas.\n       DoD's report would have been stronger had it provided well \n     documented estimates of the savings from past BRAC rounds and \n     estimates of excess capacity based on requirements. Yet \n     despite those limitations, the report provides rough but \n     credible estimates of the total recurring savings from past \n     BRAC rounds, the aggregate level of excess capacity in the \n     United States, and the potential savings from future BRAC \n     rounds.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Those figures are in current dollars, not adjusted for \n     inflation. They represent the one-time costs that DoD expects \n     to incur in closing and realigning bases during the six-year \n     implementation period that the Congress has allowed for each \n     BRAC round. They include environmental costs but exclude any \n     revenues from land sales that result from BRAC actions. \n     Although DoD initially expected to receive about $4.1 billion \n     in revenue from land sales as a result of past BRAC actions, \n     it now expects that figure to be only $0.1 billion.\n     \\2\\ DoD's estimate is based on the sum of the savings shown \n     in the budget for the last year of the implementation period \n     for each BRAC round.

In addition, I have \n     enclosed the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) review of \n     The Report of the Department of Defense on Base Realignment \n     and Closure, which elaborates on many of the issues you \n     address in your letter.\n       Actual BRAC Savings. The Department is able to provide \n     reasonable estimates of BRAC savings. Yet the firm measures \n     of BRAC savings that were requested by the Congress do not--\n     and indeed cannot--exist. BRAC savings are really avoided \n     costs--costs that DoD would have incurred if BRAC actions had \n     not taken place. Because those avoided costs are not actual \n     expenditures, DoD cannot observe them and record them in its \n     financial records. As a result, DoD can only estimate savings \n     rather than actually measure them.\n       DoD Information Systems. It is not possible for DoD to \n     establish an information system to track actual savings. The \n     BRAC budget justification books track only estimated savings. \n     DoD is more successful in tracking one-time implementation \n     costs, which typically reflect actual expenditures made from \n     BRAC accounts. Its information systems, however, cannot \n     always categorize those expenditures in the most useful way. \n     For example, in its report, DoD could not provide BRAC \n     obligations by base type for the Navy and the defense \n     agencies. To comply with the spirit of the request in section \n     2824(g), DoD might try to provide better documentation of how \n     the budget estimates for savings are made and to maintain \n     more accessible records of BRAC costs on an installation-by-\n     installation basis.\n       Economic Effects of Future BRAC Rounds. DoD's report does \n     not make detailed projections of the specific outcomes of \n     future BRAC rounds. The economic impact of base closures on \n     communities depends on many factors, including the size and \n     strength of the local economy and whether the community is \n     urban or rural. An analysis of the likely impact of future \n     base closures on local communities cannot be attempted \n     until the specific communities are identified; even then, \n     it would be very difficult to do.\n       Information Provided in DoD's Report. The DoD report \n     provides most, but not all, of the information that the \n     Congress requested. As noted above, it does not provide data \n     that would require projecting the specific outcomes of future \n     BRAC rounds. In addition, DoD was unable to locate some of \n     the requested data, including the original cost and savings \n     estimates that it gave to the BRAC commissions.\n       DoD's Analysis of Excess Capacity. DoD's report determines \n     excess capacity based on the change in the ratio of forces to \n     supporting bases since 1989. Although that approach is not \n     unreasonable, the resulting estimates of excess capacity \n     depend heavily on what specific indices are used for the size \n     of the forces and of their supporting bases. In addition, \n     that approach can understate or overstate the current level \n     of excess capacity for particular types of bases depending on \n     whether DoD had too many or too few bases of those types in \n     1989.\n       Overseas Base Capacity. DoD's capacity analysis does not \n     address overseas forces or bases. The estimates of excess \n     capacity presented in DoD's report refer to the percentages \n     of excess capacity in the United States. The extent to which \n     there may be a shortage or an excess of bases overseas \n     relative to U.S. forces overseas does not affect the accuracy \n     of those estimates or the need for base closures within the \n     United States.\n       Savings from Past BRACs and Future Personnel Reductions. \n     CBO found that the methodology used by DoD to show annual \n     recurring savings of $7 billion from the four prior BRAC \n     rounds is relatively weak. Nonetheless, CBO believes that \n     recurring savings from those BRAC rounds will be \n     substantial--about $5 billion annually, as is indicated by \n     the services' BRAC budget documents.\n       DoD's current spending plan, which extends only to 2003, \n     shows small reductions in the number of personnel in 2001 and \n     beyond. Such reductions are not inconsistent with additional \n     BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005, because most of the savings and \n     personnel reductions from those rounds would not be seen \n     until after 2003. However, DoD will have to make significant \n     reductions in personnel after 2001 to realize the level of \n     BRAC savings that it projects from future rounds.\n       Future Savings Estimate. In its review of DoD's report, CBO \n     concludes that the department's estimate of savings from \n     future BRAC rounds is not unreasonable for planning. A more \n     accurate estimate would require detailed projections about \n     the outcomes of future BRAC rounds.\n       Costs Beyond the Implementation Period. DoD will incur \n     environmental and caretaker costs for some bases after the \n     six-year implementation period is over. In its review, CBO \n     suggests that estimates of BRAC costs and savings would be \n     more accurate if they included those costs.\n       Data Included in DoD's Report. Most of the data in the \n     appendices to the DoD report are not new. Rather, they were \n     compiled from several existing sources, including BRAC budget \n     justification documents and other documents that DoD has \n     submitted to the Congress. However, the report aggregates the \n     data in new ways and presents them at levels of detail not \n     previously available in a single document.\n       As your letter indicates, the issues surrounding military \n     base closures are difficult ones. One problem is that if the \n     BRAC process is going to work, the Congress must decide on \n     the advisability of additional rounds without knowing in \n     advance which bases would be affected and what the specific \n     effects of those closures would be. Another difficulty is \n     that the Congress must make those decisions even though the \n     savings from previous rounds can only be estimated rather \n     than tracked in DoD's financial records. The amount of \n     savings from BRAC actions will always be impossible to \n     estimate precisely. The reason is that the effects of BRAC \n     actions are not easily disentangled from those of non-BRAC \n     actions, such as mandated budget reductions or cuts in forces \n     and workloads.\n       I hope that this response is helpful. Please contact me if \n     you have any questions or if you would like to request \n     additional work by CBO on BRAC issues. CBO's staff contact is \n     Lauri Zeman, who can be reached at (202) 226-2900.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The heart of the matter, it seems to me, is that our \nauditors, our budget experts, have said that it is their conclusion \nthat ``past and future BRAC rounds will lead to significant savings for \nthe Department of Defense.''\n  What are those estimates of savings? By 2001, the Department \nestimates that BRAC actions will produce a total of $14.5 billion in \nnet savings. After 2001, when all BRAC actions must be completed, \nsteady State savings will be $5.7 billion per year. This is just from \npast base closure rounds, which some Members say can't be audited in \nterms of precise savings.\n  That is a lot of money, $5.7 billion per year--steady State savings. \nIs it possibly $5.6 billion or $5.8 billion? Nobody can state with \ncertainty. It is significant.\n  What can be stated is what the CBO's conclusion is, that these are \nsignificant savings and are similar to the kind of savings that the CBO \nbelieves are achieved with base closing.\n  Last July, as I indicated, the CBO gave their own conclusions, so \nwhile we can debate this issue on the floor about audit trails and how \nprecise the estimates are, our auditors, our experts, have reached the \ncritical conclusion that the savings, indeed, are significant.\n  Earlier this month we received letters from Secretary Cohen, from the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, from all of the Joint Chiefs, from the \nSecretaries of the Army and the Navy and the Air Force. In his letter, \nSecretary Cohen says the Department's ability to properly support \nAmerica's men and women in uniform today and to sustain them into the \nfuture hinged in great measure on realizing this critical savings that \nonly BRAC can provide.\n  Our ability to support the men and women in uniform depends on future \nsavings from BRAC rounds.\n  A letter which we just received, signed by all six members of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, makes their views crystal clear:\n\n       Simply stated, our military judgment is that further base \n     closures are absolutely necessary.\n\n  Those are pretty strong words and these are our uniformed military \nleaders. On the Armed Services Committee, we put a lot of stock in \ntheir judgment on most issues. Once in a while we may disagree with \nthem, as is our right and our duty, but when the top military \nleadership, civilian and uniform, in this Nation tell Members that more \nBRAC rounds are ``absolutely necessary'' we should take heed.\n  General Shelton said in last year's Department of Defense report:\n\n       I strongly support additional base closures. Without them, \n     we will not leave our successors the war-fighting dominance \n     of today's force.\n\n  That is not a political statement; that is a military man's \nstatement. That has to do with warfighting dominance.\n  We can argue about audit trails or specifics on this floor, but when \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs says we will not leave our successors \nthe warfighting dominance that we have in today's force without \nadditional base closures, those are words which have a special meaning, \nit would seem to me, to all of the Members who have this special \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n  We have to face up to this responsibility. A decade ago, after years \nof prodding by Senator Goldwater and under the leadership of Senator \nNunn and Senator Warner, Congress had the vision and the courage to \nstart the BRAC process. Just imagine the financial problems that we \nwould have today if we could not count on the savings from previous \nBRAC rounds. If the Senators a decade ago did not succeed in persuading \nus to start the BRAC process, think of the problems we would have \ntoday. Those are the problems we are going to have 4, 5, 6, 7 years \nfrom now if we do not continuing a process, if we do not continue the \nprocess, if we do not shed the excess infrastructure which is no longer \nneeded.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to address the \nSenate with regard to a unanimous consent request which he and I have \nshared? I will just present it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that time until 1:45 today be equally divided \non the BRAC amendment between the proponents and opponents, with the \nvote beginning, as under the previous order, at 1:45 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nand I had discussed the possibility of Senator Kerrey coming in. I am \ncommitted to the 1-hour time agreement. We are advised by Senator \nKerrey he would not be available to utilize that time period after the \n1:45 vote. I will be working to determine what we can bring up \nfollowing the 1:45 vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Virginia for his efforts to \naccommodate Senator Kerrey. An additional hour is needed for his \namendment, but because of his vice chairmanship on the Intelligence \nCommittee which begins meeting right now, he is unable to be here.\n  Mr. WARNER. The most I can advise the Senate is we will have the vote \nat 1:45 today on the BRAC amendment. Thereafter, as quickly as I can, I \nwill advise the Senate, after consultation with the ranking member, as \nto what the next amendment will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan has 1 \nminute 14 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. I will finish and \nthen ask unanimous consent that after I am completed, in 3 minutes or \nso, Senator Robb be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Congress likes to ask the Joint Chiefs \nevery once in awhile how much more money they think they need and where \nshould we add it? What are their priorities?\n  Those are legitimate questions for us to ask. But they are also \nrelatively pretty easy issues to address. Our duty as Members of \nCongress extends far beyond pitching and hitting softballs. We have an \nobligation to the men and women in uniform to listen to the Chiefs when \nthey ask us to do something that is hard to do.\n  The Chiefs' opinions are important to us when following them is easy \nto do, when they give us their priorities if we can find some \nadditional funds. But now they are asking us to do something that is \nhard politically to do, and that is to heed their advice, to close some \nadditional bases. I do not know of anybody in the Department of Defense \nor anybody in this Chamber who likes closing bases. Not many people \nlike going to the dentist or losing weight either. It is just a lot \nmore fun to eat dessert than to look after your health. But we have an \nobligation--and it is difficult--in the best interests of this Nation, \nand for the health of our military, to do not what is easiest, but to \ndo what is essential.\n  What is essential has been told to us very eloquently in these \nletters from the Chiefs, in this letter from the Secretary of Defense, \nin this letter from the three Service Secretaries. These letters tell \nus as pointedly, dramatically, strongly, forcefully as they can, that \nit is essential that additional bases be closed. ``Our military \njudgment is that further base closures are absolutely necessary.''\n\n  I began my few minutes of comments with that quote and I end them \nwith that quote, because I hope we will all think about that as we make \na politically tough decision on how to vote on the pending McCain-Levin \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Michigan for his leadership on this issue, as well as my \ncolleague and friend from Arizona for his leadership on this issue. It \nis a difficult issue.\n  This year, we have added billions of dollars to improve the readiness \nof our Armed Forces. It does not take a budget expert to realize how \nmuch more we could accomplish for our men and women in uniform if we \nhad the billions in savings that would accrue from just one additional \nround of base closures in the year 2001.\n  Last year and the year before that, I argued that not giving the \nDepartment of Defense the authority it has asked for to close unneeded \nbases makes the Congress look shortsighted and indecisive. I argued \nthen that every dollar used to maintain excess infrastructure is a \ndollar diverted from resources we so badly need to modernize our \nequipment and to improve the quality of life of our hard-working \nmilitary personnel and their families.\n  Sadly, those BRAC efforts failed for nearly the same reasons the \nemergency supplemental succeeded last year, reasons that have more to \ndo with politics than with making the right choices when it comes to \nprotecting this Nation's interests, both now and into the next century.\n  Admittedly, the emergency supplemental had plenty of legitimate \nemergency spending, emergency spending for our troops, for our farmers, \nand for hurricane and tornado victims. But it threw fiscal discipline \nout the window by also spending billions in nonemergency spending. In \nmy view, we have acted just as irresponsibly over the past 3 years by \nrefusing to close bases we no longer need. If we fail to pass this \nlatest BRAC proposal once again, we will have failed not only the \ntaxpayer but also the men and women who comprise the finest fighting \nforce the world has ever known.\n\n  I come back to this point, one I have made time and time again, to \nask, who really suffers if we force the Department of Defense to keep \nopen bases it does not need? In the end, we only punish those who most \nneed the benefits of infrastructure savings. First, we punish the \nNation's taxpayers when we fail to make the best use of the resources \nwith which we are entrusted. Second, we punish today's soldiers, \nsailors, and marines, because current readiness requires having \nsufficient reliable resources for equipment, training, and operations. \nFinally, we punish tomorrow's force, our future readiness, as we \ncontinue to mortgage the research, development, and modernization of \nthe platforms and equipment that will be necessary to keep America \nstrong into the 21st century.\n  As the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified, there is no shortage of \nlegitimate programs to apply BRAC savings towards including Navy \nshipbuilding. Years of relatively low procurement rates have created a \nshortfall so significant that the fleet size will shrink to \nsubstantially less than the 300 ships of the Navy's stated goal in the \n2020s, if procurement rates of 8 to 10 ships do not start materializing \nnow. The Navy is stretched thin enough right now, with 324 ships. Do we \nreally want to risk not having enough ships to meet our commitments in \nthe next century?\n  It does not have to be this way. The 300-ship Navy, the Army after \nnext, and the Air Force and Marine Corps of tomorrow can be funded, at \nleast in part, from BRAC savings. The savings from the first four \nrounds of base closures alone are estimated to be on the order of $25 \nbillion over the next 4 years. It should come as no surprise that \nscores of studies and organizations such as the Quadrennial Defense \nReview, the Defense Restructure Initiative, the National Defense Panel, \nand Business Executives for National Security have all concluded that \nmore base closures are crucial to the future of our Armed Forces.\n  It is time to put politics behind us. We have an obligation to change \nthe way we do business and to do what is right for our Armed Forces and \nwhat is right for the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncritically important amendment.\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeingold be added as a cosponsor of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Mr. Lesley Spraker, a military affairs fellow in the office of \nSenator DeWine, be granted the privilege of the floor during the \nconsideration of S. 1059.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous \nconsent that Paul Barger, a national defense fellow in Senator Inhofe's \noffice, be given the privilege of the floor during the remainder of the \ndebate on the defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, at this time, I yield \nwhatever time he may consume to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire. I will take just a couple of minutes.\n  I rise in opposition to the McCain-Levin amendment on base closure. \nIt is a difficult decision for me because I am persuaded there could be \nsome closures that would make us more efficient in terms of our mission \nin defense. I remember my friend, Dick Cheney, whose place I took in \nthe House, said that defense is not for economic development; it is for \ndefense. I appreciate that, and I believe that.\n  I was not at all impressed with the last process. I was not at all \nimpressed with the way the administration handled it, so I do not \nbelieve that it is appropriate at this time to bring in the politics \nagain of base closure. Frankly, the military ought to come forward with \ntheir views as to what is necessary to carry out their mission. That, \nof course, should be our particular desire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 395\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I also rise in opposition to the Kerrey \namendment. It seems to me that it would be a mistake to begin to \ndowngrade our position with regard to missiles until START II is agreed \nto by the Russians. We have already approved that treaty; the Russians \nhave not. I do not think we should weaken our position.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on those two \namendments. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 393\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, during the markup of the \ndefense authorization bill in committee, we twice rejected base closure \namendments. So it does seem anticlimatic to be out here on the floor \nagain for the very same proposal. But such is the way of the Senate \nsometimes.\n  Senators McCain and Levin did offer an amendment to have two rounds \nof base closures in 2001 and 2003. The process was adjusted to ensure \nthat the next incoming President would appoint the commissioners. \nEverything else was identical to the amendment now being offered, and \nthe amendment was defeated by a vote of 12-8, with members on both \nsides of the aisle voting one way or the other. Then Senators Levin and \nMcCain offered another amendment that called for only one round of base \nclosures in 2001.\n  The House version of the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Authorization bill \nis silent on base closures. Opposition to base closure in the House is \nmuch stronger than it is in the Senate, and the Membership has let it \nbe known that they will oppose any base closure legislation in \nconference, even though the administration proposes these two rounds in \n2001 and 2005. We are in a debate on the floor taking a lot of the \nSenate's time on a proposal that probably lacks the support in both the \nHouse and the Senate to get this to the President's desk.\n\n  There have been a lot of arguments made on both sides. Let me offer a \nfew of my own.\n  During previous rounds, the Department had the opportunity to reduce \nthe infrastructure to the extent that it believed necessary. That was \nthe purpose of the previous rounds. The bottom line is that the \nDepartment failed to do that.\n  When first announced, the 1995 BRAC round was proclaimed to be ``the \nmother of all BRACs.'' But the outcome was just a whimper; it was a \nlittle daughter rather than a mother.\n  Any purported savings of another round of these closures would not be \navailable in the near-to-medium term for the procurement of equipment \nand weapons modernization or any other purpose. That is really what we \ncare about. We want money for new equipment. We want money for \nreadiness and modernization.\n  The bottom line, as most of my colleagues know, is that it is going \nto cost us in the immediate future money that we desperately need right \nnow for readiness. No one disputes that if you close down \ninfrastructure, in the long run it is going to save money. That is \nobvious. But it is going to cost us somewhere in the vicinity of $3.2 \nbillion right up front to begin the closing, with the environmental \nissues and all the changes that have to be made: the upfront cost \ntransfer of units and equipment, new facilities at receiving \ninstallations, buyouts of civilian employees and environmental cleanup. \nIf we do not have the dollars now to do what we need to modernize our \ntroops, to get the equipment they need, to get them up to the readiness \nlevel at which they should be--how will we be able to pay these initial \ncosts?\n  Arguments that have been made, rightfully so, by Senator Inhofe and \nothers, concerning the politicization of the last BRAC process. We all \nknow that the administration seriously damaged the base closure process \nby its handling of the Commission's 1995 recommendations concerning \nMcClellan Air Force Base in California and Kelly Air Force Base in \nTexas. We need to let these issues settled. There are a lot of hard \nfeelings left over from that. We need to fully resolve these issues \nbefore we attempt another round.\n  BRAC should be focused on excess capacity, but it should not be an \nexcessively broad approach. We ought to target any future BRAC \nlegislation--we do not want every single installation in America to be \nin BRAC purgatory. I believe the Senator from Kansas, who is in the \nChair now, has used that term. And that is what happens. Everybody gets \nput in this purgatory and everybody has to hire all these consultants \nand experts to try to get out of purgatory and hopefully not go to \nHell, but hopefully wind up in Heaven, with their base preserved.\n  As the number of worldwide commitments increases for the Armed \nForces, we should be considering increasing the size of the Armed \nForces. We can make a very compelling case for that. I am willing to \nmake it. Further base closures could preclude that eventuality. What we \nlose, we never get back. For example, if we close a shipyard, imagine \nhow much time and effort and money we would have to expend, and how \nmany environmental hoops we would have to jump through to open another \nshipyard after it has been developed into condominiums along the harbor \nsomewhere. We will never be able to do it. Once it is gone, it is gone. \nWe need to understand that.\n  I think we have to look at it and ask ourselves this basic question: \nIs it now the time to reduce further our infrastructure for the purpose \nof some long-term savings that are going to cost us in the short term \nwhen there is all this uncertainty out there?\n  The Senator from Michigan very eloquently, in his statement, talked \nabout the percentage argument--that force structure has gone down 36 \npercent, personnel has gone down 40 percent, and base closings are only \ndown 18 percent. That sounds like a fair argument, and it sounds like \nyou ought to be able to put it all together, and there ought to be an \neven 36 or 40 percent cut in all areas. But that is not the case.\n  If you use an analogy of a football team, your team may be half the \nsize it used to be, but you still have to have a stadium to play in. So \nyou can reduce helmets and you can reduce personnel\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nand you can reduce support, bandages, or whatever you need for the \nplayers, but you still have to have a stadium.\n  So I do not think you can break it down that simply. It does not \nmatter whether you have a good team or a bad team, or whether you have \n75 players as backup or 12 players as backup, you still need a stadium, \nyou still need to have a certain amount of infrastructure to run the \nteam.\n  So I say this is very ill-advised. We do not know where we are going. \nI personally believe that right now, the way things are going in the \nworld, we are going to have to increase, not decrease, our personnel, \nincrease, not decrease, our forces, and if we are going to do all that, \nwe are going to have to have the infrastructure to support it.\n  So I hope this amendment will be defeated for those reasons alone, \nnot to mention the anguish the communities would have to go through.\n  I think it is important to understand that the President of the \nUnited States is calling up reserves right now, in great numbers, to be \ndeployed, Lord knows where--perhaps Bosnia, perhaps Kosovo; we do not \nknow just where. We do not know what other crisis may break out.\n  I just think it is a terrible time to think about taking down \ninfrastructure. What message does that send to the troops out there and \nto the people who support those troops all across the country in the \nbases and the infrastructure around those bases? What message does it \nsend to those people if we say, in spite of all of this increase in \nactivity around the world, we are now still going to eliminate more \ninfrastructure, not knowing what we need for the next crisis?\n  We can eliminate it at some point, if it is necessary. We are not \nsaving that much now to do it. As a matter of fact, even in the short \nterm it is costing us. So there is no rush here. I think we ought to \njust settle down, take a careful look at what we are doing, reevaluate \nour entire military structure--and in my view, increase the size of our \nforces--and not rush to judgment here with some additional base \nclosings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding time.\n  I think just about everything has been said here, but there are some \nconcerns I have that I would state in a little different way than the \nSenator from New Hampshire has stated them.\n  One is that we have gone through an artificial downsizing that is not \ncommensurate with the threat that is out there. The myth that has \nfloated around that the cold war is over, there is no longer a threat, \nis something that finally the American people are waking up and \nrealizing is not true. We are in the most threatened position today \nthat we have been in probably in the history of this country, with the \ndiverse types of opposition out there, the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and abilities to transport those weapons.\n  So I say, one of the strongest arguments against a BRAC round at this \ntime is, we have gone through four BRAC rounds. If we take the level of \nour infrastructure down to meet the level of the force strength, then \nwhen we start back up with the force strength, we will not have the \ninfrastructure that is necessary.\n  So we need to be looking at our rebuilding process. It would be like \ngoing through extensive BRAC processes back in the late 1970s--right \nbefore rebuilding, which is imminent. We are going to have to do it \nwith the new administration.\n  Secondly, as I think the Senator from New Hampshire articulated quite \nwell, we are in a really severe situation right now in terms of \nreadiness. Later on today I want a chance to elaborate on this and talk \nabout the fact that we are now at approximately one-half the force \nstrength that we were in 1991. In other words, we could not repeat our \neffort in the Persian Gulf war today.\n  This is being complicated by all these deployments to places where we \nshould not be. We should never have sent a troop or any effort or any \nassets into Bosnia; we should not have done that in Kosovo or Albania, \nor to Haiti, for all practical purposes, because that dilutes the \nalready scarce military assets we have.\n  I say this relates to this subject because we have a military system \nthat is hemorrhaging today. This is not something that we can wait \nuntil later to take care of. As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed \nout, anything that comes from a BRAC round, a new BRAC round, is going \nto cost money, not save money.\n  Now is when we are going to have to try to do something with our \nreadiness so that if General Hawley has to stand up and say something \nhas happened either in the Pacific theater, North Korea, or the Persian \nGulf, Iraq or Iran, we would be able to meet that. We cannot do that \ntoday. So this certainly would be ill-timed, even if you believe that \nit was a good idea to have future BRAC rounds.\n  I think also we need to look at the budget we are passing. I want to \ntalk about the inadequacy of what we are talking about in our \nauthorization bill. We are increasing by about $9 billion what the \nPresident's budget was. We have had testimony from the CINCs and from \nothers in the field and from the four-stars that this is totally \ninadequate. We are going to have to have at least a minimum increase of \n$24 billion each year for approximately 6 years.\n  Lastly, I would like to remind everybody of what happened in the last \nround, I believe, in the BRAC process. I was elected to the House in \n1986, and that is when we put this idea together. It was a Congressman \nfrom Texas, Dick Armey, who did it. The idea was to get politics out of \nthe BRAC process. Through round 1 and round 2 and round 3, there were \nno politics involved. They were not political decisions; they were \nrational decisions.\n  However, in the last round--and we all know what happened; no one is \ngoing to question this--the President went out there prior to the 1996 \nelection, to McClellan in California and to Kelly in Texas, in order to \nget votes and politicize the system.\n  You might say: Well, this is going to come along after he is gone. I \nam a little bit concerned about the fact that there is a possibility, a \nvery outside possibility, that Al Gore will succeed him. That being the \ncase, he was involved in politicizing this, too.\n  For those who believe we still have excess infrastructure, I would \nlike to have you consider that maybe we should wait until we see what \nthe new administration is going to look like, what kind of commitments \nare going to be made. As chairman of the committee that has oversight \nover the BRAC process, I suggest we wait and not pass this BRAC \nrecommendation today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much time does the Senator require?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Is there a UC on the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  I gave a lengthy statement last night. I will not go into everything \nthat I referred to, but I think there are several points that need to \nbe reiterated with respect to base closing.\n  I strongly oppose the base closing amendment that has been offered by \nSenator McCain and Senator Levin that would initiate another round in \nthe year 2001. We come back to the same issues that have yet to be \naddressed by the Department of Defense with respect to creating a \ncomprehensive analysis in terms of matching our infrastructure with our \nassets and the security threat mix that we can anticipate into the 21st \ncentury.\n  This is an analysis, in fact, that has been suggested and recommended \nby the National Defense Panel in order to have an overall assessment \nand accounting of exactly what we are going to need with respect to our \ndomestic infrastructure into the 21st century.\n  I think everybody acknowledges that we are facing different types of \nthreats today, more asymmetric, more unpredictable, more uncertain, far \nmore diverse, regional threats than we have\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\never encountered before. So as a result, it seems to me we need to have \nan accounting from the Defense Department as to exactly what are their \nneeds.\n  They keep telling us over and over again from the previous four \nrounds that we have achieved and realized billions and billions of \ndollars in savings. Yet we have been unable to track those savings. In \nfact, in the reports by the General Accounting Office in 1996 and then \nagain in 1997 and in addition to the Congressional Budget Office \nreports, all indicate the very same thing. It is very difficult to \nascertain the amount of savings derived from the previous base closing \nrounds, because the Department of Defense has never established a \nmechanism for tracking those savings.\n\n  I think it is important for us to have that data so we can document \nwhat has exactly been saved as a result of those four previous rounds.\n  When you look at this chart, this is in the General Accounting Office \nreport: Why BRAC Savings are Difficult to Track and Estimate Changes \nOver Time. DOD accounting systems are not designed to track savings. \nSome costs are not captured initially; i.e. the environmental costs.\n  Well, we now find out that they are going to have to spend at least \n$3 billion more in environmental mitigation than they anticipated.\n  Some savings cannot be fully captured--long-term recapitalization \ncosts. Again, we have found out in terms of sales, they anticipated \nthey would realize $3 billion in sales, and they have only received \nabout $65 million. So that is a great gap between what they projected \nfor revenues of sales and what they actually realized.\n  DOD components do not have incentives to track savings because \nbudgets may be reduced. Over time events may impact costs and savings \nthat could not have been known when estimates were developed.\n  On and on it goes. We have no way of knowing.\n  Then the Department of Defense has said, well, we have cut back on \npersonnel by 36 percent so, therefore, we should be reducing \ninfrastructure by 36 percent. Since we haven't done that, it should be \none on one, essentially, we should be reducing our infrastructure. But \nagain, these determinations should not be made by arbitrary percentages \nbut, rather, a documentation of exactly what we need for the future.\n  We have unpredictable challenges and, therefore, I think we should \nmake those decisions based on the assessment of what should be our \nmilitary infrastructure for the 21st century. Yet we have not had that \nkind of accounting.\n  I hope the Senate will not approve another round until we have the \nopportunity to have this kind of analysis from the Department of \nDefense they have resisted providing over the years.\n  In fact, in the 1998 Secretary's report on BRAC, it said additional \nrounds of BRAC in the years 2001 and 2005--that would be contingent on \ntwo rounds--would yield $21 billion in the years 2008 to 2015, the \nperiod covered by the QDR, and $3 billion every year thereafter.\n  But that is contradicted by the report by the Defense Department in \n1999 with respect to BRAC savings. It says with four BRAC rounds \nbetween 1995 and 1998, DOD invested approximately $22.5 billion to \nclose and realign 152 installations. So it costs as much to close those \nbases as what they are projecting for savings from another two rounds \nin the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. One additional minute.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The real challenge and the problem with these base closing \nrounds has been the fact that they are costing far more than what the \nDefense Department anticipated. I think it is important for us to have \nthe information and the verification from the Defense Department as to \nexactly what they have saved and how much it has cost and what they \nanticipate in the future. In addition, they have not even completed the \nfour previous rounds. They have yet to be totally implemented. So we \ncould be incurring additional costs.\n\n  Of course, the final dimension to the whole problem is all of the \ncontingency operations. We have had 25 contingency operations that have \ncost the Defense Department more than $20 billion. That has impacted \nreadiness and modernization.\n  I say to this administration that perhaps if they had more clear \nobjectives with respect to these operations, we could contain the \ncosts, but we should not put pressure on reducing our domestic \ninfrastructure if we are going to have more contingency operations in \nthe future that demand the use of our domestic installations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the McCain-Levin amendment. \nThe arguments that have been made this morning and this afternoon, I \nbelieve, speak rather clearly and directly to why this amendment is \nworthy of our colleagues' support today.\n  I also wish to express my strong support for S. 1059, the fiscal year \n2000 Department of Defense authorization bill being debated here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The first responsibility of our Government is to provide for a strong \nnational defense to protect America's security interests. The primary \nresponsibility of elected officials is to provide the leadership and \nthe wisdom to ensure it is used in the best interests of the American \npeople.\n  The percent of the gross domestic product we spend today on defense \nis lower than what it was just prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl \nHarbor. At the end of the cold war, there was excited talk about the \npeace dividend that would come, of course, from the decline in East-\nWest conflict as a result of the implosion of the Soviet Union and the \nreduction in defense spending that, of course, would logically follow.\n  There was also talk about a new global order. Some suggested that war \nmight be obsolete, thanks to the breakout of democracy around the \nglobe. This all sounded hauntingly familiar to the end of World War I \nand other periods in the history of the world. But there is a peace \ndividend. That dividend is the new freedoms and opportunities that have \nresulted from the peace and stability America and her allies won over \nthe last 50 years.\n  If we step back for a moment and review Korea, Vietnam, the Persian \nGulf, we understand in some rather direct terms what our stand and our \nallies' stand in those three areas of the world meant to stability, to \ncommitment, to using our forces in a positive way that, in fact, stood \nfor what was right in the world.\n\n  I am a veteran of Vietnam. I served in Vietnam in 1968, and I have \nheard many times of the stories written and the debate about whether it \nwas a wasted effort in Vietnam. I have responded this way: If America \nhad not taken a stand in Vietnam, aside from how we executed and \nprosecuted the war--if we had not taken a stand in Korea, Vietnam, and \nthe Persian Gulf, does anyone doubt that the face of Asia, the face of \nthe Middle East would be different than it is today? Of course it would \nbe. Would it be more in the interest of freedom and stability and \ndemocracy and market economies than it is today? I don't think so.\n  So, you see, it is not only having the ability to protect our \ninterests and preserve freedom and democracy, but the will and the \nleadership to make that commitment is just as important. There are new \nchallenges and new responsibilities today that we face, as the new \ndynamic world always provides, as we move into the next millennium.\n  During the cold war, we confronted one adversary on several fronts. \nToday, we confront several adversaries on several fronts. One of the \nconcerns that we must be very vigilant about over the next few years is \nnot placing America's interests in the world in a position to be \nblackmailed by nations who would threaten those interests by \nthreatening to use a weapon of mass destruction and for us, \nessentially, not only to be militarily incapable of responding to that \nblackmail and not having the leadership and the will to say we are not \ngoing to do that, that isn't going to happen. Actions have \nconsequences. Inactions have consequences.\n  America and her allies have done very well over the last 50 years to \nhelp\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nstabilize a very unstable world. Partly, that has been the result of \nour word meaning something, our commitment meaning something. But if we \ndon't have the military assets and the resources to be able to call \nupon that capacity to stop tyranny and war and instability, then in \nfact we place America in a terrible position and we threaten America's \nsecurity through the possibility of blackmail.\n  We must harbor our national defense resources wisely, of course. But \nwhen we do use them, we must follow the principles of the Powell \ndoctrine: Overwhelming force deployed decisively in the pursuit of \nclear objectives.\n  Rebuilding our military will not be cheap. America needs to \nunderstand that. This bill heads us in the right direction, but much \nmore is going to be required. We must not and we cannot build our \nmilitary based on budget caps or spending goals. Military spending must \nbe based on the threats and challenges we face in the world today. We \nmust protect our interests and help maintain global stability to ensure \nour long-term growth and prosperity.\n  The defense budget must flow from our national security interests, \nnot the other way around. The budget cannot drive our national security \ninterests. Our national security interests must drive the budget. If we \nmust find other means to take those resources and put them in our \nnational security budget, then we must do that. That will require \nprioritizing our budget, our resources. It will prioritize what we as \nAmericans believe our role in the world to be.\n  Every year, the nondefense nondiscretionary budget grows. You have \nheard the numbers in the last 2 days around here. For the last 14 \nyears, our defense budget has grown smaller. We have cut our defense \nbudget over the last 14 years. Every year, these other needs crowd out \nother spending priorities. Nondiscretionary entitlement programs are \nimportant, but they do us little good if the military is cut back to \nthe point that our interests are threatened around the world: oil \nsupplies are cut off, sealanes are blocked, citizens and corporations \nabroad are threatened, and our economy declines.\n\n  We must look for savings in the DOD budget, of course, push for \ngreater reforms, seek greater efficiencies, and tailor our military for \nfuture challenges. But we also must be willing to spend as much as we \nneed to protect our interests in this very uncertain, dangerous world. \nHaving a strong, capable military is only half of the challenge. We \nmust also have strong, capable political leadership. That leadership \nmust have the respect of the world, so that the world knows that that \nleadership of ours can connect the military capability that we employ; \nknowing when and where to use our military. Strong leadership, anchored \nby clear principles, beliefs, vision, and policy, has always had its \nown deterrent power.\n  Dictators fear strong leaders because they know strong leaders will \nact--despite public opinion polls, focus groups, short-term political \ngains, or leverage. Leaders understand that actions have consequences, \nand that inaction has consequences.\n  Last week, King Abdullah from Jordan was here and spoke rather \nclearly and plainly to this issue regarding NATO's involvement in \nKosovo. These are difficult times, but so have they always been. The \nreal debate that will consume the American electorate next year, and \nthe Presidential politics and this body next year, will be simply: What \nis America's role in the world? What leadership do we care to continue? \nWe must recognize that if another country is to replace America as the \nworld's leader, that new world leader may not be as benevolent as \nAmerica has been in this century.\n  I don't want that kind of a world to be inherited by my 6-year-old \nand 8-year-old. Richard Haas' new book, ``Reluctant Sheriff: The U.S. \nAfter the Cold War,'' lays it out clearly. That question about the role \nof America in the next century is a legitimate question. There should \nbe a relevant debate, with the relevant questions asked: What burdens \ndo we want to carry into the next century? Is it worth taking a \ndisproportionate share of the world's burdens, which we have always \nhad? I believe it is.\n  Henry Kissinger's piece in this week's Newsweek magazine, ``New World \nDisorder,'' speaks to this issue. Unexpected events happen in the world \ndaily. For example, last Sunday, a Chinese intelligence ship was sunk \nin the South China Sea. Supposedly, the Philippine Navy sunk it in an \narea that is contested. That is how fast flashpoints can bring world \npowers into conflict.\n  We need to commit ourselves now to rebuilding the U.S. military, \nreasserting ourselves on the world stage, and accepting the burdens \nthat come with leadership.\n  Can we imagine Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, or \nRonald Reagan whining about the burdens of leadership, whining about, \nwell, I don't know what the polls show or the focus groups show. Can we \nimagine those leaders governing and doing what they thought was in the \nbest interest of our Nation and the world based on the political whims \nand winds of the time? I don't think so.\n  America must continue to serve as the rock to which other democracies \naround the world can anchor. We must also continue to serve as the \nbeacon of freedom and justice for other nations and other peoples. \nAmerica has always inspired hope around the world, but we cannot lead \nthe world without a strong national defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, once again we have a BRAC authorization \nmeasure before us. And once again the same deficiencies that led to the \nfar-reaching political distortion of the prior, so-called \n``independent'' BRAC commissions, are ignored.\n  I voted against the first BRAC authorization back in February 1989. \nAt the time, I was one of only eight senators opposing the measure \nbecause, I said, it could not avoid political tampering. I was hoping \nto have been proven wrong. Unfortunately, I was not.\n  The proposal of my distinguished colleagues, Senators McCain and \nLevin, is well-intended. There is no question that a properly run BRAC \noutcome could lead to funds freed up for force modernization, military \npay increases, and many other badly needed defense needs, not the least \nof which is readiness. But it's not the motivation of my colleagues \nthat I worry about. Rather, I still question whether this process can \nbe completely objective. Whoever occupies the White House is also \nlikely to be misguided by the same kind of outside pressures and \npolitical interests that characterized the previous BRAC disasters.\n  And, on a more parochial note, I am simply not going to vote to put \nmy home state through this process again. We have proven over and over \nand over again that Hill Air Force Base and the other military \ninstallations based in my state are efficient, productive, and high \nquality. I am not going to vote to make them prove it again in a forum \nwhere the deck may already be stacked.\n  So with all due respect to my colleague from Arizona, I cannot \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the current \ndebate on the pending amendment which authorizes a round of military \nbase closings commencing in 2001. At this time I do not support a \nfurther round of base closings. Therefore, I oppose this amendment for \nthe following reasons.\n  I have repeatedly asked the Department of Defense, military bases in \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the Kentucky Department of Military \nAffairs for information and proof that the past rounds of base closings \nhave produced any savings to the Department of Defense or the U.S. \ntaxpayer. After repeatedly asking for this information to prove this \npoint, it has not been provided to me. Therefore, I need to see proof \nin savings and these savings need to be in ``real'' terms and without \nany accounting gimmicks and projected budgetary outcomes based on \nguesswork.\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\n  Many criticize the Department of Defense's current accounting \nmeasures. They say these accounting measures are not soundly based and \nthat these measures are used in decisions which result in an unjust \nimbalance between our military base infrastructure and the rest of the \nmilitary. Just because the Department of Defense is reduced in certain \nareas by a certain percentage, doesn't mean that our military base \ninfrastructure should be cut at the same percentage level. The \nDepartment of Defense needs to measure any downsizing of our military \nbase infrastructure in a formulaic way rather that just an across the \nboard cut done blindly and foolishly.\n  Also, I am not convinced that if savings were found from past base \nclosings, that the bases in Kentucky, Ft. Knox and Ft. Campbell, would \nbe protected and strengthened. I have recently been told by the U.S. \nArmy that these bases would not be harmed and that they would benefit \nfrom any future rounds of closings. The U.S. Army talked of these bases \nas being leading posts in their branches. However, I have not seen any \nnew strengths added to these bases from past closings and I have not \nbeen told of any specific missions which would be added to those bases \nin Kentucky. I need reassurance from the U.S. Army that these posts \nwill be protected by seeing the future plans for these posts and the \nspecific missions which would be added to them.\n  Furthermore, I am not convinced that our military in its current \nstate can do more with less. We are in a tangled mission in Yugoslavia, \nwe have major troop deployments around the Korean peninsula and around \nIraq, and we have U.S. troops scattered amongst some 40 other spots \nelsewhere in the world. Our deployments have increased dramatically \nover the past decade. If this trend of increased deployments continues, \nI cannot see the rationality of downsizing our military base structure \nin the midst of this pattern which seems to have no end.\n  In conclusion, I have not seen savings from past military base \nclosings. Even if I was convinced there were savings, I am not \nconvinced that the military bases and the soldiers that serve and work \nat those bases in Kentucky would be protected. I am concerned about \nminimizing our base structure while our soldiers and military do more \nwith less. Also, past base closings have been politicized at the \nPresidential level and I fear the process may continue down that path \nagain.\n  Because of these reasons, I oppose this amendment which authorizes \nanother round of base closings.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senators McCain and Levin authorizing a new round of base \nclosures. As the senior Senator from the state that has suffered the \ngreatest impact from the previous rounds, I believe that the base \nclosure process is deeply flawed and fundamentally unfair.\n  The first four rounds of base closure occurred too rapidly and too \nlittle effort was made to protect local communities from devastating \nlob loss and economic hardship. For those who say that adverse local \nimpact is a necessary consequence of reducing military infrastructure, \nI would like to describe how this process has effected California where \nsince the first BRAC round in 1988, 29 bases in California have been \nscheduled for closure or realignment.\n  Some claim that the process has been streamlined and every effort has \nbeen made to expedite the transfer of bases to the local community. I \nhave also heard claims that base closure can be a boon to the community \nby bringing new opportunities for job creation and economic \ndevelopment.\n  Now let's look at the facts. The California Trade and Commerce Agency \nestimates that the four rounds of BRAC cost 97,337 military and \ncivilian jobs. How many have been created? Less than 17,000. That is a \nnet job loss of more than 80,000 jobs.\n  The reason we are not seeing job creation or economic growth is \nbecause the land is simply not being transferred to the local \ncommunities as was originally planned. The process is so slow and \nbureaucratic that years go by before any development can be done on the \nclosed bases.\n  Again, the numbers prove this. The 29 closed bases represents 77,269 \nacres of land. The Federal Government has retained almost 25,000 for \nitself and 30,000 acres have yet to be transferred. That means that \nlocal communities have had access to less than 30 percent of the \nproperty that should have been made available to them. It is difficult \nto create jobs or stimulate economic growth without the land to do it.\n  That is the big picture of how the State of California has been \nimpacted by the base closure process. Here is the impact at the local \nlevel.\n  Every member of this body who has had a major base close in his or \nher state can tell a base closure horror story, but I believe the \nmagnitude of the loss that the city of Long Beach has faced makes it \nunique. In fact, if Long Beach were a state, it would rank in the top \nfive in terms of the number of jobs lost due to base closure.\n  The Long Beach Naval Station was closed as part of BRAC 1991. This \nresulted in the loss of more than 8,500 military and civilian jobs. The \ndirect loss of wage and contract was $400 million with an estimated \neconomic loss of another $1 billion annually.\n  As the city struggled to deal with this devastating blow, the federal \ngovernment dealt it another. In 1995, the Long Beach Naval Shipyard was \nscheduled for closure. The job loss from this action has been more than \n4,000 and it has caused another $1 billion in total economic loss.\n  The city's woes continued during negotiations with the Navy on the \nterms of the conveyance of the Naval Hospital. In 1964, the city had \nsold the property to the Navy for $10. Long Beach had a growing naval \ncommunity and the Navy had, in large part, been a good neighbor. In \nrecent years, that has proven not to be the case. The Navy demanded \n$8.5 million for the property. The same piece of property that the city \ngave to them for $10. In an effort to get the conveyance process \nmoving, the city reluctantly agreed to the price.\n  Now, at a time when the Clinton administration is proposing that all \ncurrent and future economic development conveyances be done at no cost, \nthe Department of Defense has thus far refused to renegotiate the deal. \nIt appears that the Pentagon, with a budget in excess of $250 billion, \nhas a greater need for the $8.5 million than Long Beach with a budget \nof just $330 million.\n  This is only one example of the multitude of problems with base \nclosure. It is an inefficient, bureaucratic, and ineffective process. I \nbelieve this is the wrong time to authorize a new round of closure. All \nwe would be doing is following one flawed procedure with another.\n  As California's example shows, local communities have not been given \nthe opportunity to recover from the four previous rounds. Delays caused \nby lack of funding and red tape have prevented the completion of land \ntransfers and the beginning of reuse.\n  I believe it is essential that we allow enough time for the base \nclosures of the 1990's to run their course before we deal them the \nchallenges of the 21st century closures. If nothing else, we owe that \nto our local governments. I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the good Senator from New \nHampshire would consider yielding me 3 minutes of his time so we can \npreserve the 10 minutes that we have left for Senator McCain who I \nunderstand is on his way over.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield 3 minutes to the opposition side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I greatly appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, we have had several years of debate now about the \nPresident's alleged role in the last base closure round on the \nprivatization-in-place proposals for Sacramento and San Antonio. This \njust simply cannot be allowed to be an issue, and it should no longer \nbe an issue. Because of the hard work of the Armed Services Committee, \nwe just resolved the depot issue in a fair way.\n  Our amendment deals with the privatization-in-place issue by \nincluding language for the 2001 BRAC round that would allow \nprivatization-in-place closing of a military installation only when it \nis recommended explicitly by the Base Closure Commission and when it is \nthe most cost-effective approach.\n  Our amendment also ensures the entire BRAC process takes place after \nthe next administration is in office. The\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nbase closure statute explicitly recognizes already that the President \ncan decide whether or not to have a BRAC round, and he can decide not \nto have a BRAC round simply by deciding not to nominate BRAC \ncommissioners. If the new President decides not to have a BRAC round, \nhe simply will not nominate the new commissioners. If there is a BRAC \nround, the new Secretary of Defense will oversee the process of the \nstatutory steps in the round done under the new administration under \nthe timetable which is in this amendment.\n  Short of banning people from even thinking about base closures until \n2001, there is just really nothing more that can be done to ensure that \nthere will be no politicization at all. I know there were strong \nfeelings on the 1995 round. But I don't think we should keep punishing \nthe taxpayers and keep spending money which we need for the men and \nwomen in uniform to have the right pay and the right equipment by \ncontinuing to raise the allegations which were leveled about the \nSacramento and San Antonio actions.\n  As it turned out, by the way, things came out quite well. The bidding \nteam that represented the privatization in place of those two \nfacilities lost during a competitive bidding process.\n  We have to be willing to take the heat. We can no longer just say \nthat the last round was politicized if, in fact, it was cured in the \nnext round. We just cannot eternally and constantly look back at these \nallegations and debate what may or may not have happened in the 1995 \nround as an excuse for not doing our duty here in 1999 in terms of \nsaving the money, which is so essential if we are going to have the \ndefense budget rationally devoted and rationally spent. We are talking \nhere about a significant chunk of money. We cannot waste this money. \nOur uniformed personnel and our civilian leadership are pleading with \nus to authorize an additional base closing round. This amendment \nassures that it is the next administration--not this one--which will \ndetermine whether to proceed with a base closing round. All we would be \ndoing is authorizing it. The next administration would be the one that \nwould be administering this next round. It would not be this \nadministration.\n\n  The timetable that we put in here assures every single statutory \nstep, from picking the commissioners to do the work that is necessary \nto sending in the recommendations. All of that will take place with the \nnew President and not with this President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could inquire about time. It is 1:30 \nnow; are we scheduled to vote on base closure at 1:45?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have followed the base closure \nrecommendations, the so-called BRAC issues, for many years, going back \nto my years in the House. We have been down this old BRAC road several \ntimes before. I have always been opposed to this approach.\n  I remember standing in the center well of the House years ago, \ntalking to Congressman Armey of Texas. He was talking about his \nconcept. I told him that I thought it was an abdication of \nresponsibility, but if he wanted to pursue it, here is how to do it, \nand here is how it has to come through the Rules Committee. He took \nnotes copiously and pursued it and it went through.\n  I think this is one more example where we and the administrations are \navoiding the tough choices. For years, for 100 years, when there was a \nneed to close a base, the administration, the Pentagon, the Department \nof Defense sent up recommendations of surplus or unneeded bases that \nCongress, through the authorization process, appropriations process, \nconsidered those recommendations and made a decision to close them or \nnot.\n  Over the years, as it became more and more difficult to close \nremaining bases or to make increasingly tough decisions, these so-\ncalled BRAC rounds gained popularity and were pushed and, in fact, \npassed through the Congress. I don't think this is the way it should be \ndone and I maintain it has not worked well.\n  In many cases, bases were closed, including several in my State. I go \nquite often now to those former bases as we continue to work to get new \nbusiness and industry to come into those facilities. The tough \ndecisions were made. We did our job.\n  So the first thing I recommended is let's do our job. I discussed \nthat with Secretary of Defense Cohen and he, of course, smiled and said \nyes, but we probably won't get them closed.\n  I believe if the case is made and they recommend a surplus, that \ncould be done--maybe not as many as they would like, but the process is \nthere and we should honor that process.\n  We have had these base closure proceedings in the past. They have \nbeen painful. They cause tremendous upheavals in the defense community. \nIn the communities where it happens, millions of dollars have been \nspent trying to defend against closures or, once a closure decision has \nbeen made, trying to find a way to make use of the base.\n  For such communities, losing a base is more than just an economic \nloss; it is an emotional loss and a blow to the core of their identity. \nThese are just not nameless, faceless people involved. In most military \ncommunities, personnel from the base are church leaders, little league \ncoaches, and scout masters, not just men and women with money to spend. \nCommunities that lose a base lose much more than economic well-being; \nthey lose friends, neighbors, and community leaders. I think it is very \nimportant that we remember what this process does to communities and to \nthe people who are involved.\n  I maintain the ones that we have had in the past have worked pretty \nwell, although some bases are still not fully closed. The environmental \ncleanups have not happened in other instances. Many of these \nfacilities, now, are just sitting there.\n  I recommend before we go to another round, if we ever do, of base \nclosures, we ought to let the ones that have already been recommended \nfully run out the string. Let's see what we have saved.\n  I am told a good bit of money will be saved this year from the base \nclosures. But if you read the little asterisk down at the bottom, it \ndoesn't include, for instance, environmental cleanup costs.\n  So if you look at the impact this has had on our communities, on our \ndefense installations, and what has actually come from it, I think it \nis not good judgment to go forward with another round now. Think about \nwhat we are doing. Think about the timing.\n  Here we are at a time when our defense capabilities are being \nstretched to the maximum steaming time, time our men and women are out \non ships and they are on remote assignments, at a time when our troops \nare in combat this very day, we are talking about closing installations \nor closing facilities back here at home.\n  Also, a side note: Just last week we passed a bill that provided \nmoney for construction of more military facilities in Europe, so we are \ngoing to be adding a half billion dollars in new construction in \nEurope. Maybe it is needed. Maybe that says we have acted too hastily \nin drawing down in Europe. We allowed our facilities--the runways, the \nair traffic control towers, the housing facilities--to deteriorate even \nthere. But at a time when we are going to be spending money in Europe, \nwe are talking about cutting back here at home. Are American \nservicemembers going to return to find that while the bases overseas \nare being rebuilt there are ``For Rent'' signs on the ones they left \nback home in the United States?\n\n  I think, first of all, the whole idea of doing it through a \ncommission is not wise. Second, I do not think we have completed the \nprocess of the base closure decisions that have already been made. \nThird, the timing could not be worse.\n  Let's look at this more. Let's make sure we can stop the free fall \nour defense has been going through in readiness, in morale of our \ntroops, in recruitment and retention. It is just one more factor that \ncan serve as a discouragement to our men and women in the military. \nSome people say, let's go ahead and do it, the Department of Defense \nwants to do it this way--instead of doing their job, in my opinion--and \nit probably will not affect me.\n  I have a list I recommend Senators review before they cast their \nvotes. This list will be available in the Senators' cloakrooms. I will \nhave them on desks. I will have it in my hand. Look at the bases that \nwere on the list that\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nwere not closed in the past. These will be the ones that probably would \nbe first choice to be reviewed again. Just in the State of California, \nyou are talking about 15 facilities. It covers the entire country. It \ncovers facilities in almost every State.\n  When I look down this list, it really scares me, the facilities that \ncould be considered for closing, what it would do in those communities \nand what it would do to our military capabilities. So take a look at \nthis list before you cast this vote. Maybe sometime in the future we \nwill need to take another look at it.\n  But I still think there is fallout from the fact that the last \nclosure did become tangled up in political decisions. There is a very \nstrong feeling that some of the decisions recommended by the BRAC were \nchanged or evaded subsequently. I remember Secretary of Defense Cohen \nbelieving very strongly he was not given the information he was \nentitled to when the Base Closure Commission was acting involving the \nState of Maine. We need to spend more time thinking about this. We \nshould get over this hump we are at right now of our military \ncapability and the involvement we have now in the Balkans. Maybe \nanother year.\n  I will tell you what I think we ought to do. Let's try doing it the \nway it was done for 100 years. Let's try doing it through the normal \nprocess. I support commissions sometimes. I guess the day might come \nwhen I would support one in this area. But I do not think this is the \nright time and I do not think this is the right way to go about it.\n  If the DOD feels further base closures are needed, the most logical \nsolution I see is for the Pentagon to identify bases it no longer \ndecides are necessary and submit these findings to us. Show the \nCongress where the redundancy and obsolescence are. I have full faith \nthat this body is capable of looking objectively at our defense needs \nand determining whether a base has outlived its usefulness.\n  Where is accountability in the BRAC process? We in Congress should \nnot be abdicating congressional authority to some ad hoc commission. In \nthis time of severe military drawdowns and austere budget cuts, I think \nit is all too easy for us to pass the buck and allow a commission, \nwhich has no obligation to answer to any constituency, to further strip \nour military. I do not think we were elected to leave all the difficult \nchoices to a special commission. The average American feels very \nstrongly about our national defense, and its important that the buck \nstops here when it comes to ensuring our military readiness.\n  So I urge my colleagues, before they vote, look at this list. Think \ncarefully about what you are doing. Can we be assured this will be done \nin a totally objective way? What will be its impact on our military \nright now? I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Warner, for \nhis thoughtfulness in this area. He has generally, in the past, been \nsupportive of this effort, even when it affected his own State. He has \nstood up and said, We will do our own part. You have to commend him for \nthat. But he, this time, has said this is not the right time; maybe \nanother day, maybe another way, but not now.\n  That is what I hope the Senate will do. I hope the Senate will vote \nagainst this next round at this time.\n  I might emphasize, earlier on there was a recommendation we have two \nrounds, 2001-2005. It was considered we would exclude certain areas and \nallow the others to go forward. I think the principle of that is wrong. \nMy own State might be exempted and everybody else might have to deal \nwith it--that is wrong. We should not do things that way. We should \nhave a fair, across-the-board policy. I think that is the way we should \ndo it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is interesting the leader brings up \n``the old-fashioned way,'' because when I was Secretary of the Navy, \ncirca 1971, 1972, 1973, I closed the Boston Naval Shipyard and the \ndestroyer base, where Senator Jack Reed and Senator Chafee were very \nmuch interested in that. We did it the old-fashioned way. I must say we \ncame down here and we had hearings. I remember in the caucus room, \nSenators Pastore and Pell sat there and grilled me and the Chief of \nNaval Operations for the better part of a day. But it worked out. So \nthere is a precedent for doing it the old-fashioned way.\n  I say to my distinguished leader, I was the coauthor of the first \nBRAC bill and the second BRAC bill. But the commission concept was \npredicated on trust and fairness. Regrettably, Mr. Leader, that was \nlost in the last round when, as you know, in the California and Texas \nsituations, the sticky fingerprints of politics got in there.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, all the communities across the country, once a \nBRAC process is initiated, they go to general quarters and they hire \nthese expensive lobbyists and all types of people to try to make sure \ntheir case, should it work its way up through the system, is treated \nfairly. That is all they really ask. Unless there is trust in the \nsystem, we cannot achieve a commission concept of closures.\n  Maybe we can induce the Secretary of Defense to try it the old-\nfashioned way and give it a shot. I commit to work fairly and \nobjectively if you put it right on the table. I thank the leader for \nhis strong position.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Warner.\n  Let me point out another instance of another Secretary of the Navy, \nSenator Chafee of Rhode Island. When he was Secretary of the Navy, the \ndecision was made, and it was very difficult, but the decision was made \nto basically mothball the Davisville, RI, Seabee base. I think it is \nstill maintained in a state of readiness, but the number of troops and \nemployees were substantially reduced. But he had done his job. We have \ndone our job in the past without a commission.\n  By the way, right now there are lawyers and various people going \naround the States saying, get ready, there is going to be another BRAC, \nyou better hire me so I can make sure your case is made. I think that \nis wrong and I thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Members to vote against this base closure \ncommission proposal. I have always opposed this procedure. I opposed it \nin the House in the eighties, even though I remember talking to \nCongressman Armey from Texas about the merits and demerits and how he \ncould proceed to get it done. He did it quite well.\n  We have been through not one, not two, but 2\\1/2\\ rounds of base \nclosure commissions. I think it is wrong in principle, because we are \nabdicating, once again, our responsibility to make decisions about what \nis best for a strong national defense to a commission. For 100 years, \nif bases, depots, or facilities needed to be closed, the Department of \nDefense made recommendations to Congress, the Appropriations Committee \nreviewed the recommendations and made decisions, and bases and \nfacilities were closed. I know of three in my own State of Mississippi \nthat were closed in the fifties and sixties, probably with good \njustification.\n  I can remember when the Secretary of the Navy was John Warner of \nVirginia. Some tough decisions were made, recommendations were made to \nthe Congress, and facilities were closed. The same thing occurred when \nSenator Chafee was Secretary of the Navy. That system worked for 100 \nyears. Some 15 or 20 years ago, it got harder and harder to get \nCongress to go along with this and the commission idea came along.\n  I think we ought to go back and do it the way it was originally \nintended. Let's do our job. I think when Members say we will never have \nany facilities closed, history belies that fact.\n  My next point is, we have been through these 2\\1/2\\ rounds. They were \na terrible experience for the communities and for the States involved \nthat have facilities that are impacted. I maintain that we haven't yet \nquite felt the impact or gotten the benefit of the base closure rounds \nthat have already been done. We still have facilities that have not \nbeen completely closed or the environmental cleanup has not been \naccomplished. We don't know whether we really saved money or not.\n  I urge we not go to another round until we have been able to assess \ncompletely how the earlier rounds worked or didn't work, what the \ncleanup costs were, what the real impact was on the communities.\n  I must say, the timing is terrible, at a time when we are asking our \nmilitary men and women for more and more in terms of steaming time, \ntime spent on\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\nremote assignments, and, in fact, at this very moment Americans are \ninvolved in a bombing campaign in the Balkans.\n  Just last week we passed legislation providing about half a billion \ndollars to add to facilities in Europe. At a time when we are spending \nmore money for facilities in Europe to upgrade or replace facilities \nthat probably we should have already done, we are talking about setting \nup a process to close them in the United States. I don't think that is \nvery wise.\n  It also comes at a time when our readiness is falling, when our \nretention and recruitment is declining. We are trying to do something \nabout that by adding some money for readiness and for the future needs \nof the military, to increase the pay for our military men and women. \nThis is just one more little stick in the eye that will affect, I \nthink, adversely, the morale of our military men and women.\n\n  Finally, and not the least, I maintain that last time politics got \nvery much involved in the base closure round. Bases that were supposed \nto be closed in California and Texas found a way to evade that. It was \nnot just one or two States; it happened in several different places. I \ndon't think the system worked very well.\n  I don't think we should do this now. I think we ought to wait and \nassess what has happened, do it at a time when we are not basically at \nwar. Let's wait until the next administration comes in. We don't know \nwhether it will be Republican or Democrat. Let's take a look at this \nthing in 2001. If, in fact, we haven't been able to get rid of some of \nthe excess or unneeded facilities, and if we are not at war, if we have \nbeen able to turn around our needs for readiness and the morale and \nretention of our troops, I will take a look at it. I don't think this \nis the right thing to do. I don't think it is the right time. I think \nit is wrong in principle.\n  I could have probably found a way to limit this base closure in a way \nthat would have been responsible, and it would also probably have \nspared my own State, but I thought that was wrong. I don't think I \nought to be trying to find a way to spare my own situation and let \nothers bear the brunt of the decision. We ought to do it all the way or \nnot.\n  What we ought to do is let the Pentagon make the recommendations and \nact on them.\n  Finally, any Members who think this is fine, don't worry, it will \naffect somebody else, I have a list here of bases, depots, and \nfacilities that were on the list of earlier base closure rounds that \nwere not closed. These are the likely facilities to be affected. This \nis not a free vote in isolation, where Members can let somebody else \npay the piper. Members can take a look and see how it would impact New \nYork or Michigan or Ohio before casting a vote. Ask yourself when you \nlook at the facilities: Are these excess? Are these unneeded \nfacilities? I think that might affect your decision.\n  We should defeat this. We should go on and pass this very good \ndefense authorization bill that has been developed by the committee, \nwithout this provision in there.\n  Maybe another day, another time, would see it differently or we would \nneed to vote differently, but not here and now. I urge the defeat of \nthe base closure commission amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \namendment for approximately 5 minutes. I probably will not take that \nlong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, all I can assume is that perhaps this vote \nmay be getting close because a list was distributed, which can only be \nto try to frighten Members, which has no basis in anything except the \nimagination of some Senate staffer. It is really unfortunate we have to \nget into this kind of damn foolishness. I mean really, this is just \nfoolishness. It does not have my State on it, yet three bases were \n``considered'' by BRAC between 1991 and 1995. Whoever is responsible \nfor this really ought to be a little ashamed--a little ashamed, maybe.\n  The process exists. It was used before. Every single expert, whether \nthey be inside or outside the military--unless they are a Member of \nCongress--says that we have to close bases. Find me one, find me one \nmilitary expert, former Secretary of Defense, any general, any admiral, \nany expert, anyone from a think tank, right or left on the political \nspectrum, Heritage Foundation, Brookings--find one. Find one who does \nnot say we have too many bases and we have to go through a procedure to \nclose them. This procedure was used in years past.\n  Strangely enough, strangely enough we have arguments like it costs \nmore money to close bases than it does to keep them open. If that is \nthe case, we ought to build more bases. If that is the case, we never \nshould have closed the bases after World War II. The fact is, that has \nsaved billions and will save billions.\n  We have young men and women at risk all over the world who are not \nproperly equipped, who are not properly trained, who are leaving the \nmilitary--11,000 people on food stamps and we have not even got the \nnerve and the political will, some might even say guts, to do the right \nthing. The right thing is to save money, transfer that money to the men \nand women in the military who are serving under very difficult \nconditions with equipment that has not been modernized, with a \nreadiness level that we have not seen since the 1970s, and morale at an \nall-time low. Meanwhile, our commitments grow and grow and grow.\n  I guess, given this incredible, bizarre list that some intellectually \ndishonest staffer--intellectually dishonest staffer compiled, we will \nprobably lose this vote. But I tell you, this will not be a bright and \nshining hour for the Senate of the United States of America.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, just to advise the Senate, there is a \nlikelihood the Senator from Washington will be recognized for an \namendment at the completion of this vote. It is still being worked on, \nbut we hope to be able to accommodate the Senator.\n  The pending business, of course, at the end of the vote, would be the \nLott amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Do we have any time left on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent for a minute for the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will not be supporting the McCain \namendment. I am not supporting it for a very simple reason. I felt the \nBRAC method was very political. It was hyped as: Oh, this is \nnonpolitical; it is going to be based on the merits.\n  I was not at all convinced that was the case. When you really sat \ndown afterwards and picked the winners and losers, it was pretty clear \nthat a lot went into that decision that was political.\n  Second, we have not seen, as the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, has \nstated, the kind of savings that we were promised because bases were \nclosed and then their missions were recreated somewhere else.\n  California got hit so hard I could not even begin to tell you the \noverwhelming economic impact that we have taken. We still have bases, I \nsay to my friends, that are sitting there that have not even been \ncleaned up and cannot be reused.\n  So I will not be supporting the McCain amendment. I hope it will not \npass. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n393.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced, yeas 40, nays 60, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 147 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     DeWine\n     Feingold\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thompson\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Lautenberg\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 393) was rejected.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am ready to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now consider an \namendment by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, an amendment re: \nDOD privately funded abortions, that there be 1 hour for debate prior \nto a motion to table, with the time equally divided and controlled, \nwith no intervening amendment in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, may I \npropound a request to the chairman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the chairman yields the floor for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will do that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as you know, it takes unanimous consent to \nallow the Murray amendment to come forward. Any person can object, \nbecause you have two amendments pending. I have, I believe, worked out \nan agreement with the distinguished ranking member to have the vote on \nthe reconsideration of the amendment, where there was a tie vote \nyesterday, occur either at 5 or after the disposition of the Kerrey \namendment, whichever is sooner. If that could be added to your \nunanimous consent request, I think that would be agreeable to both \nsides. I have no objection to Senator Murray bringing her amendment up. \nI simply do not want to leave this matter pending past 5 o'clock, if we \ncan avoid it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to accommodate the Senator. I \npresume you would want 3 minutes for each side to speak to the \namendment prior to that vote taking place.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be willing to do that. But, quite frankly, we had \na time limit. It has been exhausted. If it would accommodate the body, \nI would agree to just have the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is the Senator from Michigan does not \ndesire any time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Neither one of us is asking for it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think we have made our cases.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me amend my unanimous consent request to incorporate \nthe request from the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Virginia, as modified?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I just want to see if there \nis any problem on that relative to Senator Kerrey. I don't know why \nthere would be, offhand, but we are trying to make sure there is no \nproblem. It is fine with me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, we have bent over \nbackwards all day to accommodate him. We will continue to do so. \nWhatever the problem, we will solve it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is fine with me. He has also been very accommodating \nto us. I just want to see if I can get a signal. Do we know whether or \nnot Senator Kerrey would have any objection to that?\n  Mr. President, may I suggest the absence of a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will acknowledge the request for the \nquorum, but I think one Senator seeks recognition for an administrative \npurpose, and I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tony \nBlaylock, a legislative fellow from my office, be granted the privilege \nof the floor for the duration of the defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I suggest to the ranking member that another \nMember, the Senator from Colorado, desires to address another matter. \nRather than putting in a quorum call, I would like to have agreement \nthat the Senator proceed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could we ask the Senator from Colorado about how long his \nremarks will be?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Maybe I don't need to have this special provision we \ntalked about. I talked with the staff of the chairman, and they said \nall we had to do was file the amendment. I filed the amendment and I am \nhappy. I think we are in good shape. It is there, where we can bring it \nup immediately.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will put it in the Record as of now that you have done \nthat, if you will address the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 396\n\n   (Purpose: To substitute provisions regarding the Civil Air Patrol)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside \nthe following amendments for the purpose of introducing my amendment \nNo. 396 and then we would go back to the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, would you describe in two \nsentences the nature of the amendment so other Senators can be \nacquainted with it.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The nature of the amendment is that it strikes a \nprovision dealing with the Civil Air Patrol, brings them under the \ndirect control of the Air Force. We want to strike out that provision \nand then set up a report and review of an incident that has occurred \nwith CAP through GAO and the Inspector General. Real briefly, that is \nwhat the amendment is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could advise the Senator from \nColorado, in fairness to all colleagues, Senator Inhofe, a fellow \ncommittee member, has a position, I think, different from yours; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. There could be other Senators, many Senators, interested \nin this Civil Air Patrol issue. I am happy to lay it down, and at such \ntime as we can get a reconciliation of viewpoints, we hope to proceed. \nHow much time do you think you would need so other Senators----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Virginia would suspend for \na second so the clerk can report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Cleland, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Reid, \n     Mr. Campbell, Mr. Murkowski, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 396.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 904, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 904. MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that no \n     major change to the governance structure of the Civil Air \n     Patrol should be mandated by Congress until a review of \n     potential improvements in the management and oversight of \n     Civil Air Patrol operations is conducted.\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\n       (b) GAO Study.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a \n     study of potential improvements to Civil Air Patrol \n     operations, including Civil Air Patrol financial management, \n     Air Force and Civil Air Patrol oversight, and the Civil Air \n     Patrol safety program. Not later than February 15, 2000, the \n     Inspector General shall submit a report on the results of the \n     study to the congressional defense committees.\n       (c) Inspector General Review.--(1) The Inspector General of \n     the Department of Defense shall review the financial and \n     management operations of the Civil Air Patrol. The review \n     shall include an audit.\n       (2) Not later than February 15, 2000, the Inspector General \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     on the review, including, specifically, the results of the \n     audit. The report shall include any recommendations that the \n     Inspector General considers appropriate regarding actions \n     necessary to ensure the proper oversight of the financial and \n     management operations of the Civil Air Patrol.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask for an hour equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I thank the Chair for the guidance. I thought the \namendment had been logged in.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am wondering whether the Senator from \nVirginia would consider the following approach: after the disposition \nof the Murray amendment, that there then be an hour of debate on the \nKerrey amendment and, immediately following the disposition of the \nKerrey amendment, that the reconsideration vote occur on the Gramm \namendment, precluding second-degree amendments to the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will have to ask my colleague to \nwithhold that request. I will work on it, and I think we can \naccommodate all interested parties.\n  Now, my understanding from the Chair is, we proceed to the \namendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has a unanimous \nconsent request pending. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not able to hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia had a unanimous \nconsent request pending. Is the Senator withdrawing that request?\n  Mr. WARNER. No. I thought I had a unanimous consent request to \nproceed to the amendment of the Senator from Washington for a period \nnot to exceed 1 hour, at the conclusion of which there would be a \nmotion to table and then, of course, a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, all I want \nto do is work out a time to bring up a vote that we are not even going \nto debate on. I will be happy to have it either after the Kerrey \namendment or at 5 o'clock. There is some concern here about limiting a \nsecond amendment, apparently, on the Kerrey amendment. I do not have a \ndog in that fight.\n  We are in a position where I can't exercise my right, because we have \ntwo amendments, now three amendments, that are pending, which makes the \nfloor manager sort of a gatekeeper. But it also makes anyone else a \ngatekeeper. All I am asking is if I could get an agreement on a time \ncertain basis and/or following something else. I am not trying to be \ndifficult to deal with; I just would like to work this out before we go \non.\n  If 5 o'clock is all right, we can stop whatever we are doing at that \npoint and have the vote. I do not even require any more debate. I just \nwant to settle this issue. I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor. There \nis a unanimous consent request pending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, so the \nfloor managers may have the opportunity to have the consent request, \nwould the Chair repeat the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think I can clarify the situation very \nquickly.\n  The Senator from Virginia has propounded a UC to permit the Senator \nfrom Washington to have an hour equally divided, after which time there \nwill be a tabling motion by the Senator from New Hampshire and then a \nvote.\n  That was before the Chair at the time our colleague from Texas sought \nrecognition for the purpose of trying to reconcile an understanding \nbetween himself and the ranking member. Apparently, at this time, we \ncannot achieve that reconciliation. It is my hope that the two Senators \ncan continue to work and will permit the Senate to go forward with the \namendment of the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, may I just suggest that we set the vote at \n5 o'clock and leave the Kerrey amendment alone? The net result is the \nsame. The Senator was willing to agree a moment ago to do it. If the \nKerrey amendment is what is in dispute, it seems that it would have \nproduced this result before. So I just urge my friend from Michigan to \nallow us to settle the issue. We are going to do it without intervening \ndebate. But the problem is that I have privilege under the rules of the \nSenate, and that is being precluded by the stacking of amendments that \nrequire a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are ready to solve it. Would the Senator have \na colloquy with our colleague?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my understanding is that the chairman has \nno objection if at 5 o'clock we have the vote on reconsideration, even \nthough we were in the middle of another debate. I have no objection if \nhe doesn't.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is probably what will happen. In the middle of debate \non another amendment, we will go back to the reconsideration. I have no \nobjection to that happening at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have done that before. It may be somewhat \ninconvenient, but it is important to keep the momentum of this bill \ngoing. We have had superb cooperation from all Senators. I would like \nto make note that we have only had two quorum calls in 3 days.\n  Mr. President, I now propound a unanimous consent request that the \nSenator from Washington be permitted to go forward with her amendment \nat this time, with a 1-hour time agreement, equally divided between the \nSenator from Washington and the Senator from New Hampshire, and at the \nconclusion of that hour, there be a motion to table by the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and then a rollcall vote. We will get the yeas and nays \nlater.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have the 5 o'clock vote on the reconsideration, \ncorrect?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I add to that a 5 o'clock vote on \namendment No. 392.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I do not have an objection, but I would \nlike to make an inquiry. At some point, I would like to be in a \nposition to do what Senator Allard has done, which is to introduce an \namendment and then lay it aside for the appropriate consideration at \nits due time. Would it be appropriate, after we have taken action on \nthe unanimous consent, or as part of the unanimous consent, that I \nwould be given an opportunity to introduce an amendment and then lay it \naside?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just ask if we could have one variation. \nAt the conclusion of the vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington, I would be prepared to work out an opportunity for the \nSenator from Florida to be recognized and lay down an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Virginia?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6011-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6011-S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kerrey, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Jeffords, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 397.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In title VII, at the end of subtitle B, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 717. RESTORATION OF PREVIOUS POLICY REGARDING \n                   RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``(a) Restriction on Use \n     of Funds.--''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is the Murray-Snowe amendment that \nconcerns our brave young women who serve in the military and their \nright to pay for their own safe, reproductive health care services. I \nam here today, again joined by Senator Snowe and many others, to offer \nour amendment to protect military personnel and their dependents' \naccess to safe, affordable, and legal reproductive health care \nservices.\n  That is exactly what this amendment is all about--access to safe, \naffordable, and legal reproductive health care services. That is why \nthe Department of Defense supports this amendment, as does the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The Department of Defense \nrecognizes that it has a responsibility to ensure the safety of all of \nits troops, including our women.\n  Many of you may wonder why Senator Snowe and I continue to offer this \namendment year after year. Why don't we just give up? Let me tell my \ncolleagues, the reason I come to the floor every year during the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill is to continue to educate in \nthe hope that a majority of you will finally stand up for all military \npersonnel.\n  As I have in the past, I come here today to urge my colleagues to \nguarantee to all military personnel and their dependents the same \nrights and guarantees that are enjoyed by all American citizens. These \nrights should not stop at our border. We should not ask military \nservice women to surrender their rights to safe, affordable, legal \nreproductive health care services because they have made a commitment \nto serve our country.\n  Many of our military personnel serve in hostile areas in countries \nthat do not provide safe and legal abortion services. Military \npersonnel and their families should not be forced to seek back-alley \nabortions, or abortions in facilities that do not meet the same \nstandards that we expect and demand in this country. In many countries, \nwomen who seek abortions do so at great risk of harm. It is a \nterrifying process.\n  I heard from a service woman in Japan who was forced to go off base \nto seek a legal abortion. Unfortunately, there was no guarantee of the \nquality of care, and the language barrier placed her at great risk. She \nhad no way of understanding questions that were asked of her, and she \nhad no way of communicating her questions or concerns during the \nprocedure. Is that the kind of care that we want our service personnel \nto receive? Don't they deserve better? I am convinced that they do.\n  This amendment is not--let me repeat is not--about Federal funding of \nabortions. The woman herself would be responsible for the cost of her \ncare, not the taxpayer. This amendment simply allows women who are in \nour services to use existing military facilities that exist already to \nprovide health care to active-duty personnel and their families. These \nclinics and hospitals are already functioning. There would be no added \nburden.\n  I also want to point out that this amendment would not change the \ncurrent conscience clause for medical personnel. Health care \nprofessionals who object to providing safe and legal health care \nservices to women could still refuse to perform them. Nobody in the \nmilitary would be forced to perform any procedure he or she objects to \nas a matter of conscience.\n  For those of you who are concerned about Federal funding, I argue \nthat current practice and policy results in more direct expenditures of \nFederal funds than simply allowing a woman herself to pay for the cost \nof this service at the closest medical military facility.\n  Today, when a woman in the military needs an abortion or wants an \nabortion, she first has to approach her duty officer to request from \nhim or her medical leave. Then she has to ask for transport to a U.S. \nbase with access to legal abortion-related services. Her duty officer \nhas to grant the request, remove her from active duty, and transport \nher to the United States. This is an expensive, taxpayer-funded, and \ninefficient system. Not only is there cost of transportation, but there \nis cost to military readiness when active personnel is removed for an \nextended period of time.\n  As we all know, women are no longer simply support staff in the \nmilitary. Women command troops and are in key military readiness \npositions. Their contributions are beyond dispute. While women serve \nside by side with their male counterparts, they are subjected to \narchaic and mean-spirited health care restrictions. Women in the \nmilitary deserve our respect and they deserve better treatment.\n  In addition to the cost and the loss of personnel, we have to ask: \nWhat is the impact on the woman's health? A woman who is stationed \noverseas can be forced to delay the procedure for several weeks until \nshe can get her travel to the United States where she can get safe, \nadequate, legal health care. For many women, every week an abortion is \ndelayed is a risk to her health.\n  Why should a woman who is serving our country in the military be \nplaced at a greater risk than a woman who is not serving in the \nmilitary?\n  In talking about this amendment, I am often struck by how little some \nof my colleagues know about restrictions on reproductive health care \nservices in many other countries. Many of my colleagues may be \nsurprised to learn that in some countries abortions are illegal, and \npunishment is swift and brutal--not just against the provider but \nagainst the woman as well. In these cases, a back-alley abortion can be \ndeadly. Not only are they risking their own health, but they are also \nrisking their own safety and well-being.\n  We are talking about women who are serving us overseas in the \nmilitary. Why should we put our military personnel in this kind of \ndanger?\n  We are fortunate in this country, because abortion is an extremely \nsafe procedure when it is performed by trained medical professionals. \nHowever, in the hands of untrained medical professionals in \nunsterilized facilities abortion can be dangerous and risky to a \nwoman's health. The care that we expect--actually the care that we \ndemand--is simply not universal.\n  Regardless of what some of my colleagues may think about the \nconstitutional ruling that guarantees a woman\n\n[[Page S6013]]\n\na right to a safe abortion without unnecessary burdens and obstacles, \nit is the law of our land. Roe v. Wade provides women in this country \nwith a certain right and a guarantee. While some may oppose this right \nto choose, the Supreme Court and a majority of Americans support this \nright. However, active-duty servicewomen who are stationed overseas \ntoday surrender that right when they make the decision to volunteer and \nto defend all of us.\n  It is sadly ironic that we send them overseas to protect our rights, \nyet in the process we take their rights away from them.\n  I urge my colleagues to simply give women in the military the same \nprotection whether they serve in the United States or overseas. Please \nallow women the right to make choices without being forced to violate \ntheir privacy, and, worse, jeopardize their health. This is and must be \na personal decision. Women should not be subjected to the approval or \ndisapproval of their coworkers or their superiors. This decision should \nbe made by the woman in consultation with her doctor.\n  The amendment that is before us simply upholds the Supreme Court \ndecision. It is not about Federal funding. It is not about forcing \nthose who constitutionally object to providing these services. It is \nsimply about the degree that we recognize the role of women in the \nmilitary and whether we give them the respect that I argue they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, \nwhat time she would like to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nWashington for, once again, providing leadership on this most \nsignificant issue. As she said, it is regrettable that we have to come \nback to the floor to seek support for our women in uniform who happen \nto be assigned overseas for this very basic right. I commend her for \nintroducing this legislation once again to repeal the ban on privately \nfunded abortions at overseas military hospitals.\n  It is unfortunate that this amendment is even necessary. It is \nunfortunate that we have to be here fighting for it once again. How \ncould this debate be necessary? How can it be that this blatant wrong \nstill needs to be righted? Yet, here we are, once again, having to \nargue a case that basically boils down to providing women who are \nserving this country overseas with the full range of constitutional \nrights, options, and choices that would be afforded them as American \ncitizens on American soil.\n  We are here today because the U.S. law denies the right to choose to \n227,000 spouses and dependents stationed with our servicemen overseas, \nand denies the right to choose for more than 27,000 servicewomen who \nvolunteered to serve our country. Though these women are right now \nprotecting our country's interests, year after year this body denies \nthem access to safe and sanitary medical care simply because they were \nassigned to duty outside the United States.\n  In very simple terms, this amendment will allow women stationed \noverseas that right to privately funded abortions at their local \nAmerican military facility. It will allow women and their spouses the \nfreedom to consider the most difficult, heart-wrenching decision they \ncould make without fearing the potentially substandard care they would \nbe faced with in a country that does not speak their language and that \ndoes not train their medical personnel the way in which they are here \nin the United States.\n  I don't understand why we insist in denying our service men and women \nand their families their right as Americans. We ask a great deal of our \nmilitary personnel and their families--low pay, long separations, \nhazardous duty. When they signed up to serve their country, I don't \nbelieve they were told, nor do I believe they were asked, to leave \ntheir freedom of choice at the ocean's edge. It is ironic that we are \ndenying the very people who we ask to uphold democracy and freedom the \nbasic and simple right to safe medical care. The Murray-Snowe amendment \nwould overturn that ban and ensure that women and military dependents \nstationed overseas would have access to safe health care.\n  I want to clarify the fact that overturning this ban doesn't mean we \nwill be using Federal funds to support a procedure such as abortion. \nThis would allow American personnel stationed overseas to use their own \nfunds for the support of an abortion in a military hospital. It is very \nimportant to make that distinction.\n  As the Senator from Washington indicated, there is also a clause so \nthat medical personnel cannot be forced to perform a procedure with \nwhich they disagree.\n  We had this ban lifted in 1993 restoring a woman's right to pay for \nabortion services with her own money. Unfortunately, that ban was \nreinstated back in 1995. I think it is important to understand what \nchoices women are left with under our current policy.\n\n  Imagine a young servicewoman or the wife of an enlisted man living in \na foreign country where language is a barrier. She finds herself \npregnant and, for whatever reason, she has made a very difficult \ndecision to terminate her pregnancy and she wants to have that \nprocedure done in a military hospital and is willing to pay for it with \nher own funds. Under current U.S. law, she won't be able to do that. \nShe won't be able to go to a base hospital near her family and friends. \nShe won't be assured of the same quality care that she could receive \nhere in the United States. She won't be able to even communicate under \nsome circumstances because language might be a barrier.\n  So what are her choices? She must either find the time and the money \nto fly back to the United States to receive the health care she seeks, \nor possibly endanger her own health by seeking one in a foreign \nhospital, or she may have to fly to a third country, again where the \nmedical services may not equate to those available at the military \nbase--if she can't afford to return home.\n  What is the freedom to choose? It is a freedom to make a decision \nwithout unnecessary government interference. Denying a woman the best \navailable resources for her health care simply is not right. Current \nlaw does not provide a woman and her family the ability to make a \nchoice. It gives the woman and her family no freedom of choice. It \nmakes the choice for her.\n  Our men and women in uniform--and the families standing behind them--\nare our country's best and most valuable assets. When people sign up \nfor military service, they promise us they will do their best to \nprotect our country and its ideals. We promise them we will provide for \nthem and their families the necessities of life--to provide them with \nthe most advanced and the safest health care available. That is the \narrangement. This is the benefit that we make available to them in \nreturn for their commitment to serve our country. Our men and women and \ntheir spouses should not be required to give up their constitutional \nprotections, and the Supreme Court supported right to privacy, and our \npromise of safe health care.\n  Yet, we prohibit women from using their own money--not taxpayers \ndollars--to obtain the care they need at the local base hospital.\n  What we are saying to our women in uniform, or to the dependents of \nothers who serve in our military, is: Sorry. You are on your own. So \nshe faces a circumstance that she would not confront were she stationed \nat Fort Lewis, WA, or Brunswick Naval Air Station in Brunswick, ME, \nbecause she could go off base and be guaranteed safe and legal medical \ncare.\n\n  The Murray-Snowe amendment is only asking for fair and equal \ntreatment. It is saying to our men and women and their families, if you \nfind yourself in a difficult situation, we will provide the service of \nsafe medical care if you pay for it with your own money. Is that too \nmuch to ask?\n  We owe it to our men and women in uniform. We owe it to them so that \nthey have the options to receive the care they need in a safe \nenvironment. They do not deserve anything less.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in voting for the Murray-Snowe \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, here we go again with the \nsame amendment that comes up every year. The vote is always close. \nThere are a lot of very strong feelings on both sides.\n  Again, as I have in the past, I rise in opposition to this \namendment--this time the Murray-Snowe amendment--\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\nwhich would allow U.S. military facilities to be used for the \nperformance of abortions on demand.\n  Under current law, no funds may be made available to the Department \nof Defense for the performance of abortions. The amendment now before \nthe Senate is completely inconsistent with the Hyde amendment, which \nhas been existing law for 20 years. Under the Hyde amendment, no \ntaxpayer dollars may be used to pay for abortions.\n  The issue here is whether or not you want to basically throw out the \nHyde amendment and say that Members are willing to have taxpayer \ndollars used to pay for abortions in military hospitals. The Hyde \namendment recognizes that millions of American taxpayers believe that \nabortion is the taking of an innocent life, an unborn human being. \nThose Members, myself included, who proudly call ourselves pro-life \nshould not be forced to pay for a procedure with our tax money that \nviolates our fundamental and deeply held belief in the sanctity of \ninnocent human life. That is the issue here.\n  In the 1980 case of Harris versus McRae, the Supreme Court upheld the \nconstitutionality of the Hyde amendment. The Court determined that \nthere is no constitutional right to a taxpayer-funded abortion, no \nmatter how we feel on the issue otherwise--no constitutional right, \naccording to the Harris versus McRae decision in 1980.\n  Current law with respect to abortions at military facilities, then, \nis fully consistent with the Hyde amendment. This amendment by the \nSenator from Washington will overturn existing law. The proponents of \nthis amendment, which would overturn current law and allow abortion on \ndemand at military facilities, claim that their proposal is somehow \nconsistent with Hyde. It is not. They say this because, under their \nproposal, servicewomen seeking these abortions would pay for them. That \nis true.\n  This argument, however, evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of the \nnature of military medical facilities. Military clinics and military \nhospitals, unlike private clinics and private hospitals, receive not \n10, not 20, not 30, not 90, but 100 percent of their funding from the \ntaxpayers of the United States. A woman cannot go into a military \nhospital and use those facilities without the taxpayers paying for the \nfacility she is using to have that abortion. The clinics, the \nhospitals, the doctors, the equipment--all of it is paid for by the \nU.S. taxpayer.\n  Physicians who practice in those clinics and hospitals, government \nemployees whose salaries and bills are paid by the taxpayers, all of \nit, all of the operational and administrative expenses associated with \nthe practice of military medicine are paid for by the taxpayers of the \nUnited States.\n  Furthermore, equipment that would be used at these facilities to \nperform the abortions, equipment that we abhor--those of us who are \npro-life, who find it repulsive and reprehensible, and I won't go into \nthe details about what happens with the equipment that is used on these \ninnocent children--that equipment will be purchased by \ntaxpayer dollars. It will be purchased by dollars that I pay in taxes \nand that many of my millions of friends around the Nation who oppose \nabortion, their dollars will be used to pay for this.\n\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has said that that is wrong \nand they ruled in the McRae case that it should not be done. In short, \nit is simply impossible to allow the performance of abortions at \nmilitary facilities, even if the procedure itself is paid for by the \nservicewoman involved, without having the taxpayers forced to subsidize \nit. You can't have it.\n  The only way to protect the integrity of the taxpayer's dollars is to \nkeep the military out of the business of abortion. We could go on and \non, on just that issue. Just what business should the military be in? \nThe military has gotten into a lot of things lately under this \nadministration that don't belong in the realm of the military, but do \nwe have to now go to the taking of the lives of unborn children and use \nthe military to now do that? Do we have to really do that? Isn't it bad \nenough that we have to see throughout America since the illustrious Roe \nversus Wade decision in 1973--I ask everyone to reflect for a moment on \nwhat has happened since that decision.\n  In 1973, Roe versus Wade was passed. Since that date, 35 million \nbabies, that we know of, have been aborted. Let's define abortion: The \ntaking of the life of an unborn child. Thirty-five million. If you look \nat the statistics of how many girls are born and how many boys are \nborn, that probably translates into about 18 million young girls who \nwould now be as old as 30 years, perhaps, depending on when the \nabortion might have been performed. How many of those 18 million young \nwomen may have had the opportunity to serve in the U.S. military? They \ndon't get that chance because our country, our Nation, supported a \nSupreme Court decision that said they didn't have a chance to ever have \nthe opportunity to serve in the military, never have the opportunity to \nbe a mother, never to have the opportunity to be a daughter, never to \nhave the opportunity to live their dreams, to enjoy the liberties of \nthe United States of America--never to have that opportunity. Never to \nhave the opportunity to fight for the freedom of the United States as a \nmember of the military because they were aborted--they were killed in \nthe womb.\n  This Nation, through this Supreme Court decision, allowed it to \nhappen. That is beyond the dignity, to put it mildly, of a great \nnation. We let it happen.\n  It is bad enough that happened, but now we have to go one step \nfurther with the amendment of the Senator from Washington and say that \nthe taxpayers have to fund it.\n  Mr. President, I wish everyone who will vote on this amendment in the \nnext hour or so had had the opportunity I have had to personally meet a \nyoung woman who is now in her midtwenties. She could not serve in the \nmilitary because she was not physically able to serve in the military. \nLet me tell you why she could not serve in the military. She was \naborted, and she lived, and she is crippled. So she cannot serve in the \nmilitary. I have met this young woman, as many have. There are many \nlike her, but I use her as an example, Gianna Jessen. Who knows, maybe \nGianna would have liked to have been a woman in the military, but she \ncannot.\n  Why do we not wake up in America and understand what we are doing? \nShould we really be surprised when our children do some of the things \nthey do in this country? Why should we be surprised? What is the \nunderlying message? And this amendment sends the same message.\n  The underlying message is: Go to school today, Johnny. Go to school \ntoday, Mary. You be good kids. You do the right thing. And meanwhile, \nwhile you are at school, we will abort your brother or your sister.\n  That is the message we are giving to our kids. That is the message \nthis amendment is giving to our kids. That is the message this \namendment is giving to all Americans--that now we are going to say the \ntaxpayers can support this kind of thing.\n  I wish the Senator from Washington would come down here on the floor \nwith an amendment that might say we could provide a little help, a \nlittle counseling, a little love, a little compassion, a little \nunderstanding to this woman who wants this abortion, and explain to her \nthe beauty of life and explain to her what a great opportunity it would \nbe for her to have that child and to have that child grow up into a \nworld where that child could be loved and could be understood and could \nhave the opportunity to perhaps follow her mother's ambitions and serve \nin the U.S. military or perhaps to follow in her mother's wake and be a \nmother herself, to enjoy the fruits of the greatest nation in the \nworld.\n  Let's not agree to this amendment and violate the spirit of the Hyde \namendment and violate more unborn children, intrude into the womb, take \nthe lives of unborn children.\n  When are we going to wake up? Would it not be wonderful to come down \non the floor of the Senate just one year when we did not have to deal \nwith this, when people would respect life and we would be offering \namendments to protect life rather than to take it. That is an America I \nam dreaming of, Mr. President. That is an America I would like to see \nin the 21st century, not an America of death but an America of life, \nwhere we respect life.\n  Allowing abortion on demand in military facilities would violate the \nmoral\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\nand religious convictions of millions and millions and millions, tens \nof millions, of Americans who believe, through their own religious \nconvictions, or in any other way, as I do, that the unborn child has a \nfundamental right to life, a right to life that comes from the \nDeclaration of Independence, from the Constitution, and from God \nHimself. Yes, from God Himself. That is where it comes from, and we do \nnot have the right to take it.\n  For the sake of one or two votes on the floor of the Senate, in a \nvery few minutes we are going to make that decision. Whichever way it \ngoes, we are going to find out how many more children have to die. How \nmany more children have to die?\n\n  When are we going to wake up, America? How much more of this do we \nhave to take? Why are you surprised when your children do something \nwrong? What kind of message do we send?\n  This amendment is not about the so-called right to choose abortion \nthat the Supreme Court created in 1993. I disagree with Roe v. Wade. \nEverybody knows that. I just said it. I introduced a bill, S. 907, that \nwould reverse Roe v. Wade, establishing that the right to life comes \nwith conception and protecting that life. I dream of the America of the \nfuture when we will respect it.\n  But, as I said, this amendment is not about the larger issue of \nabortion; it is about taxpayer funding of abortion. Millions and \nmillions of pro-life Americans, who believe to the very core of our \nbeing that abortion is the taking of an innocent life, should not be \nforced to pay for abortions, not directly, not indirectly, not any way \nyou can define it, with taxpayer dollars.\n  I urge my colleagues, no matter what their personal views are, to \nreject this amendment, to vote to preserve current law, to vote to \nprotect and be consistent with the Hyde amendment. Let's get the \nmilitary involved in protecting America and not taking innocent \nchildren's lives.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Smith for his \nremarks. I join him in urging our colleagues to vote ``yes'' in favor \nof the tabling motion, to vote ``no'' on the Murray amendment.\n  Abortion is not a fringe benefit. People talk about a benefit that \nother people have. Abortion is the taking of a human life, so it should \nnot be just a fringe benefit that is provided for at Government expense \nor provided for in Government hospitals. These are military hospitals. \nThey do not have abortionists working in those hospitals. They have not \nbeen allowed through 1992. It was a change in the Executive order by \nthe Clinton administration in 1993, saying we are going to have those. \nIn 1993 and 1994, because of an Executive order--not because of a \nchange in Congress--the Clinton administration said we want to provide \nabortions at military hospitals.\n  Guess what. They could not find abortionists. They could not find \ndoctors to perform abortions at military hospitals, because they had \nbeen prohibited for at least 10 years, if not 12 years before, when \nthat was not the case. The Hyde amendment said we are not going to use \nFederal funds to provide abortions. We did not have abortions performed \nat military hospitals. The Clinton administration tried to change that. \nThey did not have anybody to do it. They tried to recruit them.\n  We changed the law in 1995. The Murray amendment would change it back \nby saying to military hospitals: You must provide abortions--a fringe \nbenefit. Granted, maybe the person receiving the abortion now would \nhave to pay a little bit, but the military is going to have to find \nsomebody to perform them. They are going to have to make sure they have \nsomebody who is trained to do it, and trained to do it right. So they \nare going to have to hire people to perform abortions, people right now \nthey do not have--they have not been able to find them. Frankly, in \n1993 and 1994 we changed the law. Congress changed the law in 1995, and \nI think they were right in doing so.\n  I think it would be a mistake for Congress to overrule that now and \nsay we think that should be a standard benefit that is provided in \nGovernment military hospitals all across the world, so it could be \nbasically a fringe benefit, it could be standard operating procedure--\nyes, anybody can get an abortion in a military hospital. It would be a \nmethod of birth control. I think that would be a serious mistake.\n  We have to realize, it is not a fringe benefit; it is the taking of \nan innocent human being's life. So I urge my colleagues to support \nSenator Smith in the tabling motion with respect to the Murray \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we all recognize that the bottom line of \nour national defense is quality of our men and women in uniform. They \nare the core of our security. They make a commitment to the defense of \nthis nation, and we make a commitment to them that includes access to \nhigh quality health care. Women serving overseas are particularly \nreliant on this commitment, as they often have no alternative access to \nquality health care.\n  The issue of abortion is a matter of individual conscience. The \nSupreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade that the decision whether to have an \nabortion belonged to the individual, not the government. Yet, for \nAmerican servicewomen, that right to choose is effectively being taken \naway from them. They are being denied access, even at no expense to the \nGovernment, to a safe medical procedure. In most cases, the service \nwoman does not have access to this procedure anywhere else.\n  American servicewomen have agreed to put their lives on the line to \ndefend this country. But yet we are denying them a basic right that all \nother women are allowed--one that could easily be granted to them at no \nexpense to the federal government. The Murray-Snowe amendment provides \nthat the woman involved would reimburse the government for the full \ncost of the procedure. In my mind, this is a basic matter of fairness. \nI would argue that our military women should not be singled out to be \nunjustly discriminated. I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to \ntable the Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, which \nwill at long last remove the unfair ban on privately-funded abortions \nat U.S. military facilities overseas. This amendment will right a \nserious wrong in current policy, and ensure that women serving overseas \nin the armed forces can fairly exercise their constitutionally-\nguaranteed right to choose.\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness for the large numbers of \nwomen who make significant sacrifices to serve our Nation. They serve \non military bases around the world to protect our freedoms. In turn, it \nis our responsibility in Congress to protect theirs. It is wrong for us \nto deny these women who serve our country with such distinction the \nsame medical care available to all women in the United States. Women \nwho serve overseas should be able to depend on military base hospitals \nfor their medical needs. They should not be forced to choose between \nlower quality medical care in a foreign country, or travelling back to \nthe United States for the care they need. Congress has a responsibility \nto provide safe medical care for those serving our country at home and \nabroad.\n  Without proper care, abortion can be a life-threatening or \npermanently disabling procedure. This danger is an unacceptable burden \nto impose on the nation's dedicated servicewomen. They should not be \nexposed to substantial risks of infection, illness, infertility, and \neven death, when appropriate care can easily be made available to them.\n  This measure does not ask that these procedures be paid for with \nfederal funds. It simply asks that servicewomen overseas have the same \naccess to all medical services as their counterparts at home.\n  In addition to the health risks imposed by the current unfair policy, \nthere is also a significant financial burden on servicewomen who make \nthe difficult decision to have an abortion. The cost of returning to \nthe United States from far-off bases in other parts of the world can \noften result in significant financial hardship for young women. \nServicewomen in the United States do not have to bear this burden, \nsince non-military hospital facilities are readily available. It is \nunfair to ask those serving abroad to suffer this financial penalty.\n  If military personnel are unable to pay for a trip to the United \nStates on\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\ntheir own, they often face significant delays while waiting for \navailable military transportation. Each week, the health risks faced by \nthese women increase. If there are long delays in obtaining a military \nflight, the women may decide to rely on questionable medical facilities \noverseas. As a practical matter, these women in uniform are being \ndenied their constitutionally-protected right to choose.\n  A woman's decision to have an abortion is a very difficult and \nextremely personal one. It is wrong to impose an even heavier burden on \nwomen who serve our country overseas. Every woman in the United States \nhas a constitutionally-guaranteed right to choose whether or not to \nterminate her pregnancy. It is time for Congress to stop denying this \nright to women serving abroad. It is time for Congress to stop treating \nservice women as second-class citizens. I urge the Senate to support \nthe Murray-Snowe amendment and end this flagrant injustice under \ncurrent law.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senators Murray and Snowe. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  This amendment would repeal the current ban on privately funded \nabortions at US military facilities overseas.\n  I strongly support this amendment for three reasons. First of all, \nsafe and legal access to abortion is the law. Second, women serving \noverseas should have access to the same range of medical services they \nwould have if they were stationed here at home. Third, this amendment \nwould protect the health and well-being of military women. It would \nensure that they are not forced to seek alternative medical care in \nforeign countries without regard to the quality and safety of those \nhealth care services. We should not treat US servicewomen as second-\nclass citizens when it comes to receiving safe and legal medical care.\n  It is a matter of simple fairness that our servicewomen, as well as \nthe spouses and dependents of servicemen, be able to exercise their \nright to make health care decisions when they are stationed abroad. \nWomen who are stationed overseas are often totally dependent on their \nbase hospitals for medical care. Most of the time, the only access to \nsafe, quality medical care is in a military facility. We should not \ndiscriminate against female military personnel by denying safe abortion \nservices just because they are stationed overseas. They should be able \nexercise the same freedoms they would enjoy at home. It is \nreprehensible to suggest that a woman should not be able use her own \nfunds to pay for access to safe and quality medical care. Without this \namendment, military women will continue to be treated like second-class \ncitizens.\n  The current ban on access to reproductive services is yet another \nattempt to cut away at the constitutionally protected right of women to \nchoose. It strips military women of the very rights they were recruited \nto protect. Abortion is a fundamental right for women in this country. \nIt has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court.\n  Let's be very clear. What we're talking about here today is the right \nof women to obtain a safe and legal abortion paid for with their own \nfunds. We are not talking about using any taxpayer or federal money--we \nare talking about privately funded medical care. We are not talking \nabout reversing the conscience clause--no military medical personnel \nwould be compelled to perform an abortion against their wishes.\n  This is an issue of fairness and equality for the women who sacrifice \nevery day to serve our nation. They deserve access to the same quality \ncare that servicewomen stationed here at home--and every woman in \nAmerica--has each day. I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment to the 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Murray amendment \nbecause it proposes to legalize the destruction of innocent unborn \nbabies at military facilities. And Mr. President, if precious unborn \nbabies are allowed to be slaughtered on military grounds, it will be a \nstark contradiction to the main purpose of our national defense--the \ndefense and protection of the human lives in America.\n  Small wonder that the men and women serving in the military are \nlosing faith in the leadership of this country. In fact, Congress \nrecently heard from members of the Air Force, Navy, Army, and Marines \nwho testified about the low morale among U.S. service men and women--\nwhich they contribute to a general loss of faith and trust.\n  After all, the military establishment continues to have its moral \nwalls chipped away by the immoral principles of the extreme liberal-\nleft. In fact, the American people would be shocked and disturbed to \nlearn that our military has been pressured to accept Witchcraft as a \nrecognized religion.\n  Why would Congress wish to demoralize our military folks further by \ncasting a dark cloud over military grounds--which is precisely what \nwill happen if abortions are to be performed at these facilities.\n  Let us not forget, America's military is made up of fine men and \nwomen possessing the highest level of integrity and pride in defending \ntheir country. These are men and women who have been selfless in \ndedicating their lives to a deep held belief that freedom belongs to \nall.\n  Senators should not mince words in saying that military doors should \nbe shut closed to abortionists. I urge Senators to vote against this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I remind my colleagues, what this \namendment does is simply allow a woman who is serving in the military \noverseas to use her own money to have an abortion performed in a \nmilitary hospital at her expense.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray for yielding me \nthis time. It is so hard to know where to begin to respond to the \ncomments made by both of my colleagues who are the leaders in the anti-\nchoice movement and who are using this amendment as a reason to once \nmore come to this floor and to attack a basic constitutional right, \nthat women have been granted, that they do not agree with.\n  So what has been their effort? It is, in essence, to take away that \nright bit by bit. I hate to say this: They have made great progress. \nThey have taken away the right to choose in many ways, from poor women \nin this country, by denying them funding. A woman in D.C. cannot \nexercise that right, even if she does not use Federal funds but \nlocally-raised funds. They no longer teach surgical abortion at medical \nschools as a result of the action of this anti-choice Congress.\n  Women in the military, as we now know, are denied the right to go to \na safe military hospital. Native American women who rely on Indian \nhealth care cannot go to that health care center and obtain a legal \nabortion.\n  I want to make a statement, and I sure would like a response: Women \nin Federal prison who need to have this legal procedure get treated \nbetter than women in the military overseas. Let me repeat that. Under \nthe laws of this Congress, women in Federal prison get treated better \nthan women in the military who are stationed overseas when both need to \nhave this procedure.\n  Under our rules, if a woman is in a Federal prison, she cannot count \non Medicaid, that is so. But if there is an escort committee who can \ntake her to get this procedure paid for privately, she gets that escort \ncommittee. What happens to a woman in the military? Suppose you are \nstationed in Saudi Arabia where abortion is illegal, and you cannot go \nto your military hospital. You, obviously, cannot go to a clean health \nfacility in Saudi Arabia, so you have two choices: You can go to a \nback-alley abortionist and risk your life--you are already risking your \nlife in the military--but risk your life or you can go to your \ncommander, who is usually a man, and confide in him as to your \nsituation which, it seems to me, is a horrible thing to have to do, to \ntell such a private matter to a commander. Then, if you can get a seat \non a C-17 cargo plane, maybe then you can go back, in a situation where \nyou really need immediate attention, and figure out a way to get a \nsafe, legal abortion.\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Oklahoma say: \nWell, this is Federal funding.\n  This is not Federal funding. Senator Murray has stated that over and \nover. I compliment her and Senator Snowe on their tenacity in bringing \nthis back and forcing us to look at what we are doing to women in the \nmilitary who risk their lives every single day, and because of this \nantichoice Senate, we are forcing them to put their lives at risk \nagain. I commend them. This is not a fringe benefit. They will pay.\n  Medical facilities abroad are in a state of readiness. They do not \nhave to turn the lights on when someone comes in for a health care \nprocedure. The lights are on, and they will pay the costs. We all know \nwhen we pay our doctors the overhead is put into that bill. That is \nsuch a bogus argument. It is amazing that it is even made.\n  What you are doing in this current policy is telling women in the \nmilitary they are lesser citizens than all the other women in the \ncountry when, in fact, they ought to be treated with even more dignity \nand respect perhaps than anyone else, because not many of us can say \nthat we go to work every day putting our lives on the line. They can \nsay that. Yet, because of this terrible way we treat these women, they \nare put in jeopardy.\n  I will sum it up this way. There are people in this Senate who \ndisagree with the Supreme Court decision, and I say to my friend from \nNew Hampshire, he certainly does and he does not mince words about it \nand he is very straightforward about it. He says he is proud to be pro-\nlife.\n  I ask for 1 more minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 30 additional seconds to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I am for life--lives of children, \nlives of women, and I say that this policy puts lives in jeopardy, puts \nlives on the line in a way that is arbitrary, in a way that is \ncapricious, in a way that treats these women far worse than we do women \nin Federal prison. I hope the Murray-Snowe amendment will get an \noverwhelming vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time? The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington, as well as the \nSenator from Maine, for offering this amendment, which I will support. \nI join in saying what the Senator from New Hampshire said earlier. \nSenator Smith suggested this is not a debate in which we are anxious to \nget involved. It is a very controversial issue, deeply felt on both \nsides. I respect the Senator from New Hampshire and his personal views \non this, as I respect those who support my position in offering a vote \nin favor of this amendment.\n  Let me say a few things that need to be cleared up. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire said repeatedly that this process uses taxpayer dollars \nto pay for abortion. Of course, that is a flash point. When people hear \nthat, they say: Wait, I don't think we ought to spend taxpayer dollars \non that. Maybe people want to do that personally.\n  Senator Murray addressed that point. Her amendment makes it clear \nthat these procedures are to be paid for by the servicewoman out of her \npocket at a cost that is assessed for the procedure itself. There are \nno taxpayer dollars involved in this. This amendment is clear.\n  Secondly, the Senator from New Hampshire says this does not abide by \nthe Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment, as important as it is, does not \noverride Roe v. Wade. The Hyde amendment limits abortions to those \ncases involving the life of the mother. But the procedure now on \nmilitary bases goes beyond the Hyde amendment. The procedure on \nmilitary bases today says if there is an endangerment of the woman's \nlife, she can have the abortion performed at a military hospital at \nGovernment expense. If she is a victim of rape or incest, she can have \nan abortion performed at a military hospital at her own expense.\n  We are talking about the other universe of possibilities out there. \nSenator Boxer of California really poses an interesting challenge to \nus: Two women, under the supervision of the Government of the United \nStates of America, both of them pregnant, both of them wanting to end \nthe pregnancy with a procedure. In one case, we say if you have the \nmoney, we will escort you to a safe and legal clinic in America for the \nperformance of this procedure. In the other case, we say if you have \nthe money, you have to fend for yourself; you cannot use a safe and \nlegal clinic or military hospital.\n  What is the difference? The first woman is a prisoner in the Federal \nPrison System. For her, we have an escort committee. But for the woman \nwho has volunteered to serve the United States to defend our country \nand she is in the same circumstance, we say: You're on your own; go out \nin this country, wherever it might be, and try to find someone who will \nperform this procedure safely and legally.\n  Whether you are for abortion or against it, simple justice requires \nus to apply it equally and not to discriminate against those women who \nare serving in the American military. That is what it comes down to.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma said abortion is not a fringe benefit. He \nis right. But health care is a fringe benefit that most Americans \nenjoy, and many hospitalization insurance policies cover abortion \nprocedures. We do not cover them when it comes to the women who serve \nin the U.S. military. Abortion is not a fringe benefit; abortion is a \nconstitutional right. If that constitutional right means anything, we \nshould support the Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 4 minutes 12 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I retain the last minute for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Washington.\n  I support this amendment. I believe a woman should have a right to \nchoose, and under the circumstances involved here, if the woman is \ngoing to seek an abortion, she should not be compelled to come back to \nthe United States. Having an abortion in many foreign spots poses very \nmaterial risks. This is a common sense abortion amendment which ought \nto be adopted.\n\n\n          War Crimes Tribunal Indictment of Slobodan Milosevic\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to comment about another matter \nvery relevant to the pending legislation, that is the dispatch from \nReuters within the hour that the War Crimes Tribunal has issued an \nindictment for President Milosevic and that an arrest warrant has \nalready been signed. I think that is very important news, because it \nnot only puts Milosevic on notice but also all of his subordinates, \nthat the War Crimes Tribunal means business, that those who are \nresponsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes will be \nprosecuted.\n  I compliment Justice Louise Arbour who was in Washington on April 30, \nasking a bipartisan group of Senators, including this Senator, for \nassistance; and we appropriated some $18 million in the emergency \nsupplemental last week.\n  The next important point is to be sure that we do not permit a plea \nbargain to be entered into which will exonerate Milosevic as part of \nany peace settlement.\n  We ought to be sure this prosecution is carried forward. There is an \nabundance of evidence apparent to the naked eye from the television \nreports on atrocities, of mass murders, which can only be carried out \nwith the direction of or at least concurrence or acquiescence of \nPresident Milosevic. Those crimes should not go unpunished. There \nshould not be a compromise or a plea bargain which would give Milosevic \nimmunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter dated March 30 to \nthe President be printed in the Record, where I ask specifically that \nthe extradition of President Milosevic to face indictments ought to be \na precondition to stopping the NATO airstrikes; and a copy of my letter \nof April 30, to the\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\nPresident urging that warrants be issued and executed for Karadzic, and \nthat the full impact of the War Crimes Tribunal be carried out, that \nthis is a very important movement, probably worth a great deal more \nthan airstrikes or even ground forces, to indict Milosevic, let him \nknow that indictments and warrants are outstanding, and that those \nunder him who carry out war crimes will be prosecuted to the full \nextent of the law.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1999.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: If today's reports are accurate, there \n     is strong evidence that Serbian forces' massacres of Kosovo's \n     ethnic Albanians constitute genocide and crimes against \n     humanity, which should be prosecuted in the War Crimes \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n       There is probable cause to conclude that Serbian President \n     Slobodan Milosevic himself is a war criminal, just as former \n     Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said as far back as \n     1992.\n       I strongly urge you to:\n       (1) Put President Milosevic and his co-conspirators, who \n     carried out the massacres and crimes against humanity, on \n     explicit notice that the United States will throw its full \n     weight behind criminal prosecution against all of them at The \n     Hague;\n       (2) seek similar declarations from our allies;\n       (3) turn over all existing evidence to Justice Arbour, the \n     Chief Prosecutor at the War Crimes Tribunal, and make it an \n     Allied priority to gather any additional evidence which can \n     be obtained against President Milosevic and his confederates, \n     so that such evidence might be evaluated at the earliest \n     possible time with a view to obtaining the appropriate \n     indictments.\n       I anticipate some will say that we should not complicate \n     possible cease-fire negotiations with this focus on President \n     Milosevic and his co-conspirators.\n       I believe that consideration should be given to whether our \n     goals in Kosovo should include the extradition of President \n     Milosevic to face indictments, if returned, as a precondition \n     to ending NATO air strikes.\n       That is a hard judgment to make at this point. Many of us \n     in Congress believe that the United States should meet the \n     Serbian brutality with a very strong response so that future \n     tyrants will know that this type of conduct will not help \n     them personally in negotiations, but instead will be met with \n     tough criminal prosecutions in accordance with international \n     criminal law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 1999.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: This morning, I hosted a meeting with \n     several of my colleagues and Justice Louise Arbour, Chief \n     Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda (ICTY).\n       As a result of our meeting, I believe it is critical that \n     the United States take the lead in bringing indicted war \n     criminals to justice in the former Yugoslavia. Specifically, \n     I urge you in the strongest possible terms to direct United \n     States Forces, Europe, as part of UNSFOR, to apprehend \n     Radovan Karadzic and a number of other individuals in Bosnia \n     for whom open or sealed indictments have been returned by the \n     ICTY, and whose identities and locations are known to SFOR \n     Commanders.\n       While many of us in Congress support the current air \n     campaign, we are concerned that not enough is being done to \n     convey to Serbian military and paramilitary commanders that \n     they will be held responsible following the conflict for any \n     war crimes they commit on the ground in Kosovo.\n       Mr. Karadzic has been an indicted war criminal since 1995, \n     and his location is known to SFOR commanders. According to \n     Justice Arbour, SFOR knows the location and identity of ``a \n     handful'' of other individuals under sealed indictments for \n     war crimes. Clearly, U.S. and SFOR units in Bosnia are \n     sufficiently strong to apprehend these individuals if given \n     that mission.\n       While there are always concerns of friendly casualties and \n     ethnic unrest in the surprise apprehension of indicted war \n     criminals, the signal of seriousness that such a move would \n     send to every Serbian official from President Milosevic on \n     down is important enough under present circumstances for you \n     to shift our policy accordingly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 397\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 5 additional \nminutes of our time to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  The Senator has 6 minutes 2 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire for his generosity. I truly appreciate it.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I commend my colleagues, the Senator from Washington and the Senator \nfrom Maine, for presenting this amendment, on a very important issue, \nto the body today for us to discuss and to walk through. She has \ncourageously offered this amendment for many, many years, and each year \nwe seem to gain some support. I hope this year we will gain enough \nsupport to make this amendment part of the law of our land, because it \nmakes such common sense and good sense.\n  When we ask women to join our military--and we are truly recruiting \nthem rather vigorously, because we need their strength and their talent \nand their abilities to help make our military be the strongest and the \nbest in the world--it is just inconceivable that we would say: Come \njoin the military. Put on the uniform. Put yourself in harm's way. But \nwe are simply not going to extend to you all of the rights that are \nguaranteed to other Americans for medical decisions that should be \nyours to make. It just makes no sense.\n  So I urge Senators, regardless of how you might feel about this \nissue--and good arguments have been made on both sides--to think about \nthis as it truly is--not asking for any new privileges, not asking for \nany expansion of the law, but simply to allow the women who we are \nrecruiting at this age to serve in the military, to give them the \nmedical options they may need at a very tough time for them.\n  One other point I want to make is, those who have opposed this \namendment over the years have said: We most certainly would not mind \nexcept that we do not want this to be at Government expense. Let me \nremind everyone that this is not at Government expense, that these \nwomen are individuals prepared to pay whatever medical costs are \nassociated with the procedures that they may need.\n  But if we do not change the law to allow this to happen, the \ntaxpayers have to pick up a greater burden in transporting these women, \nsometimes in transport and cargo airplanes and helicopters back to the \nUnited States, which takes time away from their service. I argue that \ncosts substantially more, than the taxpayers are underwriting, for \nmedical procedures.\n  So it makes no sense from a military standpoint--for human rights, \nfor civil rights, for equal rights--to just have the same laws apply. \nIt really makes no sense for the taxpayers to have to pick up an \nadditional expense, when every dollar is so precious that we need to \nallocate well and wisely in our military.\n  So I thank the Senator from Maine, the Senator from Washington, and \nothers, who have spoken. I urge my colleagues, regardless of how you \nconsider yourself or label yourself on this issue, to think of this as \nthe right, commonsense thing to do for women and their families, their \ndependents, and, yes, their spouses, their husbands in the military, \nfor our families who are in the military, serving at our request to \nprotect our flag, to protect democracy, to protect freedom around the \nworld, to please consider that in their votes this afternoon.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Washington \nState.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 7 minutes \n30 seconds; the Senator from Washington has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I just want to respond to \none point that was made on the other side regarding the payback, if you \nwill, the fact that the woman agrees to pay out of her own pocket, \ntherefore, I would assume the issue is that she would reimburse the \nGovernment.\n  But I would ask one to consider the accounting nightmare that would \nensue as we try to figure out--we had a doctor paid for by the \ntaxpayers, a clinic, a hospital paid for by the taxpayers, equipment \npaid for by the taxpayers, and supplies and special equipment involving \nabortions--how one would allocate all of this?\n  We would have to figure out, how many abortions were done and how all \nthe allocations would be done. It simply is not workable. It would not \nwork. The bottom line, as I have been indicating, is that the taxpayers \nwould be subsidizing abortions in military hospitals. I think everyone \nunderstands that. I do not think there should be any confusion on that, \nthat those who do not support abortion would be subsidizing abortions.\n  I just want to review, in closing, the current law. Just to \nsummarize, no funds made available to DOD are used for abortions. Under \ncurrent law, military facilities are prohibited, in most cases, in the \nperformance of abortions. So the amendment now before the Senate is \ninconsistent with the Hyde amendment, which has been in existence for \nover 20 years, that taxpayer dollars may not be used to pay for \nabortions.\n  Current law, with respect to abortions at military facilities, is \nfully consistent with the Hyde amendment. The proponents of this \namendment, which would overturn current law and allow abortion on \ndemand, claim that their proposal is somehow consistent. As I said \nbefore, it is not. Under their proposal, women seeking abortions would \npay for them, but this evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of the \nnature of military medical facilities, which I pointed out.\n  In conclusion, I say that it is just simply unfair, and it has been \nso ruled by the Supreme Court, that people, who, because of their own \nvalues and beliefs and principles, do not believe in abortion, that \nthey should have to subsidize it with their tax dollars or pay for it \nwith their tax dollars. That is the issue.\n  We have had a vote on this issue many years in the past. I hope \npeople will see the light to see that this is wrong and basically \nunfair, and that we would respect the innocence of human life, and \nperhaps encourage the young woman in trouble to talk to a chaplain. \nThere are military chaplains out there, and some darn good ones, who \nare available to counsel young women in need.\n  I would certainly be very excited to hear that some of these women \nwent to the chaplain because this law didn't get changed and perhaps \nchose life over abortion.\n  At this point, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me conclude by letting my colleagues \nknow that under current law today, a woman who volunteers to serve all \nof us, to protect all of us and our rights, when she goes overseas to \nserve us and finds herself in a situation where she requires an \nabortion, which is a legal procedure guaranteed by the Constitution in \nthis country, has to go to her commanding officer and request \npermission to come home to the United States, flying home on a C-17, or \na helicopter when one is available, to have a procedure that women here \nin this country who have not volunteered to serve overseas have at \ntheir disposal.\n  We are asking a lot of these young women. We should at least provide \nthem the opportunity, as we do under my amendment, to pay for that \nprocedure in a military hospital, where it will be safe, at their own \nexpense. That is the least we should be offering them.\n  In a few moments we will be voting on this amendment. My colleague \nfrom New Hampshire has said the vote is close. Every vote will count. \nThere is no doubt about it. So when you cast your vote today, ask \nyourself if women who serve us overseas to defend our rights should be \nasked to give up their rights when they get on that plane and they are \nsent overseas.\n  This is an issue which sends a message to all young people today that \nwhen they serve us in the military to protect our rights, we are going \nto be here to defend their rights as well. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the motion to table.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nmotion to table and to stand with the women and men who serve us \noverseas.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do \njust the opposite and to support a motion that I am going to make in a \nmoment to table, out of respect for those of us who believe deeply in \nthe sanctity of life and who also understand and are compassionate \nabout young women who are in need of an abortion, or feel that they are \nin need of an abortion in some way, and who hope we could save that \nlife, that innocent life, and to show compassion for the unborn, which \nI think is really the issue.\n  At this point, I move to table the Murray amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 397. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 148 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 395\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers are desiring to turn to the \nSenator from Nebraska who desires additional time. Can we enter into a \ncolloquy on this subject?\n  Mr. KERREY. I think we should be able to finish this up in an hour. I \nhave four people on our side who want to speak. I don't know if they \nwill all get to the floor. If they don't, they are aware of what is \ngoing on. I have no more than 15 or 20 minutes of closing remarks \nmyself. I think we can wrap it up in an hour.\n  Mr. WARNER. I realize that what I offered to the Senator is hopefully \na reduced period of time. In return, there would be no further debate \non this side. That is a fairly generous offer. I thought we were in the \narea of 40 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. We can do it in 40 minutes and probably less than that.\n  Mr. WARNER. With that representation, I ask unanimous consent that we\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\nproceed to the amendment by the Senator from Nebraska for a time not to \nexceed 40 minutes under the control of the Senator from Nebraska and, \nsay, 5 minutes under the control of the Senator from Virginia, making a \ntotal of 45 minutes. At the conclusion of that we will proceed to a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia did not state \nthis. Does this mean there will be no amendments offered prior to the \nvote on my amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know of no amendments at this point. I \nask unanimous consent that prior to the motion to table there be no \namendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again, this amendment strikes language \nthat requires the United States of America to make its determination \nabout how many strategic weapons we will have based upon a decision by \nthe Russian Duma to ratify START II.\n  Some have described this amendment as encouraging unilateral \ndisarmament. Nothing could be further from the truth. We make \nunilateral decisions and we decide what our forces are going to look \nlike. On that basis, this entire bill is a unilateral decision. We \nhaven't consulted with the Russians to determine what our Army is going \nto look like, how many divisions we will have, how many wings we will \nhave in our Air Force. We have not made any consultation nor have we \ngiven the Russians a veto over any other part of our defense except for \nstrategic defenses.\n  There we say that even if, as is the case, we have former STRATCOM \ncommanders--in this case, Eugene Habiger--saying we would be well \nadvised to go to a lower level, it would keep the United States of \nAmerica safer than we currently are. As a consequence not only of \nmeasuring accurately how many nuclear weapons we needed in our triad--\nthe land, sea and air-based system that we developed over the years--\nthe greatest threat of nuclear attack to the United States of America \nis not China, is not an authorized launch by the Nation of Russia, it \nis an unauthorized launch. That risk has increased over the past few \nyears as the Russian economy declines. As a consequence of that \ndecline, they have decreased capacity to control their systems. This is \nnot a small item. This is a significant threat to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  One of the points I have tried to make is that we have been lulled \ninto a false sense of complacency as a consequence of the end of the \ncold war. Statements are made that we are no longer targeting the \nRussians, nor they us.\n  In the past, I have not supported an early deployment of the \nstrategic defense initiative, of missile defense. I have come to the \nconclusion as a consequence of this threat and others that the United \nStates of America should. That is a unilateral decision. We made that \ndecision not based upon what the Russians wanted but what we believed \nwas in our best interest to keep America safe. That is how we ought to \nmake our decisions about what our level is going to be of our force \nstructure for nuclear weapons.\n  Not only are the people of the United States of America at greater \nrisk as a consequence of forcing the Russians to maintain 6,000 at the \nend of 2001, but we are laboring under the optimistic scenario that \nmaybe the Russians will ratify START II, in which case we can go to \nlower levels. But even at START II levels, the Russians would not be to \n3,500 warheads until 2007.\n  We have to put an awful lot of our national security chips in the \npossibility that Russia will be in better shape in 2007 than it is \ntoday. These weapons systems are much more dangerous than the weapons \nsystems in vogue today. There are serious threats from chemical \nweapons, from biological weapons, from weapons of mass destruction in \nthat category, serious threats from terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden, \nserious threats as well that come from cyberwarfare and other sorts of \nthings we are having conferences on all the time. China is \nunquestionably a threat, especially in the area of proliferation. But \nnone of these, or all of them taken together, combined, are as big a \nthreat as unauthorized launch of Russian nuclear weapons.\n  I hope, regardless of how this amendment turns out, the Senate will \nturn its attention to dealing with this threat. I think we are much \nbetter off dealing with that threat with a different strategy than the \nold arms control strategy. This is not an amendment that says we are \ngoing to tie our national security to START I or START II. Quite the \ncontrary, I do not expect START II to be ratified in the next couple of \nyears, if that, if it ever is ratified by the Duma. We should not hold \nup our national security decisions based upon what we expect or do not \nexpect the Russian Duma to do.\n  I would like to describe some of these weapons systems so people can \nunderstand the danger of them, the kind of destruction they could do to \nthe United States of America. The Russians have in their land-based \nsystem 3,590 warheads. They have in their sea-based system 2,424 \nwarheads. They have in their air-based 564.\n  Just take one of these. Think, if you have a disgruntled, angry group \nof Russian soldiers or sailors or airmen who say: We have not been paid \nfor a year; we are despondent; we do not think we have any future; we \nare suicidal. We are going to take over one of these sites, and we are \ngoing to launch. We are not going to blackmail the United States; we \nare not going to try to get them to do anything; all we are going to do \nis launch, because we are angry and we do not like the direction of our \ncountry and we do not like what the United States of America is doing.\n  Let me just take the SS-18. I am not going to go through the details \nof where these are. I am not going to describe for colleagues a \nscenario to take one of them over. I am not going to build a case, but \nI think I could build a case, that an SS-18 site is not as secure today \nas it was 5 years ago. That lack of security should cause every \nAmerican to be much more worried than they are about the threat of \nChina or other things we talk about and put a great deal of energy into \ndescribing.\n  The SS-18 is a MIRV'd nuclear system. It has 10 warheads on each one \nof its missiles, and each one of these warheads has 500 to 750 \nkilotons. If you put one of those in the air and hit 10 American \ncities--I earlier had a chart showing what a 100-kiloton warhead would \ndo to the city of Chicago. Nobody should suffer any illusion of what \nthe consequences to the United States of America would be if 10 of our \ncities were hit with a 500- to 750-kiloton warhead.\n  You say it is not likely to happen. Lots of things are not likely to \nhappen that have happened. That is what we do with national security \nplanning. We do not plan for those things that are most likely to \nhappen. We plan for those things that are least likely to happen, \nbecause the least likely thing is apt to be the one that does the most \ndamage, and that is exactly what we are talking about here.\n  You do not have to kill every single American. If you put 10 nuclear \nwarheads with 500 to 750 kilotons of payload on 10 American cities, I \nguarantee the United States of America is not the superpower we are \ntoday. Imagine the devastation it would do to our economy. Imagine the \nemergency response that is required. Imagine all sorts of things. This \ncountry would not be the same as it is today if that were to happen. It \nis a terrible scenario. It is one we used to talk about way back in the \n1980s.\n  I remember campaigning in 1988. We had a big portion of our debate \nabout nuclear weapons and the danger of nuclear weapons and what are we \ngoing to do to keep the United States of America safe. The most \nvulnerable of the Russian triad are their nuclear submarines. I went \nthrough it earlier. A Delta IV submarine has 64 100-kiloton warheads on \nit. You could put 1 in each State and have 14 left over to pick some \nStates you might put 2 or 3 on top of.\n  This is a real risk. Is it likely to happen? No. The likelihood is \nlow. But low is not comforting when you are thinking about something \nsuch as that. Low should not give any American citizen comfort. I just \nheard somebody say it is not likely to happen; it is a low likelihood \nit is going to happen.\n  In the State of Nebraska, it is not likely a tornado is going to hit \ntonight.\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\n But tornadoes hit there relatively frequently. We look up at the sky \nand say, ``It is blue; it does not look to me like a storm is coming,'' \nbut storms hit out there just like that, and great destruction and \ndevastation has occurred as a consequence. We have been lulled into a \nfalse sense of complacency about the Russian nuclear system and, as a \nconsequence, we have not tried to figure out an alternative strategy. \nWe need an alternative strategy. The Russian Duma is not going to \nratify START II. I am here today to predict that is not going to \nhappen.\n  We should not in our defense authorization say we are not going to \ntake any action that might make America safer because we want to wait \nfor the Russians to ratify START II. This amendment is described by \nsome opponents as unilateral disarmament. It is not. It is no more \nunilaterally disarming than anything else we have in our defense \nauthorization. We do not make decisions about what we are going to do \nfor this Nation's security based upon what Russia is going to do in any \nother area of defense.\n  I cited earlier, I supported missile defense even though some said if \nwe have missile defense, if we have an early deployment of missile \ndefense, the Russians are going to do this, that, or the other thing, \nincluding maybe not ratifying START II. We did not make that decision \nbased upon wondering what the Russians are going to do. We need to make \nnational security decisions based upon what we think is in the best \ninterests of the United States of America, to keep our people safe. \nThis amendment does that.\n  The President has indicated he supports this amendment. He would like \nto get this limitation taken off. He does not have any plans to take \naction. I encourage him to do so. I think it is in our interests to \nthink about taking our levels lower. I think the Russians would \nreciprocate. And even if they did not, the United States of America \nwould still be safer as a consequence, by measurement of people who are \na lot smarter and a lot more knowledgeable than I am on this subject.\n  For fiscal reasons, for reasons of scarce resources that need to be \napplied into our conventional readiness and things that our Air Force, \nNavy, Marines, and Army are more likely to have to be called upon to \nmeet, for reasons of trying to reduce the risk of unauthorized launch \nthat would be devastating to the United States of America, I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will give this amendment their \nfull consideration and I hope they vote for it. A vote for this \namendment is not a vote for unilateral disarmament. A vote for this \namendment is a vote for the United States of America deciding what we \nthink is in our best interests in national security and then \nauthorizing accordingly in a defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from California wishes \nto speak. The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, earlier said \nhe would like to be a cosponsor. I am not sure he has been listed as a \ncosponsor. Senator Kennedy as well, Senator Boxer as well, and Senator \nBiden as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield to the Senator from California such time as she \nneeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I say to my friend from Nebraska how \ngrateful I am for taking the time that he has needed to explain this \namendment, not only to our colleagues but to the American people. This \namendment is a very important amendment. It will delete the provision \nin law which prevents the United States from retiring additional \nnuclear weapons delivery systems until the Russian Duma ratifies the \nSTART II treaty.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has explained in great detail why that is \nnot a prudent course for our Nation, and I agree with him. I will take \n5 or 6 minutes to explain why.\n  For the last 2 years, the defense authorization bill has included a \nprovision which bars reductions below 71 B-52H bombers, 18 Trident \nballistic missile submarines, 500 Minuteman III intercontinental \nballistic missiles, and 50 MX Peacekeeper missiles. Congress has told \nthe Pentagon that we cannot reduce below that level.\n  In this year's defense authorization bill, this provision again is \nincluded with a revision that allows the number of Trident submarines \nto be reduced by six at the request of the Navy. This is a good step. \nIt is a good first step, but more needs to be done to move in this \ndirection.\n  As Senator Kerrey has stated, there is no need to maintain these huge \nstockpiles of nuclear weapons. There is little doubt that Russia will \nfall well below START II levels whether or not the Duma gives its \nconsents and ratifies the START II treaty. Edward Warner III, Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, Strategy and Threat Reduction testified that:\n\n       In light of the very small modernization efforts [Russia] \n     has underway, and the obsolescence of many major components \n     of both their submarines and their strategic military forces, \n     Russia will be hard-pressed to keep a force of more than \n     about 3,500 weapons. And our intelligence analysts say in \n     light of current developments--again, we're projecting out \n     over the decade--by about the year 2010, they will be hard-\n     pressed to even meet a level of about 1,500 weapons.\n\n  If this is the case, if our own intelligence people are telling us \nthat regardless of whether the Duma passes START II, the Russians are \ngoing to have a much lower level of capability, why do we need 6,000 \ndeployed nuclear weapons with thousands more in reserve? What useful \npurpose do these thousands of weapons serve?\n  If we reduce our stockpiles toward START II levels of 3,500 nuclear \nweapons, we would still have the ability to obliterate any nation \nanywhere anytime.\n  I will repeat that because I want the American people to understand \nthat this amendment keeps us strong; it makes us safer; it makes us \nstronger. START II levels will still leave us with 3,500 nuclear \nweapons which could obliterate any nation anywhere anytime, and, I add, \nmany times over.\n  It is dangerous to maintain 6,000 deployed U.S. nuclear weapons, half \nof which are on hair-trigger alert. The massive U.S. deployment \npressures Russia to deploy as many of its nuclear forces as it can \nafford--and they do it on hair-trigger alert--at a time when the \nRussian command and control is stressed and when Russian launchers are \ndangerously over age.\n  What Senator Kerrey is trying to point to here is not a situation of \npanic but of truth, and the truth is the more we deploy, the more they \nare compelled to deploy, and that is at a time when the Russian \ncommand-and-control system is stressed and when the launchers are \ndangerously over age. This sets up a very dangerous situation.\n  Certainly many of us are concerned about what we have learned about \nChina's efforts to steal our nuclear secrets. This is very serious. \nEvery one of us, regardless of party, is sick at heart about what has \nhappened. It has happened over many, many decades, and there is blame \nto go everywhere. But the truth of the matter is, China has a few dozen \nstrategic nuclear delivery vehicles and that threat is not comparable \nto the one we face in Russia, as Senator Kerrey has pointed out. That \nis the real threat we face. We need to do something to diminish that \nthreat.\n\n  There is a question of cost. There can be substantial savings from \nnuclear weapons cuts. The CBO has estimated that reducing U.S. forces \nto START II levels by 2007 could produce a savings of $570 million in \nfiscal year 2000 and a $12.7 billion savings over 10 years.\n  This is not small change. This is important. We just faced a \nsituation where we saw a vote in the Senate, and we lost by four votes, \nto put some afterschool programs in place across this country. When I \ntalked to my friends on the other side, I received two votes on the \nother side. The others all said: We love the program, but we can't \nafford it. We were asking for essentially an authorization of $600 \nmillion, and the money was not there.\n  Why do we waste money and make a situation more dangerous when we can \nsave money and make a situation less dangerous? I think that is the \nmerit of the amendment that is before us. Mr. President, $12.7 billion \nover 10 years is not small change. We have lots of things we can do, \nand we can always return it to the taxpayers.\n  The CBO further estimated that reductions in nuclear delivery systems \nwithin the overall limits of START II could produce savings of $20.9 \nbillion.\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\n  There is a precedent for what we would do here.\n  It is very important. The Senator from Nebraska said people call this \nunilateral disarmament. Let me prove to you that this is not the case. \nIn 1991, President Bush had the courage to announce that we would \nwithdraw our tactical nuclear weapons to the United States. That was \nnot dependent on any action by the Soviet Union. He stood up and said \nthis is in the best interest of the United States of America.\n  He also ordered 1,000 U.S. warheads deployed on strategic bombers and \nballistic missiles slated for dismantlement to be taken off alert. I \nthink we all remember that day. It was a very exciting and dramatic \nday. He did those two actions because it was in the best interests of \nAmerica.\n  Do you know what happened after that? President Gorbachev responded \nin kind. He withdrew all tactical weapons from Warsaw Pact nations and \nnon-Russian republics, removed most categories of tactical nuclear \nweapons from service, and designated thousands of nuclear warheads for \ndismantlement.\n  The point the Senator from Nebraska is making is, sometimes it does \ntake courage to stand up and say this is what is in our best interests \nand show real leadership, the way George Bush did in 1991 in these two \nexamples and the way President Gorbachev followed his lead.\n  I am very disappointed that the Russian Duma has not yet ratified the \nSTART II treaty. Again, if we follow the leadership of the Senator from \nNebraska on this, we will be acting in our best interests, not in the \nbest interests of the Russian Duma. We should lead and not wait for \nthem to lead.\n  In conclusion, there are very good reasons for the United States of \nAmerica to reduce its nuclear weapons. This amendment is carefully \ndrawn. It is carefully thought out. It comes from a man who put his \nlife on the line in the military and would do nothing to harm our \nnational security. As a matter of fact, he would do everything to make \nus stronger. I hope we follow his lead and adopt his amendment. I yield \nback my time.\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Nebraska for his \namendment. What he has done is to bring back before us and before the \nNation a very important issue, which is, what is the necessary level of \nnuclear weapons in our inventory for our own security.\n  Do we need as many as we have? Should we legislatively bake in that \nlevel if we do not need the START I level or should we at least be free \nto consider options to go to what the necessary level is for our own \nsecurity?\n  The Senator's gift to us and to the Nation here is that he is \nbringing before us an issue which the Joint Chiefs want us to consider \nbut we have not yet considered, and that is, what is the level of \nnuclear weapons that we need for our own security and should that be \ndetermined by a legislative level, on a piece of paper, set in law, or \nshould that be determined by our security needs?\n  If we have a larger number of nuclear weapons than we need, we do two \nthings. The Senator from California has just illuminated those two \nthings. No. 1, if we have more nuclear weapons than we need for our own \nsecurity, we are wasting valuable resources. That is No. 1. But, No. 2, \nwhat we are doing is we are then telling the Russians: Look, we're \ngoing to stay at this level, which in turn will encourage them, \nunhappily, to remain at the same level. That increases the \nproliferation threat to us because as the Senator from Nebraska has \npointed out, the greatest threat to this Nation is the inventory of \nnuclear weapons on Russian soil. The Chinese threat does not come \nclose. You are talking dozens in that case and not nearly as accurate. \nIn the case of the Russians, you are talking many, many thousands of \nnuclear weapons which are not only pointed at us but also the more that \nare there on Russian soil, the greater the risk that one of them might \nbe lost or not counted and leave Russian soil and get into the hands of \na terrorist state or a terrorist group.\n  So both from a proliferation perspective and from the perspective of \nthe wise use of our resources, we ought to at least be open to consider \noptions of fewer nuclear weapons than the START I level provides for.\n  We may decide we want to stay at that level. It may be determined \nthat we want to stay at that level. But the Joint Chiefs say that it \nmay not be necessary. They want to consider options that would go down \nto a lower level of nuclear weapons, because they may not need as many \nnuclear weapons, regardless of what the Russians do. Even if the \nRussians stay at the START I level, we may not need as many nuclear \nweapons as the START I level allows us.\n  There is no point in keeping them just because the Russians have them \nif we do not need them. There is no point keeping them if that helps to \npush the Russians to keep their own, with all of the proliferation \nthreats which that engenders.\n  I close by reading a couple answers that we have received to \nquestions that I have addressed to Secretary Cohen and to General \nShelton.\n  I asked Secretary Cohen:\n\n       Should we maintain the requirement in law that our forces \n     be maintained at the START I level or should we now let that \n     expire and do what our military requirements indicate we \n     should do, rather than to put it in a legislative form?\n\n  Secretary Cohen's answer:\n\n       . . . I do not think we need to have the legislation, . . . \n     . I think it is unnecessary. . . .\n\n  General Shelton was even more pointed. General Shelton, in answer to \nthat question, said:\n\n       I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language. . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator would yield 2 additional minutes?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  General Shelton said:\n\n       I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language that \n     mandates specific force structure levels.\n\n  This is the highest level of uniform military leadership we have in \nthis Nation. This is what he says:\n\n       The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time to consider \n     options that will reduce our strategic forces to the levels \n     recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review. The START I \n     legislative restraint will need to be removed before we can \n     pursue these options. Major costs will be incurred if we \n     remain at START I levels.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       The Service Chiefs and I agree it is time to reduce the \n     number of our nuclear platforms to a level that is militarily \n     sufficient to meet our national security needs. . . .\n\n  ``[M]ilitarily sufficient to meet our national security needs. . . \n.''\n  General Shelton went on:\n\n       The statutory provision that keeps us at the START I level \n     for both Trident SSBNs and Peacekeeper ICBMs will need to be \n     removed before we can pursue these options.\n\n  So we have the leadership of this Nation's military--civilian and \nuniform--urging us not to have a restraint in law that will make it \ndifficult for them to pursue options which they need to pursue in order \nto avoid the waste of resources, options which will allow us to be \nmilitarily sufficient and not to promote proliferation in Russia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I again thank my colleague from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator for \noffering this amendment. I am very hopeful that the Senate will adopt \nit.\n  I strongly support this amendment, and I commend Senator Kerrey's \nleadership on this important issue of nuclear arms control. His \nproposal is a significant step in moving forward on the stalled process \nof nuclear arms reductions. Now more than ever, given the present \nclimate of tension in the world, it is essential for the United States \nto reactivate arms control discussions with the Russians. It is also \ncritical that we demonstrate to the international community our \nwillingness to engage in continued nuclear arms reductions.\n  This initiative offers us a major opportunity to break the current \nimpasse\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\nthat is preventing significant reductions in the stockpiles of nuclear \narms. In addition, it can help to revitalize the START II debate in the \nRussian Duma, and move us toward greater cooperation on this critical \nglobal security issue.\n  At the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on Military Readiness \non January 5, I pressed senior military officials about spending \npriorities in the armed services, and questioned the need for \nmaintaining strategic forces at the START I level. In response to my \ninquiries, the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. J.L. Johnson, agreed \nthat he would prefer to reduce the number of Trident submarines from \nSTART I levels, and see some of the money currently used to maintain \nstrategic forces at old levels reallocated to meet current and more \ncritical needs. This amendment will give us the opportunity to do so in \nother parts of our strategic arsenal as well.\n  As Senator Kerrey noted, history demonstrates the benefits of this \nkind of initiative in arms control, and the impact that can be made by \na modest but significant gesture. In September 1991, President Bush \nordered that 1,000 U.S. warheads scheduled for dismantling under START \nI be taken off alert, before that treaty was every ratified. This \naction resulted in a reciprocal response from President Gorbachev, who \njust one week later, designated thousands of Soviet nuclear warheads \nfor dismantling and took several classes of strategic systems off \nalert.\n  Three years after the Senate ratified START II, we still have not \nmoved closer to the goals in that important treaty. Russia has yet to \nratify this treaty, and a move by the United States toward meeting our \nSTART II goals may encourage the Russian Duma to take up its \nratification, and move us closer to the creation of START III.\n  This is an important time in our relationship with Russia. Earlier \nthis year, we passed a bill calling for the creation of a National \nMissile Defense System, conditioned on an amended ABM treaty negotiated \nwith Russia. The best way that we can more toward a new ABM treaty and \nwork to improve global security is by demonstrating to our Russian \nallies that we are committed to arms control--and an effective way to \ndemonstrate this commitment is by passing this amendment.\n  Moving closer to implementation of START II will also provide \nsignificant savings for the American taxpayer. This amendment will open \nthe door to savings in the cost of upkeep for many unnecessary weapons. \nIn addition, the tritium in these weapons can be recycled, eliminating \nthe need for production of new tritium and the associated production \ncosts.\n  This amendment is a constructive effort to breathe new life into the \nstalled arms control negotiations, move us closer to achieving the \ngoals of START II, and send a strong signal to Russia and the \ninternational community about our commitment to these goals. It will \nstrengthen our ability to cooperate with Russia to combat the growing \nthreat of rogue nuclear states, and to build a more comprehensive \nglobal security system. Reducing our military stockpile, even to START \nII levels, will not impair our national security in any way. As Admiral \nJohnson explained to us last January, this amendment is in the best \ninterest of the armed services, and it will help us to meet more \ncritical readiness needs. I hope this amendment will be accepted. I \ncommend the Senator for initiating it.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Virginia want to \nspeak?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will speak whenever you have completed. I want to \naccommodate you. You can follow me, if you so desire; whatever your \ndesire may be.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would love to hear the Senator's remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. KERREY. You can go first. I would love to hear your remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. You are thoughtful to say that, because I enjoyed \nlistening to yours but I, regrettably, think you are wrong in this \ninstance, and I will move to table your amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend from Massachusetts, a fellow \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, we have in this bill--you are \nranking on that committee--the removal of those submarines as sought by \nthe President and the administration.\n  The essence of what I have to say is that Congress expressed a \nwillingness to do that. Hopefully, this legislation will go through, \nbecome law. It seems to me, if the administration has further \nreductions in the arsenal, let it come before the Congress. That is the \nprocedure that I would follow.\n  So I just say, in opposition to this amendment, the amendment would \nstrike section 1041. Section 1041 renews and modifies the provision \nthat has been enacted in the defense authorization bill each year for \nthe last 5 years. This is a measured, balanced, and needed provision \nwhich, in my view, all Members of the Senate should support. It simply \nprohibits the retirement of certain strategic delivery systems unless \nSTART II enters into force. Essentially, this provision seeks to \nprohibit unilateral compliance with the reduction of U.S. inventory \nimplementation of the START II treaty and make clear to Russia that the \nbenefits of our mutual arms control agreements can only be realized \nthrough mutual implementation of those agreements.\n\n  This year, the Secretary of Defense and the Navy requested we modify \nthe limitation to permit the retirement of four of the older Trident \nsubmarines. The Secretary, however, made it very clear that the \nadministration was not advocating any unilateral implementation of \nSTART II. The Armed Services Committee reviewed the Secretary's \nrecommendations to reduce the Trident force from 18 to 14 submarines \nand agreed to authorize such reduction. Section 1041 of the pending \nbill does, in fact, allow retirement or conversion of these four \nsubmarines.\n  In keeping with the administration's policy not to unilaterally \nimplement START II--and that is the policy; I assume the Senator from \nNebraska agrees with that--the Secretary also made sure that the fiscal \nyear 2000 budget request fully funded all remaining operational \nstrategic nuclear delivery systems, including the 50 peacekeeper \nintercontinental ballistic missiles deployed at the F.E. Warren Air \nForce Base. The Armed Services Committee supports this decision, and \nthere is nothing in this bill that prohibits the Secretary from \nimplementing any planned reduction to our strategic forces.\n  Section 1041, which the Kerrey amendment would strike, simply \nreinforces the administration's policy of remaining at START I force \nlevels until START II enters into force. To strike this provision would \nsend a signal that the Senate no longer supports this policy. This \nwould be a dangerous and unnecessary signal to send, one that could \nundermine the integrity of the arms control process.\n  Since section 1041 does not prohibit any planned changes to U.S. \nstrategic forces, it would appear that the supporters of this amendment \nare really interested in some form of unilateral arms control or some \nother steps that go beyond the administration's policy. At a time when \nour relations with Russia and China are quite uncertain, I say to my \ndear colleagues, now is not the time to consider unilateral reductions \nin our strategic forces.\n  The United States and Russia are now hopefully nearing full \nimplementation of the START I agreement. The administration has worked \nvery hard to get Russia to ratify START II. If the Senate votes to \neliminate section 1041, this action could be interpreted as a sign that \nthe Senate is giving up on START II. Unless my colleagues are willing \nto abandon the arms control process, I suggest that they not support \nthe pending amendment. Indeed, the administration has acknowledged that \nsection 1041 provides significant leverage over Russia to get them to \nratify START II.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me simply reiterate that section 1041 \nof the pending bill was crafted with the Secretary of Defense's views \nfirmly in mind. Nothing in this provision prohibits the Secretary from \nundertaking any action he plans for fiscal year 2000. And, since the \nprovision expires at the end of the fiscal year 2000, we will have an \nopportunity next year to review any new recommendations coming from the \nadministration. For the time being, it\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\nwould send a very bad message to strike this important provision. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the Kerrey amendment and support the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I regret that Senators are on opposite \nsides of this issue, but we clearly are. I have offered this amendment \nbecause I believe our current strategy to deal with the threat of \nnuclear weapons is flawed in many serious ways.\n  First of all, this amendment has the support of the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs and Secretary Cohen. They have not announced any intent to \ngo below the START I levels, but we are not asking for unilateral \ndisarmament. We make decisions about how many men and women we are \ngoing to have in our Armed Forces, how big our Navy is going to be, how \nbig our Army is going to be, our Marine Corps, our Air Force is going \nto be. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. Nobody accused \nPresident Bush of unilateral disarmament at the end of the cold war \nwhen he drew our defense forces down.\n  I happen to believe we have gone too far. I support reinvigorating \nour Armed Forces. I don't support giving the Russian Duma a veto over \nthat decision.\n  That is basically what this is all about. I do not know whether the \nPresident would exercise the authority, but in my view this amendment \nwould allow the President to make a decision independently and say, \nthis is the level of nuclear weapons that we need. I have heard \nknowledgeable patriots who have served their country, who have spent a \ngreat deal of time on this subject, say to me that we are, as a \nconsequence of this law, maintaining a level higher than we need to \nkeep the people of the United States of America safe, spending money \nthat is needed in other areas, especially in the conventional area, \nforcing the Russians to maintain a level of nuclear weapons higher than \ntheir economy gives them the capacity to control, and dramatically \nincreasing the risk of an unauthorized launch as a consequence.\n  That is the new risk. In the old days when we had arms control \nagreements--and I am not as optimistic about arms control agreements \nany longer. The Senator from Virginia asked if I supported the policy \ninherent in this language. Frankly, I do not believe START II is going \nto be ratified by the Duma. And even if it is, it has been overtaken by \nevents, in my judgment. Even at that level, the Russians would be \nrequired to maintain a force structure of nuclear weapons that their \neconomy does not allow them to safely maintain.\n  I think we would see continued deterioration and continued increased \nrisk to the people of the United States of America not from a \nhypothetical risk here. All of our armed services have been vaccinated \nnow against anthrax. The Chairman knows there are conferences about all \nkinds of new threats that are very real and very present. But there is \nno threat greater than the threat of Russian nuclear weapons. There is \nno threat that would arrive here faster, that would arrive here more \naccurately and more deadly than any one of a number of weapons systems \nthat I could describe in the Russian nuclear arsenal.\n  In my view, what this does, quite the contrary to unilateral \ndisarmament, is it allows the United States of America to decide what \nis in our interests. If I had reached a conclusion that I thought we \nought to have 10,000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal, that that was in \nour interests, I would be on the floor arguing that we ought to; that \nrather than having a 6,000 floor, we ought to say that arms control is \nnot going to work at all. If the Russians were doing something that \ncaused me to conclude that I thought we ought to have a higher level, I \nwould argue for that.\n\n  I am arguing that the United States of America should make its own \ndecisions when it comes to nuclear weapons. And right now, in my view, \nthat decision would cause us to go below the statutory floor that we \ncurrently have and a further benefit would occur as a consequence \nenabling us to reduce the threat of an unauthorized launch.\n  Again, I have a great deal of respect for the chairman and admire his \nwork and agree with him on lots of things that are in this bill, but I \ncome to the floor to offer this amendment because I believe very \npassionately that it will make the people of the United States of \nAmerica safer and more secure if it is adopted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say in reply that this section was \ncrafted with the views of the Secretary of Defense firmly in mind. \nNothing in this provision prohibits the Secretary from undertaking any \naction he plans for fiscal year 2000. And since the provision expires \nat the end of the fiscal year 2000, we will have the opportunity in the \nnext year to review any new recommendations coming from the \nadministration.\n  A year from now we will have more clarity, hopefully, of the \nrelationship with China, of the relationship with Russia and, indeed, \nthis Senator's concern about North Korea and its advancements in \nmissile technology. So I think we can focus on the superpowers but \nthis, in my judgment, talks to the entire strategic defense of the \nUnited States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much, although the \nonly reason I was referencing Secretary Cohen and General Shelton's \nsupport, as Senator Levin indicated earlier and put in the Record, \nthere has been some indication that perhaps the administration doesn't \nsupport eliminating this artificial floor. They do. They have no \nplans--they have not indicated that they intend to go any lower than \nthis. But they have put in the record at the Armed Services Committee, \nin response to Senator Levin's question, that they support this \namendment. They support eliminating this artificial floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will do the same.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. It has been a good, spirited debate \non a very serious subject. I think his historical context would be very \nhelpful for all Senators. The bottom line is, we tend to forget, as you \npointed out, in 1988, it was foremost in our minds. Not so.\n  Mr. President, if the Senate could now proceed to the vote with all \ntime yielded back, I ask for the yeas and nays and move to table the \nKerrey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is the desire of the managers and the leadership to \ncontinue to work on this bill and make good progress.\n  The pending amendment is the amendment by the distinguished leader \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Lott; am I not correct? I am fairly certain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Actually, the pending amendment is the Allard \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. President, we are then ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 396\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering with Senator \nHarkin and a number of other people is now before the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the start that Senator Grassley be added \nas a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Colorado yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield for an inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has the floor and \nhas yielded to the Senator from Virginia for an inquiry.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I am very anxious to structure this so all Senators have an \nopportunity to speak on this important amendment. I have spoken to \nSenator Harkin, and he desires 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the amount of time he will require. It may be \nthat we have to go off this amendment for a short time, but I have \nassured him that we would not, of course, vote, and we would come back \non the amendment to give him the 20 minutes.\n  But I inquire of the Senator from Colorado the time that he desires, \nand the distinguished Senator, Senator Inhofe, the time that he \ndesires.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would guess about 15 minutes is what I would need.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why not give 15 minutes to each side; 20 minutes for \nSenator Harkin.\n  Is there any other time that you know of, I ask my distinguished \nranking member?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We do not know of any other time.\n  So we are clear then, we will not close off debate on this until \nSenator Harkin has an opportunity to come back and claim his 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have assured him. In order to protect \nall parties--Senator Stevens may wish to speak to this --I ask \nunanimous consent that we have 1 hour, divided 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, and 40 minutes, \nwhich would include the time for Senator Harkin, under the control of \nthe Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in order to protect Senator Harkin, which I \nknow the Senator from Virginia is determined to do--\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. --and I am determined to do, if he is unable to be back \nhere by the time the 40 minutes is utilized, we would then go to some \nother matters and protect him?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is exactly right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado has the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair let me know when I \nhave reached the 15-minute mark.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so informed.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered, with Senator \nHarkin, and others, dealing with the Civil Air Patrol, is, in the \ngreater scheme of this defense authorization, probably not that big a \nmeasure. But for the Civil Air Patrol, its members, an the job they do, \nit will prevent a huge and unfortunate change.\n  This defense authorization contains a provision that would force the \ncivilian, volunteer, locally controlled Civil Air Patrol wings into a \nmore rigid and centralized Air Force command structure.\n  My fellow sponsors of the current amendment and I feel this forced \nchange would hamper the patrol, hinder their activities, and hurt, \nultimately, results.\n  The Air Force fights wars. Their structure and administration are \ndesigned for fighting wars. The Civil Air Patrol, a nonprofit civilian \nservice organization, is fundamentally different.\n  The Patrol was started to watch our borders during war time. But now \ntheir focus is search and rescue, counterdrug operations, and \nhumanitarian efforts.\n  Last year, the patrol saved 116 lives through their search and rescue \noperations. In 1998, they also flew 41,721 hours in support of \ncounterdrug operations. Over the last 4 years, the Patrol membership \nhas increased 20 percent, and the youth cadet program has increased its \nmembership by 30 percent.\n  Newspaper are full of stories about Patrol efforts to find downed \nplanes, lost hikers, and others, or emergency flights to provide \nsupplies, transport people, and shuttle other vital items.\n  After the recent tornados in Oklahoma, Patrol wings flew damage \nassessment missions for relief authorities.\n  In January, the Colorado wing found two missing hikers in Mesa Verde \npark in Colorado. In April, they flew search and rescue looking for the \nMiller family of Iowa. As the Omaha-World Herald said on Tuesday, May \n11, ``When a small plan goes down in the unforgiving mountains of \nsouthwest Colorado, the story seldom ends well.'' But the Patrol kept \nat it, doing what they have been called on to do time and time again.\n  The Air Force conducted a week long review of the Patrol at national \nheadquarters. They found what they\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\ndeemed to be irregularities. The Civil Air Patrol has responded to the \nreview, point by point. They have shown a willingness to deal with the \nAir Force by instituting some of the proposed measures, an by \nnegotiating on the others. But from my understanding the Air Force, \nhowever, does not wish to negotiate in a sincere manner.\n  While I understand Air Force Secretary Peters position, I do not \nbelieve the only option on the Civil Air Patrol was to do it the Air \nForce Way. I would prefer to do it the correct way.\n  And so what is the proper congressional response now? This section of \nthe defense authorization is certainly not the answer. The provision \nthat we are trying to remove with this amendment could very well be a \n``fix'' for something that is not broken, or a surgical amputation \ninstead of a band-aid.\n  There have been allegations of financial impropriety and safety \nlapses. I am willing--in fact, I am eager--to have these fully \ninvestigated.\n  The amendment before us mandates a Department of Defense Inspector \nGeneral audit on the financial and management structure of the Civil \nAir Patrol, and requires them to present the report, with \nrecommendations, to the congressional defense committees. The amendment \nlikewise calls for the GAO to investigate and make recommendations on \nthe CAP management and financial oversight structure, as well as the \nAir Force's management and financial oversight structure of the Civil \nAir Patrol and their recommendations for improvement. Both reports are \ndue by February 1, 2000, so that we can consider the reports and \nrecommendations for next year's authorization. But the amendment does \nnot overwhelmingly change the makeup and leadership of the Patrol, \nwithout hearings, congressional oversight, or joint party \nconsultations. It allows us to take an informed and reasoned approach \nto dealing with the allegations.\n  The Civil Air Patrol is not some loose-cannon. It is not some rogue \nagency. The Patrol is already an auxiliary of the Air Force. Their \nfinancial practices are overseen by the Air Force. Air Force personnel \nmust sign off on Patrol expenditures and billing. Air Force personnel \nwork at Patrol headquarters, with daily access to financial records, \nand these records are all public information.\n  I do not know the motives for this attempt to subsume the Patrol into \nthe Air Force after all these years. If the desire is merely to react \nto charges of impropriety, then the language as it stands is obviously \nexcessive, and our amendment is the far better approach.\n  But if I don't know the reason why, I certainly know reasons why not \nto allow this language.\n  I worry the Patrol will lose its local control.\n  It is very important in States such as Colorado that we have \nimmediate decisions when a plane goes down. Because we live in a State \nthat has a lot of rough terrain, the weather changes quickly and \ndramatically, it is important that decisions be made quickly. With our \nlocal decisionmaking process, those decisions do get made properly and \nwe can get out and save peoples' lives, in States such as Colorado, \nthrough the efforts of the Civil Air Patrol. It will sour those locally \nbased volunteers who make up the overwhelming majority of the wings, \nwho donate their time and energy and often equipment. Many of the \nassets of the Civil Air Patrol are gifts the Patrol received from \ndonors willing to give to a charitable organization. How can we justify \nthe Air Force wresting control of these items away from the local \nvolunteers? How can we justify the added expense of substituting high-\nranking, paid, benefit-earning Air Force personnel for unpaid, \nvolunteer Civil Air Patrol leadership? How can we justify doing it with \nso little discussion, so little oversight, so little recognition of the \nseverity of the action?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment. I want to say that there is \nno one of the 100 Members of the Senate who has been historically \ncloser to the CAP, who has participated in CAP activities than I have. \nThere is not a year that goes by that I do not talk to the troops and \nthose who are being promoted, those who have achieved really great \nthings and have made great contributions to society. I also, just 2 \nweeks ago, could very well have been the product of a search by the \nCAP, had I not been able to glide my plane into an airport. So I \nunderstand that. I have been on various patrols where we go out. I know \nthe valuable contributions that the Civil Air Patrol makes to this \nNation every year, search and rescue, youth cadet program.\n  However, we are concerned with the continuing streams of allegations \ncoming from the Air Force and from members of the Civil Air Patrol that \nsenior members of the CAP have engaged in inappropriate, and in some \ncases, illegal activities. I will outline a few of the allegations that \nhave been brought to the committee by either the Air Force or former \nmembers of the CAP.\n  I have some documents to include as part of the Record that I will \nwant immediately following my remarks, but these are just some of the \naccusations that are out there. I know that the Senator from Colorado \nis just as concerned about these as I am.\n  One individual was charging the cost of his flying hours to the Civil \nAir Patrol counterdrug account when he was actually flying to visit his \ndaughter. A second accusation: One CAP wing charged both its home State \nand the CAP counterdrug budget for the same mission, essentially \nreceiving double reimbursement for the same activity.\n  Here is a good one: The southeast regional commanders conference was \nheld on a cruise to Nassau paid for by CAP headquarters. After the \nconference, some individuals requested and received a per diem, even \nthough the cost of the cruise had been paid for by the CAP and, thus, \nby the taxpayers. I have often thought--I suggested this to the Senator \nfrom Colorado--what kind of a position would we be in, would I be in, \nas chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee if I sat back and let these charges go unanswered? I could \njust imagine ``60 Minutes'' or some news account of this talking about \nthe cruise to Nassau that was paid with taxpayers' money and then \ndouble dipping on top of that.\n  We have numerous other types of reports concerning missing equipment. \nSeventy percent of one wing's gear, communications gear, computers, et \ncetera, cannot be accounted for; 77 percent of another wing's gear is \nmissing. The most extraordinary of all, however, is a letter we \nreceived from one former member alleging that Federal laws and Federal \naviation regulations relating to aircraft maintenance were being \nviolated, and quoting from that letter, ``the lives of our cadet''-- \nthese are juveniles--``members were being jeopardized.''\n  We are talking about human lives here. Because of these accusations \nand because the Civil Air Patrol is an auxiliary of the Air Force, \nreceiving virtually all of its funding--some 94 percent of the funding \nfor the CAP comes from the Air Force and the headquarters at the Air \nForce installation--the leadership of the Air Force requested that the \ncommittee pass legislation to grant the Air Force the necessary \nauthority to ensure responsible management of the Civil Air Patrol.\n  That is exactly what this legislation does. This is in our mark that \nis before us today.\n  I do urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. However, should it \npass, I hope that the Secretary of the Air Force will refer the \nallegations to the FBI and seek to sever the Air Force's ties with the \nCAP. We can't hold the Air Force responsible for an organization that \nit doesn't have any authority to supervise. I do not know whether there \nis any other example anywhere, Mr. President, where you have the \nresponsibility statutorily borne by some agency and they have no \nauthority to police or discipline the behavior of that entity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from General Ryan, Chief \nof Staff of the Air Force, making this request be printed in the \nRecord. And I ask that the internal memorandum that outlines many other \nexamples, which I would be glad to share with the Senator from Colorado \nand with the Senate, should this debate pursue, be\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\nprinted in the Record immediately after the letter from General Ryan.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Department of the Air Force,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Chief of Staff,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1999.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, \n         Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Air Force has a long-standing and \n     mutually beneficial relationship with the Civil Air Patrol \n     (CAP). As a former CAP cadet, I am very familiar with the \n     important role this organization plays in shaping the lives \n     of thousands of young Americans.\n       However, there have been a number of recent incidents which \n     have caused us some concern about the activities of the CAP \n     headquarters. As an auxiliary of the Air Force, CAP receives \n     most of its budget and a great deal of nonappropriated \n     support, such as free use of on-base facilities, from the Air \n     Force. Yet, it is not accountable to the Air Force for how it \n     spends its budget or conducts its business. Consequently, we \n     have developed a proposal to strengthen and preserve our \n     relationship with CAP. It requires new legislation, but will \n     not affect CAP's funding levels. It will be transparent to \n     the CAP field units and will ultimately improve the level of \n     support they receive from the headquarters.\n       We have briefed your personal staff and the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee staff on our proposed changes to the Air \n     Force-CAP relationship. We recently met with the CAP \n     leadership and continue to seek solutions to our concerns. \n     These efforts are ongoing and should they prove successful, \n     we will recommend withdrawing this legislation.\n       I trust this information is helpful and ask for your \n     support as we work to strengthen the bond between the Air \n     Force and CAP.\n\n                                              Michael E. Ryan,\n\n                                                    General, USAF,\n     Chief of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: AF/DXON.\n     Subject: Special Project Team Assessment of Civil Air Patrol.\n\n Memorandum for the Special Assistant to the Secretary of The Air Force\n\n       As you know, I traveled to Maxwell AFB, AL from 18-23 April \n     1999 as part of the Special Project Team that the Secretary \n     and Chief of Staff chartered to assess Civil Air Patrol (CAP) \n     processes. Our purpose was not to perform a full-blown \n     inspection of either CAP's administrative headquarters or the \n     units in the CAP national chain of command. Nevertheless, in \n     just a couple days time the team discovered a number of \n     practices that convinced us of the Air Force need for greater \n     oversight of CAP activities. I will cite a few examples that \n     are of particular concern:\n       CAP recently conducted its Southeast Region Commander's \n     Conference on board a Caribbean cruise ship with the National \n     Commander and National Director in attendance. Our auditors \n     discovered that executives claimed per diem for this meeting \n     even though the cost of the cruise was inclusive of meals.\n       Senior corporate leaders travel by first class, and receive \n     what could be regarded as generous salaries. Certain senior \n     corporate employees are receiving full military retirement \n     pay in addition to their salaries.\n       CAP units flew over 41,000 hours on ``counter drug'' \n     missions, which were reimbursed, from appropriated funds. We \n     are aware of several irregularities where personal travel and \n     maintenance flights were charged to counter drug, as well as \n     one wing that charged several counter drug missions to both \n     the Air Force and the state.\n       Several CAP wings cannot account for over 70% of the \n     communications equipment purchased for their units with funds \n     that were reimbursed with Air Force appropriated funds.\n       Members and former members complain that they lack faith in \n     the independence and effectiveness of the CAP Inspector \n     General program. Members were refused membership renewal \n     coincidental to raising complaints about equipment control, \n     aircraft maintenance (safety) practices, and an assault. A \n     flight check ride pilot was ostracized from her unit for \n     restricting a CAP pilot from solo flight privileges. In each \n     case, the affected members went to their IGs who deferred to \n     command action.\n       Because this assessment was never intended to be an \n     inspection, the observations made should be viewed only as \n     symptoms. The team also observed truly excellent programs at \n     certain wings and more generally at the administrative \n     headquarters. Talented and dedicated volunteers and employees \n     in many cases provide safe and valuable programs to cadets \n     and the country as a whole. The CAP National Board seemed to \n     satisfy a major concern by agreeing in principle to comply \n     with OMB Circular A-110. Nevertheless, the Air Force should \n     attempt to gain visibility through representation on an \n     overseeing Board of Directors to assure that CAP's role as a \n     civilian auxiliary to the Air Force will be a credit to the \n     Air Force and the nation. The Board of Directors would \n     operate at the macro level and provide the SECAF authority \n     commensurate with the responsibility of overseeing CAP \n     matters. This would clearly establish the auxiliary to \n     principal structure to foster a healthy relationship for the \n     future. Unless CAP CORP leadership convinces the National \n     Board to reverse itself and embrace such a structure, it is \n     regrettable that the only sure way to obtain this reasonable \n     level of oversight will likely be through legislation.\n\n     Robert L.

Well, I will respond to the chairman by saying that I do \nnot have anyone who has requested time from me. I have pretty much \nstated the whole case. I would appreciate, of course, yielding time to \nhim to hear his position on this, as chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will ask unanimous consent that I have about 5 minutes \non this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  In response to comments in the cases that were presented by my \nesteemed colleague from Oklahoma--I will add at this point, it is a \npleasure to serve with him on the Armed Services Committee; he is \nsomebody that I highly regard in the Senate, a very honorable \nindividual. I know that he has a love for the Civil Air Patrol and he \nwants them to be able to do their job effectively. I know that his \nconcerns are out of love for that very organization, because he is a \npilot himself. I will respond that from the information I have on the \nmisallocation of the personnel uses, I understand there is a high \nprobability that that occurred. But in other organizations where this \nhappens, we don't go and just take away complete control of the \norganization without some hearings, without some oversight from this \nCongress.\n  I understand that the Air Force has spent some time in overviewing \nit, and it has been done within the structure of the Air Force. I \nthink, before we move ahead with an amendment as dramatic as what is in \nthe defense authorization bill before us, that we ought to have some \nhearings, that we ought to, as Members of Congress, spend some time and \ndelve into the actual facts.\n  I don't think we can do this without having some agency do some \nreporting for us. That is why in the amendment that I have put forward, \nI ask the GAO to look at the financial structure--this is an area my \ncolleague has suggested where there could be some problems--and report \nback to Congress whether or not there are abuses. And also in the \namendment, I have the Inspector General, who can look at the \nadministrating aspects of it, how they established policy, see if they \nare following through with their goals, if they are doing what they \nhave promised to the Congress and to the Air Force, and give a report \non those incidents. And we ask that this be given in a timely manner so \nthat next year when we come back in and this bill is before us then we \ncan go ahead and look over the report and, hopefully, maybe have a \nhearing or two based on the report and put something reasonable and \nresponsible forward.\n\n  I have some real concerns about saying, OK, we are going to turn over \ntotal control to the Civil Air Patrol, take it away from being a \nvoluntary nonprofit organization. That is almost like a chapter 11 in \nthe real business world. When you take over the board of directors, you \ncompletely change everything.\n  I don't think it is that serious. I don't think we ought to put the \nAir Force in control of the board of directors. But I do think there \nare some things that we need to investigate. For example, on the cruise \nissue brought up by my colleague, my understanding is\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\nthat the Air Force was the one that OK'd the disbursement for that \ncruise. So there might be some question of where the responsibility \nlies, who was culpable for some of these actions. I know the Air Force \nhas some oversight on some of the equipment.\n  Now, maybe we don't have the Air Force doing what their \nresponsibility should be. So if that is the case, then there might be \nenough blame here to go around to everybody. I think the only way, as \nMembers of the Senate, we can begin to sort this out is if we have \nhearings, we ask for a report from the General Accounting Office, and \nask the inspector general to give us a report, so we have some facts on \nwhich we can work.\n  For that reason, I am continuing to push my amendment. I hope the \nMembers of the Senate will support me. A number of my colleagues also \ncome from mountainous States where the Civil Air Patrol is vital and \ntheir response needs to be made on a local decisionmaking process. We \ncan't be waiting to go out to search until after it has been filtered \nthrough Washington and goes back to the State. On these search efforts, \nwhen they come up, there is an immediate need and there has to be an \nimmediate decision made locally.\n  My hope is that we can adopt my amendment and take out the more \nonerous provisions that we have in the bill until we can get the facts \nbefore us. And then, after we have those facts, perhaps we can move \nforward in a more informed and responsible manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I know the Senator has the \nbest interests of the CAP at heart in making his comments. But I do \nbelieve that he needs to read this very carefully, and if any other \nMembers want to read it, it is on pages 292, 293, and 294.\n  All we are doing is saying that if the Air Force is going to continue \nto be responsible for the behavior and the actions of the CAP, they be \ngiven some oversight, some ability to get into the books and check \nthese things out. It is my understanding that the account that the \nSenator from Colorado has is not an accurate account of the cruise. I \nwill repeat the accusation.\n  The Southeast Region Commanders Conference was held on a cruise to \nNassau. Now, this is a cruise paid for by public funds, CAP funds, \nwhich came from the Air Force. After the conference, some individuals \nrequested and received per diem, even though the cost of the cruise had \nbeen paid for by taxpayer money. I just think this is so outrageous. In \nfact, the Air Force personnel who was wanting to stop this from \nhappening was so opposed to it that he refused to go on the trip \nhimself. He canceled out.\n\n  All we are saying is that if they are going to be responsible for \nthis, we are going to have to, in some way, give them the authority to \noversee it. After a while, I am going to be giving a talk on what I \nfind to be offensive about this whole bill that we are discussing \ntoday. It is primarily that we are not funding adequately our whole \nmilitary, certainly in the area of readiness. Our service Chiefs, our \nfour-stars, and our CINCs all got together and said, in order to meet \nthe minimum expectations of the American people, and to meet our \nnational requirements, our mission requirements, we would have to have \n$17.4 billion a year more for the next 6 years, plus the amount for pay \nincreases and retirement. That comes to about $24 billion. The amount \nof increase here is only $9 billion--totally inadequate.\n  I am supporting this legislation because it is the very best we can \ndo. I say to the Senator from Colorado, we are looking everywhere to \npick up a million dollars here and a little bit there; we want to do \nit. In spite of that, General Ryan recommended, because of his \naffection for the CAP, an additional $7.5 million. That should \ndemonstrate his feelings about the CAP. We were not able to give that \nadditional amount. We kept the same levels as the previous year because \nwe have problems in modernization, quality of life, force strength, and \nthere is no place that isn't bleeding and hemorrhaging right now. So \nthat is my concern.\n  I would hate to be in a position to deny the Air Force the right to \nat least look at the books and have an opportunity to stop this type of \nabuse if they are going to be responsible for their actions. Right now, \nthey are responsible. That is why I said if this should pass, I think \nthe Secretary of the Air Force really needs to refer these accusations \nto the FBI and sever the ties of the Air Force. CAP doesn't want that. \nThey have had a very good relationship all these years. I think there \nmay be a small number of people who perhaps have not exercised the \nproper behavior and don't want the oversight. But I can't think right \nnow of any example in Government where someone is responsible for \nsomeone else and yet has no authority over their behavior.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding. In \nresponse to the Senator from Oklahoma, I agree that funding for our \nmilitary has been dismal, particularly in light of the fact that this \nadministration has continued to have more deployments than President \nBush and President Reagan put together. Yet, we have cut defense from \ntime to time, and I am very sympathetic to and voted for increased \nfunding for the Department of Defense. I understand there are problems \nwith the Air Force, but I think this is where the Civil Air Patrol, \nwith their voluntary program, helps with the budget; they don't hurt \nthe budget.\n  If we have shortages at the Air Force, as far as adequate funding for \noversight, it seems to me that taking over the whole program is going \nto require more personnel, more time, and it is going to cost the Air \nForce more. It seems to me that the responsible thing to do at this \nparticular point is to, first of all, get our studies and facts in \norder and then find out if we can't come up with a commonsense \nresolution that has some reasonable oversight by the Air Force and \nstill keep this a voluntary organization. The strength of it is the \nvoluntarism. I hate to take that away from it. I think we save the Air \nForce money.\n\n  So that is why I believe it is important that we go ahead with the \namendment that I am proposing, because I think in the long run the Air \nForce can benefit. We just have to get the oversight problems taken \ncare of. We can do that. Once we get the facts before us--and that is \nwhat my amendment does--then we can move forward.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Actually, the Senator from Colorado has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nOklahoma yielded to me. What is our time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma yielded the floor. \nThe Senator from Colorado assumed the floor. At this time, the Senator \nfrom Colorado has 8 minutes and the Senator from Oklahoma has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I was going to \nask a question of the Senator. First of all, I realize that the Senator \nfrom Colorado and I both are among the strongest supporters of our \nnational defense. The Center for Security Policy has us both rated as \n100 percent. That is not an issue on the table. We both feel that way.\n  My problem is, No. 1, they have made the specific statement that it \nis not going to cost any more to have some supervision over the CAP \nbecause the time they spend trying to look into these things without \nthe authority to do it is more time consuming than if they had the \nlegal authority that we are trying to give them with our defense \nauthorization bill. If you just take the money in the examples I used \non the trip to Nassau and all of that, I think you would have to agree \nthat the money would be better spent on spare parts than it would be on \nsome of the double-dipping in which they have engaged.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. I have supported Senator Allard's \namendment, because, as I understand it, it calls for a GAO evaluation \nand an inspector general investigation for the potential wrongdoing.\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will reclaim my time, and yield the \nfloor so the Senator will be talking on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Two or 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think it is time to reevaluate the way \nthe Civil Air Patrol is supervised. I am inclined to think that the Air \nForce justifies and makes a good case for tighter accountability and \nfor maybe more direct ultimate control over how the Civil Air Patrol \noperates. But, as Senator Allard has eloquently discussed, it is a \npopular volunteer agency that we don't want to become too bureaucratic, \nelse we may lose the popularity that is involved with it.\n  I hope before we vote on this--I suspect the vote is set for \ntomorrow, is that correct, not tonight?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am not sure whether it is going to be scheduled for \ntonight or tomorrow. I haven't heard one comment from the floor manager \nin that regard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was hoping that perhaps we could get with the Air \nForce one more time, and maybe they would be amenable to improving this \namendment to give them maybe more certainty or more prompt resolution \nof it and get this matter settled. I think that is going to be \nimportant.\n  I want to maintain the vitality and the attractiveness of the Civil \nAir Patrol and the many thousands of volunteers that do so much. We \nwant to increase accountability. We want to increase their \nresponsibility to professionally manage every dollar. They are an \nagency that receives our funding, and we have every right to expect \nrigorous accountability. I would like to develop a system in which the \nAir Force feels comfortable. I think we are close to that. Maybe we can \nreach that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent that my time be allocated to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I hope before this is over the Senator from Alabama is on \nmy side. So I don't mind using my time to ask the question.\n  I ask the Senator. I know there are a lot of demands on time. Was the \nSenator from Alabama in here when I made my remarks concerning the \naccusations of those things that have taken place with the CAP?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am aware of some of those allegations.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask also if he is aware of what this does. It takes an \nentity that is 94 percent paid for by taxpayers' funds and gives some \nauthority of oversight as to the expenditure of that 94 percent of \nfunds that are being used. That is essentially what the amendment does.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I favor that. I certainly favor full investigation of \nevery allegation of wrongdoing. I believe that Senator Allard's \namendment calls for that. I think the difference would be: Are we \nprepared tonight to make the final decision about how this \nreorganization occurs or should we get a GAO report and an IG report \nfirst?\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. I also want to make sure----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 7 minutes and \nthe Senator from Colorado has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me yield myself whatever time I may need.\n  I say to the Senator that in my remarks I commented that there isn't \na Member of the 100 Members of the Senate who has worked closer on an \nactive basis, actually flying with and teaching and working with the \nCAP, than I have. I have attended every ceremony that they have had--\nunless there is something I don't know about--in the State of Oklahoma, \nbecause of my strong support for their group.\n  My problem is this wonderful group has a few bad apples in it, and \nthere is no way to get at those bad apples. Here we have General Ryan \nsuggesting that we increase the appropriations to them for the \noperation of their program by $7.5 million that we had to deny when the \nSenator and I were sitting in the Armed Services Committee.\n  This is a time that we can't afford to be throwing away any money \nwhen we have all the readiness needs, when we have modernization needs, \nwhen we have force strength needs, and quality-of-life needs, and all \nof these things that need to be funded in this particular area. I just \ndo not want to be in a position where I am passing an amendment to take \naway the authority of the Air Force in this case which is using public \nfunds to fund this entity and taking away their ability to in some way \ndictate what is going on there if they are going to be responsible for \nit.\n  Here they are responsible for some of this activity, such as the one \nindividual that was charging the cost of his flying hours to the CAP \ncounterdrug account when he was actually flying to visit his daughter, \nor one CAP person charged his time both to the home State and the CAP \ncounterdrug budget. So he is double-dipping. Those are public funds \nthey are getting--funds that could be used to buy spare parts, funds \nthat would keep us from having to cannibalize engines, funds that would \nkeep us from having to keep these guys working 16 hours a day repairing \naircraft that are broken down.\n  I think we are looking at so many issues. That is why we discussed it \nat some length in our committee, because we can't allow these abuses to \ntake place and tell the Air Force, Your hands are tied; you have \nresponsibility for their actions but you don't have anything to do with \ntheir performance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate and respect the insight of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, because he has stood steadfastly for good defense, and \nhe knows this issue exceedingly well.\n  Again, I think maybe we can reach a compromise that would give us \nsome opportunity to review the reorganization and the structure.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reclaiming my time, let me throw out a suggestion. We can \ngo ahead and pass this as a mark that dictates at this time. If there \nis any kind of abuse, we can change it. Anything we do can be changed. \nThat is what we are trying to do right now. These abuses are not things \nthat just happened in the last 6 months. They have been happening over \na long period of time.\n  We talked about doing something about this in the last three \nauthorization bills. We haven't done it. We put it off. Nothing has \nhappened. Now we have an opportunity to do it. All we are doing here is \nallowing us to at least have some ability to monitor what is going on \nand stop some of these things.\n  I just keep thinking about the ``60 Minutes'' program coming up with \nall of these abuses. What do we do? We have debated this issue. We \nturned around and said we will leave the status quo. That is what we \nare going to do if we pass the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Some change is necessary. I certainly agree with that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor. I yield whatever time the Senator from \nVirginia may consume.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the committee sat here and listened to \nthe differences of views of three of his stalwarts. But as I listened, \nI said to myself, possibly you could work it out. We are at the point \nin time where I would like to go on another amendment. Senator Harkin \nwill return at circa 7 o'clock, and he desires to speak for about 15 or \n20 minutes. We made in the unanimous consent agreement that provision. \nThere is time within which you might consider it, because I stand very \nfirmly with the decisions of the committee. I listened to the debate. \nAs a matter of fact, ironically--I hate to keep dating myself--along \nabout circa 1943, or 1944, I was associated somehow with the Civil Air \nPatrol, because I always wanted to join the Army Air Corps. It was \ncalled the Army Air Corps in those days. Also, it gave a young person--\nas I was 16--an opportunity to hop in a plane and fly. It was exciting \nto fly in those days. It was not a matter of routine in those days. It \nwas a dream. So much for that trivia.\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\n  The point is that this is a very respected and venerable organization \nthat has to be preserved.\n  As I listened to our colleague from Oklahoma recount the potential \nproblems, ``60 Minutes'' is going to tune in on this pretty soon. There \nare just a few of us that understand the value of the Civil Air Patrol, \nand we could lose it.\n  For example, the junior ROTC and the junior NROTC and other programs \nto encourage young people to direct some portion of their life devoted \nto the military, I have seen those programs scaled back, funding \nreduced, and support reduced. It concerns me that this program, \nlikewise, could face those situations.\n  I am going to support the Senator from Oklahoma in his position \nbecause it is a committee position. I listened to the debate and I \nbelieve some remedies have to be addressed.\n  With a little luck, maybe we can work it out.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have completed my statement. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. All Members cosponsoring this amendment recognize we have \nsome oversight problems. We are struggling because we don't have the \nfacts firmly before the Senate. It seems to me, as with any other \nproblem that comes before this Senate, we can go through the same \nchannel as any other agency. We can have hearings--public hearings; we \ncan have a GAO study, and an inspector general study to have some basis \nin fact with which to work. Once we have all the facts, we can put \ntogether some reasonable recommendations.\n  At this point, to turn total control over to the Air Force is a \nrather draconian action until we get the facts. I hope I can sit down \nwith the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, whom I respect dearly, and work out a way to make it \naccountable without having to turn over total control to the Air Force.\n  I am afraid we will lose the volunteer aspect. I think that is one of \nthe real values of the Civil Air Patrol. The volunteer aspect used to \ngo down to young students, high school age. They learn to work the \nradio; they learn to be part of a team; they get experience with \nflying, and eventually they may very well apply to the Air Force \nAcademy or the Navy to fly. I think it is a great recruiting mechanism \nwith lots of advantages. I think it all boils down to the volunteer \norganization.\n  My hope is we can work out a plan that would bring accountability to \nthis very serious problem yet maintain the volunteer aspects of the \norganization and local control.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I leave it to the experts on this.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The amendment merely gives oversight.\n  Here is the problem: I appreciate the voluntary aspect of it; \nunfortunately, the voluntary aspect of this only funds about 5 percent, \nand about 95 percent is public funds, for which we are responsible.\n  Before the esteemed chairman of the committee arrived, I talked about \nhow strapped we are. I believe the bill we are debating today is \ninadequate in terms of proper funding, but it is the best we can do, so \nwe support it.\n  I can think of military construction projects right now that would \nlove to have a little extra funding, and it does relate to our security \ninterests.\n  I am happy to work with the Senator from Colorado on any kind of a \ncompromise that will give oversight of the CAP to the Air Force so that \nthey will have some degree of control.\n  If 95 percent of the funding of the CAP is taxpayers' dollars, the \ntaxpayers have to have some degree of control. We have a lot of other \nanecdotal accusations. I don't want to get into that. Things like this \nare going on and things like this will continue to go on in any entity \nin society that doesn't have any oversight. I can cite some examples in \nanother committee. We served on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee where one of the agencies has had no oversight over the past \n5 or 6 years and was getting out of hand. They have to have oversight. \nThose people are dealing with public funds and the public has to have \noversight.\n  My concern is what will happen if we don't do this. If we don't do \nthis, as I suggested, the Secretarys of the Air Force may decide to \nsever relations, and then we really have a serious problem with CAP. I \nthink there is not a person in here who is not a strong supporter of \nthe CAP --certainly these three Senators are among the strongest. \nWe are attempting to save it.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I say to my colleagues, is it possible we could \nconclude this debate? We are anxious to bring up another amendment \nwhich we hope to vote on tonight.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will sit down with my colleagues, both of my \ncolleagues, and go over some of this language. The way I read the \nlanguage, the Air Force Secretary appoints the national board of \ndirectors, and they have total control over the rules and regulations. \nIt looks to me as if they have total control. Maybe I am \nmisinterpreting it.\n  I am willing to sit down with my colleague and see if this happens or \nnot, and maybe we can work out a compromise.\n  With that in mind, I yield the floor so the chairman can move ahead.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I make one last comment to the Senator from Colorado. The \nlanguage where the local units would continue to be run by local \ncommanders is not addressed in this. That doesn't change. That would \nremain as it is in the current law.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, we will ask unanimous consent that this amendment be \nlaid aside until such time as I bring it up again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. At that time, we will have debate by Senator Harkin for a \nperiod not to exceed 15 to 20 minutes, and then we propose to vote, \nunless good fortune strikes and these able Senators are reconciled.\n  The pending business now would be the amendment from the \ndistinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott; would that not be correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. We now turn to an amendment by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, a very valued member of the Armed \nServices Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic \nForces.\n  It would be my hope we could arrive at a time agreement and possibly \nvote on the amendment tonight.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If I may respond to the Senator from \nVirginia, how much time would the Senator like to have?\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to consult with my distinguished ranking member, \nbut in fairness, I advise my good friend I have looked over this \namendment--the Senator from Virginia, as chairman of the committee--and \ncertainly my own judgment is that I will have to move to table.\n  I think my good friend understands that.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to the Senator, I understand that \nthe Senator opposes it. I ask if the Senator would allow considering an \nup-or-down vote. But the Senator is the chairman, and I respect that. I \nprefer an up-or-down vote because I think it is an issue that is \ndeserving of that one way or the other, no matter how we feel. It seems \nto me more appropriate to have a yes-or-no vote, but obviously I defer \nto my chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. And I thank my colleague for that understanding.\n  So if the Senator will proceed and allow me to seek recognition as \nsoon as the ranking member can give me advice, I will be in opposition, \nas will the ranking member.\n  I hope we could have, perhaps, 50 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. My concern is the tabling motion. As the \nSenator knows, this issue is on the calendar now as a separate issue. \nMy purpose in bringing it up on this bill: There are a lot of Senators \non both sides of the aisle who support it. My assumption is there may \nbe enough, but I haven't done a whip count.\n  My inclination would be, if the chairman is going to move to table \nit, to not bring it up at this time, because I do have the option of \nbringing it up as a separate resolution because it is on the calendar.\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\n  I hoped to have an up-or-down vote. I put it to the chairman this \nway: If the chairman will allow an up-or-down vote, I am happy to have \na time limit, say, of 30 minutes, depending on what the other side \ndesires. I don't need any more than 15 minutes.\n  If the chairman is going to table, I think at this point I will not \noffer the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a development somewhat new, as opposed to what we \nhad in earlier conversations. Might I suggest the Senator lay down the \namendment and commence and give me the opportunity to consult with the \nranking member?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. All right.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 405\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress with respect to the court-\nmartial conviction of the late Rear Admiral Charles Butler McVay, III, \nand to call upon the President to award a Presidential Unit Citation to \n               the final crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 405.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1061. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE U.S.S. \n                   INDIANAPOLIS.\n\n       (a) Court-Martial Conviction of Last Commander.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the court-martial charges against then-Captain Charles \n     Butler McVay III, United States Navy, arising from the \n     sinking of the U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS (CA-35) on July 30, 1945, \n     while under his command were not morally sustainable;\n       (2) Captain McVay's conviction was a miscarriage of justice \n     that led to his unjust humiliation and damage to his naval \n     career; and\n       (3) the American people should now recognize Captain \n     McVay's lack of culpability for the tragic loss of the U.S.S. \n     INDIANAPOLIS and the lives of the men who died as a result of \n     her sinking.\n       (b) Presidential Unit Citation for Final Crew.--(1) It is \n     the sense of Congress that the President should award a \n     Presidential Unit Citation to the final crew of the U.S.S. \n     INDIANAPOLIS (CA-35) in recognition of the courage and \n     fortitude displayed by the members of that crew in the face \n     of tremendous hardship and adversity after their ship was \n     torpedoed and sunk on July 30, 1945.\n       (2) A citation described in paragraph (1) may be awarded \n     without regard to any provision of law or regulation \n     prescribing a time limitation that is otherwise applicable \n     with respect to recommendation for, or the award of, such a \n     citation.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I spoke in morning \nbusiness on this issue a couple of days ago, to call it to the \nattention of my colleagues, because I believe it is one that is very \nimportant and very relevant to this bill. I wanted my colleagues to be \naware that I would probably be bringing it up at some point in the near \nfuture. I did not expect it to be quite this soon.\n  A lot of individuals who have expressed an interest in my bringing it \nup earlier rather than later, are not only my colleagues but many \naboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis who survived this great tragedy at sea. \nIn deference to them, I felt it would be appropriate to try to get a \nvote on this. I want to emphasize to my colleagues, I hope my \ncolleagues are paying attention out there, watching on TV. Because if \nthere is any doubt or concern about whether or not this should be \nsupported, I urge Senators to listen to me for a few minutes as I try \nto explain why I believe this amendment should be agreed to.\n  First of all, I have a number of cosponsors who came in as original \ncosponsors. Not only myself, but Senator Frist, Senator Bond, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Robb, Senator Hagel, Senator Breaux, Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Helms, Senator Inhofe, Senator Durbin and Senator \nEdwards. It is a joint resolution. I also, subsequent to that, received \ncosponsorship from Senator Boxer and from Senator Inouye.\n  We can see it represents all regions of the country and both sides of \nthe political spectrum. It is not in any way, shape, or form a \npolitical issue. It simply expresses the sense of Congress with respect \nto the court-martial conviction of the late Rear Adm. Charles Butler \nMcVay, III. It calls upon the President to award a Presidential Unit \nCitation to the final crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.\n  This is an incredible story of incredible bravery and at the same \ntime it is a story of incredible prejudice to an individual with a \ngreat, distinguished record as a captain, as an officer in the U.S. \nNavy.\n  I want to share with my colleagues this brief story from the closing \ndays of World War II, the war in the Pacific. I know as we debate the \nissues of the day, and believe me I have been involved in them all \nweek, and there are some huge issues--the China issue and so many \nothers. But I think it is important to understand. I just spoke a few \nmoments ago to new flag officers who were just getting their stars. It \nwas quite an honor to do that. But I think it is important, if we are \ngoing to ask people such as these new flag officers to come on board to \nserve and continue to serve in the military, not to leave after their \nenlistment is up, but to become those flag officers, they need to \nunderstand if there is some type of inequity or something that has \nhappened that causes an injustice, we need to look at it in a way so we \ncan make a wrong right. I think they need to know that. If something \nwas wrong and the military did something wrong, we need to be big \nenough to admit it and to correct it. That is what this story is about.\n  This is a harrowing story. It has a lot of bad elements--It has bad \ntiming; it has bad weather. It has heroism and fortitude, but it also \nhas negligence and shame. It has good luck and bad luck. And above all, \nit is a story of some very special men whose will to survive shines \nlike a beacon even today, many decades later.\n  We have the opportunity, right now, perhaps as soon as an hour, to \nredeem the reputation of a fine man--a wronged man, in my view--and \nsalute the indomitable will of a very fine crew of the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis. I had the privilege of hosting two--actually more than \ntwo, several survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, a couple here \nyesterday or the day before that, and several before that at a meeting. \nThe bill I offer today will honor all these men and their shipmates of \nthe U.S.S. Indianapolis and redeem their captain, in my view--Capt. \nCharles McVay.\n\n  Captain McVay graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1920. He was a \ncareer naval officer. He had an exemplary record in the military that \nincluded participation in the landings in North Africa, award of a \nSilver Star for courage under fire earned during the Solomon Islands \ncampaign. Before taking command of the Indianapolis in November of \n1944, Captain McVay chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee of the \nCombined Chiefs of Staff in Washington. That is the highest \nintelligence unit of the Allies during the war.\n  McVay led the ship through the invasion of Iwo Jima, then bombardment \nof Okinawa in the spring of 1945, during which Indianapolis \nantiaircraft guns shot down seven enemy planes before the ship was \nseverely damaged. Captain McVay returned his ship safely to Mare Island \nin California for much-needed repairs.\n  Another great story about the Indianapolis which is not well known. \nIn 1945, the Indianapolis delivered to the island of Tinian the world's \nfirst operational atomic bomb, which would later be dropped on \nHiroshima by the Enola Gay on August 6. After delivering her fateful \ncargo, she then reported to the naval station at Guam for further \norders. She was ordered to join the U.S.S. Idaho in the Philippines to \nprepare for the invasion of Japan.\n  It was at Guam that the series of events ultimately leading to the \nsinking of the Indianapolis began to unfold. It is quite a story.\n  There were hostilities in this part of the Pacific, but they had long \nsince ceased. This is 1945. The war is almost over. The Japanese \nsurface fleet is no longer considered a threat and attention instead \nhad turned 1,000 miles to the north where preparations were underway \nfor the invasion of the Japanese mainland.\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\n  So we have a picture here of very little Japanese activity in the \nPacific. These conditions led to a relaxed state of alert on the part \nof those who decided to send the Indianapolis across the Philippine Sea \nunescorted, and consequently Captain McVay was randomly told, just \nzigzag at your discretion.\n  So the higher-ups were in a relaxed state. We were going into the \nJapanese homeland. There was little presence, Captain McVay was told. \nSo we will send you out across the Philippine Sea unescorted. The \nIndianapolis, unescorted, departed Guam for the Philippines on July 28, \n1945. Think about how close we are now to the end of the war. Just \nafter midnight, on 30 July 1945, midway between Guam and the Leyte \nGulf, the U.S.S. Indianapolis was hit by two torpedoes fired by the \n``I-58'', the Japanese submarine that was not supposed to be there \naccording to the higher-ups.\n  The first torpedo blew the bow off the ship. The second hit the \nIndianapolis at midship on the starboard side adjacent to a fuel tank \nand a powder magazine. You cannot imagine--no one could--the resulting \nexplosion, but it split the ship completely in two.\n  There were 1,196 men aboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis on that fateful \nnight. Mr. President, 900 escaped the ship before it sunk in 12 \nminutes. In 12 minutes, the naval ship went to the bottom and 900 men \nwere able to get off that ship before it sank. Few liferafts were \nreleased, and at sunrise on the first day of those 900 men being in the \nwater, they were attacked by sharks. The attacks continued until the \nremaining men were physically removed from the water almost 5 days \nlater.\n  If you can imagine in the middle of the night aboard ship: It is hit \nby two torpedoes and sinks in 12 minutes, very few liferafts; you are \nin the water. The men were in the water for 5 days and the sharks began \nimmediately to circle and attack and pick these men off, literally, one \nby one, as wolves might pick off a weakened antelope or some other \nanimal they were pursuing.\n  Shortly after 11 a.m. on the fourth day, the survivors were \naccidentally discovered by an American bomber on a routine \nantisubmarine patrol. This is important for my colleagues to understand \nthis--accidentally discovered.\n  A patrolling seaplane was dispatched to lend assistance and report. \nEn route to the scene, it overflew the destroyer Cecil Doyle DD-368, \nand alerted her captain to this emergency. The captain of the Cecil \nDoyle, on his own authority--no orders--decided to divert from his \nmission and go to the scene of the Indianapolis sinking.\n  Arriving there hours ahead of the Cecil Doyle, the seaplane's crew--\nthe seaplane's crew had called the Cecil Doyle; the Cecil Doyle is en \nroute and the seaplane, in the meantime, began dropping rubber rafts \nand supplies to these men who had been in the water for 5 days. While \ndoing so, they observed the shark attacks. They literally saw men who \nwere moments from rescue dragged under by attacking sharks. These men \nwere so overcome by this that, disregarding standing orders not to land \nat sea, the plane landed and taxied to the stragglers and lone swimmers \nwho were at greatest risk of shark attacks, as the sharks would pick \noff those who were not able to stay up with the rest of the group. It \nwas an act of extreme bravery on the part of the seaplane crew.\n  As darkness fell, the crew of the seaplane waited for help, all the \nwhile continuing to seek out and pull nearly dead men from the water. \nWhen the fuselage of the plane was full, the survivors were tied to the \nwing with a parachute cord. That plane rescued 56 men from the water on \nthat particular day, just literally sitting in the water allowing these \nmen to cling to that plane.\n  Then came the Cecil Doyle. This was the first vessel on the scene, \nand it began taking survivors aboard. Again, disregarding the safety of \nhis own vessel, the Doyle's captain pointed his largest searchlight \ninto the night sky to serve as a beacon so other rescue vessels might \ncatch it. This was the first indication to the survivors that their \nprayers had been answered. Help at last had arrived.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have, I think, news that will be \nreceived as good news. The distinguished Senator from Colorado and the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma, at the suggestion of the chairman, \ngot together and they resolved the amendment; am I not correct in that?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I think we are getting some common ground worked out. I \nam hopeful we can get something put on paper.\n  Mr. WARNER. The purpose of interrupting our distinguished colleague \nis to advise the Senate, because many Senators are engaged in other \nactivities right now and the sooner we let them know there will or will \nnot be a vote, it will be helpful to them and the chairman. I \nunderstood the Senator just now to indicate this thing was settled.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We think we have reached agreement. We are getting it put \ndown on paper. We can put this vote off until tomorrow, if that is the \nSenator's question.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tim Coy, a \nstaff person, be granted the privilege of the floor for the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was engaged in conversation with Senator \nSessions, and he told me it was an absolute. I spoke with the Senator \nfrom Colorado just now and I felt I got an absolute answer.\n  Mr. ALLARD. When we get it down in writing, that is when we will have \nan absolute answer. We made a vocal agreement. I think we are there. I \ndo not want to sign off completely.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am a moment premature.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened very intently to my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, and I have studied the history of the \nIndianapolis. His opening statement I found persuasive to the point \nwhere I would like to go back to neutral on any question of tabling and \noffer to my good friend the opportunity for the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to have a hearing, because, as you recall yesterday--I \ncertainly do vividly, because I spent hours in the debate--our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Roth of Delaware, brought in a most \nsignificant record, and I think the Senate would likewise want a live \nrecord on this critical issue that you bring before the Senate.\n  Therefore, a hearing would avail you--and I hope you would avail \nyourself to chair that hearing--of the opportunity to develop a record \nto bring to the Senate so Senators would have the benefit of that \nrecord to make this important vote.\n  For that reason--perhaps you would like to finish your presentation \ntonight so it is there in the Record--perhaps you will consider that, \nand we will not proceed with the amendment further, that you will take \nit down.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments \nthe Senator has made. I think clearly it would be in the best interests \nof the Senate, and certainly of the Indianapolis, to not have the \namendment tabled. I believe you bring up some very valid points. There \nmay be some Senators who have not had a chance to digest this.\n  I did send out a significant amount of information over the past \nseveral days, but we have been busy. So in deference to the chairman, \nas long as my rights are protected--I would like to complete 5 or 6 \nminutes to just finish the statement I was making, to finish the story, \nif you will, as to what happened--I will, with the chairman's \ncommitment to a hearing, withdraw the amendment. We will have the \nhearing at some point, whenever is appropriate, where we can both \nconvene it. Then perhaps we can bring it back after that hearing to the \nfloor as a separate piece of freestanding legislation, which I have on \nthe calendar, as is, anyway.\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my good friend for his cooperation and \nunderstanding. This is an important chapter of naval history. Some of \nour colleagues have not had the opportunity to look at it as \nextensively as has the Senator, plus I think the record of some live \ntestimony will be helpful.\n  So to inform Senators, the Senator from New Hampshire will proceed \nfor such time as he desires to conclude his opening statement. Then \nfollowing that, the Senator from New Hampshire will send to the desk an \namendment relating to funding on the Kosovo operations; am I not \ncorrect on that, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is correct. I will be happy to offer \nthat amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we can agree now that the time agreement on that \nwould be, why don't we say, 40 minutes. At the conclusion of that, \nagain, I have to advise my good friend I will move to table. So I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 40 minutes to be equally divided \nbetween the Senator from New Hampshire and the two managers of the \nbill, and then we will have a vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, just reserving the right \nto object, I do have six or seven cosponsors. I did not realize this \nwas going to come at this point. I would just like to be able to \nprotect their rights to speak. My intention would be not to go beyond \nthe 40 minutes, if they did not show up. I ask you to amend the UC to \n60 minutes. If we do not need it, I would be more than happy to yield \nit back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. About how much longer will you be taking?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Starting at 7:00.\n  Mr. WARNER. So, Mr. President, we would start at 7:00. All debate \nwould be concluded at 8:00. The Senator from Virginia will move to \ntable, at which time we will have a record vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to be certain that the chairman is \nin agreement with my understanding of what this would be. At 8:00, the \nchairman would move to table, and if in fact it is tabled, that would \nend it. But if it is not tabled, there will be then no limitation as \npart of this unanimous consent agreement on time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is quite clear. I will read the UC \nand incorporate that in it. This gives an opportunity for Senators to \nplan the balance of the evening. I now ask unanimous consent that when \nSenator Smith from New Hampshire offers an amendment regarding Kosovo, \nwhich will take place not later than the hour of 7:00, there be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on \nor in relation to the amendment. I finally ask consent that no \namendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I still \nhave that standing.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is gone, but what is on your mind?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Harkin was informed that at 7:15 he would be \ngranted, how many minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct. But I am advised by the \nprincipal sponsor, Senator Allard, that the matter has been settled. It \nis being written up. Of course, Senator Harkin would be consulted. If \nfor any reason that writing fails to resolve it, then we will have to \nrevisit this amendment tomorrow at a time that you and I will discuss \nto accommodate Senator Harkin and other Senators.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is my understanding that it is the intent, at least of \nthe chairman, that this would then be the last vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the prerogative of the leader, but I have reason \nto believe that you are correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That that is the intent?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the intent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know that is not the decision until the leader --\n  Mr. WARNER. I am 99.99 percent certain that this would be the last \nvote at 8:00.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I add my thanks to the Senator from New Hampshire. As \nalways, he is very cooperative with attempting to resolve issues. I \ndidn't have a chance to thank him earlier today for his willingness to \naddress the Trident submarine issue, even though he took a different \nposition on the amendment of Senator Kerrey, that part of that \namendment really had been addressed, at least in committee, with the \nTrident reduction. While I very much supported Senator Kerrey's \namendment for the reasons that I gave, I didn't have an opportunity \nduring that debate to thank Senator Smith for his participation in \naddressing one part of that issue which the Defense Department was most \nanxious to address. I thank him for that as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nhis comments.\n  Just finishing the story briefly, in 5 or 6 minutes, so we can go \nahead to the next issue, there were 900 men who made it into the water \nand only 317 remained alive at the end of those 5 days. If you can \nimagine 5 days of shark attacks, starvation, thirst with only salt \nwater, suffering from exposure. The men from the U.S.S. Indianapolis \nwere finally rescued. Curiously enough, the Navy withheld the news of \nthe sunken ship from the American people for 2 weeks until the day the \nJapanese surrendered, on August 15, 1945. So the press coverage was \nminimal. Also, it was somewhat suspicious that they started the \nproceedings without having all the available data that was necessary. \nAnd less than 2 weeks after the sinking of the Indianapolis, before the \nsinking of the ship had even been announced to the public, the Navy \nopened an official board of inquiry to investigate Captain McVay, the \ncaptain of the ship, and his actions. The board, strangely enough, \nrecommended a general court-martial for Captain McVay 2 weeks after the \nincident before it had even been made public. Indeed, many of the \nsurvivors' families were not even made aware that the ship had gone \ndown.\n  Admiral Nimitz, commander in chief of the Pacific Command, didn't \nagree. He wrote the Navy's judge advocate general that at worst, McVay \nwas guilty of an error in judgment, but not gross negligence worthy of \na court-martial. Nimitz later recommended a reprimand. Nimitz and \nAdmiral Spruance later were overridden by the Fifth Fleet, Secretary of \nthe Navy James Forrestal and Adm. Ernest King, Chief of Naval \nOperations. They directed that the court-martial would go on and \nproceed.\n  It is pretty difficult to understand why the Navy brought the charge \nin the first place.\n  Explosions from torpedoes, as I said before, had knocked out the ship \ncompletely, knocked out its communication system so he was unable to \ngive an abandon ship order except by word of mouth, which all of the \ncrew said McVay had done. So he was ultimately found not guilty on that \ncount.\n  Then the second count was not zigzagging, and it goes on to talk \nabout that.\n  The bottom line, Captain McVay was ultimately found guilty on the \ncharge of failing to zigzag and was discharged from the Navy with a \nruined career. And in 1946, at the request of Admiral Nimitz, who had \nnow become the CNO, Chief of Naval Operations, in a partial admission \nof injustice, Secretary Forrestal remitted McVay's sentence and \nrestored him to duty. But Captain McVay's court-martial and personal \nculpability for the sinking of the Indianapolis continued to stain his \nNavy records. The stigma of this conviction remained with him always. \nAnd as sometimes happens in these kind of tragedies, in 1968, he took \nhis own life. To this day, Captain McVay is recorded in naval history \nas negligent in the deaths of 870 sailors. Not one sailor said that he \nwas negligent, yet it still continues to be on the record.\n  This is an injustice. I look forward to having the hearing and \nhearing from these sailors who will tell us publicly how they feel \nabout this.\n  We need to restore the reputation of an honorable officer. In the \ndecade since World War II, the crew of the Indianapolis, to their \neverlasting credit, has worked tirelessly in defending their captain. \nCaptain McVay could be and would be, if he were here, very proud of his \nmen who are trying to see that his memory is properly honored.\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\n  We can do that. We can help the crew do just that right here in the \nSenate. It is at the request of the survivors that I introduce this \nresolution.\n  Since McVay's court-martial, a number of other things have come up. I \nwill not get into those now because of time, but we will get into them \nin the hearing.\n  Let me conclude on this point: Many of the survivors of the \nIndianapolis believe that a decision to convict Captain McVay was made \nbefore the court-martial. That is a very serious charge. They are \nconvinced that McVay was made a scapegoat to hide the mistakes of \nothers higher up. McVay was court-martialed and convicted of hazarding \nhis ship by failing to zigzag despite overwhelming evidence that the \nNavy itself had placed the ship in harm's way, not Captain McVay, \ndespite testimony from the Japanese submarine commander that zigzagging \nwould have made no difference, despite the fact that although 700 Navy \nships were lost in combat in World War II, McVay was the only Navy \ncaptain, ship captain, to be court-martialed, and despite the fact that \nthe Navy did not notice when the Indianapolis failed to arrive on \nschedule. In spite of that, he was court-martialed, thus costing \nhundreds of lives unnecessarily and creating the greatest sea disaster \nin the history of the United States.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 405, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, at Chairman Warner's \nrequest, I will withdraw my amendment at this time and look forward to \nthe hearing.\n  The amendment (No. 405) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 406\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit, effective October 1, 1999, the use of funds for \n military operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n Montenegro) unless Congress enacts specific authorization in law for \n                    the conduct of those operations)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will now proceed to the next issue at \nhand, my amendment on Kosovo, which I send to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Mr. Sessions, Mr. Allard, Mr. Craig, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. \n     Hutchinson, proposes an amendment numbered 406.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle D, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. __. RESTRICTION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS \n                   IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (SERBIA \n                   AND MONTENEGRO).\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none \n     of the funds available to the Department of Defense \n     (including prior appropriations) may be used for the purpose \n     of conducting military operations by the Armed Forces of the \n     United States in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia \n     and Montenegro) unless Congress first enacts a law containing \n     specific authorization for the conduct of those operations.\n       (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to--\n       (1) any intelligence or intelligence-related activity or \n     surveillance or the provision of logistical support; or\n       (2) any measure necessary to defend the Armed Forces of the \n     United States against an immediate threat.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on \n     October 1, 1999.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is an amendment I \nregret very much that I have to offer. I cannot express in words how \nstrongly I am opposed to the war in Yugoslavia and the conduct of that \nwar. I have to say that the only weapon in the arsenal of a Congressman \nor a Senator is funding.\n  Cutting off funding is the only way you can stop an administration \npolicy that you do not approve of. It is the only instrument we have at \nour disposal under the Constitution. And I will be the first to admit \nthat it is a blunt instrument, but it is the only weapon I have in my \narsenal to stop a policy that I think is very dangerous, one which is \ngoing to cost us dearly if we continue.\n  So with great reluctance, I am offering this amendment, not because I \nwant to but because I have to. As we deliberate funding the Department \nof Defense for the next fiscal year, I think the Senate of the United \nStates should go on record as to whether or not we ought to be expected \nto vote on funding this operation in Kosovo.\n  We have been warned many times against interventions like the one in \nYugoslavia. Our Founding Fathers themselves implored us in written \nstatement after written statement, in speech after speech--George \nWashington comes to mind in his Farewell Address--not to meddle in the \naffairs of sovereign nations. He took care to warn us against the \nmischiefs of foreign intrigue. We would do well to heed his words.\n  But we did not heed his words when we attacked Yugoslavia. It is not \nthe first time in American history, but we did not heed those words. We \nstarted the war in Yugoslavia. We attacked a sovereign nation in the \nmidst of a civil war. The Founding Fathers explicitly gave the \nresponsibility to Congress to approve or disapprove acts of war, and we \ncannot and we must not abdicate that.\n  We have already authorized airstrikes. We did that, regrettably, in a \nvote that I lost earlier this spring. But the issue here is: Are we \ngoing to have an operation of possible ground forces and a possible \ncontinuation of airstrikes in a sovereign nation in the midst of a \ncivil war, without any statement from Congress other than one that was \nto fund an air war, which kept the ground troops out, which allowed \nMilosevic to take over Kosovo? This policy has not worked. We are being \ndragged into a ground war. Believe me, there are plans on the table, \nand everybody in America should know it, right now as we speak, to put \nground forces into Kosovo.\n  When a superpower uses military force against another nation, it has \nto do it with an intensity and ferocity that shows purpose and \ndecisiveness. I do not want any more Vietnams. I served in Vietnam. I \nwatched the politicians debate the war, and the people in the streets \nprotest the war while the rest of us fought the war, and then were not \ntreated very well when we came home. I have had enough of that. It has \nbeen said many times: ``No more Vietnams.'' Well, to do anything less \nthan to go in with absolute purpose and absolute decisiveness and end \nthe war that you began--to do less than that is another Vietnam.\n  Somalia comes to mind. People lost their lives. We did not have a \nclear purpose there either. We just went in. And here, in Kosovo, we \njust went in. Yes, Milosevic is a terrible person and he has done \nterrible things to innocent people. The question is, though: Was \nbombing Milosevic the way to end it?\n  Well, apparently not, since there were 2,000 people dead and 50,000 \nrefugees when we went in, and now there are 150,000 dead and a million \nrefugees. Apparently, the policy that 58 senators supported in here two \nmonths ago is not working.\n  I have been on this floor repeatedly arguing against this war. I do \nnot like doing so. But we are attacking a sovereign nation, and our \nnational interests are not at stake. Humanitarian problems in \nYugoslavia are serious problems, but are they national security \ninterests of the United States of America? Every single person out \nthere who has a son or daughter old enough to serve in the military \nshould ask themselves: Is it worth my son's or daughter's life to die \nin Yugoslavia for a humanitarian crisis that does not involve the \nnational security of the United States?\n  If the answer is yes, then you ought to tell all your Senators to \nvote against me. Call them up tonight and tell them that. I, for one, \nhave two sons and a daughter, and I do not want any of them in \nYugoslavia.\n\n  As the sole remaining superpower, we have a special obligation and \nresponsibility. We have to be committed to democracy, we have to keep \nour markets open, and we have to have the finest military in the world. \nAnd we do. But most importantly, we have to act clearly, decisively, \nand within our explicit national interests. We have not done that here \nin Yugoslavia.\n  Some people have said: Let's go win the war. Maybe somebody can \nexplain to me what ``win'' means. Does it mean that we occupy \nYugoslavia for the next hundred years? That we put a partition up \nbetween Kosovo and the rest of Yugoslavia, or barbed wire, and keep\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\n50,000, or 60,000, or 200,000 troops there for a hundred years? Perhaps \nwe should just bomb every bridge, every building, every oil refinery, \nevery railroad, flatten it to the ground, kill every Serb. Maybe that \nis how we win. Somebody tell me. I have been waiting. I have offered \nthis challenge on broadcast after broadcast, in interview after \ninterview, in conversation after conversation with administration \nofficials, Senators, Congressmen, people on the street, people in the \nmilitary. Nobody has given me the answer yet. How do we win? I have not \nheard the answer.\n  Our military is stretched to the breaking point. Recruiting is down. \nThere are chronic spare part shortages. Deployments continue to \nincrease. And now we are hearing reports about shortages of cruise \nmissiles and other smart weapons. Over 30,000 reservists are being \ncalled up.\n  Let me ask my colleagues to reflect on something. God forbid, but \nwhat if North Korea were to attack the South tomorrow morning; or Iraq \ndecided to invade Kuwait; or the Iranians, or the Libyans, or anybody \nelse caused some problems somewhere in their part of the world? Are we \nready to meet those threats? Could we meet those threats all at once, \nor any of them, and keep all of the commitments--including that in \nKosovo--that we have now? If you have a son or daughter in the \nmilitary, ask them. They will tell you that they cannot. Ask a general \nor an admiral in private, I say to my colleagues, and they will tell \nyou that we cannot. If we cannot, then we ought not to be doing this.\n  Let me tell you something. If we get into a ground war in Yugoslavia, \nwe are going to be there for a long, long time. I do not want that to \nhappen. I do not want to be proven right. But we are at a turning \npoint. If we continue to increase our intervention in Yugoslavia--which \nground forces will certainly do--we are in fact committing ourselves to \nthe Balkans, not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, not for a \nyear, but for decades. Mark my words: we will be in the Balkans for \ndecades.\n  We went into Vietnam in 1965. Thirteen years later and after 58,000 \nAmericans were dead, when we tried to defeat and conquer an indigenous \npeople who were dug in in their country, in their homeland, we still \nhad not gotten it done.\n  These people are going to fight for their homeland, and we are going \nto have to be prepared to take heavy casualties to move them out.\n  Again, I will be blunt about it. If you think it acceptable to put \nyour son or your daughter into Kosovo, then you ought to vote against \nme. But you ought to be prepared to put your son or daughter in there \nat the same time you put somebody else's son or daughter in there.\n  This region of the Balkans has been inflamed for centuries. If they \nattacked the United States, or if they threatened the national security \nof the United States anywhere in the world, I would lead the charge \nhere in the Senate for a declaration of war. But they have not done \nthat.\n  I am hearing a lot of pious arguments about this humanitarian crisis. \nBut the question we have to ask: ``Will our grandchildren be patrolling \nthe streets of Kosovo?''\n  Think about it--not you, not your son, but your grandson, and maybe \nhis grandson. Are they going to be patrolling the streets of Kosovo to \nkeep the Serbians from coming across their border and killing more \nethnic Albanians? That is what you had better ask yourself.\n  There are those who say that the integrity of NATO is at stake. I \nhear that all the time--if we do not go to war in Kosovo, NATO will \nfall apart. Look-- NATO survived the Soviet Union. It survived Joseph \nStalin. It survived Khrushchev and Brezhnev. But it is not going to \nsurvive Slobodan Milosevic?\n  For goodness' sake. This alliance has stood for decades for all of \nthese great powers, and has stood well. I supported NATO in those \nyears. The administration would almost laughingly tell us that Slobodan \nMilosevic has the power to do what Stalin, Khrushchev, and Andropov \ncould not do--destroy the NATO alliance. If the alliance is that \nfragile, maybe it is time to shut the door on NATO. Surely it is not \nthat fragile.\n  The key for NATO's success has been that it is a defensive alliance. \nBut it must stay true to its core mission--which it is not doing now; \nwe are seeing tremendous broadening of the scope of NATO here, under \nthis President--the collective defense of its members. If we use this \nas the overriding principle of NATO, that it should be there for the \ncollective defense of its members, not only will the cohesion of the \nalliance not be in question, but we would never have gotten involved in \nthe swamp in the Balkans. That is exactly what it is. It is a swamp. \nAnd we are going to get stuck in it.\n  Let me assure you of one thing. If this war against Yugoslavia \ncontinues to escalate, then NATO truly is finished, because NATO will \ndisgrace itself. Even today on the news we have our commander, General \nClark, saying we need to hit more targets, we need to hit more specific \ntargets in Belgrade, we have to come closer to those embassies, closer \nto those populations, take more risks, take out more facilities, risk \nmore collateral damage, because, if we do not, we will never win--or, \nif we do not, we are going to have to put in ground troops.\n  Should ground troops be introduced? Should we be forced to attack and \noccupy Yugoslavia? This will certainly be the end of NATO. This \nalliance is not an offensive force. It never has been. The greatness of \nNATO is the fact that it is defensive--that is what allows it to \nfunction by consensus.\n  Already our allies have tried to find a way to end the airstrikes. \nAnybody who tells you that there are no cracks in NATO and that NATO is \nsolidly behind this is not telling you the truth. Who can blame those \nin NATO who are taking a different position now? They joined NATO to \nprevent a European war. Now they find that the U.S. has led them into \none--in the Balkans, of all places.\n\n  One of the main reasons I do not support this war is because I want \nto preserve our standing in the world. It is because I believe our \nrelationship with Russia is on the line. It is because I believe that \nwe should not draw precious military resources from our overseas \ncommitments. It is because I care about the stability in Bosnia. It is \nbecause I believe in the sovereignty of other nations that I am against \nthe escalation of this conflict. Some call that isolationism. It is not \nisolationism, and I resent that reference. It is actually realism.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes, I yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I don't want the Senator to get the \nimpression that he is alone in his feelings. I agree with everything \nthe Senator said.\n  I would like to ask the Senator if he didn't leave out one very \nsignificant reason why we should not be involved in that war --or that \ncivil war within a sovereign nation--is that in our state of readiness \nright now we cannot carry out the national military strategy in \ndefending America's regional fronts. In fact, it is even questionable, \naccording to our air combat commander, that we could defend America on \none front, with all the allocations of our scarce assets that are going \ninto Bosnia, Haiti, and Kosovo.\n  Right now my major concern, with 5,000 of our troops already over \nthere in Albania, is that they are virtually naked; they have no force \nprotection, no infrastructure.\n  I hope the Senator will add to his list of reasoning why we shouldn't \nbe there is because it is draining our ability to defend America on \nsuch fronts as North Korea or the Middle East.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I certainly will add that to the list. I \nreferred to that a few moments ago. But it is a point well taken.\n  Mr. President, great powers use discretion. They do not allow \nthemselves to be bogged down in places where their interests are not at \nstake. They use their power judiciously.\n  When do we use force? When do we use diplomacy? We have made \ncommitments around the world in places like Korea and the Middle East. \nThe United States has shown resolve. We place American lives at risk \nwhen our vital interests are the stake. We have done it all over the \nworld. Americans have died in places all over the world that some \ncannot pronounce and never heard of. It has been happening for decades. \nThere is no question about it. But our vital interests are not \nthreatened in Yugoslavia.\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\n  We have troops in warships across the world. Every year we send \nbillions of Americans' tax dollars overseas in foreign aid. The \nAmerican people are the most generous in the world. Private citizens, \ncorporations, and charitable organizations send hundreds of millions of \ndollars every year to help needy people throughout the world. If we \nhave a flood, or an earthquake, or a tornado in America, how many times \ndo you hear about all of these other countries pouring in money to help \nthe people in Des Moines, or to help the people someplace else where a \ntornado or a flood occurs?\n  To somehow say now that we have to get into this conflict when we \nhave countries in Europe who can, and should, deal with it--how much \nmore blood do we need to shed in Europe for Europe? It is about time \nEurope stepped up to the plate.\n  The United States does not need to resort to airstrikes to show we \nare not isolationist, and we certainly should not put our troops at \nrisk. And we do not need somebody who has never been a strong military \nleader--indeed, who has never been in the military--to be the macho man \nwho drags us into a war where we do not belong in.\n  With this legislation, I am just trying to keep the administration \nfrom throwing money and forces at Kosovo without regular \naccountability. If Congress wants operations after 1 October, all we \nhave to do is authorize them. This vote tonight will not be the \nmission. We have made that vote. This vote is going to be on whether or \nnot we want to have another opportunity fund this operation after \nOctober 1.\n  I respect my colleagues on both sides of this question. I respect \nimmensely the thought that they put into it. I respect their \nconvictions. Again, the only instrument I have as a Member of Congress, \nblunt as it may be, if I disapprove of this policy, is to cut off the \nfunding. That is the reason I offer this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator, we have had many debates on the floor of the \nSenate about this very divisive war. The Senator from New Hampshire, \nfrom the very beginning, has been absolutely clear as to his views, and \nI respect them. I differ with them, but I respect them.\n  I will not go over the entire history of what I and other Senators \nhave said about this. These are those Members who believed that once \nthe commitment was made by this Nation as an integral part, as a full \npartner, of NATO, to the other 18 nations, that was it; it was to \nsupport our troops and to do what we can.\n  What worries me about the amendment is that it would send a signal to \nMilosevic: Hang tough.\n  This is the man who, as just clearly stated, has divided the whole \nworld, has divided every precedent of human rights. Would it not send a \nmessage to him to hang in there? No matter what we are able to inflict, \nhang in there, because on October 1 the United States pulls out of NATO \nand leaves it to the other 18 nations if they wish to carry on?\n  That is my first question.\n  The second question: What do we say to the men and women of the \nUnited States Armed Forces and the other nations flying missions, some \neight or nine nations flying missions? What do we say to them? They are \nin the cockpit right now, taking risks, risking life and limb. Did the \nSenator think about stopping it as of tonight? That was an option I am \nsure the Senator considered.\n  Those are the two questions I pose to my good friend.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Responding to the leader on his time, I \nlost that vote earlier, regrettably. I lost that vote on the floor.\n  What I am trying to do now is to not authorize any funds for \noperations in Yugoslavia beyond the October 1, the beginning of the \nnext fiscal year, unless we again authorize those operations.\n  Mr. WARNER. What do we say to the young men and women flying these \nmissions? Their mission tonight, tomorrow night, and into the \nindefinite future is to carry out the orders of the Commander in Chief \nof the United States and the guiding military group in NATO. They \nsalute, march off, get in the cockpit, fly off, and take risks. In my \njudgment, they are making some slow but, nevertheless, steady progress \nin degrading the military machine of Milosevic. When they fly home, \nthey drop their orders, and they can at least say it was another chip \naway toward the end result and the five basic points that NATO has laid \ndown to resolve this conflict.\n  If we are to pass this and they fly the mission, they will wonder: Am \nI going to be the last person to die on the last day of this war, which \nwould be September 30, 1999?\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. What do we say? First, we tell them that \nwe are ensuring that the American people, through their representatives \nin Congress, should either support it, if it is to continue, or not.\n  If my amendment were to prevail and I were one of those pilots, I \nwould hope that my Commander in Chief, after this amendment did \nprevail, would begin to make a compelling case for our actions against \nYugoslavia, and would bring that case before the American people for a \nvote in Congress. That is all this amendment requires. It is the only \nway to ensure that the American people are behind their troops in the \nfield.\n  Mr. WARNER. The first part of my question was, Does this not send a \nsignal to Milosevic to just hang tough and disrupt every effort being \nmade, whether by the United States, Germany or, indeed, Russia, in \ntrying to negotiate some diplomatic resolution?\n  I understand that the Russian delegation could be arriving within the \nnext 48-72 hours. The Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, is \nfinishing--if he hasn't already today--some discussions in Russia \nrelating to that mission. It seems to me that the diplomatic process \nwould come to a standstill.\n  Milosevic will say to his people, we have stayed this long, stay the \ncourse. If the United States pulls out, I think Milosevic could go to \nhis people and say there is little likelihood that the other nations \nmight continue on. And, furthermore, look who is flying the missions. \nOver 50 percent of the tactical missions are by U.S. pilots. Over 70 \npercent of the support aircraft, the tanker aircraft, the intelligence \naircraft, are all flown by the United States.\n  It would have the effect of disabling NATO from carrying on if it so \ndesired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I think that if we were to \nlook at the resolve of Mr. Milosevic, he has done pretty well for \nhimself, considering after 60-some days of bombing he has cleared out \nKosovo of just about every ethnic Albanian he can clear out, with the \nexception of those who can serve him as human shields to protect his \narmy and tanks.\n  That is despicable. I am not going to stand on the floor of the \nSenate and defend Slobodan Milosevic. I am concerned about the long-\nrange situation and what our objective is. We can bomb and bomb and \nbomb. We have been doing that. How long that goes on, I do not know. \nThe bottom line is: he has achieved what he wanted to achieve, which is \nto get the ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. He has accomplished what he \nwanted to accomplish in spite of the bombing--and maybe because of the \nbombing.\n  I do not know what we are gaining by continuing. But I do think that, \nas a minimum, the President must get Congressional authorization to \ncontinue the war.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for taking questions. I did not mean \nto importune the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I inquire of the Presiding Officer how much time remains \non both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Smith controls 8 minutes 30 seconds, \nand the Senator from Virginia, the manager, controls 23 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I am not going to take that long, only because I don't want the \nSenator to be left with no time to respond to what I think we will be \nhearing in the next 22 minutes. I want to make sure the Senator has \nadequate time.\n  Let me take a minute and say that I don't like the amendment but I \ndon't\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\nknow any other choice. I wish there were other choices out there.\n  We got involved in this. I am sure I can visualize what was happening \nwhen they made the decision to invade a sovereign nation, sitting \naround a table saying, we will send bombs out there for a couple of \ndays and that will take care of him and everything will be fine.\n  That was not the plan. We heard the plan criticized by the very best \npeople out there. I will be in the region again this weekend.\n  My concern, as I voiced several times, without a well laid out plan \nin a war we shouldn't be involved in--we have troops out there, as I \nsaid before, who are virtually naked and have no protection right now.\n  I am concerned about Albania and the threat to our lives there as \nmuch as I am crossing that line into Kosovo. Because right now there is \nno force protection over there.\n  As far as the pilots are concerned, I don't think there is a person \nin this U.S. Senate who has visited with the pilots more than I have, \nbecause as chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee I go around to all \nthese places. I take journalists with me, frankly, so these people will \nrealize why we are only retaining 19 percent of our Navy pilots, 27 \npercent of our Air Force pilots. It is not just the attractive economy \non the outside. It is not just the fact our mechanics are overworked \nand they are not sure the spare parts are going to be there. As they \nsaid in one of the places, with witnesses there, our problem is we have \nlost our sense of mission. They are sending us in places without \nadequate training. With all the money we are spending in these \ncontingency operations where we do not have strategic interests, it is \ndraining us from our ability to properly train should we have to meet a \ncontingency where our national strategic interests are at stake.\n  Our time that we are training these guys in red flag exercises in \nNellis is cut way down; the National Training Center out in the desert, \ncutting down Twenty-nine Palms for the marines; they are not getting \nadequate training because we are busy deploying our troops in places \nwhere we do not have a national strategic interest. So I just look upon \nthis as a way out. We have been looking for a way out of Bosnia since \n1995. Now there is no end in sight there. I do not want to get \nourselves in that position, so I see the only way out right now is what \nthe Senator from New Hampshire is suggesting. I do support his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment contains a funding cutoff that is far \nbroader than the one that was contained in the Specter amendment that \nthe Senate tabled yesterday. This would cut off funding effective \nOctober 1 for U.S. air or ground operations, including peacekeeping \noperations. So the Senator from New Hampshire has in no way stated \ninaccurately what this amendment does. It is his intention, and he said \nso quite clearly, that this amendment leads to the withdrawal of our \neffort, the termination, the ending of our effort in Serbia, including \nthe air campaign.\n  The Senate voted just a few months ago, 58-to-41, to support that air \ncampaign. What this amendment says is we want to terminate the air \ncampaign. This would have the Senate blow hot and blow cold on the same \nissue, whether or not we want to support an air campaign which is \npresently going on.\n  At the same time, it tells Milosevic all you have to do is hang in \nthere until October 1 and you will not even face an air campaign. You \nwill not face any kind of campaign. You will have succeeded in Kosovo.\n  Milosevic has not accomplished what he set out to accomplish because \nhe is under severe attack in Kosovo and in Serbia. He will accomplish \nwhat he set out to accomplish if this amendment passes. That will be \nthe victory. That will seal the success for Milosevic if this amendment \nis agreed to, because this amendment cuts off all funds, including \nthose for the air campaign to attempt to reduce Milosevic's military \ncapability, which is our military mission, and our broader mission will \nthen be totally impossible. The broader mission is to return over 1 \nmillion refugees who have been burned out, who have been raped, whose \nvillages have been destroyed--500 villages. Those refugees, then, will \nhave no hope of returning. Whereas now they have, indeed, a very real \nhope of returning because Milosevic is gradually being weakened and his \nforces are under tremendous stress. There is great evidence of that all \nover.\n\n  The KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army, is beginning to move back in to \ntheir villages and into their homes. Nothing will scare Milosevic much \nmore than having to face the KLA again, which will be the result of his \nfailure to negotiate a settlement which provides for the return of \nthese refugees in safety with protection.\n  We cannot allow Milosevic to succeed, which is what this amendment \nhands to him. We cannot allow Milosevic to shape the future of Europe. \nThat is what his success would do. His ethnic cleansing, if not \nreversed, will shape Europe for the next century.\n  This century began with a genocide against the Armenians. It is \nending with an ethnic cleansing of the Kosovars. And in between was a \nHolocaust. If we do not want the next century to be a repeat of this \ncentury, Milosevic cannot succeed. Europe's future is on the line and \nthat means our own security is on the line. NATO's future is on the \nline. The adoption of this amendment will tell NATO they have failed. \nThe adoption of this amendment will be the statement to Milosevic: You \nhave succeeded. We are pulling out.\n  That is what the intention of this amendment is, according to its \nsponsor. This amendment will tell our 19 allies in NATO: Forget NATO. \nForget NATO cohesion. Forget NATO unity. We are pulling out.\n  And this amendment will send the worst possible message to the most \nimportant of all the people, the men and women who wear our uniform who \nare out there in harm's way now, who would then be told by this \namendment we are pulling out.\n  This Senate must send a very different message than that. I hope this \namendment is tabled by an overwhelming vote.\n  I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to our \ncolleague from Oklahoma and our colleague from New Hampshire. They are \namong only a few who will bluntly state why they want out. They are \nstraightforward. The Senator from Oklahoma says this is a way out of \nKosovo, just like we should find a way out of Bosnia. They say we have \nno interest in Yugoslavia. We have no ability to do anything about it. \nAnd we have no right.\n  I find this absolutely fascinating. We talk about a sovereign nation \nbeing invaded by a horde of 19 democracies who are doing such an \ninjustice to them.\n  Then I hear that one of the reasons we should not be involved is \nbecause Yugoslavia is a sovereign country. I cannot remember what their \nexplanation was as to why we should not be involved in Bosnia, where \nSlobodan Milosevic was crossing the Drina River with these very forces \nthat are cutting off the noses, ears and then cutting the throats of \ncaptured men in Kosovo, who are taking their women to the third floor \nof army barracks for the pleasure of the troops and picking what they \nbelieve to be the most attractive of the women who happen to be \nMoslems. These are the same fellows that crossed the Drina River and \ninvaded another country. I heard the same arguments from you all about \nhow we should not be involved there. So do not let anybody fool you, \nthis is not about sovereignty.\n\n  The second point I would make is that we have reached the conclusion, \nstraightforwardly, that Slobodan Milosevic's business is his business. \nWhat do we have to do with that? Let them work it out.\n  I never thought I would live to see the day when a European leader \nwas herding masses of women and children onto boxcars and trains in the \nsight of all the world, shipping them off to another border, \ndestroying, as they crossed the border, their licenses, taking their \nbirth certificates, going into\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\nthe town halls and destroying the property records of those very \npeople. And it is so convenient to say that is not our business.\n  Then I hear another argument. You know, we have commitments around \nthe world. We will not be able to fight a two-front war. But what is \nthe threat to America beyond the nuclear one? And that will not be \ndeterred by American ground forces. I hear my friend from New Hampshire \nsay: Let the Europeans take care of this. Have we not shed enough blood \nin Europe?\n  But we have to worry about Korea? Why not say let the Asians take \ncare of Korea? There are more of them than us. We have shed enough \nblood in Asia.\n  Are we protecting the use of American force in Europe so we can use \nit in Korea?\n  If that is the logic, explain to me why the Japanese and the South \nKoreans cannot take care of themselves. I find this incredibly \nselective logic.\n  And, by the way, this so-called failure in Bosnia--what a fascinating \nnotion. Nobody is being killed there now; the raping, the rape camps, \nthe ethnic cleansing have stopped; people are actually living next door \nto one another again. There are 6,800 American forces there, and that \nis supposedly too high a price to pay without, thank God--as my mother \nwould say, knock on wood--one American being killed? I am sure glad you \nguys were not around in 1955 and 1956 and 1957 to say: By the way, all \nthose forces we have in Germany, they are sitting there occupying a \ncountry and protecting a country, but their mission must be a failure \nbecause if they left, there would be war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not been a cheerleader for our \nparticipation in this conflict. I supported it, but I am nervous about \nit. But I must say, this is wrong. At 7 o'clock this evening, with no \nnotice, we have an amendment that suggests we shall terminate our \nparticipation in the NATO campaign to stop the ethnic cleansing and the \nmassacre in Kosovo. At 7 o'clock tonight, with no notice, we are going \nto have this debate probably for an hour?\n  I just heard one of the sponsors of this amendment talk about what \nMr. Milosevic has achieved. He is right about that, Mr. Milosevic has \nachieved the following: massacre, we don't know how many; troops \nburning villages; raping people; killing innocent men, women and \nchildren; hauling people like cattle in train cars or herding them in \ngroups to the border; displacing 1 million to 1.5 million people from \ntheir homeland.\n  Yes, he has achieved that. What hasn't he achieved? What he has not \nachieved he is about to achieve if the Senate adopts this amendment. He \nwants to achieve an end to the airstrikes that cause him great \ninconvenience and a great threat to his movement in this massacre and \nin this ethnic cleansing. Does the Senate want to allow him to achieve \nthat goal? I do not think so.\n  Five or 10 years from now we will look in our rear-view mirror and \nsee that on our watch ethnic cleansing and massacre occurred and we \nsaid: Gee, that didn't matter; it wasn't our business.\n  We have already decided that is not the position we will take. It is \nour business. It does matter. Do you want to know what ethnic cleansing \nis? Do you want to know what are the horrors of this kind of action \nvisited upon those men, women, and children? Go to the museum not many \nblocks from here and see the train cars where they hauled people in \nEurope before, see the shoes of the people who died in the gas ovens, \nand then ask yourself: Does this kind of behavior matter? It does \nmatter, and this country, with our allies, is trying to do something \nabout it.\n  Imperfect? Is this operation in Kosovo with us and our NATO allies \nimperfect? Yes, it is imperfect, but are we trying? Is this country, \nwith our allies, saying this does matter? Yes. That is exactly what we \nare doing.\n  Do we really want to say to Mr. Milosevic tonight: You can achieve \nthe rest of your goals through the help of the Senate. You can do all \nthis--rape, burn, massacre, move people out of their homeland, clean \nout a country, engage in ethnic cleansing--and when this country and \nothers stand up to say we will not allow that on our time and our \nwatch, you can achieve your objective and remove that nuisance called \nairstrikes and bombing campaigns and the Senate will help you do that? \nI do not think so. I certainly hope not, not this Senate.\n  My hope is that history will record this effort as a noble effort \nthat said when this kind of behavior exists, we will do what we can \nwith our allies to stop it. I do not know how this ends, but I know it \nshould not end tonight on a Wednesday night vote by the Senate to say \nto Mr. Milosevic: This country will no longer continue to be a problem \nfor you.\n  The rape, the burning, the massacres, the ethnic cleansing will not \nstop, but the airstrikes should? I do not think that is a decision this \nSenate will make. It is not a decision the Senate should make, and I \nhope in a short time, with an amendment that should not be offered in \nthis kind of circumstance, the Senate will say: No, this effort by this \ncountry at this point in time is important. This is not about us alone. \nIt is about this country with NATO, with our allies attempting to stop \nthis man, Slobodan Milosevic, from the kind of behavior we would not \naccept from anyone in the world. I hope when this vote is cast, we will \nnot achieve the objective Mr. Milosevic wants most, and that is a \ncessation of the bombing and the airstrikes. That is the price this man \nis paying for his behavior, and he must pay that price until he stops.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nSenator Bingaman, that Dr. Michael Cieslak, a fellow, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the pendency of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 5 minutes 39 seconds; the \nopponents have 7 minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my framework is a little different. Murder is never \nlegitimate, and we have tried to do the right thing to stop the \nslaughter of people, albeit we have not been anywhere close to 100 \npercent successful. I have deep concerns about the conduct of this war \nand where it is heading.\n  On May 3, I called for a temporary pause in the bombing for a focus \non diplomacy. I wished we had done that. I wished we had not seen the \nbombing of the Chinese Embassy. I think we had momentum for a \ndiplomatic solution consistent with our objectives: That the Kosovars \ngo back home, that there be a force there to give them protection, that \nthey be able to rebuild their lives.\n  I say to colleagues tonight that I do have serious reservations about \npart of the direction in which we are heading. The airstrikes have gone \nbeyond degrading the military, which was to be our objective, and I \nreally worry that we begin to undercut our own moral claim when we \nbegin to affect innocent people with our airstrikes, when we begin to \nkill innocent people, albeit that is not the intention.\n  I focus on diplomacy. I still believe we need to have a pause in the \nbombing. We have to have a diplomatic solution. That is the only option \nthat I see available to bring this conflict to an end and to enable the \nKosovars to go back home, which is our objective.\n  Once again, I worry about these airstrikes when we go after power \ngrids and it affects hospitals and it affects innocent civilians. That \ngoes beyond just degrading the military. I sharply call that into \nquestion.\n  I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, I believe this amendment is \nprofoundly mistaken. It takes Milosevic completely off the hook.\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\n This amendment takes us in the opposite direction of where we need to \ngo toward a diplomatic solution to end this conflict.\n  This is the wrong amendment. This is the wrong statement. This is at \nthe wrong time. Therefore, I rise to speak against it. But I will \ncontinue to speak out and raise questions. I will continue to talk \nabout the need to move away from the bombing and to focus more \nseriously, and in a more concentrated and focused way, on a diplomatic \nsolution and an end to this conflict on honorable terms.\n  I hope my colleagues tonight, however, will vote against this \namendment. I hope it will be a strong vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate on \nthis amendment, and I appreciate the wrenching emotion that has \nmotivated those on both sides of this issue.\n  The NATO operation in Kosovo is a difficult issue for many of us to \ncome to terms with. Our hearts ache for the suffering of the Kosovar \nAlbanians who have been banished from their homeland by the forces of \nYugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. At the same time, we fear for \nthe safety of U.S. and NATO military forces who are engaged in a \nperilous mission in a corner of the world that has been torn by ethnic \nconflict for centuries.\n  We cannot foresee the outcome of this operation. We have a duty to \nwatch it carefully, to debate it fully on the floor of this Senate. But \nin our concern to do what is right, we should not act in so much haste \nthat we run the risk of making a fatal mistake.\n  There may come a day when I will stand on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate with the Senator from New Hampshire and call for a cutoff to the \nfunding of U.S. operations in Kosovo. But that day is not today. That \ntime is not now. A decision of that magnitude must not be taken on the \nrun, after a hastily called 60-minute debate among a handful of \nSenators.\n  Mr. President, this amendment sends the wrong message at the wrong \ntime. By all means, let us debate the U.S. involvement in Kosovo. But \nlet us do it with deliberation and forethought. I urge the Senate to \ntable this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. As I said when we began the debate, I respect the views \nof my long-time friend. He comes from a distinguished military family. \nHe served, himself, in the uniform of the United States. We have a very \ndiverse group in the Senate with regard to their views on this \nconflict.\n  There is not a one of us who was not deeply concerned before we \nbecame involved in this conflict. We are in it now. I salute here \ntonight the professionalism that has been shown by the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States, in particular, and joined by \ntheir counterparts from some eight other nations in the air, and the \nother NATO nations in one way or another that have participated in this \nconflict.\n  We are in it because our generation cannot tolerate what we have seen \nMilosevic do to human beings. To do so would be to reject, indeed, what \nother men and women have done in previous generations to bring about \nfreedom for others: World War II, followed by Korea, followed by \nVietnam. We are there to protect freedom. We are there to protect the \nrights of human beings to have some basic quality of life and ability \nto exist.\n  I remember the peak of this event. When we got started, it was just \nbefore Easter. I went back to my constituents and, indeed, they asked \nme: Why should we be there? I said: Could you be at home on Easter \nSunday, sharing with millions and millions of Americans the experience \nof your respected place of religion, sharing with your family a \nbountiful meal, and watch the pictures of the deprivation, the murder, \nthe rape, the mayhem inflicted by Milosevic and his lieutenants on \nfellow human beings?\n  Yes, they are Kosovars; yes, they are far away; yes, they speak a \ndifferent language. I was there in September. I traveled in Kosovo, in \nPristina, in Macedonia. At that time, I saw these people being driven \nfrom their homes. Not distant from where we were driving--we were \npermitted by the Yugoslav Army to take certain roads--we could see the \nburning houses; we could hear the shells. The war was in full progress \nin other areas several miles distant from the route that we took.\n  We could not stand by, as a free people, and see in Europe a \nrepetition of the horrors that visited Europe in World War II. So we \nare there. My vote tonight in opposition to my good friend is because I \nam pledged and committed to the men and women of the United States \nArmed Forces and the other nations. I am pledged and committed to the \nsurvival of NATO, not just as a political entity but for what NATO \nstands for, the principles for which it stands. I encourage my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  We will somehow, as a collection of free nations, bring this tragic \nconflict to a halt. When and exactly how, none of us knows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opponents has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand my time has concluded. I say \nto my friend, I respect you, but I vote against you. I shall move to \ntable at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The respect is mutual, as my friend \nknows.\n  Mr. President, there have been a few misstatements about my amendment \nthat I would like to clarify, as Senators now begin to make their way \nto the floor. I will only be a few minutes in closing.\n  All this amendment requires is that the President make the case and \nget congressional approval to go forward with this war after October 1. \nNo funds are cut off until October 1, and unless Congress chooses not \nto authorize the President to continue. That is what this amendment \nrequires.\n  I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the issue say a few \nmoments ago that this is coming at the last minute and that we do not \nhave time to deliberate. I will tell you how much time you have to \ndeliberate. You have the rest of this month, you have June, July, \nAugust, and September. You have 4 months to think about whether or not \nyou want this war to continue and whether or not you want to authorize \nmore funding. It does not send any message to Milosevic other than the \nfact that Congress intends to exercise its constitutional authority. \nThat is all.\n  I could probably give emotional speeches about a number of human \ntragedies around the world. My colleague from Delaware got very \nemotional; and that is a good quality when you believe in something. \nBut this decision should not be based on emotions. This is a decision \nabout how we should use our finite power. We should make the decision \non how we use our power on the basis of American interests. No American \nlife should be risked based on any Senator's emotions, for goodness' \nsake.\n  In 1995, 500,000 Rwandans were slaughtered in six weeks--most of them \nhacked to death by machetes--in tribal warfare in the nation of Rwanda. \nMaybe I am mistaken--and if I am, I will apologize to any Senator who \nsays he came down here and said that we should enter the war in Rwanda, \nenter that civil war, fire cruise missiles, bomb the blazes out of all \nthe cities, bring those tribes back to their knees to stop the \nhacking--but I did not hear it. That was a humanitarian crisis of the \nhighest magnitude, and we did not enter it. And we should not have \nentered it.\n  Those 500,000 people are just as precious under the eyes of God as \nanybody else in the world, and we said nothing. We did not fire cruise \nmissiles, we did not drop smart bombs, and we did not talk about ground \nforces, we did not talk about NATO forces, or any other forces of the \nworld going in and setting up a partition to keep two warring tribes \napart. Why? Because, as in Kosovo, the conflict posed no threat to the \nUnited States. No American lives were worth risking.\n  This is not about tying the President's hands as he tries to defend \nAmerica. It is about guiding and restraining an incompetent \nadministration as it muddles around in a place\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nwhere U.S. interests are, at best, peripheral.\n  There are terrible humanitarian situations that Mr. Milosevic has \ncreated. I will be the first to admit it. The question is, as I said at \nthe outset of this debate, How do we resolve it? Do we resolve it with \nmore bombs? By bombing and causing collateral damage to innocent \npeople? Or do we do it through diplomacy?\n  I am not trying to send a message one way or the other to Milosevic \nwith this amendment. I am trying to send a message to the American \npeople and to the Senate to say, if we are going to put Americans at \nwar in a sovereign nation in a civil war, the least the Senate can do \nis have the intestinal fortitude to say yes or no, rather than to let \nthis thing string on like Vietnam did and then, after 58,000 people are \ndead, we say, oh, my goodness, if we had just stopped this war a little \nbit earlier--or perhaps, as Senator Goldwater said, we had fought it to \nwin a little bit sooner. Meanwhile, there are 58,000-plus people on the \nVietnam Wall.\n  Now is the time to speak, not 5 years from now. All I am asking in \nthis amendment is that we have from now until October 1 to decide \nwhether or not we want to fund this war any further. That is the \nmessage I am sending. I am sending that to my colleagues who represent \nthe people of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes to address the Senate with regard to tomorrow's schedule prior \nto the vote so Senators coming to vote can depart and know what will \ntake place tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The order was to be handed to me. We were not able to \nresolve the Allard amendment, so that will be the recurring order of \nbusiness tomorrow morning. Of course, the Lott amendment is still in \nplace; am I not correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. So we will endeavor tomorrow morning, without specifying \nexactly how and when we will do it, to bring up the Allard amendment. \nSenator Harkin has 20 minutes, and we will divide, say, another 20 \nminutes between the distinguished ranking member and myself, should we \nneed it. That would be a total of 40 minutes on the debate. I think \nmaybe I will say 15 minutes between the two of us and 15 minutes to \nSenator Allard, 20 minutes for Senator Harkin. I think that should do \nit.\n  We will just have to establish the time that we will vote on the \nAllard amendment tomorrow morning.\n  This will be the last vote for tonight, and Senators can expect early \non in the morning that we will address the Allard amendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 406. The yeas and nays are ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Moynihan) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 77, nays 21, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 151 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--77\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--21\n\n     Allard\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cleland\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bond\n     Moynihan\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:30 a.m. \non Thursday, the Senate resume the DOD authorization bill, and that the \nAllard amendment No. 396 be the pending business, and that there be 30 \nminutes remaining on the amendment with 20 minutes under the control of \nSenator Harkin and 10 minutes equally divided between Senator Allard \nand myself, with a vote occurring at 10 a.m. on or in relation to the \namendment, with no amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in light of that agreement, there will be \nno further votes this evening. The next vote will be at 10 a.m. on \nThursday relative to the Allard amendment.\n  Mr. President, at this time there will be no further action on the \nDOD bill.\n\n\n                       FEDERAL PRISON INDUSTRIES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am in strong support of the amendment \nto strike Section 806 of S. 1059, the Defense Authorization Act.\n  Many of us, including Senator Gramm, Senator Hatch, and Senator Byrd, \ndiscussed the importance of Federal Prison Industries on the floor \nyesterday when this amendment was first considered. I would like to \nspeak for a moment on a few issues that have been raised in this \ndebate.\n  Some have argued that the taxpayers would save money if Federal \nagencies were not required to use FPI because FPI prices are not \ncompetitive. However, studies from the General Accounting Office and \nthe Department of Defense Inspector General show that FPI prices are \ngenerally within the market range. Indeed, the DoD IG report found that \nFPI prices were generally lower than the private sector for the \nproducts reviewed.\n  Moreover, it is important to note that Prison Industries is a self-\nsufficient corporation. As we discussed at my Judiciary hearing on this \nissue, if Prison Industries did not exist, it would cost taxpayers \nmillions of dollars per year to fund inmate programs that would provide \nsimilar security to prison facilities and similar benefits to \nprisoners. FPI is the most successful inmate program. We should support \nit strongly and not pass legislation that could undermine it.\n  The April 1999 study between DoD and BoP discusses the relations \nbetween the two agencies in great detail. The study concludes that no \nlegislative changes are warranted in Defense purchases from FPI. It \nmade some recommendations for improvements that are currently being \nimplemented. We should give the study time to work.\n  This joint study shows that Defense customers are generally satisfied \nwith FPI. Although some concerns remain such as timeliness of delivery, \nthese issues are being addressed. It is best to allow the joint study \nto speak for itself. The Executive Summary states: ``In response to \nquestions regarding the price, quality, delivery, and service of \nspecific products purchased in the last 12 months, FPI generally rated \nin the good to excellent or average ranges in all categories. On the \nwhole, respondents seem to be very satisfied with quality and service, \nmostly satisfied with price, and least satisfied with delivery. * * * \nMost respondents rated FPI either good or average, as an overall \nsupplier, in efficiency, timeliness, and best value. FPI was rated \nhighest as an overall supplier in the area of quality.'' The survey \ngenerally shows a\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\npositive, productive relationship. It is clear that drastic changes are \nnot warranted in the relations between DoD and BoP.\n  Indeed, the Administration strongly opposes Section 806. The \nStatement of Administration Policy on S. 1059 explains that this \nprovision ``would essentially eliminate the Federal Prison Industries \nmandatory source with the Defense Department. Such action could harm \nthe FPI program which is fundamental to the security in Federal \nprisons.''\n  FPI is a correctional program that is essential to the safe and \nefficient operation of our increasingly overcrowded Federal prisons. \nWhile we are putting more and more criminals in prison, we must \nmaintain the program that keeps them occupied and working.\n\n\n                         defense production act\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I commend the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, \nfor including in this legislation a one-year extension of the Defense \nProduction Act. As the Senator knows, the Defense Production Act falls \nunder the jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  The Defense Production Act is due to expire on September 30, 1999. \nThe Banking Committee has a great interest in the Defense Production \nAct and we intend to conduct a thorough review when we consider its \nreauthorization. However, due to the press of other business, \nspecifically the time-consuming task of passing the first modernization \nof our financial services laws in sixty years, the Banking Committee is \nunable to conduct such a thorough review at this time.\n  Therefore, I requested that Senator Warner include a provision in the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill to extend the Defense \nProduction Act until September 30, 2000. This extension will allow the \nBanking Committee the time to give the reauthorization of the Defense \nProduction Act the attention it deserves. Senator Warner was kind \nenough to include this provision at my request.\n  Mr. WARNER. We understand that the Banking Committee intends to take \na close look at the Defense Production Act, but may not be able to do \nso prior to the September 30, 1999 deadline. The Armed Services \nCommittee is happy to accommodate the Banking Committee, as we did last \nyear, and include a one-year extension of the Defense Production Act in \nthe DOD authorization bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for his courtesy and assistance on this issue. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter I wrote to Senator Warner on this issue \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Committee on Banking,\n\n\n                                   Housing, and Urban Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1999.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am writing to request that the Armed \n     Services Committee include a one-year authorization of the \n     Defense Production Act in S. 1059, the Department of Defense \n     authorization bill. As you know, pursuant to the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate, the Committee on Banking, Housing and \n     Urban Affairs has jurisdiction over the Defense Production \n     Act. This Act is due to expire on September 30, 1999.\n       While it is the Banking Committee's intention to give more \n     thorough attention to the Defense Production Act in the \n     future, other issues such as financial services modernization \n     have taken priority this year. As a result, it would be of \n     great assistance if you would include in the upcoming defense \n     authorization bill a provision to renew the Defense \n     Production Act through September 30, 2000.\n       Thank you for your assistance in extending the Defense \n     Production Act for another year.\n           Yours respectfully,\n                                                       Phil Gramm,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n\n                           164th airlift wing\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Warner, for coming to the Senate floor today to \ndiscuss the follow-on aircraft designation for the 164th Airlift Wing \nof the Tennessee National Guard.\n  Mr. WARNER. As the Senator from Tennessee is aware the C-141 aircraft \nhas served this nation well but its useful life is coming to an end. In \nthe report to accompany the Defense Authorization Act, the Committee \nurges the Secretary of the Air Force to designate a follow-on aircraft \nfor those Air Force Reserve units affected by the retirement of the C-\n141, and notify the relevant congressional committees as soon as the \nnew mission assignments are available.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding the 164th Air Wing is \nthe only Air Guard C-141 unit in the country not to have a follow-on \nmission designated.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Committee's urging of the Secretary of the Air Force \nto designate a new mission for the C-141s of the Air Force Reserve was \nin no way meant to neglect the similar urgency in the Tennessee Air \nGuard. Moreover, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the \nimportance of strategic airlift to our ability to project force \nglobally. the Guard and Reserve are a critical part of the total force \nequation. Let me assure the Senator from Tennessee that I strongly \nsupport his efforts to have a follow-on mission designated for the \n164th Air Wing in Memphis.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chairman for his strong words of support. At a \ntime when our nation considers the possibility of sending ground troops \nto Kosovo it is clear to me that we must support strategic airlift. \nAirlift remains one the largest challenges our forces face. It is my \ndesire to see the Air Force act to resolve this issue with expediency \nand consider designating the C-5 or the C-17 airframe for the future of \nthe Tennessee Air Guard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, let me assure the Senator from Tennessee that I am \nconfident working with the Armed Services Committee and the Air Force \nthat this issue will be resolved soon.\n\n\n                  MEDAL OF HONOR TO ALFRED RASCON 1999\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the amendment which recommends the Congressional Medal of Honor be \nawarded to Mr. Alfred P. Rascon. I would like to take just a moment and \nintroduce you to Mr. Rascon.\n  Alfred Rascon was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and emigrated to the \nUnited States with his parents in the 1950's. He served two tours in \nVietnam, one as a medic. When Rascon volunteered for the service, he \nwas not yet a citizen but was a lawful permanent resident, and he was \nonly 17 years of age but convinced his mother to sign his papers so he \ncould enlist.\n  On March 16, 1966, then Specialist Alfred Rascon, while serving in \nVietnam, performed a series of heroic acts that words simply cannot \ndescribe. For Rascon and the seven soldiers he aided while under direct \ngunfire, that day will long be remembered. Rascon's platoon found \nitself in a desperate situation under heavy fire by a powerful North \nVietnamese force. When an American machine gunner went down and a medic \nwas called for, Rascon, 20 at the time, ignored his orders to remain \nunder cover and rushed down the trail amid an onslaught of enemy \ngunfire and grenades. To better protect the wounded soldier, Rascon \nplaced his body between the enemy machine gun fire and this soldier. \nRascon jolted as he was shot in the hip. Although wounded, he managed \nto drag this soldier off the trail. Rascon soon discovered the man he \nwas dragging was dead.\n  Specialist 4th Class Larry Gibson crawled forward looking for \nammunition. The other machine gunner lay dead, and Gibson had no \nammunition with which to defend the platoon. Rascon grabbed the dead \nsoldier's ammunition and gave it to Gibson. Then, amid relentless enemy \nfire and grenades, Rascon hobbled back up the trail and snared the dead \nsoldier's machine gun and, most important, 400 rounds of additional \nammunition. Eyewitnesses state that this act alone saved the entire \nplatoon from annihilation.\n  The pace quickened and grenades continued to fall. One ripped open \nRascon's face, but this did not stop him. He saw another grenade drop \nfive feet from a wounded Neil Haffy. He tackled Haffy and absorbed the \ngrenade blast himself, saving Haffy's life.\n  Though severely wounded, Rascon crawled back among the other wounded \nand provided aid. A few minutes later,\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nRascon witnessed Sergeant Ray Compton being hit by gunfire. As Rascon \nmoved toward him, another grenade dropped. Instead of seeking \ncover, Rascon dove on top of the wounded sergeant and again absorbed \nthe blow. This time the explosion smashed through Rascon's helmet and \nripped into his scalp. Compton's life was spared.\n\n  When the firefight ended, Rascon refused aid for himself until the \nother wounded were evacuated. So bloodied by the conflict was Rascon \nthat when soldiers placed him on the evacuation helicopter, a chaplain \nsaw his condition and gave him last rites. But Alfred Rascon survived. \nHe was so severely wounded that it was necessary to medically discharge \nhim from the Army.\n  The soldiers who witnessed Rascon's deeds that day recommended him in \nwriting for the Medal of Honor. Years later, these soldiers were \nshocked to discover that he had not received it. It appears their \nrecommendations did not go up the chain of command beyond the platoon \nleader who did not personally witness the events. Rascon was instead \nawarded the Silver Star. Rascon's Silver Star citation details only a \nportion of his heroic actions on March 16, 1966.\n  Perhaps the best description of Alfred Rascon's actions came 30 years \nlater from fellow platoon member Larry Gibson:\n\n       I was a 19-year-old gunner with a recon section. We were \n     under intense and accurate enemy fire that had pinned down \n     the point squad, making it almost impossible to move without \n     being killed. Unhesitatingly, Doc [as Rascon was called] went \n     forward to aid the wounded and dying. I was one of the \n     wounded. Doc took the brunt of several enemy grenades, \n     shielding the wounded with his body.\n       In these few words, I cannot fully describe the events of \n     that day. The acts of unselfish heroism Doc performed while \n     saving the many wounded, though severely wounded himself, \n     speak for themselves. This country needs genuine heroes. Doc \n     Rascon is one of those.\n\n  Rascon was once asked why he acted with such courage on the battle \nfield even though he was an immigrant and not yet a citizen. Rascon \nreplied, ``I was always an American in my heart.''\n  Mr. President, these actions speak for themselves. I first met Mr. \nRascon in 1995. He came to see me as the Inspector General of the \nSelective Service System, where he continues to serve his nation today. \nIn the course of our conversation I learned of his amazing story, and \nas the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee at that time, I \nrealized I had to act.\n  I contacted a number of officials at the Department of Defense and \nlearned that his case could not even be examined because the law said \ntime to consider those awards had expired. So, in the 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Bill, we changed the law. Four years have passed since \nthen; however, the Secretary of the Army and the Chairman of Joint \nChiefs of Staff now agree and have recommended that Alfred Rascon be \nawarded the Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest award for valor. You \nhave heard this story. The legislation authorizes the President to \naward the Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon. If ever there was a case to \nrecognize heroism and bravery far above and beyond the call of duty, \nthis is it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6042-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, yesterday afternoon the Committee on \nAppropriations met and reported, en bloc, the Fiscal Year 2000 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriation Bill, the Fiscal Year 2000 302(b) \nallocations for the committee, and H.R. 1664, by a recorded vote of 24-\n3. At that full committee markup, the committee also adopted an \nexplanatory statement of the committee's recommendations in relation to \nH.R. 1664. That explanatory statement, which was adopted in lieu of a \ncommittee report, was filed with the Senate by Mr. Stevens (for himself \nand Mr. Byrd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Specter, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nDeWine, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nDorgan, and Mr. Hatch). Subsequent to that markup, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the following Senators be added as cosponsors: Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Breaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I further ask unanimous consent that the explanatory \nstatement of the committee be printed at the appropriate place in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nEXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON \n     APPROPRIATIONS ON H.R. 1664, A BILL MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR \n                          OPERATIONS IN KOSOVO\n\n       Mr. Stevens (for himself and Mr. Byrd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Hollings, \n     Mr. Shelby, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bayh, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. \n     Hutchison, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n     Dorgan, and Mr. Hatch)\n       The Committee on Appropriations, to which was referred \n     ``H.R. 1664, making emergency supplemental appropriations for \n     military operations, refugee relief, and humanitarian \n     assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo, and for \n     military operations in Southwest Asia for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes'' reported \n     the same to the Senate with various amendments and an \n     amendment to the title and presents herewith information \n     relative to the changes recommended.\n       In order to expedite completion of congressional action \n     relative to the emergency appropriations contained in H.R. \n     1664, as passed by the House of Representatives, as well as \n     the emergency appropriations contained in H.R. 1141, the \n     Fiscal Year 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Act, \n     funding for both measures was included in H.R. 1141. The \n     conference agreement on that measure was passed by the House \n     of Representatives on May 18, 1999, by the Senate on May 20, \n     1999, and the bill was signed by the President on May 21, \n     1999.\n       In accordance with an agreement with the bipartisan House \n     and Senate leadership, two provisions which were contained in \n     the Senate version of H.R. 1141 were deleted, without \n     prejudice, from the conference agreement thereon. Pursuant to \n     that agreement, these two provisions, the Emergency Steel \n     Loan Guarantee Program and the Emergency Oil and Gas \n     Guaranteed Loan Program, are to be considered expeditiously \n     by the Senate in a freestanding emergency appropriation bill.\n       Since the conference agreement on H.R. 1141 included the \n     necessary funding for Kosovo operations, the committee \n     recommends that the text of H.R. 1664 as passed by the House \n     be amended to remove House language, and that language \n     relating to the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program and \n     the Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program, with \n     offsets, be added. In light of the emergency nature of the \n     funding contained in the bill for these two critical \n     programs, the committee hopes that no amendments will be \n     offered to the measure and that it can be sent directly to \n     the House. The Speaker of the House has agreed to permit a \n     motion to go to conference within one week of receiving this \n     bill after Senate passage, to allow normal appropriation \n     conferees to be appointed, and to permit the resulting \n     conference report to be brought up before the House. The \n     committee urges that this matter be expedited by the Senate \n     in order to hopefully complete action prior to the Memorial \n     Day Recess on this critical emergency facing the steel and \n     oil and gas industries and the tens of thousands of steel and \n     oil and gas workers who have recently lost their jobs as the \n     result of the massive influx of cheap and illegally-dumped \n     imported steel and oil and gas over the past year.\n\n\n                 Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program\n\n       The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, as reported by \n     the committee, provides a two-year, GATT-legal, one billion \n     dollar guaranteed loan program to back loans provided by \n     private financial institutions to qualified U.S. steel \n     producers. The minimum loan to be guaranteed for a single \n     company at any one time would be $25,000,000 (subject to a \n     waiver), and the maximum would be $250,000,000. A board is \n     established to administer this program consisting of the \n     Secretaries of Commerce (who would serve as chairman), \n     Treasury, and Labor. This board would have the authority to \n     determine the specific requirements in awarding these loan \n     guarantees, including the percentage of the guarantee, \n     appropriate collateral, as well as loan amounts and interest \n     rates thereon. Repayment of the loans guaranteed under this \n     program would be required within six years.\n       The committee makes these recommendations in response to \n     the critical situation facing the U.S. steel industry. As a \n     result of global financial chaos, in 1998, a record level of \n     more than 41 million tons of both cheap and illegally-dumped \n     imported steel flooded the U.S. market. This represents an \n     increase of 83 percent over the 23-million ton average\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\n     for the previous eight years. This wave of imported steel \n     substantially reduced demand for U.S. steel production, and \n     brought about the devastating loss of employment for more \n     than ten thousand American steelworkers.\n       The U.S. Department of Commerce has found dumping margins \n     of up to 200 percent on Russian steel, up to 67 percent on \n     Japanese steel, and up to 70 percent on steel from Brazil. \n     Appropriate actions are being pursued to assess penalties \n     against those responsible for this illegal dumping of steel. \n     However, even if penalty tariffs are collected against those \n     responsible for this illegal dumping, U.S. steel mills will \n     not receive any compensation for the losses they have \n     suffered. A number of U.S. steel plants have closed or \n     declared bankruptcy since September of 1998, and a number of \n     others are close behind.\n       Estimates are that jobs of tens of thousands of additional \n     steelworkers are in danger unless this illegal dumping is \n     stopped and those in the U.S. steel industry are able to meet \n     their financial obligations in order to get back on their \n     feet.\n\n\n             Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program\n\n       The Emergency Oil and Gas Guarantee program, as reported by \n     the committee, provides a two-year, GATT-legal, five-hundred-\n     million dollar guaranteed loan program to back loans provided \n     by private financial institutions to qualified oil and gas \n     producers and the associated oil and gas service industry, \n     including Alaska Native Corporations. The minimum loan to be \n     guaranteed for a single company at any one time would be \n     $250,000, and the maximum would be $10,000,000. A board is \n     established to administer this program consisting of the \n     Secretaries of Commerce (who would serve as chairman), \n     Treasury, and Labor. This board would have the authority to \n     determine the specific requirements in awarding these loan \n     guarantees, including the percentage of the guarantee, \n     appropriate collateral, as well as loan amounts and interest \n     rates thereon. Repayment of the loans guaranteed under this \n     program would be required within ten years.\n       The committee makes these recommendations in response to \n     the critical situation facing the domestic, independent oil \n     and gas industry. Since the beginning of the most recent oil \n     and gas crisis (January 1997), the industry has lost 42,500 \n     jobs. Bankruptcies have fueled the closure of an estimated \n     136,000 wells. Twenty percent of total U.S. marginal well \n     production has been jeopardized because of bankruptcies.\n       The economic slowdown in Asia led to depressed demand, and \n     oversupply. The United Nation's Food for Oil program, which \n     allows Iraq to sell additional oil in an already saturated \n     market, further depressed prices. Every key indicator of \n     domestic oil and gas industry's health--earnings, employment, \n     production, rig counts, rig rates and seismic activity is \n     down.\n       The committee notes that the United States was 36 percent \n     dependent when the oil embargo of the 1970s hit. U.S. foreign \n     oil consumption is estimated at 56 percent and could reach 68 \n     percent by 2010 if $10 to $12 per barrel prices prevail. It \n     has been predicted that half of marginal wells located in 34 \n     states could be shut-in. Marginal wells produce less than 15 \n     barrels of oil and day and are the most vulnerable to closure \n     when prices drop. Yet, these wells, in aggregate, produce as \n     much oil as we import from Saudi Arabia.\n       There is no current government loan program that will help \n     the oil and gas producers and the oil and gas service \n     industry. The industry tried to use our trade laws but \n     without success. In 1994, when U.S. dependence upon foreign \n     oil was 51 percent, a Department of Commerce section 232(b) \n     Trade Expansion Act investigation report found that rising \n     imports of foreign oil threaten to impair U.S. national \n     security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to oil \n     supply interruptions. President Clinton concurred with that \n     finding. Unfortunately, little action to address the problem \n     has been implemented.\n       Without an emergency loan program to get them through the \n     current credit crunch there will be more bankruptcies, more \n     lost jobs, and greater dependence on foreign oil.\n\n\n                                 Offset\n\n       The committee's recommendation includes a rescission of \n     $270 million from the administrative and travel accounts of \n     the object class entitled ``Contractual Services and \n     Supplies'' in the non-defense category of the budget. This \n     category includes such things as $7 billion for travel and \n     transportation; over $7 billion for advisory and assistance \n     services; $44 billion for a category called ``other \n     services''; and almost $30 billion for supplies and \n     materials. The rescission shall be taken on a pro-rata basis \n     from funds available to every Federal agency, department, and \n     office in the Executive Branch, in the non-defense category. \n     The Office of Management and Budget is required to submit to \n     the Committees on Appropriations of the House and Senate a \n     listing of the amounts by account of the reductions made.\n\nCOMPLIANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 7(C), RULE XXVI OF THE STANDING RULES OF THE \n                                 SENATE\n\n       Pursuant to paragraph 7(c) of rule XXVI, the Committee \n     ordered reported en bloc, an original fiscal year 2000 \n     Department of Defense Appropriations bill, the fiscal year \n     2000 section 302(b) allocation, and H.R. 1664, by recorded \n     vote of 24-3, a quorum being present.\n      Nays\nMr. Dorgantevens\nMrs. Feinstein\nMr. Durbinci\nMr. Bond\nMr. Gorton\nMr. McConnell\nMr. Burns\nMr. Shelby\nMr. Gregg\nMr. Bennett\nMr. Campbell\nMr. Craig\nMrs. Hutchison\nMr. Kyl\nMr. Byrd\nMr. Inouye\nMr. Hollings\nMr. Leahy\nMr. Lautenberg\nMr. Harkin\nMs. Mikulski\nMr. Reid\nMr. Kohl\nMrs. Murray\n\n                            BUDGETARY IMPACT\n\n       Section 308(a)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344), as \n     amended, requires that the report accompanying a bill \n     providing new budget authority contain a statement detailing \n     how that authority compares with the reports submitted under \n     section 302 of the act for the most recently agreed to \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for the fiscal year.

Mr. President, I have been circulating drafts of bills \ndesigned to provide WIC benefits to military personnel and to certain \ncivilian personnel, stationed overseas, for a few weeks. I know that \nSenator Harkin and other Senators on both sides of the aisle have also \nbeen working on this matter as have members of the other body.\n  I have received valuable input regarding my drafts from Members, \nnational organizations and even personnel stationed overseas and I \nappreciate all who have helped. This bill introduction does not mean \nthat I am no longer seeking input. On the contrary, as I have always \nhandled nutrition legislation, I want to work with all Members on this \nimportant legislation, which I hope can be unanimously passed.\n  Basically, the Strengthening Families in the Military Service Act \nmandates that the Secretary of Defense offer a program similar to the \nWIC program--the Supplemental Nutrition\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nProgram for Women, Infants and Children--to military and associated \ncivilian personnel stationed on bases overseas. If it makes sense to \nallow those stationed in the United States to participate in WIC, it \nmakes sense to allow those stationed overseas to have the important \nnutritional benefits of that program. Why should families lose their \nbenefits when they are moved overseas?\n  This bill provides that the Secretary of Defense will administer the \nprogram under rules similar to the WIC program administered by the \nSecretary of Agriculture within the United States.\n  WIC is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. In fact, just a \nfew weeks ago, I joined Senators Lugar and Torricelli, the National \nAssociation of WIC Directors' Executive Director Doug Greenaway, as \nwell as others, in celebrating this accomplishment.\n  For 25 years the WIC program has provided nutritious foods to low-\nincome pregnant, post-partum and breast-feeding women, infants, and \nchildren who are judged to be at a nutritional risk.\n  It has proven itself to be a great investment--for every dollar \ninvested in the WIC program, an estimated $3 is saved in future medical \nexpenses. WIC has helped to prevent low birth weight babies and \nassociated risks such as developmental disabilities, birth defects, and \nother complications. Participation in the WIC program has also been \nlinked to reductions in infant mortality.\n  This program has worked extremely well in Vermont, and throughout the \nnation.\n  However, despite the successes of this program, there continues to be \nan otherwise eligible population who cannot receive these benefits--\nwomen and children in military families stationed outside of the United \nStates.\n  These are families who are serving our country, living miles from \ntheir homes on a military base in a foreign land, and whose nutritional \nhealth is at risk. If they were stationed within our borders, their \ndiets would be supplemented by the WIC program, and they would receive \nvouchers or packages of healthy foods, such as fortified cereals and \njuices, high protein products, and other foods especially rich in \nneeded minerals and vitamins. If they receive orders stationing them at \na U.S. base located in another country, they lose this needed support.\n  I know that I am not alone in my desire to establish WIC benefits for \nour women and children of military families stationed overseas. I look \nforward to working with all members of Congress in making a program \nthat benefits nutritionally at risk women, infants and children serving \nAmerica from abroad. I know there are other approaches being considered \nand I want to work out a good solution.\n  I have been informed of situations where this nutrition assistance is \ndesperately needed by military and civilian personnel overseas. I do \nnot see how we can turn our backs on these Americans stationed abroad. \nI am willing to work with other ways of providing this assistance but I \nbelieve that my bill has advantages over other suggestions. First, this \nbill guarantees this assistance for the next three years and mandates a \nstudy to determine if improvements or other changes are needed.\n  This bill also disregards the value of in kind housing assistance in \ncalculating eligibility which increases the number of women, infants \nand children that can participate and makes the program more similar to \nthe program in the United States. The CBO has estimated that the \naverage monthly food cost would be about $28 for each participant based \non a Department of Defense estimate of the cost of an average WIC food \npackage in military commissaries. Administration costs which include \nhealth and nutrition assessments are likely to be about $7 per month \nper participant, according to CBO.\n  I am advised that counting the value of in kind housing assistance as \nthough it were cash assistance would reduce the cost of this program to \n$2 million per year and that 5,100 women and children would participate \nin an average month under such an approach. This will be an issue which \nI look forward to discussing with my colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  S.--\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator Collins in \nintroducing S. 1123, the Imported Food Safety Act of 1999. This \nlegislation will address a growing problem that affects everyone in \nthis nation, the safety of the food that we eat.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates as many as \n9,100 deaths are attributed to foodborne illness each year in the \nUnited States. In addition there are tens of millions of cases of \nfoodborne illness that occur, the majority of which go unreported due \nto the fact that they are not severe enough to warrant medical \nattention.\n  The legislation that Senator Collins and I have crafted will target \none of the most critical areas in helping to provide Americans with the \nsafest food possible--the safety of imported food. The CDC has \nrecognized that as trade and economic development increases, the \nglobalization of food supplies is likely to have an increasing impact \non foodborne illnesses.\n  Currently, one-half of all the seafood and one-third of all the fresh \nfruit consumed in the U.S. comes from overseas. In fact, since the \n1980's food imports to the U.S. have doubled, but federal inspections \nby Food and Drug Administration have dropped by 50 percent.\n  Over the years there have been foodborne pathogen outbreaks involving \nraspberries from Guatemala, strawberries from Mexico, scallions, \nparsley and cantaloupes from Mexico, carrots from Peru, coconut milk \nfrom Thailand, canned mushrooms from China and others. These outbreaks \nhave serious consequences. The Mexican frozen strawberries I have just \nnoted were distributed in the school lunch programs in several states, \nincluding my home state of Tennessee, were attributed to causing an \noutbreak of Hepatitis A in March of 1997.\n  The Collins-Frist bill will do several vital things to safeguard \nagainst potentially dangerous imported food. The bill would allow the \nU.S. Customs Service, using a system established by FDA, to deny entry \nof imported food that has been associated with repeated and separate \nevents of foodborne disease.\n  The bill would also allow the FDA to require food being imported by \nentities with a history of import violations to be held in a secure \nstorage facility pending FDA approval and Customs release.\n  To improve the surveillance of imported food, we authorize CDC to \nenter into cooperative agreements and provide technical assistance to \nthe States to conduct additional surveillance and studies to address \ncritical questions for the prevention and control of foodborne diseases \nassociated with imported food, and authorize CDC to conduct applied \nresearch to develop new or improved diagnostic tests for emerging \nfoodborne pathogens in human specimens, food, and relevant \nenvironmental samples.\n  These are just a few of the many provisions in this bill that will \nhelp improve the quality and safety of the imported food that we \nconsume every day. I applaud the leadership of my colleague, Senator \nCollins, who as Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations held 4 comprehensive hearings last year on the issue of \nfood safety. As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health, I \nlook forward to working with Senator Collins and the rest of my \ncolleagues on the issue of food safety and our overall efforts in \nimproving our Nation's public health infrastructure. We must continue \nto fight infectious diseases and ensure that this legislation is \nenacted to help protect our citizens and provide them with the \nhealthiest food possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6045-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6045-S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AGRICULTURAL TRADE FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to voice my \nsupport for S. 566, the Agricultural Trade Freedom Act, which was \npassed out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry this morning on a 17-1 vote. I appreciate Senator Lugar's \nstrong leadership on these trade and international issues.\n  More than any other industry in America, agriculture is extremely \ndependent on international trade. In fact, almost one-third of our \ndomestic agricultural production is sold outside of the United States. \nClearly, a strong international market for agricultural commodities is \ntherefore of utmost importance to our agriculture economy.\n  As those of us who herald from agricultural states know, the business \nof agriculture in America reaches far beyond farmers alone. There are \nmany rural businesses, such as feed stores, machinery repair shops and \nveterinarians, who depend on a strong agricultural economy. And when we \ndiscuss international trade, there are many national businesses, such \nas agricultural exporters, which are greatly impacted by our trade \npolicies.\n  Despite the importance of these international markets, agricultural \ncommodities are occasionally eliminated from potential markets because \nof U.S. imposed unilateral economic sanctions against other countries. \nThese economic sanctions are imposed for political, foreign policy \nreasons. Yet there is little to show that the inclusions of \nagricultural commodities in these sanctions actually have had the \nintended results. The question now emerging from this policy is who is \nactually hurt by the ban on exporting commercial agricultural \ncommodities, and should it continue?\n  American farmers and exporters obviously face an immediate loss in \ntrade when unilateral economic sanctions are imposed. Perhaps even more \ndevastating, however, is the long-term loss of the market. Countries \nwho need agricultural products do not wait for American sanctions to be \nlifted; they find alternative markets. This often leads to the \npermanent loss of a market for our agriculture industry, as new trading \npartnerships are established and maintained.\n  Our farmers, and the rural businesses and agriculture exporters \nassociated with them, are consequently greatly hurt by this policy. The \nAgricultural Trade Freedom Act corrects this problem by exempting \ncommercial agricultural products from U.S. unilateral economic \nsanctions. The exemption of commercial agricultural products is not \nabsolute; the President can make the determination that these items are \nindeed a necessary part of the sanction for achieving the intended \nforeign policy goal. In this situation, the President would be required \nto report to Congress regarding the purposes of the sanctions and their \nlikely economic impacts.\n  Recently, the administration lifted restrictions on the sale of food \nto Sudan, Iran and Libya--all countries whose governments we have \nserious disagreements with. It did so, and I am among those who \nsupported that decision, because food, like medicines, should not be \nused as a tool of foreign policy. It is also self-defeating. While our \nfarmers lost sales, foreign farmers made profits.\n  Unfortunately, the administration did not see fit to apply the same \nreasoning to Cuba. American farmers cannot sell food to Cuba, even \nthough it is only 90 miles from our shores and there is a significant \npotential market there. This contradiction is beneath a great and \npowerful country, and Senator Lugar's legislation would permit such \nsales. The administration should pay more attention to what is in our \nnational interests, rather than to a tiny, vocal minority who are \nwedded to a policy that has hurt American farmers and the Cuban people.\n  The Agricultural Trade Freedom Act maintains the President's need for \nflexibility in foreign policy while simultaneously recognizing the \nimpact that sanctions may have on the agricultural economy. This \nlegislation is\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nsupported by dozens of organizations including the National Association \nof State Departments of Agriculture, the U.S. Dairy Export Council, the \nNational Milk Producers Federation, and the National Farmers Union.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Lugar for his leadership on \nthis issue. I was pleased to join with him, the ranking member, Senator \nHarkin, the Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle, Senator Conrad and \nothers in this effort, and I look forward to working with them and all \nmembers of the Senate to see that this measure becomes law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6046-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I want to voice my disagreement with a \nportion of Senate Report Number 106-44, which accompanied S. 900, the \nFinancial Services Modernization Act of 1999. The Report describes an \namendment that I offered that was adopted by a unanimous vote of the \nSenate Banking Committee during its consideration of S. 900. I want to \nexplain what I intend that amendment to mean and how I intend its \nlanguage to be interpreted.\n  At issue is the standard for determining whether State laws, \nregulations, orders and other interpretations regulating the sale, \nsolicitation and cross-marketing of insurance products should be \npreempted by federal laws authorizing insurance sales by insured \ndepository institutions and their subsidiaries and affiliates. Since \nthe inception of the national banking system, the insurance sales \npowers of national banks have been heavily restricted. In addition, \nsince the inception of the insurance industry in this country, the \nStates have been the virtually exclusive regulators of that business. \nAlthough S. 900 seeks to tear down the barriers that separate the \nbanking, insurance and securities industries, at the same time it seeks \nto preserve functional regulation. This means that the extensive \nregulatory systems that have been developed to protect consumer \ninterests in each area of financial services should be retained.\n  For that reason, one of the principles of the proposed legislation is \nto ensure that the activities of everyone who engages in the business \nof insurance should be functionally regulated by the States. After all, \nthe States are the sole repository of regulatory expertise in this \narea. During my review of the Committee Print before the mark-up and \nduring my conversations with my Senate colleagues, it became evident \nthat the Committee Print's provisions regarding the preemption of State \ninsurance laws and regulations did not adhere to this principle. The \nCommittee Print disregarded the Supreme Court's holding in Barnett Bank \nof Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996), regarding the \nstandard for preempting State regulation of insurance sales activity.\n  I therefore introduced an amendment that replaced the Committee \nPrint's insurance sales preemption provisions with substitute \nprovisions based on the Supreme Court's Barnett standard. My amendment \ndeleted all of the provisions in the Committee Print regarding the \npermissible scope of state regulation of the insurance sales activities \nof insured depository institutions, their subsidiaries and affiliates. \nMy amendment substituted language that had been developed and analyzed \nduring prior considerations of these issues in previous Congresses, in \nparticular during senate consideration of H.R. 10 last year.\n  The core preemption standard included in my amendment now appears as \nSection 104(d)(2)(A) of S. 900. It states:\n\n       In accordance with the legal standards for preemption set \n     forth in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States in Barnett Bank of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 116 \n     U.S. 1103 (1996), no State may, by statute, regulation, \n     order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or \n     significantly interfere with the ability of an insured \n     depository institution, or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof, \n     to engage, directly or indirectly, either by itself or in \n     conjunction with a subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party, \n     in any insurance sales, solicitation, or cross-marketing \n     activity.\n\n  The ``prevent or significantly interfere'' language was taken \ndirectly from the Supreme Court's Barnett decision and is intended to \ncodify that decision. No further amplification of the standard was \nincluded because my colleagues and I intended to leave the development \nof the interpretation of that standard to the courts.\n  There is a great deal of disagreement among both regulators and \nmembers of the affected industries as to the manner in which the \nstandard should be amplified. Indeed, State insurance regulators and \nsignificant portions of the insurance industry did not support the \nusage of the ``significant interference'' test at all but instead \nsought a clarification, supported by the Barnett opinion, that only \nstate laws and regulations that ``prohibit or constructively prohibit'' \nan insured depository institution, or an affiliate or subsidiary of an \ninsured depository institution, from engaging in insurance sales \nactivities should be preempted.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wish to associate myself with the statements of my \ncolleague, Senator Bryan, the author of the amendment adopted by the \nBanking Committee. My understanding in voting for his amendment was \nthat it codified the Barnett Bank standard for preemption of State \nlaws. The Committee Report accompanying S. 900 seeks to amplify, or put \na gloss on, the Barnett Bank standard. I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Nevada whether the gloss put on the ``prevent or significantly \ninterfere'' standard in the Committee Report is in keeping with his \namendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. My colleague from Maryland asks a perceptive question. The \nCommittee Report attempts to clarify the core preemption standard in a \nway that is contrary to the meaning of the provision. Page 13 of the \nReport states that State laws are preempted not only if they `` \n`prevent or significantly interfere' with a national bank's exercise of \nits powers'' but also if they `` `unlawfully encroach' on the rights \nand privileges of national banks;'' if they `` `destroy or hamper' \nnational banks' functions;'' of if they `` `interfere with or impair' \nnational banks' efficiency in performing authorized functions.'' The \nclauses after the initial restatement of the standard are paraphrases \nof the holdings of the cases cited in Barnett.\n  As I noted earlier, I intentionally omitted any amplification of the \nBarnett standard. In addition, the last paraphrase (regarding \n``efficiency'') is correct and harmful. It is incorrect because it \nimplies that it applies to any authorized function. In fact, the case \ncited by the Supreme Court in Barnett said that a State cannot impair a \nnational bank's ability to discharge its duties to the government. The \nlast paraphrase is harmful because it could dramatically expand the \nscope of the preemption provision. It could do so if read to prohibit \nthe application of any State law that impairs a national bank's or its \naffiliate's or subsidiary's efficiency in selling insurance. The \nBarnett opinion does not support any\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\nsuch reading. Moreover, if this language had been suggested as an \namendment to my amendment, I would not have supported it nor would the \nmajority of my colleagues.\n\n  The Committee Report also lists several examples of State law \nprovisions that the Report states should be preempted under the \nstandard, incorporated into S. 900. As noted above, this violates my \nintent in offering an amendment based on the Barnett standard. For \nexample, page 13 of the Committee Report states that an ``example of a \nState law that would be preempted under the standard set forth in \nsubsection 104(d)(2)(A) would be a statute that limits the volume or \nportion of insurance sales made by an insurance agent on the basis of \nwhether such sales are made to customers of an insured depository \ninstitution or any affiliate of the agent.'' I strongly disagree. State \nstatutes that limit sales in this manner or that effectively require \nall insurance agents to engage in public insurance agency activities, \nand not limit their sales efforts to their captive customers, are not \npreempted under the Section 104(d)(2)(A) preemption standard.\n  In addition, page 14 of the Committee Report offers a requirement \nthat insurance activities take place more than 100 yards from a teller \nwindow as an example of a State law provision that would be preempted. \nI wish to note that less restrictive provisions that merely require the \nphysical separation of insurance activities from other activities \nwithin a bank are not preempted under the Section 104(d)(2)(A) \npreemption standard. The intent underlying the amendment was to leave \nthese determinations of what is or is not preempted to the courts, \nbased on the applicable legal standards identified in Barnett.\n  Finally, I fell compelled to note that page 15 of the Committee \nReport states that nothing in the preemption provisions can be read to \nrequire licensure of the bank itself, only of employees acting as \nagents. While this is technically true, it creates some potential \nconfusion with the core licensure requirement. This should be read as \nallowing institution licensure so long as that licensure does not \n``prevent or significantly interfere with'' the exercise of authorized \ninsurance sales powers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to point out that the language of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Nevada was previously explained \nin the Report of the Banking Committee that accompanied H.R. 10 last \nyear. For State laws that fall outside the 13-point safe harbor, the \nbill does not limit in any way the application of the Supreme Court's \nBarnett Bank decision. State laws outside the safe harbor could be \nchallenged under that decision. This year's Committee Report \nincorrectly describes the standard that State laws must meet under \nBarnett Bank in order to avoid being preempted.\n  Mr. BRYAN. In closing, I should say that I would have brought my \nconcerns regarding the Committee Report language directly to the \nCommittee Chairman, Senator Gramm, and his staff but I did not have the \nopportunity to read the Committee Report language discussing my \namendment prior to its publication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6047-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6047-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the second time and placed on \nthe calendar:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the 2-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions for \nreasonable and incidental expenses related to instruction, teaching, or \nother educational job-related activities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             teacher deduction for incidental expenses act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, Senator Coverdell and I are \nintroducing two bills that will help teachers who spend their personal \nfunds in order to improve their teaching skills and to provide quality \nlearning materials for their students. I am going to discuss the first \nof those bills, the Teachers' Professional Development Act.\n  I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from Georgia, Senator \nCoverdell, in presenting this response to the critical need of our \nelementary and secondary schoolteachers for more professional \ndevelopment.\n  Other than involved parents, a well-qualified teacher is the most \nimportant element of student success. Educational researchers have \nrepeatedly demonstrated the close relationship between well-qualified \nteachers and successful students. Moreover, teachers themselves \nunderstand how important professional development is to maintaining and \nexpanding their level of competence. When I meet with Maine teachers, \nthey tell me of their need for more professional development and the \nscarcity of financial support for this worthwhile pursuit.\n  In Maine, we have seen the results of a strong, sustained \nprofessional development program on student achievement in science and \nmath. With support from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, the State of Maine, private foundations, the \nbusiness community, and colleges in our State, the Maine Mathematics \nand Science Alliance established a statewide training program for \nteachers. The results have been outstanding.\n  While American students, overall, performed at the bottom of the \nThird International Science and Mathematics Study, Maine students \noutperformed the students of all but one of the 41 participating \nnations. The professional development available to Maine's science and \nmath teachers undoubtedly played a critical role in this tremendous \nsuccess story. Unfortunately, however, this level of support for \nprofessional development is the exception and not the rule.\n  The willingness of Maine's teachers to fund their own professional \ndevelopment activities has impressed me deeply. For example, an English \nteacher who serves as a member of my Educational Policy Advisory \nCommittee told me of spending her own money to attend a curriculum \nconference. She then came back to her high school and shared the \nresults of this curriculum conference with all the other teachers in \nher English department. She is typical of the many teachers throughout \nthe United States who generously reach within their own pockets to pay \nfor their own professional development to make them even better, even \nmore effective at their jobs.\n  I firmly believe that we should encourage our educators to seek \nprofessional training, and that is the purpose of the legislation I am \nintroducing today. The Collins-Coverdell legislation would help \nteachers to finance professional development by allowing them to deduct \nfrom their taxable income such expenses as conference fees, tuitions, \nbooks, supplies, and transportation associated with qualifying \nprograms. Under the current law, teachers may only deduct these \nexpenses if they exceed 2 percent of their income. My bill would \neliminate this 2 percent floor and allow all of the professional \ndevelopment expenses to be deductible.\n  I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the \nadditional education they need to improve their skills and to serve \ntheir students better. I hope that this legislation will encourage \nteachers to continue to take courses in the subject areas that they \nteach, to complete graduate degrees in either their subject area or in \neducation, and to attend conferences to get new ideas for presenting \ncourse work in a challenging manner. This bill would reimburse our \nteachers for a very small part of what they invest in our children's \nfuture. This would be money well spent.\n  Investing in education is the surest way for us to build one of our \nmost important assets for our country's future, and that is a well-\neducated population. We need to ensure that our nation's elementary and \nsecondary school teachers are the best possible so that they can bring \nout the best in our students. Adopting this legislation would help us \nto accomplish this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these efforts, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in assuring enactment of this legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n        Mack):\n  S. 1125. A bill to restrict the authority of the Federal \nCommunications Commission to review mergers and to impose conditions on \nlicenses and other authorizations assigned or transferred in the course \nof mergers or other transactions subject to review by the Department of \nJustice or the Federal Trade Commission; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n              telecommunications merger review act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce The \nTelecommunications Merger Review Act of 1999, which will make the \ngovernment's review of telecommunications industry mergers more \ncoherent and effective.\n  It seems like hardly a week goes by without the announcement of yet \nanother precedent-setting merger in the telecommunications industry. \nConsumers are right to be concerned about the possible effects of these \nmergers, and the Congress is right to be concerned that government \nreview of these mergers is careful and consistent in keeping consumer \ninterests uppermost.\n  The urgent need for competence and clarity in reviewing telecom \nindustry mergers highlights a glaring problem in the current system. \nThat problem, Mr. President, arises from the fact that different \nagencies sequentially go over the same issues, and, after considerable \ndelay, can make radically different decisions on the same sets of \nfacts.\n  Two of these agencies, the Department of Justice and the Federal \nTrade Commission, have extensive expertise in analyzing the \ncompetition-related issues that are involved in mergers, and they \napproach the merger review process with a great deal of professionalism \nand efficiency. The third agency, the Federal Communications \nCommission, has comparatively little expertise in these issues, and \nonly limited authority under the law.\n  Nevertheless, the FCC has bootstrapped itself into the unintended \nrole of official federal dealbreaker. How? By using its authority to \nimpose conditions on the FCC licenses that are being transferred as \npart and parcel of the overall merger deal. Because the FCC must pre-\napprove all license transfers, its ability to pass on the underlying \nlicenses gives it a chokehold on the parties to the merger. And it uses \nthat chokehold to prolong the process and extract concessions from the \nmerging parties that oftentimes\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nhave very little, if anything, to do with the merger itself.\n  Mr. President, many people might ask, what's so bad about that? Won't \nthe FCC's conditions make sure that consumer interests are served? The \nshort answer is, the FCC is simply duplicating the review and that the \nDepartment of Justice performs with much more competence and \nefficiency. About the best you can say is that the FCC is wasting \nvaluable resources that could more productively be spent elsewhere. But \nthe real harm lies in the fact that the FCC is foisting needless \nburdens and restrictions on the merging companies that translate into \nhigher costs for consumers.\n  The FCC tries to defend its efforts by arguing that its job is really \ndifferent from DOJ's--that DOJ makes sure that a merger won't harm \ncompetition, while the FCC makes sure that the same merger will help \ncompetition. In other words, according to the FCC, DOJ looks at a \nmerger's effect on business; the FCC looks at its effect on people. For \nexample, last week FCC Chairman Kennard gave a speech in which he \nproclaimed that, despite the strain these merger reviews were imposing \non the agency, ``We will not rest until on each transaction we can \narticulate to the American public what are the benefits of this merger \nto average American consumers, because I believe that's what the \npublic-interest review requires.''\n\n  If that's true, I have good news for Chairman Kennard--he can take a \nrest, because DOJ is doing exactly the same thing. In a separate speech \nlast week Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, DOJ's chief merger \nreview official, said that what most people do not understand \n(including, evidently, the FCC), is that ``everything we do in \nantitrust . . . is consumer driven.'' He then went on to say precisely \nwhat that means:\n\n       We are a unique federal agency. Our interest is to protect \n     what the economists call consumer welfare. And there is one \n     simple truth that animates everything we do, and that is \n     competition--the more people chasing after the consumer, to \n     serve him or her better, to get lower prices, to get new \n     innovations, to create new opportunities--the more of that \n     juice that goes through the system, the better.\n\n  To be accurate, there is one big difference between the way the FCC \nand the DOJ do merger reviews: DOJ is infinitely better at it. Two \nweeks ago the FCC's already-faltering merger review process hit rock-\nbottom when a staff member (an ostensible antitrust expert) heading up \nthe FCC's review of the SBC-Ameritech merger (which DOJ has already \napproved) publicly proclaimed that, unless the FCC imposed major \nconditions, the proposed transaction ``flunks the public interest \ntest.'' An ``unnamed agency spokeswoman'' then cheerfully agreed that a \nmajority of the Commissioners shared the same view.\n  Can you imagine either the FTC or DOJ countenancing such happenings \nduring the course of their merger review processes? I think not. This \nappallingly unprofessional behavior by the FCC staff drove the value of \nSBC and Ameritech stock down over $2 billion, and it confirmed that, if \nthis is what passes for FCC merger review ``expertise,'' the FCC has no \nbusiness being in it.\n  Mr. President, this bill will restore integrity and professionalism \nto federal review of telecommunications industry mergers. It does not \ntouch either DOJ's or FTC's broad authority to review all mergers, \nincluding all telecommunications industry mergers. It would make sure \nthat any FCC concerns are heard by incorporating the FCC into DOJ and \nFTC merger review proceedings. Nor does it touch the FCC's broad \nauthority to adopt and enforce rules to govern the behavior of \ntelecommunications companies. What it does do is tell the FCC that, in \ncases where either DOJ or FTC has reviewed a proposed \ntelecommunications merger and stated in writing no intent to intervene, \nthe FCC must follow the determination of these expert agencies and \ntransfer any FCC licenses without further delay.\n  Under this bill the FCC may independently review proposed mergers \nwhen neither DOJ nor FTC states in writing its intent not to intervene. \nNevertheless, because DOJ and FTC review all mergers and have authority \nto intervene in any merger, their nonintervention is any proposed \nmerger appropriately signifies that they find the transaction at issue \nis unobjectionable. Therefore, any FCC review in such cases is subject \nto a strict 60-day deadline, and the FCC is directed to presume \napproval without attaching further conditions or obligations on any of \nthe parties. Nothing (except extreme unlikelihood) would preclude the \nFCC from rebutting the presumption with hard facts, nor would the FCC \nbe precluded from subsequently exercising its existing enforcement and \nrulemaking prerogatives to deal with any unanticipated problems.\n\n  Mr. President, we can streamline the way the federal government \nreviews telecom industry mergers and still safeguard the public \ninterest. That's what this bill is intended to do by eliminating \nbureaucratic mismanagement while preserving essential federal review \nand enforcement prerogatives. I urge my colleagues to give it careful \nconsideration and support.\n  This bill, the Telecom Merger Review Act of 1999, would do nothing to \nchange the authority that the Department of Justice and the Federal \nTrade Commission currently have to review all telecom industry mergers.\n  Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications Merger \n     Review Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A stated intent of the Congress in enacting the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to reduce regulation.\n       (2) Under existing law, the Department of Justice and the \n     Federal Trade Commission exercise primary authority to review \n     all mergers, including telecommunications industry mergers. \n     The Federal Communications Commission has only limited \n     authority under the Clayton Act to review telecommunications \n     industry mergers.\n       (3) The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \n     Commission have extensive expertise in analyzing issues of \n     industry concentration and its effects on competition. The \n     Federal Communications Commission has only limited expertise \n     in analyzing such issues.\n       (4) Notwithstanding the limitations on its Clayton Act \n     jurisdiction and on its substantive expertise, the Federal \n     Communications Commission exercises broad authority over \n     telecommunications industry mergers pursuant to the \n     nonspecific public interest standard and other provisions in \n     the Communications Act of 1934 that allow it to impose terms \n     and conditions on the assignment and transfer of licenses and \n     other authorizations.\n       (5) The Federal Communications Commission's exercise of \n     broad authority over telecommunications industry mergers \n     overreaches its intended statutory authority and its \n     substantive expertise and produces delay and inconsistency in \n     its decisions.\n       (6) Under existing law, parties to a proposed \n     telecommunications industry merger are unable to proceed \n     without the prior approval of the Federal Communications \n     Commission, even if the Department of Justice or the Federal \n     Trade Commission have already approved the merger.\n       (7) The Federal Communications Commission's existing \n     rulemaking and enforcement prerogatives constitute normal and \n     effective means of assuring that all licensees, including \n     parties to a telecommunications industry merger, operate in \n     the public interest.\n       (8) The primary jurisdiction and preeminent expertise of \n     the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on \n     all matters involving industry concentration and its effects \n     on competition, combined with the Federal Communications \n     Commission's existing rulemaking and enforcement \n     prerogatives, make the exercise of separate \n     telecommunications industry merger approval authority by the \n     Federal Communications Commission unnecessary.\n       (9) Because the duplication of effort, inconsistency, and \n     delay resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's \n     review of telecommunications industry mergers is unnecessary, \n     it imposes unwarranted costs on the industry, on the \n     Commission, and on the public, and it fails to serve the \n     public interest.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Costmetic Act to \nimprove the safety of imported food, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              Imported food safety improvement act of 1999\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Imported \nFood Safety Act of 1999.'' I am proud to be the sponsor of this \nimportant legislation which guarantees the improved safety of imported \nfoods.\n  The health of Americans is not something to take chances with. It is \nimportant that we make food safety a top priority. Every person should \nhave the confidence that their food is fit to eat. We should be \nconfident that imported food is as safe as food produced in this \ncountry. Cars can't be imported unless they meet U.S. safety \nrequirements. Prescription drugs can't be imported unless they meet FDA \nstandards. You shouldn't be able to import food that isn't up to U.S. \nstandards, either.\n  We import increasing quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, \nseafood, and many other foods. In the past seven years, the amount of \nfood imported into the U.S. has more than doubled. Out of all the \nproduce we eat, 40% of it is imported. Our food supply has gone global, \nso we need to have global food safety.\n  The impact of unsafe food is staggering. There have been several \nfrightening examples of food poisoning incidents in the U.S. When \nMichigan schoolchildren were contaminated with Hepatitis A from \nimported strawberries in 1997, Americans were put on alert. Thousands \nof cases of cyclospora infection from imported raspberries--resulting \nin severe, prolonged diarrhea, weight loss, vomiting, chills and \nfatigue were also reported that year. Imported cantaloupe eaten in \nMaryland sickened 25 people. As much as $663 million was spent on food \nborne illness in Maryland alone. Overall, as many as 33 million people \nper year become ill and over 9000 die as a result of food borne \nillness. It is our children and our seniors who suffer the most. Most \nof the food-related deaths occur in these two populations.\n  These incidents have scared us and have jump-started the efforts to \ndo more to protect our nation's food supply. Now, I believe in free \ntrade, but I also believe in fair trade. FDA's current system of \ntesting import samples at ports of entry does not protect Americans. It \nis ineffective and resource-intensive. Less than 2% of imported food is \nbeing inspected under the current system. At the same time, the \nquantity of the imported foods continues to increase.\n  What this law does is simple: It improves food safety and aims at \npreventing food borne illness of all imported foods regulated by the \nFDA. This bill takes a long overdue, big first step.\n  First, it requires that FDA make equivalence determinations on \nimported food. This was developed with the FDA by Senator Kennedy and \nmyself in consultation with the consumer groups.\n  Today, FDA has no authority to protect Americans against imported \nfood that is unsafe until it is too late. Last year, the GAO found that \nFDA lacks the authority to require that food coming into the U.S. is \nproduced, prepared, packed or held under conditions that provide the \nsame level of food safety protection as those in the U.S. This means \nthat currently, food offered for import to the U.S., can be imported \nunder any conditions, even if those conditions are unsanitary. The \nImported Food Safety Act of 1999, will allow FDA to look at the \nproduction at its source. This means that FDA will be able to take \npreventive measures. FDA will be able to be proactive, rather than just \nreactive.\n  That means that when you pack your childrens' lunches for school or \nsit down at the dinner table, you can rest assured that your food will \nbe safe. Whether your strawberries were grown in a foreign country or \non the Eastern Shore, in Maryland, those strawberries will be held to \nthe same standard. You won't have to worry or wonder where your food is \ncoming from. You won't have to worry that your children or families are \ngoing to get sick. You will know that the food coming into this country \nwill be subject to equivalent standards.\n  Secondly, this bill contains strong enforcement measures. Last year, \nthe\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, under the leadership of \nSenator Sue Collins, held numerous hearings on the safety of imported \nfood. These enforcement measures are largely a product of those facts \nuncovered during those hearings. Senator Collins developed these \nenforcement provisions and introduced a bill which focuses on \nenforcement. I refer those with special interest in enforcement to also \nconsider her bill.\n  Finally, this bill covers emergency situations by allowing FDA to ban \nimported food that has been connected to outbreaks of food borne \nillness. When our children, parents and communities are getting \nseriously sick, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can \nimmediately issue an emergency ban. We don't have to wait till someone \nelse gets seriously sick or dies. We no longer have to go through the \ncurrent bureaucratic mechanism that is inefficient and resource \nintensive. We can stop the food today, to protect our citizens.\n  My goal is to strengthen the food supply, whatever the source of the \nfood may be. This bill won't create trade barriers. It just calls for \nfree trade of safe food. It calls for international concern and \nconsensus on guaranteeing standards for public health.\n  This bill is important because it will save lives and makes for a \nsafer world. Everyone should have security in knowing that the food \nthey eat is fit to eat. I'd like to thank FDA for their advice and \nconsultation in developing this legislation. I also want to thank the \nConsumer Federation of America for their insight and recommendations.\n  I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to enact this \nlegislation. I pledge my commitment to fight for ways to make America's \nfood supply safer. This bill is an important step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Ms. \nCarol Tucker Foreman, Distinguished Fellow and Director of the Food \nPolicy Institute, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Carol Tucker Foreman, Distinguished Fellow and Director of \n                       the Food Policy Institute\n\n       I am here today on behalf of the Consumer Federation of \n     America and the National Consumers' League to endorse the \n     Imported Food Safety Act of 1999. I thank Senators Mikulski, \n     Kennedy and Durbin and Congresswoman Eshoo for introducing \n     this very important legislation.\n       It will improve the Food and Drug Administration's capacity \n     to protect American consumers from food-borne illness caused \n     by adulterated imported food.\n       Food-borne illness is a serious public health problem in \n     the U.S. Food poisoning kills 9,000 Americans each year and \n     causes as many as 33 million illnesses. It costs us at least \n     $5 billion each year in medical costs and time lost from \n     work. The human toll is incalculable.\n       Americans eat from a global plate. We want a wide variety \n     of foods available on a year round basis. Health experts urge \n     us to eat more fruits and vegetables. Imports make fresh \n     fruits available to us even in the middle of February.\n       But no one wants imported foods served with a side helping \n     of food poisoning. We want all our food, domestic and \n     imported, to be safe.\n       We have not had that assurance. In recent years there have \n     been a number of incidents of food-borne illness arising from \n     imported food products. Last year, the Senate Permanent \n     Subcommittee on Investigations revealed serious problems with \n     the Food and Drug Administration's capacity to protect \n     Americans from unsafe food.\n       The General Accounting Office reported that FDA can't \n     protect us because the agency has no authority to require \n     that foods coming into the United States be produced and \n     packaged under circumstances that provide the same level of \n     health protection required for domestic food producers and \n     processors.\n       Most American consumers, and frankly most food producers \n     and processors as well, would be shocked to learn that \n     imported food is not required to be produced in a manner that \n     provides the same level of health protection as domestic \n     products and that FDA has no authority to check, in advance, \n     for adequate public health safeguards. FDA can act only after \n     the fact--after adulterated food has been found or someone \n     has gotten sick.\n       The USDA inspects meat, poultry and egg products. GAO noted \n     that USDA has the necessary power to protect consumers. The \n     Department has the authority to require that meat and poultry \n     produced abroad and imported into the U.S. be produced in a \n     system that provides a level of health protection equivalent \n     to that imposed on U.S. producers. That level of protection \n     may include limits on bacteria that cause human illness. In \n     addition, USDA has federally sworn inspectors who examine the \n     foreign systems and check food at the docks.\n       The Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over all \n     other food products, including the fresh fruits and \n     vegetables that are so susceptible to contamination. FDA has \n     no similar authority, no inspectors who visit foreign plants \n     and virtually no inspectors to check food at the docks. Last \n     year, FDA checked only two percent of the food imported into \n     the U.S. In fact, FDA has established only a limited number \n     of performance standards for domestically produced foods.\n       That point bears repeating. If you eat meat and poultry \n     produced in another country and imported into the U.S., you \n     can do so knowing they were produced under circumstances at \n     least as clean and sanitary as meat, poultry and eggs \n     produced in the U.S. If you consume fresh fruits and \n     vegetables produced in another country, you have no such \n     assurance, even though you will cook your meat, poultry and \n     eggs but may well eat the fruits and vegetables raw, \n     increasing the chance that you will consume disease causing \n     bacteria.\n       In a recent study, the Center for Science in the Public \n     Interest surveyed 225 food-borne illness outbreaks that \n     occurred between 1990 and 1998. Foods regulated by the FDA \n     caused over twice as many outbreaks as foods regulated by the \n     USDA. Fruits, vegetables and salads caused 48 outbreaks. \n     Seafood, both finfish and shellfish, caused 32 outbreaks.\n       USDA's more rigorous system of inspection has certainly not \n     stopped foreign produced meat products from entering the \n     country. We import hundreds of millions of pounds of meat \n     each year from Australia, to Argentina and Denmark and a host \n     of other countries. Neither foreign nor domestic producers \n     have suffered any loss of trade.\n       The Imported Food Safety Act sets up a system for the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to use in establishing \n     equivalency; gives FDA more authority to visit other \n     countries; provides important enforcement authority and \n     controls over imported foods; prohibits port shopping and \n     increases penalties for importing contaminated foods and \n     authorizes new funding for FDA to carry out these functions.\n       Americans do care about food safety. The Food Marketing \n     Institute, the nation's super market trade association, \n     recently released its annual survey of trends among super \n     market shoppers. Ninety percent of those surveyed said food \n     safety was very important or somewhat important to them in \n     making food selections. The Imported Food Safety Act will \n     increase assurance among consumers that the food supply is \n     safe.\n       The Imported Food Safety Act is an important part of a \n     package of food safety legislation which Congress should \n     address this year. Other parts of the package include \n     legislation to promote the use of specific microbial \n     standards for both domestic and foreign produce, introduced \n     by Senator Harkin; require registration of importers, \n     introduced by Senator Dorgan. Congress should act now before \n     confidence is diminished.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor of this \nimportant bill, and I commend Senator Mikulski for her leadership on \nthis legislation to close the critical gaps in our imported food safety \nlaws.\n  Citizens deserve to know that the food they eat is safe and \nwholesome, regardless of its source. The United States has one of the \nsafest food supplies in the world. Yet every year, millions of \nAmericans become sick, and thousands die, from eating contaminated \nfood. Billions of dollars a year in medical costs and lost productivity \nare caused by food-borne illnesses. Often, the source of the problem is \nimported food.\n  We've heard recently about the thousands of cases of illness from \nCyclospora in raspberries from Guatemala. But this high profile case is \nby no means the only case.\n  In 1997, school children in five states contracted Hepatitis A from \nfrozen strawberries served in the school cafeterias. Fecal \ncontamination is a potential source of Hepatitis A, and the \nstrawberries the children ate came from a farm in Mexico where workers \nhad little access to sanitary facilities.\n  Earlier this year, cases of typhoid fever in Florida were linked to a \nfrozen tropical fruit product from Guatemala. Again, poor sanitary \nconditions appear to be at the root of the problem.\n  Gastrointestinal illness has been linked to soft cheeses from Europe. \nBacterial food poisoning has been attributed to canned mushrooms from \nthe Far East.\n  The emergence of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and an increase \nin the number of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics, make \nmicrobial contamination of food a major public health challenge.\n  Ensuring the safety of imported food is a huge task. Americans now \nenjoy a wide variety of foods from around the world and have access to \nfresh fruits\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nand vegetables year round. In 1997, the Food Safety Inspection Service \nof the Department of Agriculture handled 118,000 entries of imported \nmeat and poultry. The FDA handled far more-- 2.7 million entries of \nother imported food. Current FDA procedures and resources allowed for \nless than two percent of those 2.7 million imports to be physically \ninspected. Clearly, we need to do better.\n  The authority of the FDA is not sufficient to prevent contaminated \nfood imports from reaching our shores. The Agency has no legal \nauthority to require that food imported into the United States is \nprepared, packed and stored under conditions that provide the same \nlevel of public health protection as similar food produced in the U.S. \nUnder current procedures, the FDA takes random samples of imports as \nthey arrive at the border. The imports often continue on their way to \nstores in all parts of the country while testing is being done, and it \nis often difficult to recall the food if a problem is found. \nUnscrupulous importers make the most of the loopholes in the law, \nincluding substituting cargo, falsifying laboratory results, and \nattempting to bring a refused shipment in again, at a later date or at \na different port.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will give the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services the additional authority needed to assure \nthat food imports are as safe as food grown and prepared in this \ncountry.\n  It will give the FDA greater authority to deal with outbreaks of \nfood-borne illness and to bar further imports of dangerous foods until \nimprovements at the source can guarantee the safety of future \nshipments. This authority covers foods that have repeatedly been \nassociated with food-borne disease, have repeatedly been found to be \nadulterated, or have been linked to a catastrophic outbreak of food-\nborne illness.\n  It will close loopholes in the law and give the FDA better tools to \ndeal with unscrupulous importers.\n  It will authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \ntarget resources toward enhanced surveillance and prevention activities \nto deal with food-borne illnesses, including new diagnostic tests, \nbetter training of health professionals, and increased public awareness \nabout food safety.\n  Too many citizens today are at unnecessary risk of food-borne \nillness. The measure we are proposing is designed to reduce that risk \nas much as possible, both immediately and for the long term. We know \nthat there are powerful special interests that put profits ahead of \nsafety, but Americans need and deserve laws that better protect their \nfood supply. This is essential legislation, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see that it is enacted as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Gramm):\n  S. 1128. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe Federal estate and gift taxes and the tax on generation-skipping \ntransfers, to provide for a carryover basis at death, and to establish \na partial capital gains exclusion for inherited assets; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   estate tax elimination act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators Bob \nKerrey, Don Nickles, John Breaux, sConnie Mack, Chuck Robb, and Phil \nGramm to introduce a bill that attempts to forge bipartisan consensus \nwith regard to the future of the federal estate tax. The legislation we \nare offering today is titled the Estate Tax Elimination Act of 1999.\n\n  Mr. President, we know that many Americans are troubled by the estate \ntax's complexity and high rates, and by the mere fact that it is \ntriggered by a person's death rather than the realization of income. \nFor a long time, I have advocated its repeal, because I believe death \nshould not be a taxable event.\n  Other people agree that the tax is problematic, but are concerned the \nappreciated value of certain assets might escape taxation forever if \nthe estate tax is repealed while the step-up in basis allowed under \nSection 1014 of the Internal Revenue Code remains in effect.\n  The legislation we are introducing today attempts to reconcile these \npositions by eliminating both the estate tax and the step-up, and \nattributing a carryover basis to inherited property so that all gains \nare taxed at the time the property is sold and income is realized. This \nis an explicit trade-off: estate-tax repeal for implementation of a \ncarryover basis. Both must occur, or this plan will not work.\n  The concept of a carryover basis is not new. It exists in current law \nwith respect to gifts, Section 1015 of the Internal Revenue Code, and \nproperty transferred in cases of divorce, Section 1041, and in \nconnection with involuntary conversions of property relating to theft, \ndestruction, seizure, requisition, or condemnation.\n  In the latter case, when an owner receives compensation for \ninvoluntarily converted property, a taxable gain normally results to \nthe extent that the value of the compensation exceeds the basis of the \nconverted property. However, Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code \nallows the taxpayer to defer the recognition of the gain until the \nproperty is sold. The Kyl-Kerrey bill would treat the transfer of \nproperty at death--perhaps the most involuntary conversion of all--the \nsame way, deferring recognition of any gain until the inherited \nproperty is sold.\n  Our bill would also establish a limited capital-gains exclusion for \ninherited property to ensure that small estates, which are currently \nexempt from tax by virtue of the unified credit and the step-up in \nbasis, do not find themselves with a new tax liability when the \nproposed law takes effect.\n  Mr. President, I have asked the Joint Tax Committee to review the \nproposal and provide an official revenue estimate. We are awaiting the \nresults of that review now.\n  I hope the members of the Finance Committee will take a serious and \ncareful look at this bipartisan proposal. With it, we ought to be able \nto finally eliminate the estate tax--and do it this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   S. __, the Estate Tax Elimination Act Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       Designates the bill, the ``Estate Tax Elimination Act of \n     1999.''\n     Section 2. Repeal of certain Federal transfer taxes\n       Repeals Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), thus \n     eliminating the federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping \n     transfer taxes as of the date of enactment.\n     Section 3. Termination of a step-up in basis at death\n       Amends IRC Section 1014 to eliminate the step-up in basis \n     at death with respect to property acquired from a decedent \n     dying after the date of enactment. The basis for such \n     property is to be determined pursuant a new IRC Section 1022 \n     (section 4 of the bill).\n     Section 4. Carryover basis at death\n       Establishes a new IRC Section 1022 to provide for carryover \n     basis for certain property acquired from a decedent.\n       (a) If property is classified as carryover basis property, \n     its new basis in the hands of the acquiring person will be \n     its initial basis, increased by its allowable share of the \n     decedent's exclusion allowance determined under (c) below.\n       (b) Carryover basis property means property which has been \n     acquired from a decedent who died after the date of \n     enactment, and which is not any of the following:\n\n       (1) Property acquired from the decedent and sold, \n     exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by the acquiring person \n     before the decedent's death;\n       (2) An item of income in respect of a decedent;\n       (3) Life-insurance proceeds under IRC Section 2042;\n       (4) Foreign personal holding company stock as described in \n     IRC Section 1014(b)(5); or\n       (5) Property transferred to a surviving spouse, the value \n     of which would have been deductible from the value of the \n     taxable estate of the decedent under IRC Section 2056.\n       (6) Tangible personal property (e.g., household effects) \n     valued at $50,000 or less which was a capital asset in the \n     hands of the decedent and for which the executor has made an \n     election on a required information return.\n       (c) The decedent's general exclusion allowance is equal to \n     the lesser of:\n       (1) an applicable amount for the year of the decedent's \n     death as follows:\n         $650,000 in 1999\n         $675,000 in 2000 and 2001\n         $700,000 in 2002 and 2003\n         $850,000 in 2004\n         $950,000 in 2005\n         $1 million in 2006 and thereafter.\n     or the aggregate net appreciation (fair market value, less \n     initial basis) of all carryover basis property.\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\n       Except that, if the decedent had a deceased spouse whose \n     own exclusion allowance was less than the applicable amount \n     for that spouse, the decedent's applicable amount will be \n     increased by the unallocated portion of the deceased spouse's \n     applicable amount.\n       (2) As per current law, family-owned businesses and farms \n     would be eligible for an additional exclusion, which combined \n     with the general exclusion allowance could total up to $1.3 \n     million.\n       (3) The executor will allocate the exclusion-allowance \n     amount to the carryover basis property on a required \n     information return. Any allocation may be changed at any time \n     up to the 30th day after the initial-basis finality date, \n     which means the last day on which the initial basis of \n     property may be changed in an administrative or judicial \n     proceeding under new IRC Section 7480. The basis adjustment \n     for any property shall not exceed the net appreciation in \n     such property and may not increase the basis of such property \n     above its fair market value.\n       In the case of any carryover basis property which was a \n     personal or household effect, the basis of such property in \n     the hands of the acquiring person shall not exceed its fair \n     market value for purposes of determining loss.\n       A nonresident, not a citizen of the United States, is \n     ineligible for a basis adjustment based upon a decedent's \n     exclusion allowance.\n       (d) Establishes a new IRC Section 7480 to provide \n     procedures for receiving a binding determination of the \n     initial basis of carryover basis property.\n       (e) Establishes a new IRC Section 6039H to require an \n     executor to file an information return providing all of the \n     necessary information with respect to carryover basis \n     property. An executor is required to furnish, in writing, the \n     adjusted basis of such item to each person acquiring an item \n     or carryover basis property from a decedent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1129. A bill to facilitate the acquisition of inholdings in \nFederal land management units and the disposal of surplus public land, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n               federal land transaction facilitation act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Land \nTransaction Facilitation Act, which addresses longstanding problems \nencountered by Federal land managers first, in disposing of surplus \nfederal property, and secondly, in acquiring private inholdings within \nfederally designated areas. This legislation builds on existing laws \nand provides resources dedicated to the consolidation of federal agency \nland holdings.\n  I first introduced this bill prior to the end of the 105th Congress, \nas Title II to the Valles Caldera Preservation Act. This portion of \nthat legislation was independent of the proposed acquisition of land in \nNew Mexico, and perhaps more important. Again this year, Congress will \ncommit large sums of federal taxpayer dollars to purchase new property. \nBefore we do, however, it seems prudent to provide a framework for the \norderly disposal of unneeded federal property that also commits \nresources to meet our current obligations to those who hold land \nsurrounded by federal property.\n  Currently, one-third of the land area in New Mexico is owned by the \nFederal government. On average, across the eleven Western States, the \nFederal government owns approximately one half of the land. I agree \nthat this public land is an important natural resource that requires \nour most thoughtful consideration in the way it is managed and used by \nthe public.\n  To best conserve our existing national treasures for future use and \nenjoyment, we must devise, with the concurrence of other members of \nCongress and the President, a definite plan and timetable to dispose of \nsurplus land through sale or exchange into private, or State and local \ngovernment ownership.\n  The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act provides for the \norderly disposition of unneeded Federal property on a state by state \nbasis. It also addresses the problem of what are known as \n``inholdings'' within federally managed areas. These interrelated \nproblems give rise to an interrelated solution proposed in this \nlegislation.\n  There are currently more than 45 million acres of privately owned \nland trapped within the boundaries of Federal land management units, \nincluding national parks, national forests, national monuments, \nnational wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. In many cases, the \nlocation of these tracts, referred to as inholdings, makes the exercise \nof private property rights difficult for the land owner. In addition, \nmanagement of the public land is made more cumbersome for the Federal \nmanagers.\n  There are also cases where inholders have been waiting generations \nfor the federal government to set aside funding and prioritize the \nacquisition of their property. With rapidly growing public demand for \nthe use of public land, it is increasingly difficult for federal \nmanagers to address problems created by inholdings in many areas.\n  This legislation directs the Department of the Interior to identify \ninholdings existing within Federal land management units that \nlandowners that have indicated a desire to sell to the Federal \ngovernment. Inholdings will only be considered for acquisition by the \nSecretary of Interior if, after public notice, landowners indicate \ntheir willingness to sell. The Secretary will then establish a priority \nfor their acquisition considering, among other factors, those which \nhave existed as inholdings for the longest time.\n  Additionally, this legislation authorizes the use of the proceeds \ngenerated from sale of land no longer needed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM) to purchase these inholdings from willing sellers. \nThis will enhance the ability of the Federal land management agencies \nto work cooperatively with private land owners, and with State and \nlocal governments, to consolidate the ownership of public and private \nland in a manner that would allow for better overall resource \nmanagement.\n  There is an abundance of public domain land that the BLM has \ndetermined it no longer needs to fulfil its mission. Under the Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), the BLM has identified \nan estimated four to six million acres of public domain land for \ndisposal, with public input and consultation with State and local \ngovernments as required by law.\n  Let me state this very clearly--the BLM already has authority under \nan existing law, FLPMA, to exchange or sell land out of Federal \nownership. Through its public process for land use planning, when the \nagency has determined that certain land would be more useful to the \npublic under private or local governmental control, it is already \nauthorized to dispose of this land, either by sale or exchange. This \nlegislation maintains every aspect of existing law. It also provides an \norderly process, and sufficient resources, for the BLM to exercise it.\n  The sale or exchange of land which I have often referred to as \n``surplus,'' would be beneficial to local communities, adjoining land \nowners, and BLM land mangers, alike. First, it would allow for the \nreconfiguration of land ownership patterns to better facilitate \nresource management. Second, it would contribute to administrative \nefficiency within federal land management units, by allowing for better \nallocation of fiscal and human resources within the agency. Finally, in \ncertain locations, the sale of public land which has been identified \nfor disposal is the best way for the public to realize a fair value for \nthis land.\n  The problem is that an orderly process for the efficient disposition \nof lands identified for disposal does not currently exist. This \nlegislation corrects that problem by directing the BLM to fulfil all \nlegal requirements for the transfer of land out of Federal ownership, \nand providing a dedicated source of funding generated from the sale of \nthis land to continue this process.\n  I want to make it clear that this program will in no way detract from \nother programs with similar purposes. The bill clearly states that \nproceeds generated from the disposal of public land, and dedicated to \nthe acquisition of inholdings, will supplement, and not replace, funds \nappropriated for that purpose through the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. In addition, the bill states that the BLM should rely on non-\nFederal entities to conduct appraisals and other research required for \nthe sale or exchange of this land, allowing for the least disruption of \nexisting land and resource management programs.\n  This bill has been a long time in the making. For over a year, now, I \nhave been working with and talking to knowledgeable people, both inside \nand outside of the current administration, to develop many of the ideas \nembodied in this bill. Prior to adjournment of the 105th Congress, my \nstaff and I worked closely with the administration on this legislation. \nI have since received additional comments from the\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\nInterior Department, and have included many of their suggestions into \nthis bill.\n  I feel comfortable in stating that by working together, we have \nreached agreement in principle on the best way to proceed with these \nvery important issues involving the management of public land \nresources, namely, the disposition of surplus public land in \ncombination with a program to address problems associated with \ninholdings within our Federal land management units.\n  I look forward to hearings on this matter, and anticipate that most \nof my fellow Senators will agree that Federal Land Transaction \nFacilitation Act logically addresses this management issue. I believe \nthat in the end, we will be able to stand together and tell the \nAmerican people that we truly have accomplished a great and innovative \nthing with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Land Transaction \n     Facilitation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.) to sell land identified for disposal under its \n     land use planning;\n       (2) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under that \n     Act to exchange Federal land for non-Federal land if the \n     exchange would be in the public interest;\n       (3) through land use planning under that Act, the Bureau of \n     Land Management has identified certain tracts of public land \n     for disposal;\n       (4) the land management agencies of the Department of the \n     Interior have authority under existing law to acquire land \n     consistent with land use plans and the mission of each \n     agency;\n       (5) the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal \n     and the acquisition of certain non-Federal land from willing \n     landowners would--\n       (A) allow for the reconfiguration of land ownership \n     patterns to better facilitate resource management;\n       (B) contribute to administrative efficiency within Federal \n     land management units; and\n       (C) allow for increased effectiveness of the allocation of \n     fiscal and human resources within the Federal land management \n     agencies;\n       (6) a more expeditious process for disposal and acquisition \n     of land, established to facilitate a more effective \n     configuration of land ownership patterns, would benefit the \n     public interest;\n       (7) many private individuals own land within the boundaries \n     of Federal land management units and desire to sell the land \n     to the Federal Government;\n       (8) such land lies within national parks, national \n     monuments, national wildlife refuges, and other areas \n     designated for special management;\n       (9) Federal land management agencies are facing increased \n     workloads from rapidly growing public demand for the use of \n     public land, making it difficult for Federal managers to \n     address problems created by the existence of inholdings in \n     many areas;\n       (10) in many cases, inholders and the Federal Government \n     would mutually benefit from Federal acquisition of the land \n     on a priority basis;\n       (11) proceeds generated from the disposal of public land \n     may be properly dedicated to the acquisition of inholdings \n     and other land that will improve the resource management \n     ability of the Bureau of Land Management and adjoining \n     landowners;\n       (12) using proceeds generated from the disposal of public \n     land to purchase inholdings and other such land from willing \n     sellers would enhance the ability of the Federal land \n     management agencies to--\n       (A) work cooperatively with private landowners and State \n     and local governments; and\n       (B) promote consolidation of the ownership of public and \n     private land in a manner that would allow for better overall \n     resource management;\n       (13) in certain locations, the sale of public land that has \n     been identified for disposal is the best way for the public \n     to receive fair market value for the land; and\n       (14) to allow for the least disruption of existing land and \n     resource management programs, the Bureau of Land Management \n     may use non-Federal entities to prepare appraisal documents \n     for agency review and approval consistent with applicable \n     provisions of the Uniform Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisition.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, with respect \nto liability of motor vehicle rental or leasing companies for the \nnegligent operation of rented or leased motor vehicles; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               motor vehicle rental fairness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Motor Vehicle \nRental Fairness Act of 1999. The measure is short, simple and \nimportant. It will assure that companies who rent or lease motor \nvehicles are not held liable for accidents caused by their customers \nwhen there is no way the companies could prevent these accidents.\n  Normally under our system of jurisprudence, defendants in lawsuits \nare held liable based upon their action or inaction. Unfortunately, a \nsmall number of states ignore this general principle. This minority of \nstates subject rental and leasing companies to unlimited liability for \naccidents caused by their customers that involve the company's \nvehicles--despite the fact that the company was not at fault. This type \nof vicarious liability, liability without fault, holds these companies \nliable even when they have not been negligent in any way and the \nvehicle operated perfectly.\n  The measure I am introducing prevents states from holding companies \nliable for accidents based solely upon their ownership of the vehicles. \nThe bill makes clear that rental companies would still be liable if the \nvehicle did not operate properly. It makes clear that companies are not \nexcused from meeting state minimum insurance requirements on their \nmotor vehicles. Minimum insurance requirements ensure that people \ninvolved in accidents with vehicles owned by rental companies have \nrecourse to recover some damages.\n  The reason most often cited for imposing vicarious liability is to \nensure that an innocent third party can recover damages in an accident. \nUnfortunately, this quest for a financially responsible defendant has \nlead to absurd results. If a vehicle is purchased from a bank or \nfinance company, then there is no vicarious liability. However, if that \nsame vehicle is leased, vicarious liability applies.\n  This problem attracted my attention because of the impact the \npolicies of a small number of states have on interstate commerce. \nSettlements and judgments from vicarious liability claims against \nrental companies cost the industry over $100 million annually. And let \nme be clear, it is the consumer who is paying this cost.\n  For these reasons, this bill and the reforms it implements are long \noverdue. Everyone, companies and individuals alike should be held \nliable only for harm they caused or could have prevented. The only way \nthese companies can prevent this harm would be to go out of business. \nThis is an absurd expectation that will be remedied by this bill.\n  I look forward to hearings on this matter and working with my \ncolleagues to ensure its passage. I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1130\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Motor Vehicle Rental \n     Fairness Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDING.\n\n       The Congress finds that the vicarious liability laws, the \n     ultimate insurer laws, and the common law in a small minority \n     of States--\n       (1) impose a disproportionate and undue burden on \n     interstate commerce by increasing rental rates for motor \n     vehicle rental and leasing customers throughout the United \n     States; and\n       (2) pose a significant competitive barrier to entry for \n     smaller motor vehicle rental and leasing companies attempting \n     to compete in these markets,\n\n     in contravention of a fundamental principle of fairness that \n     there should be no liability in the absence of fault.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation being introduced by the distinguished Chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee--the senior Senator from Arizona. I strongly \nsupport the reforms to state vicarious liability laws contained in the \n``Motor Vehicle Rental Fairness Act of 1999'' and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important bill and move it swiftly towards enactment.\n  I commend the chairman for taking the lead on this important \nlegislation. His bill, of which I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor, seeks to put a halt to an absurd aberration in our legal \nsystem. Under the vicarious liability laws of a very small number of \nstates, companies that rent or lease motor vehicles are held strictly \nliable if their renters or lessees are negligent and cause an accident. \nThe company does not have to be negligent in any way. The vehicle may \noperate perfectly and be maintained properly. These states simply hold \nthe company liable because of their ownership of the vehicle.\n  The only way for these companies to avoid this liability would be to \nstop renting or leasing these vehicles. This is not an acceptable \nresolution to this problem. The American justice system should be based \non the general principle that a defendant should be held liable only \nfor harm he or she could prevent--not merely because the defendant has \na ``deep pocket.''\n  Vicarious liability laws undermine competition in these states and \nhave driven smaller rental and leasing companies out of business. In \nfact, vicarious liability acts as a tax on all rental and leasing \ncompanies--and their customers--nationwide because these companies must \ntry to recover their losses from vicarious claims through rental rates \nnationwide.\n  It is time to put a stop to this legal disconnect. Hold these \ncompanies liable if they are negligent. Hold them liable if they fail \nto properly maintain one of the vehicles they rent or lease. But do not \nhold them liable simply for being in business--for fulfilling the needs \nof our traveling constituents.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to hearings on the Senator from \nArizona's legislation at the earliest possible date and hope to move \nthis legislation through this body as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1131. A bill to promote research into, and the development of an \nultimate cure for, the disease known as Fragile X; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              fragile x research breakthrough act of 1999\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nHagel, to introduce the Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999.\n  Most of my colleagues have probably never heard of Fragile X. But it \nis the leading known cause of mental retardation. And the measure we \nintroduce today could help put us on the path to treat and ultimately, \nwe hope, cure the disorder. This measure will launch a concerted and \naggressive federal effort to deal with Fragile X.\n  Fragile X--which is a genetic defect that results in mental \nretardation--was only recently discovered. Given its prevalence, it's \nsurprising that it took us so long to discover this problem.\n  One in 2,000 males and one in 4,000 females have the gene defect. One \nin every 260 women is a carrier. Current studies estimate that as many \nas 90,000 Americans suffer from Fragile X. Yet up to 80 to 90 percent \nof them are undiagnosed. It does not affect one racial or ethnic group \nmore than another.\n  Scientists have only known exactly what causes Fragile X since 1991. \nFragile X occurs when a specific gene, which should hold a string of \nmolecules that repeat six to fifty times, over-expands. It causes the \ngene to hold anywhere from 200 to 1,000 copies of the same sequence, \nrepeating over and over, much like a record skipping out of control. \nThe result of this error is that instructions needed for the creation \nof a specific protein in the brain are lost. Consequently, the Fragile \nX protein is either low or absent in the affected person. The lower the \nlevel of the protein, the more severe the resulting disabilities.\n\n  People with Fragile X have effects ranging from mild learning \ndisabilities to severe mental retardation. Behavioral problems \nassociated with Fragile X include aggression, anxiety, and seizures. \nThe effects on both the victims of the disorder and their families are \nprofound, taking a huge emotional and financial toll. People with \nFragile X have a normal life expectancy but usually incur special costs \nthat add up to over $2 million on average over their lifetime. Because \nit is inherited, many families have more than one child with Fragile X.\n  But although Fragile X is now known in the scientific community, it \nis still neither widely studied by scientists nor known by the public \nat large.\n  That's shocking, considering its devastating effect. Let me give you \nan example. In 1989 Katie Clapp gave birth to her first child, Andy. \nShe and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia were thrilled. There were \nsome concerns initially because Andy was missing one kidney and had \nsome other medical problems. But they were quickly remedied, and \nMichael knew from his training as a medical doctor that Andy could do \nfine with one kidney. Testing did not reveal any other problems, so the \ncouple breathed easy.\n  But soon Andy started showing other signs of problems. He had \ndifficulty feeding and was inconsolable except when held by his mother. \nHe was not as responsive as other children his age, except to scream \nwhen put down. Over the first year of life, he began to miss \nachievement milestones, such as sitting up and walking. Michael was in \nhis residency training at the University of North Carolina hospital, so \na\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\nwealth of medical resources were within his reach. Andy was seen by \nneurologists and geneticists, but there were no answers.\n  When Andy was two years old, Katie became pregnant with a second \nchild. She wanted to be sure that her next baby would be born free of \nAndy's problems. So Andy was tested some more for genetics \nabnormalities, but nothing showed up. Yet Andy's problems were becoming \nmore and more apparent, and causing greater difficulties for the \nfamily.\n  Finally, when he was three and a half years old, Andy went to a new \nphysician, a developmental pediatrician. During the initial visit with \nthe doctor, Michael and Katie got their first indication that there \nmight be a name for the problem they had been living with. The doctor \nsuggested that Andy be tested for something called Fragile X. The test \nwas performed, and came back positive. Katie Clapp and Michael \nTranfaglia soon learned that not only did Andy have this inherited \ngenetic disorder, but that their baby daughter Laura was also \nafflicted.\n  Recent advances in Fragile X research now make it possible to test \ndefinitively for the disorder through DNA analysis. Yet many doctors \nare still not familiar with Fragile X, and subtle symptoms in early \nchildhood can make it difficult to detect.\n  But there is good news. Because scientists have identified the \nmissing protein that causes the disorder, there is hope for a cure. And \nbecause Fragile X is the only single-gene disease known to directly \nimpact human intelligence, understanding the disease can give us \ninsight into human intelligence and learning and into dealing with \nother single gene defects. Understanding Fragile X may also unlock some \nof the mysteries of autism, schizophrenia, and other neurological \ndisorders. But we need to fund research efforts into this devastating \ndisease.\n  Mr. President, my proposal seeks to capitalize on the good news. It \nwould:\n  Expand and coordinate research into Fragile X under the direction of \nthe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development--a \ndivision of the National Institutes of Health;\n  Establish at least three Fragile X centers, which would receive \ngrants for research and development aimed at improving the diagnosis \nand treatment of, and finding a cure for, Fragile X;\n  Allow patients with Fragile X to participate in clinical trials;\n  Coordinate activities and exchange of information between the centers \nfor better understanding of the disorder, and\n  Encourage wide scale research into Fragile X by allowing qualified \nhealth professionals who conduct research into the disorder to be \nrepaid for principal and interest on educational loans under the \nNational Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program.\n  Today, in our country, thousands of children have Fragile X, but \ntheir parent have never heard of the disease. These parents know \nsomething is wrong, but they cannot give the problem a name, and \nneither can any doctor they have consulted. Like Katie and Michael, \nthey may know their child has a disability, but they do not know why. \nThey do not know that if they have more children, those children may \nalso be at risk. They do not know there are treatments for the problem.\n  They do not know that someone is working on a cure.\n  The same holds true for many adults in our society. They are living \nin group homes and in institutions around the country. They have been \ncared for during entire lifetimes by devoted family members. Yet they \nhave never had a diagnosis beyond ``mental retardation.''\n  This summer in North Carolina, we are hosting a very special \ngathering of very special people. The Special Olympics World games will \nbegin with an opening ceremony in Raleigh on June 26th, and the Games \nwill run through July 4th. Among the participants will be many athletes \nwho have Fragile X. Some of them know it, but many others, along with \ntheir families, do not even know that their particular disorder has a \nname. And with a name comes knowledge, and with knowledge comes hope \nfor a better future--even for a cure.\n  The job of these extraordinary athletes this summer is to make the \nmost of their abilities and to achieve personal goals and triumphs. Our \nrole in the games is to support their efforts, and to cheer them on. \nBut our responsibility does not end there. It is our responsibility to \nmake the most of the knowledge we now have, to expand that knowledge, \nand to give these folks the best chance possible. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important research. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental \n     retardation. It affects 1 in every 2,000 boys and 1 in every \n     4,000 girls. One in 260 women is a carrier.\n       (2) Most children with Fragile X require a lifetime of \n     special care at a cost of over $2,000,000 per child.\n       (3) Relatively newly-discovered and relatively unknown, \n     even in the medical profession, Fragile X is caused by the \n     absence of a single protein that can be produced \n     synthetically but that cannot yet be effectively assimilated.\n       (4) Fragile X research, both basic and applied, is vastly \n     underfunded in view of its prevalence, the potential for the \n     development of a cure, the established benefits of currently \n     available interventions, and the significance that Fragile X \n     research has for related disorders.\n       (5) Fragile X is a powerful research model for other forms \n     of X-linked mental retardation, as well as neuropsychiatric \n     disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, mood disorders, \n     and pervasive developmental disorder. Individuals with \n     Fragile X are a homogeneous study population for advancing \n     understanding of these disorders.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my colleague \nand friend, the distinguished junior Senator from North Carolina, \nSenator Edwards, in introducing the Fragile X Breakthrough Act of 1999.\n  Although many of you may not have heard of Fragile X, it is the \nleading cause of inherited mental retardation. It affects tens of \nthousands of children in this country every year. Fragile X is caused \nby a defective gene that fails to product specific protein necessary \nfor proper brain function. Those afflicted with this condition often \nsuffer mild to severe mental retardation, anxiety, seizures, and a \nvariety of learning disorders. Most children with Fragile X will \nrequire a lifetime of specialized care at a cost of over $2 million \neach.\n  For those afflicted and their families--like John and Megan Massey \nfrom Scottsbluff, Nebraska, whose two sons Jack and Jacob suffer from \nthis disease--it is a frustrating, life-crippling, and heart-wrenching \ncondition. But there is hope. In 1991, medical researchers were able to \nidentify the specific gene that fails to produce the necessary protein \nand is responsible for Fragile X. Since then, researchers have been \nable to develop a synthetic version of this protein, and are now \nworking on a way to deliver it to the brain's flawed cells.\n  Congress has an unprecedented opportunity to play a key role in \nsolving the mystery of this disease, and encouraging the development of \na treatment and eventual cure. The Fragile X Breakthrough Act is a \npractical, pro-active, and cost-effective vehicle by which Congress can \naccomplish these goals.\n  The National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) is \nrequired by law to establish research centers in order to conduct \nclinical and scientific research aimed at helping infants and children. \nIn accordance with that charge, the Fragile X Breakthrough Act \nauthorizes $10 million for the NICHD, to make grants or enter into \ncontracts with public or private entities to develop and operate three \nFragile X research centers. It also provides $2 million for a program \nthat encourages physicians to conduct Fragile X research, by offering \nto repay a portion of their educational loans. These proposals closely \nfollow the recommendations that emerged from an international \nscientific conference held by the NICHD and the Fragile X Foundation \n(FRAXA) in December of 1998.\n  We are closing in on one of the principal genetic causes of mental \nretardation. Let's give the NICHD the authority and funding to \naccelerate Fragile X research, so that the final, critical \nbreakthroughs can be made. Let's give these children the chance to lead \nnormal, productive lives. If not for Jacob and Jack Massey, then for \nthose children who will inevitably follow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1132. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe reinvestment of employee stock ownership plan dividends without the \nloss of any dividend reduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    esop dividend reinvestment and participant security act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwill not only promote employee ownership, but also enhance retirement \nsavings. The ``ESOP Dividend Reinvestment and Participant Security Act \nof 1999'' will grant many workers their long-sought desire to share in \nthe growth of their company while not sacrificing one nickel of their \nretirement security. This legislation will permit employees to reinvest \ndividends paid on employer securities held in an ESOP without going \nthrough the administrative complexity that companies currently face in \norder to encourage workers to keep their dividends in the plan.\n  Under current law, an employer may deduct the dividends paid on \nemployer securities in an ESOP only if the dividends are used to repay \nan ESOP loan or they are paid in cash to participants. This runs \ncounter to one of the most important themes expressed by this \nadministration as well as many others since the passage of ERISA--what \nto do about ``leakage'' in our retirement programs, or assets coming \nout of plans prematurely. In short, we need to encourage our nation's \nworkers to keep their money in their retirement plans and not let small \namounts drip out over time so that little is left by the time they \nenter retirement. The bill I am introducing today addresses this issue \nand would bolster the retirement security of ESOP participants because \nit would encourage both employees and employers to reinvest their \ndividends in the company.\n  Not only does the current approach of denying a deduction for \nreinvested dividends discourage the accumulation of assets for \nretirement, it also thwarts one of the primary purposes of an ESOP--\nproviding an efficient means for employees to build an ownership \ninterest in their company. Congress has steadfastly maintained the ESOP \ndividend deductibility rules for over 15 years in order to encourage \nemployers to establish ESOPs that hold dividend-paying company stock. \nThese rules clearly are intended to provide ESOP participants a broader \nopportunity to share in the company's growth and to ultimately use such \ngrowth to provide retirement assets. Unfortunately, our present rules \nfall short of the mark.\n  This bill fulfills the promise inherent in the original ESOP dividend \ndeduction provision. The ``ESOP Dividend Reinvestment and Participant \nSecurity Act of 1999'' would give employees the ability to retain the \ndividends paid on employer stock in the ESOP and to reinvest these \namounts in the employer stock for continuing growth and accumulation. \nNo employee would then be forced to receive dividends that could \ninstead be used to build retirement savings. And, all employees could \nreceive the benefit of participating in their company's growth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Poultry Products Inspection Act to cover \nbirds\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nof the order Ratitae that are raised for use as human food; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n         poultry products inspection act amendments legislation\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \namend the Poultry Products Inspection Act to include birds of the \nRatitae order, such as ostriches, emus, and rheas, in the mandatory \nUSDA meat inspection program. Currently producers of ratitae \nparticipate in a voluntary inspection program, but costs are borne by \nthe producers and can add as much as $2 per pound to the price of the \nproduct. The USDA currently absorbs the cost of inspection for the more \ntraditional agricultural products, such as turkey, poultry, and beef.\n  I introduce this legislation to encourage agricultural \nentrepreneurship and diversification, and to level the economic playing \nfield for those farmers willing to take innovative risks to bring new \nproducts to American and global consumers. Ratite meat is reported to \nbe high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and byproducts from \nthe animals are being studied by universities and medical labs for \ntheir potential uses. I would also note that farmers engaged in \nproducing ratite meat can now be found all over the country, not just \nin Minnesota.\n  With the increasing focus in our country on food safety, I believe \nthis bill is a small but important step toward both encouraging \ndevelopment of alternative agricultural products and ensuring the \nsafety of the food our citizens consume.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in support of this bill to help \nfamily farms diversify into new products that will provide them with \nnew income sources and give American consumers more variety at the \ngrocery store.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 1134.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide \nthat the lowest unit rate for campaign advertising shall not be \navailable for communication in which a candidate attacks an opponent of \nthe candidate unless the candidate does so in person; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            POLITICAL CANDIDATE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Congressman Walden in the House of Representatives, that would \nfight the scourge of negative political campaigns with the simple yet \npowerful tool of accountability. If candidates choose to run for office \nby disparaging their opponents rather than standing on their own \nrecords and beliefs, they should at least be expected to take \nresponsibility for the ad campaigns that they run. Under this \nlegislation, there would be meaningful financial penalty--in the form \nof higher advertising rates--for those who fail to do so.\n  For me, this bill arises out of unpleasant personal experience. I was \nelected to this body in a special election against the man I am now \nproud to call my friend and colleague, Gordon Smith. That campaign was \nthe nastiest, most negative, least edifying political season that my \nstate has ever been through. The unabashedly negative ads that both of \nour campaigns put on the air were a sour departure from Oregon's \ntradition of responsible, thoughtful politics.\n  I eventually became so disgusted with what my own campaign had \nbecome, that with only a few weeks before the election, I got rid of \nall my ads, destroyed negative mailings that were about to be sent out, \nasked others who were airing negative ads on my behalf to desist, and \nstarted over with a campaign that was 100 percent positive. I didn't \nknow if it would be a smart campaign strategy or a kind of political \nsuicide, and I didn't much care. Win or lose, I wanted to be proud of \nthe way that I had conducted myself.\n  What I learned all too well in that campaign is that negative \npolitics corrupts everything that it touches. It harms not only its \ntarget, but its sponsor as well. Negative ads are one of the biggest \nreasons for the cynicism and even disgust that so many Americans feel \ntoward the political process. They cheapen the very institution of \ndemocracy.\n  There's no way, of course, to mandate a sense of shame or legislate \nan end to negative ads. But in an era when elections are determined \nmore and more by television and radio advertising, it is not too much \nto ask that candidates be held responsible for the statements they make \nin their ads.\n  Under current campaign law, broadcasters are required to give \nqualified candidates for federal office their lowest price for ads, \nwhat is known as the lowest unit broadcast rate. In order to qualify \nfor this rate, candidates must comply with federal campaign finance \nlaws, and include proper disclaimers in the ad, among other \nregulations. The Political Candidate Personal Responsibility Act would \nattach two additional requirements to the discounted ad rate. The first \nrequirement is that for both television and radio advertisements, the \nlowest unit rate will only be available if a candidate, when referring \nto his or her opponent, makes the reference him or her self. Radio \nadvertisements must also contain a statement by the candidate in which \nthe candidate identifies him or herself and the office for which the \nperson is running. The second requirement is that in any television or \nradio ad where a candidate makes reference to his or her opponent, the \ncandidate must appear or be heard for at least 75 percent of the \nbroadcast time. If a candidate chooses to air an advertisement that \ndoes not comply with these requirements, he or she will be ineligible \nto receive the lowest unit rate for a period of 45 days in a primary \nand 60 days in a general election.\n  In other words, if you want the benefits of discounted broadcast \ntime, you can't make disparaging statements that you aren't willing to \nsay yourself. No more hiding behind grainy photographs, ominous music, \nand anonymous announcers.\n  Ultimately, one of our greatest responsibilities as elected officials \nis to encourage greater public participation in all levels of the \npolitical process. Campaign activities should not only represent the \nviews of the candidates, but they should also encourage voters to \nparticipate in the democratic process. The growing negative trend of \ncampaign advertisements degrades the process and discourages people \nfrom becoming involved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Political Candidate Personal \n     Responsibility Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Local broadcasters are currently required to offer the \n     ``lowest unit charge'' for advertising to candidates for all \n     political offices 45 days before a primary election, and 60 \n     days before a general election.\n       (2) The ``lowest unit charge'' requirement represents a \n     federally mandated subsidy for political candidates.\n       (3) Campaigns for Federal office are too frequently \n     dominated by negative and attack-oriented television and \n     radio advertising.\n       (4) The Government should take action to ensure that it \n     does not subsidize negative and attack oriented advertising \n     where the candidate fails to demonstrate personal \n     responsibility for the tenor of the candidate's advertising.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat an organization shall be exempt from income tax if it is created \nby a State to provide property and casualty insurance coverage for \nproperty for which such coverage is otherwise unavailable; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n  exemption from income tax for state created organizations providing \n                    property and casualty insurance\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Graham and I introduce \nlegislation that would help protect Florida from economic devastation \nin the event of a catastrophic windstorm or other peril.\n  Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue \nCode to grant tax-exempt status to the Florida Windstorm Underwriting \nAssociation (FWUA), the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint \nUnderwriting Association (JUA) and similar state-chartered, not-for-\nprofit insurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not \navailable. The FWUA and JUA are non-profit entities established by the \nstate to provide property and casualty insurance coverage in those \nmarkets not adequately served by other insurers.\n  In most years, Florida is not hit by a major hurricane or natural \ncatastrophe. In those years, the FWUA and JUA take in more premiums \nthan are paid out in claims or expenses. Since these entities are not-\nfor-profit, state law prevents those funds from being distributed--they \nare instead literally saved for a severely rainy or windy day. \nNonetheless, the Internal Revenue Code requires 35% of those funds to \nbe sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than used to fund \nreserves. Designating the FWUA and JUA as tax-exempt will help Florida \nto accumulate the necessary reserves to pay claims brought on by a \ncatastrophe. This bill gives the two Florida catastrophe funds the same \ntax-exempt status that is already enjoyed by a number of not-for-profit \ninsurance provers.\n  State law authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property \ninsurance policyholders throughout Florida to pay for losses generated \nby catastrophic storms or other perils. Thus, the benefits of the tax \nexemption would reduce the frequency and severity of assessments levied \nagainst individual policyholders. Greater funds would be available to \ncover losses which otherwise would be paid for by higher assessments on \nFlorida policyholders--cutting taxes for the approximately 5,000,000 \nproperty owners in the state of Florida.\n  This legislation has the bipartisan support of the entire Florida \nCongressional delegation in addition to strong backing from Governor \nJeb Bush, the State Insurance Commissioner, the Florida Senate \nPresident and Florida's House Speaker. And this change in the tax code \nwould result in only a negligible loss of federal tax revenue, \naccording to Joint Tax.\n  Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses \nthroughout the state of Florida, all of whom are subject to assessment \nif reserves are not sufficient to pay claims in the event of a severe \nhurricane or other catastrophe. With hundreds of miles of magnificent \ncoastline, Florida remains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment \nof our legislation permits Florida to prepare for the next Hurricane \nAndrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on \nFlorida property owners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as we prepare for next week's start \nof the 1999 Hurricane Season, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Mack, in introducing legislation that will help protect Florida \nfrom economic devastation in the event of a catastrophic disaster.\n  Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue \nCode to grant tax-exempt status to state chartered, not-for-profit \ninsurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not \navailable. In our state, this legislation will primarily assist the \nFlorida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA) and the Florida \nResidential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (JUA).\n  The Florida Windstorm Association was created in 1970. Twenty-two \nyears later, in 1992, the legislature authorized the Joint Underwriting \nAssociation. These organizations operate as residual market mechanisms. \nThey provide residential property and casualty insurance coverage for \nthose residents who need, but are unable to procure through the \nvoluntary market.\n  The JUA was created in direct response to $16 billion in covered \nlosses during Hurricane Andrew. The destructive force of Andrew \nrendered a number of property insurance companies insolvent. Other \nfirms recovered from the catastrophe by withdrawing from Florida \nmarkets.\n  During those fortunate years when we are not impacted by major \nhurricanes or other natural catastrophes, the FWUA and JUA take in more \npremiums that are paid out in claims and expenses. Florida law prevents \nthose funds from being distributed so that needed reserves will \naccumulate in preparation for inevitable disasters.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service penalizes Florida for \nthis responsible, forward thinking practice. It requires that 35% of \nthose funds be sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than \nused to fund reserves. Designating state chartered, non profit insurers \nas tax-exempt will help Florida accumulate the necessary reserves to \npay claims brought on by a catastrophe.\n  State law also authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property \ninsurance policyholders for losses generated by natural disasters. Tax \nexemptions should reduce the frequency and severity of assessments \nlevied against individual policyholders, because it would make more \nfunds available to cover losses which otherwise would be paid for by \nhigher assessments on policyholders.\n  Mr. President, even seven years later, Hurricane Andrew is still a \nnightmarish memory for Floridians. The 1999 Hurricane season will begin \non June 1, 1999. The National Weather Service expects this hurricane \nseason--which begins next Tuesday, to be another active storm season. \nIt is imperative that the federal government avoids the comfortable \nhabit of ignoring lessons presented by Andrew and other recent \ncatastrophes.\n  This legislation has bipartisan support in the state's Congressional \ndelegation. It is backed by our state governor, our insurance \nCommissioner, our state Senate President and House Speaker.\n  Also, Mr. President, the Joint Committee on Taxation has ruled that \nthis legislation will have a negligible effect on the federal budget.\n  Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses \nthroughout Florida, all whom are subject to assessment if reserves are \nnot sufficient to pay claims in the event of a catastrophe. Florida \nremains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment of this \nlegislation will permit our state to prepare for the next Hurricane \nAndrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on \nFlorida property owners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 1139. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, relating to \ncivil penalties for unruly passengers of air carriers and to provide \nfor the protection of employees providing air safety information, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n  increase of civil penalties on unruly airline passengers legislation\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, years ago, when air travel was in its \ninfancy, the greatest threat to passenger safety was mechanical \nfailure.\n  Over the last half-century, the dedication of the men and women who \nservice our airlines, coupled with advances in technology and know-how, \nhave made air travel the safest method of transportation we have.\n  But it's not always the most convenient way to travel. As air travel \nhas become safer, it has also become more popular--and more crowded.\n  As all of my colleagues in this chamber well know, air travel is an \nincreasingly stressful and chaotic experience, at times trying even the \nmost patient among us.\n  I commend my colleagues for introducing the passenger's bill of \nrights earlier this Congress, which hopefully will alleviate some of \nthe stress of air travel.\n  I rise today to address a different aspect of that stress, and that \nis the safety hazard created to all passengers when a passenger who \ncan't control his behavior or emotions, or simply refuses to do so, \nacts in a way that jeopardizes the safety of the flight.\n  Over the last few years, the number of reported incidents in which \nunruly airline passengers have interfered with flight crews, or even \nphysically assaulted them, has increased dramatically and dangerously.\n  One airline alone reports that the number of incidents caused by \nviolent or unruly passengers more than tripled in only three years--\nfrom 296 cases in 1994 to 921 cases in 1997.\n  In 1996, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed civil penalties \nagainst 121 unruly passengers. In 1997, that number jumped to 195--a \nsixty percent increase in only one year.\n  These incidents represent a serious threat to the safety of both \nflight crews and passengers alike.\n  Today I, along with my colleague Senator Frist, am introducing a bill \nthat addresses this problem.\n  Briefly, my bill will allow the Secretary of Transportation to \nincrease the civil penalty from its current level of $1,100, up to \n$25,000, on any airline passenger who interferes with the duties or \nresponsibilities of the flight crew or cabin crew or takes any action \nthat poses an imminent threat to the safety of the aircraft or other \nindividuals on the aircraft.\n  We need not only to punish passengers who threaten the safety of \ntheir passengers. We also need to give airlines the power to prevent \nparticularly violent or disruptive passengers from committing similar \nacts in the future.\n  When someone drives in an unsafe manner on our roads, local police \nhave the power to fine them. When that someone commits the same \noffenses repeatedly, or drives in a way that is especially dangerous, \nlocal authorities have the power to revoke or suspend their driver's \nlicenses--to take those drivers off the road.\n  I think we need to do something similar with air travelers who commit \nparticularly dangerous acts, or who insist on repeatedly disrupting \nairline flight crews. We need them off of our airlines, so that they do \nnot have the opportunity to jeopardize the lives of other passengers in \nthe future.\n  The bill I am introducing today gives the Secretary of Transportation \nthe authority to raise the civil penalty up to $25,000.\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\n  Second, and most important, my bill would also give the Secretary of \nTransportation the authority to impose a ban of up to one year on all \ncommercial air travel on passengers guilty of such incidents.\n  The bill enforces this ban by making airlines which provides air \ntransportation to a banned traveler liable to the Government for a \ncivil penalty of up to $25,000.\n  Third, this bill would give whistleblower protection to flight \nattendants who report unsafe behavior by co-workers.\n  Fourth, this bill will make the investigation of in-flight incidents \neasier by giving the Attorney General the authority to deputize local \nlaw enforcement officials to investigate incidents when the plane \nlands, wherever it lands.\n  Mr. President, everyone in this body travels extensively by air. \nEvery time we get into an airline, we put our lives in the hands of the \nhardworking men and women who staff our airlines.\n  When we, or any other American, gets on an airplane, we should be \nable to sit back and relax, confident in the knowledge that those men \nand women can perform the jobs they were trained to do without \ninterference by unreasonable or violent passengers.\n  We should also be able to board an airline secure in the knowledge \nthat the man or woman sitting in the seat next to us, doesn't have an \nextensive history of violent or disruptive behavior on airplanes.\n  We should also have the security of knowing that if a passenger does \nchoose to commit a particularly unruly or violent act that threatens \nthe safety of other passengers or the flight crew, that passenger won't \nbe able to get on another airplane tomorrow and do the same thing to \nanother unsuspecting planeload of passengers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.\n  Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the 2-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions for \nreasonable and incidental expenses related to instruction, teaching, or \nother educational job-related activities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             teacher deduction for incidental expenses act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, Senator Coverdell and I are \nintroducing two bills that will help teachers who spend their personal \nfunds in order to improve their teaching skills and to provide quality \nlearning materials for their students. I am going to discuss the first \nof those bills, the Teachers' Professional Development Act.\n  I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from Georgia, Senator \nCoverdell, in presenting this response to the critical need of our \nelementary and secondary schoolteachers for more professional \ndevelopment.\n  Other than involved parents, a well-qualified teacher is the most \nimportant element of student success. Educational researchers have \nrepeatedly demonstrated the close relationship between well-qualified \nteachers and successful students. Moreover, teachers themselves \nunderstand how important professional development is to maintaining and \nexpanding their level of competence. When I meet with Maine teachers, \nthey tell me of their need for more professional development and the \nscarcity of financial support for this worthwhile pursuit.\n  In Maine, we have seen the results of a strong, sustained \nprofessional development program on student achievement in science and \nmath. With support from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, the State of Maine, private foundations, the \nbusiness community, and colleges in our State, the Maine Mathematics \nand Science Alliance established a statewide training program for \nteachers. The results have been outstanding.\n  While American students, overall, performed at the bottom of the \nThird International Science and Mathematics Study, Maine students \noutperformed the students of all but one of the 41 participating \nnations. The professional development available to Maine's science and \nmath teachers undoubtedly played a critical role in this tremendous \nsuccess story. Unfortunately, however, this level of support for \nprofessional development is the exception and not the rule.\n  The willingness of Maine's teachers to fund their own professional \ndevelopment activities has impressed me deeply. For example, an English \nteacher who serves as a member of my Educational Policy Advisory \nCommittee told me of spending her own money to attend a curriculum \nconference. She then came back to her high school and shared the \nresults of this curriculum conference with all the other teachers in \nher English department. She is typical of the many teachers throughout \nthe United States who generously reach within their own pockets to pay \nfor their own professional development to make them even better, even \nmore effective at their jobs.\n  I firmly believe that we should encourage our educators to seek \nprofessional training, and that is the purpose of the legislation I am \nintroducing today. The Collins-Coverdell legislation would help \nteachers to finance professional development by allowing them to deduct \nfrom their taxable income such expenses as conference fees, tuitions, \nbooks, supplies, and transportation associated with qualifying \nprograms. Under the current law, teachers may only deduct these \nexpenses if they exceed 2 percent of their income. My bill would \neliminate this 2 percent floor and allow all of the professional \ndevelopment expenses to be deductible.\n  I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the \nadditional education they need to improve their skills and to serve \ntheir students better. I hope that this legislation will encourage \nteachers to continue to take courses in the subject areas that they \nteach, to complete graduate degrees in either their subject area or in \neducation, and to attend conferences to get new ideas for presenting \ncourse work in a challenging manner. This bill would reimburse our \nteachers for a very small part of what they invest in our children's \nfuture. This would be money well spent.\n  Investing in education is the surest way for us to build one of our \nmost important assets for our country's future, and that is a well-\neducated population. We need to ensure that our nation's elementary and \nsecondary school teachers are the best possible so that they can bring \nout the best in our students. Adopting this legislation would help us \nto accomplish this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these efforts, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in assuring enactment of this legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n        Mack):\n  S. 1125. A bill to restrict the authority of the Federal \nCommunications Commission to review mergers and to impose conditions on \nlicenses and other authorizations assigned or transferred in the course \nof mergers or other transactions subject to review by the Department of \nJustice or the Federal Trade Commission; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n              telecommunications merger review act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce The \nTelecommunications Merger Review Act of 1999, which will make the \ngovernment's review of telecommunications industry mergers more \ncoherent and effective.\n  It seems like hardly a week goes by without the announcement of yet \nanother precedent-setting merger in the telecommunications industry. \nConsumers are right to be concerned about the possible effects of these \nmergers, and the Congress is right to be concerned that government \nreview of these mergers is careful and consistent in keeping consumer \ninterests uppermost.\n  The urgent need for competence and clarity in reviewing telecom \nindustry mergers highlights a glaring problem in the current system. \nThat problem, Mr. President, arises from the fact that different \nagencies sequentially go over the same issues, and, after considerable \ndelay, can make radically different decisions on the same sets of \nfacts.\n  Two of these agencies, the Department of Justice and the Federal \nTrade Commission, have extensive expertise in analyzing the \ncompetition-related issues that are involved in mergers, and they \napproach the merger review process with a great deal of professionalism \nand efficiency. The third agency, the Federal Communications \nCommission, has comparatively little expertise in these issues, and \nonly limited authority under the law.\n  Nevertheless, the FCC has bootstrapped itself into the unintended \nrole of official federal dealbreaker. How? By using its authority to \nimpose conditions on the FCC licenses that are being transferred as \npart and parcel of the overall merger deal. Because the FCC must pre-\napprove all license transfers, its ability to pass on the underlying \nlicenses gives it a chokehold on the parties to the merger. And it uses \nthat chokehold to prolong the process and extract concessions from the \nmerging parties that oftentimes\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nhave very little, if anything, to do with the merger itself.\n  Mr. President, many people might ask, what's so bad about that? Won't \nthe FCC's conditions make sure that consumer interests are served? The \nshort answer is, the FCC is simply duplicating the review and that the \nDepartment of Justice performs with much more competence and \nefficiency. About the best you can say is that the FCC is wasting \nvaluable resources that could more productively be spent elsewhere. But \nthe real harm lies in the fact that the FCC is foisting needless \nburdens and restrictions on the merging companies that translate into \nhigher costs for consumers.\n  The FCC tries to defend its efforts by arguing that its job is really \ndifferent from DOJ's--that DOJ makes sure that a merger won't harm \ncompetition, while the FCC makes sure that the same merger will help \ncompetition. In other words, according to the FCC, DOJ looks at a \nmerger's effect on business; the FCC looks at its effect on people. For \nexample, last week FCC Chairman Kennard gave a speech in which he \nproclaimed that, despite the strain these merger reviews were imposing \non the agency, ``We will not rest until on each transaction we can \narticulate to the American public what are the benefits of this merger \nto average American consumers, because I believe that's what the \npublic-interest review requires.''\n\n  If that's true, I have good news for Chairman Kennard--he can take a \nrest, because DOJ is doing exactly the same thing. In a separate speech \nlast week Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, DOJ's chief merger \nreview official, said that what most people do not understand \n(including, evidently, the FCC), is that ``everything we do in \nantitrust . . . is consumer driven.'' He then went on to say precisely \nwhat that means:\n\n       We are a unique federal agency. Our interest is to protect \n     what the economists call consumer welfare. And there is one \n     simple truth that animates everything we do, and that is \n     competition--the more people chasing after the consumer, to \n     serve him or her better, to get lower prices, to get new \n     innovations, to create new opportunities--the more of that \n     juice that goes through the system, the better.\n\n  To be accurate, there is one big difference between the way the FCC \nand the DOJ do merger reviews: DOJ is infinitely better at it. Two \nweeks ago the FCC's already-faltering merger review process hit rock-\nbottom when a staff member (an ostensible antitrust expert) heading up \nthe FCC's review of the SBC-Ameritech merger (which DOJ has already \napproved) publicly proclaimed that, unless the FCC imposed major \nconditions, the proposed transaction ``flunks the public interest \ntest.'' An ``unnamed agency spokeswoman'' then cheerfully agreed that a \nmajority of the Commissioners shared the same view.\n  Can you imagine either the FTC or DOJ countenancing such happenings \nduring the course of their merger review processes? I think not. This \nappallingly unprofessional behavior by the FCC staff drove the value of \nSBC and Ameritech stock down over $2 billion, and it confirmed that, if \nthis is what passes for FCC merger review ``expertise,'' the FCC has no \nbusiness being in it.\n  Mr. President, this bill will restore integrity and professionalism \nto federal review of telecommunications industry mergers. It does not \ntouch either DOJ's or FTC's broad authority to review all mergers, \nincluding all telecommunications industry mergers. It would make sure \nthat any FCC concerns are heard by incorporating the FCC into DOJ and \nFTC merger review proceedings. Nor does it touch the FCC's broad \nauthority to adopt and enforce rules to govern the behavior of \ntelecommunications companies. What it does do is tell the FCC that, in \ncases where either DOJ or FTC has reviewed a proposed \ntelecommunications merger and stated in writing no intent to intervene, \nthe FCC must follow the determination of these expert agencies and \ntransfer any FCC licenses without further delay.\n  Under this bill the FCC may independently review proposed mergers \nwhen neither DOJ nor FTC states in writing its intent not to intervene. \nNevertheless, because DOJ and FTC review all mergers and have authority \nto intervene in any merger, their nonintervention is any proposed \nmerger appropriately signifies that they find the transaction at issue \nis unobjectionable. Therefore, any FCC review in such cases is subject \nto a strict 60-day deadline, and the FCC is directed to presume \napproval without attaching further conditions or obligations on any of \nthe parties. Nothing (except extreme unlikelihood) would preclude the \nFCC from rebutting the presumption with hard facts, nor would the FCC \nbe precluded from subsequently exercising its existing enforcement and \nrulemaking prerogatives to deal with any unanticipated problems.\n\n  Mr. President, we can streamline the way the federal government \nreviews telecom industry mergers and still safeguard the public \ninterest. That's what this bill is intended to do by eliminating \nbureaucratic mismanagement while preserving essential federal review \nand enforcement prerogatives. I urge my colleagues to give it careful \nconsideration and support.\n  This bill, the Telecom Merger Review Act of 1999, would do nothing to \nchange the authority that the Department of Justice and the Federal \nTrade Commission currently have to review all telecom industry mergers.\n  Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications Merger \n     Review Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A stated intent of the Congress in enacting the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to reduce regulation.\n       (2) Under existing law, the Department of Justice and the \n     Federal Trade Commission exercise primary authority to review \n     all mergers, including telecommunications industry mergers. \n     The Federal Communications Commission has only limited \n     authority under the Clayton Act to review telecommunications \n     industry mergers.\n       (3) The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \n     Commission have extensive expertise in analyzing issues of \n     industry concentration and its effects on competition. The \n     Federal Communications Commission has only limited expertise \n     in analyzing such issues.\n       (4) Notwithstanding the limitations on its Clayton Act \n     jurisdiction and on its substantive expertise, the Federal \n     Communications Commission exercises broad authority over \n     telecommunications industry mergers pursuant to the \n     nonspecific public interest standard and other provisions in \n     the Communications Act of 1934 that allow it to impose terms \n     and conditions on the assignment and transfer of licenses and \n     other authorizations.\n       (5) The Federal Communications Commission's exercise of \n     broad authority over telecommunications industry mergers \n     overreaches its intended statutory authority and its \n     substantive expertise and produces delay and inconsistency in \n     its decisions.\n       (6) Under existing law, parties to a proposed \n     telecommunications industry merger are unable to proceed \n     without the prior approval of the Federal Communications \n     Commission, even if the Department of Justice or the Federal \n     Trade Commission have already approved the merger.\n       (7) The Federal Communications Commission's existing \n     rulemaking and enforcement prerogatives constitute normal and \n     effective means of assuring that all licensees, including \n     parties to a telecommunications industry merger, operate in \n     the public interest.\n       (8) The primary jurisdiction and preeminent expertise of \n     the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on \n     all matters involving industry concentration and its effects \n     on competition, combined with the Federal Communications \n     Commission's existing rulemaking and enforcement \n     prerogatives, make the exercise of separate \n     telecommunications industry merger approval authority by the \n     Federal Communications Commission unnecessary.\n       (9) Because the duplication of effort, inconsistency, and \n     delay resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's \n     review of telecommunications industry mergers is unnecessary, \n     it imposes unwarranted costs on the industry, on the \n     Commission, and on the public, and it fails to serve the \n     public interest.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPEAL OF MERGER APPROVAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 11(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 21(a)) is \n     amended by striking ``in the Federal Communications \n     Commission where applicable to common carriers engaged in \n     wire or radio communication or radio transmission of \n     energy;''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Costmetic Act to \nimprove the safety of imported food, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              Imported food safety improvement act of 1999\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Imported \nFood Safety Act of 1999.'' I am proud to be the sponsor of this \nimportant legislation which guarantees the improved safety of imported \nfoods.\n  The health of Americans is not something to take chances with. It is \nimportant that we make food safety a top priority. Every person should \nhave the confidence that their food is fit to eat. We should be \nconfident that imported food is as safe as food produced in this \ncountry. Cars can't be imported unless they meet U.S. safety \nrequirements. Prescription drugs can't be imported unless they meet FDA \nstandards. You shouldn't be able to import food that isn't up to U.S. \nstandards, either.\n  We import increasing quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, \nseafood, and many other foods. In the past seven years, the amount of \nfood imported into the U.S. has more than doubled. Out of all the \nproduce we eat, 40% of it is imported. Our food supply has gone global, \nso we need to have global food safety.\n  The impact of unsafe food is staggering. There have been several \nfrightening examples of food poisoning incidents in the U.S. When \nMichigan schoolchildren were contaminated with Hepatitis A from \nimported strawberries in 1997, Americans were put on alert. Thousands \nof cases of cyclospora infection from imported raspberries--resulting \nin severe, prolonged diarrhea, weight loss, vomiting, chills and \nfatigue were also reported that year. Imported cantaloupe eaten in \nMaryland sickened 25 people. As much as $663 million was spent on food \nborne illness in Maryland alone. Overall, as many as 33 million people \nper year become ill and over 9000 die as a result of food borne \nillness. It is our children and our seniors who suffer the most. Most \nof the food-related deaths occur in these two populations.\n  These incidents have scared us and have jump-started the efforts to \ndo more to protect our nation's food supply. Now, I believe in free \ntrade, but I also believe in fair trade. FDA's current system of \ntesting import samples at ports of entry does not protect Americans. It \nis ineffective and resource-intensive. Less than 2% of imported food is \nbeing inspected under the current system. At the same time, the \nquantity of the imported foods continues to increase.\n  What this law does is simple: It improves food safety and aims at \npreventing food borne illness of all imported foods regulated by the \nFDA. This bill takes a long overdue, big first step.\n  First, it requires that FDA make equivalence determinations on \nimported food. This was developed with the FDA by Senator Kennedy and \nmyself in consultation with the consumer groups.\n  Today, FDA has no authority to protect Americans against imported \nfood that is unsafe until it is too late. Last year, the GAO found that \nFDA lacks the authority to require that food coming into the U.S. is \nproduced, prepared, packed or held under conditions that provide the \nsame level of food safety protection as those in the U.S. This means \nthat currently, food offered for import to the U.S., can be imported \nunder any conditions, even if those conditions are unsanitary. The \nImported Food Safety Act of 1999, will allow FDA to look at the \nproduction at its source. This means that FDA will be able to take \npreventive measures. FDA will be able to be proactive, rather than just \nreactive.\n  That means that when you pack your childrens' lunches for school or \nsit down at the dinner table, you can rest assured that your food will \nbe safe. Whether your strawberries were grown in a foreign country or \non the Eastern Shore, in Maryland, those strawberries will be held to \nthe same standard. You won't have to worry or wonder where your food is \ncoming from. You won't have to worry that your children or families are \ngoing to get sick. You will know that the food coming into this country \nwill be subject to equivalent standards.\n  Secondly, this bill contains strong enforcement measures. Last year, \nthe\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, under the leadership of \nSenator Sue Collins, held numerous hearings on the safety of imported \nfood. These enforcement measures are largely a product of those facts \nuncovered during those hearings. Senator Collins developed these \nenforcement provisions and introduced a bill which focuses on \nenforcement. I refer those with special interest in enforcement to also \nconsider her bill.\n  Finally, this bill covers emergency situations by allowing FDA to ban \nimported food that has been connected to outbreaks of food borne \nillness. When our children, parents and communities are getting \nseriously sick, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can \nimmediately issue an emergency ban. We don't have to wait till someone \nelse gets seriously sick or dies. We no longer have to go through the \ncurrent bureaucratic mechanism that is inefficient and resource \nintensive. We can stop the food today, to protect our citizens.\n  My goal is to strengthen the food supply, whatever the source of the \nfood may be. This bill won't create trade barriers. It just calls for \nfree trade of safe food. It calls for international concern and \nconsensus on guaranteeing standards for public health.\n  This bill is important because it will save lives and makes for a \nsafer world. Everyone should have security in knowing that the food \nthey eat is fit to eat. I'd like to thank FDA for their advice and \nconsultation in developing this legislation. I also want to thank the \nConsumer Federation of America for their insight and recommendations.\n  I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to enact this \nlegislation. I pledge my commitment to fight for ways to make America's \nfood supply safer. This bill is an important step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Ms. \nCarol Tucker Foreman, Distinguished Fellow and Director of the Food \nPolicy Institute, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Carol Tucker Foreman, Distinguished Fellow and Director of \n                       the Food Policy Institute\n\n       I am here today on behalf of the Consumer Federation of \n     America and the National Consumers' League to endorse the \n     Imported Food Safety Act of 1999. I thank Senators Mikulski, \n     Kennedy and Durbin and Congresswoman Eshoo for introducing \n     this very important legislation.\n       It will improve the Food and Drug Administration's capacity \n     to protect American consumers from food-borne illness caused \n     by adulterated imported food.\n       Food-borne illness is a serious public health problem in \n     the U.S. Food poisoning kills 9,000 Americans each year and \n     causes as many as 33 million illnesses. It costs us at least \n     $5 billion each year in medical costs and time lost from \n     work. The human toll is incalculable.\n       Americans eat from a global plate. We want a wide variety \n     of foods available on a year round basis. Health experts urge \n     us to eat more fruits and vegetables. Imports make fresh \n     fruits available to us even in the middle of February.\n       But no one wants imported foods served with a side helping \n     of food poisoning. We want all our food, domestic and \n     imported, to be safe.\n       We have not had that assurance. In recent years there have \n     been a number of incidents of food-borne illness arising from \n     imported food products. Last year, the Senate Permanent \n     Subcommittee on Investigations revealed serious problems with \n     the Food and Drug Administration's capacity to protect \n     Americans from unsafe food.\n       The General Accounting Office reported that FDA can't \n     protect us because the agency has no authority to require \n     that foods coming into the United States be produced and \n     packaged under circumstances that provide the same level of \n     health protection required for domestic food producers and \n     processors.\n       Most American consumers, and frankly most food producers \n     and processors as well, would be shocked to learn that \n     imported food is not required to be produced in a manner that \n     provides the same level of health protection as domestic \n     products and that FDA has no authority to check, in advance, \n     for adequate public health safeguards. FDA can act only after \n     the fact--after adulterated food has been found or someone \n     has gotten sick.\n       The USDA inspects meat, poultry and egg products. GAO noted \n     that USDA has the necessary power to protect consumers. The \n     Department has the authority to require that meat and poultry \n     produced abroad and imported into the U.S. be produced in a \n     system that provides a level of health protection equivalent \n     to that imposed on U.S. producers. That level of protection \n     may include limits on bacteria that cause human illness. In \n     addition, USDA has federally sworn inspectors who examine the \n     foreign systems and check food at the docks.\n       The Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over all \n     other food products, including the fresh fruits and \n     vegetables that are so susceptible to contamination. FDA has \n     no similar authority, no inspectors who visit foreign plants \n     and virtually no inspectors to check food at the docks. Last \n     year, FDA checked only two percent of the food imported into \n     the U.S. In fact, FDA has established only a limited number \n     of performance standards for domestically produced foods.\n       That point bears repeating. If you eat meat and poultry \n     produced in another country and imported into the U.S., you \n     can do so knowing they were produced under circumstances at \n     least as clean and sanitary as meat, poultry and eggs \n     produced in the U.S. If you consume fresh fruits and \n     vegetables produced in another country, you have no such \n     assurance, even though you will cook your meat, poultry and \n     eggs but may well eat the fruits and vegetables raw, \n     increasing the chance that you will consume disease causing \n     bacteria.\n       In a recent study, the Center for Science in the Public \n     Interest surveyed 225 food-borne illness outbreaks that \n     occurred between 1990 and 1998. Foods regulated by the FDA \n     caused over twice as many outbreaks as foods regulated by the \n     USDA. Fruits, vegetables and salads caused 48 outbreaks. \n     Seafood, both finfish and shellfish, caused 32 outbreaks.\n       USDA's more rigorous system of inspection has certainly not \n     stopped foreign produced meat products from entering the \n     country. We import hundreds of millions of pounds of meat \n     each year from Australia, to Argentina and Denmark and a host \n     of other countries. Neither foreign nor domestic producers \n     have suffered any loss of trade.\n       The Imported Food Safety Act sets up a system for the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to use in establishing \n     equivalency; gives FDA more authority to visit other \n     countries; provides important enforcement authority and \n     controls over imported foods; prohibits port shopping and \n     increases penalties for importing contaminated foods and \n     authorizes new funding for FDA to carry out these functions.\n       Americans do care about food safety. The Food Marketing \n     Institute, the nation's super market trade association, \n     recently released its annual survey of trends among super \n     market shoppers. Ninety percent of those surveyed said food \n     safety was very important or somewhat important to them in \n     making food selections. The Imported Food Safety Act will \n     increase assurance among consumers that the food supply is \n     safe.\n       The Imported Food Safety Act is an important part of a \n     package of food safety legislation which Congress should \n     address this year. Other parts of the package include \n     legislation to promote the use of specific microbial \n     standards for both domestic and foreign produce, introduced \n     by Senator Harkin; require registration of importers, \n     introduced by Senator Dorgan. Congress should act now before \n     confidence is diminished.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor of this \nimportant bill, and I commend Senator Mikulski for her leadership on \nthis legislation to close the critical gaps in our imported food safety \nlaws.\n  Citizens deserve to know that the food they eat is safe and \nwholesome, regardless of its source. The United States has one of the \nsafest food supplies in the world. Yet every year, millions of \nAmericans become sick, and thousands die, from eating contaminated \nfood. Billions of dollars a year in medical costs and lost productivity \nare caused by food-borne illnesses. Often, the source of the problem is \nimported food.\n  We've heard recently about the thousands of cases of illness from \nCyclospora in raspberries from Guatemala. But this high profile case is \nby no means the only case.\n  In 1997, school children in five states contracted Hepatitis A from \nfrozen strawberries served in the school cafeterias. Fecal \ncontamination is a potential source of Hepatitis A, and the \nstrawberries the children ate came from a farm in Mexico where workers \nhad little access to sanitary facilities.\n  Earlier this year, cases of typhoid fever in Florida were linked to a \nfrozen tropical fruit product from Guatemala. Again, poor sanitary \nconditions appear to be at the root of the problem.\n  Gastrointestinal illness has been linked to soft cheeses from Europe. \nBacterial food poisoning has been attributed to canned mushrooms from \nthe Far East.\n  The emergence of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and an increase \nin the number of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics, make \nmicrobial contamination of food a major public health challenge.\n  Ensuring the safety of imported food is a huge task. Americans now \nenjoy a wide variety of foods from around the world and have access to \nfresh fruits\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nand vegetables year round. In 1997, the Food Safety Inspection Service \nof the Department of Agriculture handled 118,000 entries of imported \nmeat and poultry. The FDA handled far more-- 2.7 million entries of \nother imported food. Current FDA procedures and resources allowed for \nless than two percent of those 2.7 million imports to be physically \ninspected. Clearly, we need to do better.\n  The authority of the FDA is not sufficient to prevent contaminated \nfood imports from reaching our shores. The Agency has no legal \nauthority to require that food imported into the United States is \nprepared, packed and stored under conditions that provide the same \nlevel of public health protection as similar food produced in the U.S. \nUnder current procedures, the FDA takes random samples of imports as \nthey arrive at the border. The imports often continue on their way to \nstores in all parts of the country while testing is being done, and it \nis often difficult to recall the food if a problem is found. \nUnscrupulous importers make the most of the loopholes in the law, \nincluding substituting cargo, falsifying laboratory results, and \nattempting to bring a refused shipment in again, at a later date or at \na different port.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will give the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services the additional authority needed to assure \nthat food imports are as safe as food grown and prepared in this \ncountry.\n  It will give the FDA greater authority to deal with outbreaks of \nfood-borne illness and to bar further imports of dangerous foods until \nimprovements at the source can guarantee the safety of future \nshipments. This authority covers foods that have repeatedly been \nassociated with food-borne disease, have repeatedly been found to be \nadulterated, or have been linked to a catastrophic outbreak of food-\nborne illness.\n  It will close loopholes in the law and give the FDA better tools to \ndeal with unscrupulous importers.\n  It will authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \ntarget resources toward enhanced surveillance and prevention activities \nto deal with food-borne illnesses, including new diagnostic tests, \nbetter training of health professionals, and increased public awareness \nabout food safety.\n  Too many citizens today are at unnecessary risk of food-borne \nillness. The measure we are proposing is designed to reduce that risk \nas much as possible, both immediately and for the long term. We know \nthat there are powerful special interests that put profits ahead of \nsafety, but Americans need and deserve laws that better protect their \nfood supply. This is essential legislation, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see that it is enacted as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Gramm):\n  S. 1128. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe Federal estate and gift taxes and the tax on generation-skipping \ntransfers, to provide for a carryover basis at death, and to establish \na partial capital gains exclusion for inherited assets; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   estate tax elimination act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators Bob \nKerrey, Don Nickles, John Breaux, sConnie Mack, Chuck Robb, and Phil \nGramm to introduce a bill that attempts to forge bipartisan consensus \nwith regard to the future of the federal estate tax. The legislation we \nare offering today is titled the Estate Tax Elimination Act of 1999.\n\n  Mr. President, we know that many Americans are troubled by the estate \ntax's complexity and high rates, and by the mere fact that it is \ntriggered by a person's death rather than the realization of income. \nFor a long time, I have advocated its repeal, because I believe death \nshould not be a taxable event.\n  Other people agree that the tax is problematic, but are concerned the \nappreciated value of certain assets might escape taxation forever if \nthe estate tax is repealed while the step-up in basis allowed under \nSection 1014 of the Internal Revenue Code remains in effect.\n  The legislation we are introducing today attempts to reconcile these \npositions by eliminating both the estate tax and the step-up, and \nattributing a carryover basis to inherited property so that all gains \nare taxed at the time the property is sold and income is realized. This \nis an explicit trade-off: estate-tax repeal for implementation of a \ncarryover basis. Both must occur, or this plan will not work.\n  The concept of a carryover basis is not new. It exists in current law \nwith respect to gifts, Section 1015 of the Internal Revenue Code, and \nproperty transferred in cases of divorce, Section 1041, and in \nconnection with involuntary conversions of property relating to theft, \ndestruction, seizure, requisition, or condemnation.\n  In the latter case, when an owner receives compensation for \ninvoluntarily converted property, a taxable gain normally results to \nthe extent that the value of the compensation exceeds the basis of the \nconverted property. However, Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code \nallows the taxpayer to defer the recognition of the gain until the \nproperty is sold. The Kyl-Kerrey bill would treat the transfer of \nproperty at death--perhaps the most involuntary conversion of all--the \nsame way, deferring recognition of any gain until the inherited \nproperty is sold.\n  Our bill would also establish a limited capital-gains exclusion for \ninherited property to ensure that small estates, which are currently \nexempt from tax by virtue of the unified credit and the step-up in \nbasis, do not find themselves with a new tax liability when the \nproposed law takes effect.\n  Mr. President, I have asked the Joint Tax Committee to review the \nproposal and provide an official revenue estimate. We are awaiting the \nresults of that review now.\n  I hope the members of the Finance Committee will take a serious and \ncareful look at this bipartisan proposal. With it, we ought to be able \nto finally eliminate the estate tax--and do it this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nanalysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   S. __, the Estate Tax Elimination Act Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       Designates the bill, the ``Estate Tax Elimination Act of \n     1999.''\n     Section 2. Repeal of certain Federal transfer taxes\n       Repeals Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), thus \n     eliminating the federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping \n     transfer taxes as of the date of enactment.\n     Section 3. Termination of a step-up in basis at death\n       Amends IRC Section 1014 to eliminate the step-up in basis \n     at death with respect to property acquired from a decedent \n     dying after the date of enactment. The basis for such \n     property is to be determined pursuant a new IRC Section 1022 \n     (section 4 of the bill).\n     Section 4. Carryover basis at death\n       Establishes a new IRC Section 1022 to provide for carryover \n     basis for certain property acquired from a decedent.\n       (a) If property is classified as carryover basis property, \n     its new basis in the hands of the acquiring person will be \n     its initial basis, increased by its allowable share of the \n     decedent's exclusion allowance determined under (c) below.\n       (b) Carryover basis property means property which has been \n     acquired from a decedent who died after the date of \n     enactment, and which is not any of the following:\n\n       (1) Property acquired from the decedent and sold, \n     exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by the acquiring person \n     before the decedent's death;\n       (2) An item of income in respect of a decedent;\n       (3) Life-insurance proceeds under IRC Section 2042;\n       (4) Foreign personal holding company stock as described in \n     IRC Section 1014(b)(5); or\n       (5) Property transferred to a surviving spouse, the value \n     of which would have been deductible from the value of the \n     taxable estate of the decedent under IRC Section 2056.\n       (6) Tangible personal property (e.g., household effects) \n     valued at $50,000 or less which was a capital asset in the \n     hands of the decedent and for which the executor has made an \n     election on a required information return.\n       (c) The decedent's general exclusion allowance is equal to \n     the lesser of:\n       (1) an applicable amount for the year of the decedent's \n     death as follows:\n         $650,000 in 1999\n         $675,000 in 2000 and 2001\n         $700,000 in 2002 and 2003\n         $850,000 in 2004\n         $950,000 in 2005\n         $1 million in 2006 and thereafter.\n     or the aggregate net appreciation (fair market value, less \n     initial basis) of all carryover basis property.\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\n       Except that, if the decedent had a deceased spouse whose \n     own exclusion allowance was less than the applicable amount \n     for that spouse, the decedent's applicable amount will be \n     increased by the unallocated portion of the deceased spouse's \n     applicable amount.\n       (2) As per current law, family-owned businesses and farms \n     would be eligible for an additional exclusion, which combined \n     with the general exclusion allowance could total up to $1.3 \n     million.\n       (3) The executor will allocate the exclusion-allowance \n     amount to the carryover basis property on a required \n     information return. Any allocation may be changed at any time \n     up to the 30th day after the initial-basis finality date, \n     which means the last day on which the initial basis of \n     property may be changed in an administrative or judicial \n     proceeding under new IRC Section 7480. The basis adjustment \n     for any property shall not exceed the net appreciation in \n     such property and may not increase the basis of such property \n     above its fair market value.\n       In the case of any carryover basis property which was a \n     personal or household effect, the basis of such property in \n     the hands of the acquiring person shall not exceed its fair \n     market value for purposes of determining loss.\n       A nonresident, not a citizen of the United States, is \n     ineligible for a basis adjustment based upon a decedent's \n     exclusion allowance.\n       (d) Establishes a new IRC Section 7480 to provide \n     procedures for receiving a binding determination of the \n     initial basis of carryover basis property.\n       (e) Establishes a new IRC Section 6039H to require an \n     executor to file an information return providing all of the \n     necessary information with respect to carryover basis \n     property. An executor is required to furnish, in writing, the \n     adjusted basis of such item to each person acquiring an item \n     or carryover basis property from a decedent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1129. A bill to facilitate the acquisition of inholdings in \nFederal land management units and the disposal of surplus public land, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n               federal land transaction facilitation act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Land \nTransaction Facilitation Act, which addresses longstanding problems \nencountered by Federal land managers first, in disposing of surplus \nfederal property, and secondly, in acquiring private inholdings within \nfederally designated areas. This legislation builds on existing laws \nand provides resources dedicated to the consolidation of federal agency \nland holdings.\n  I first introduced this bill prior to the end of the 105th Congress, \nas Title II to the Valles Caldera Preservation Act. This portion of \nthat legislation was independent of the proposed acquisition of land in \nNew Mexico, and perhaps more important. Again this year, Congress will \ncommit large sums of federal taxpayer dollars to purchase new property. \nBefore we do, however, it seems prudent to provide a framework for the \norderly disposal of unneeded federal property that also commits \nresources to meet our current obligations to those who hold land \nsurrounded by federal property.\n  Currently, one-third of the land area in New Mexico is owned by the \nFederal government. On average, across the eleven Western States, the \nFederal government owns approximately one half of the land. I agree \nthat this public land is an important natural resource that requires \nour most thoughtful consideration in the way it is managed and used by \nthe public.\n  To best conserve our existing national treasures for future use and \nenjoyment, we must devise, with the concurrence of other members of \nCongress and the President, a definite plan and timetable to dispose of \nsurplus land through sale or exchange into private, or State and local \ngovernment ownership.\n  The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act provides for the \norderly disposition of unneeded Federal property on a state by state \nbasis. It also addresses the problem of what are known as \n``inholdings'' within federally managed areas. These interrelated \nproblems give rise to an interrelated solution proposed in this \nlegislation.\n  There are currently more than 45 million acres of privately owned \nland trapped within the boundaries of Federal land management units, \nincluding national parks, national forests, national monuments, \nnational wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. In many cases, the \nlocation of these tracts, referred to as inholdings, makes the exercise \nof private property rights difficult for the land owner. In addition, \nmanagement of the public land is made more cumbersome for the Federal \nmanagers.\n  There are also cases where inholders have been waiting generations \nfor the federal government to set aside funding and prioritize the \nacquisition of their property. With rapidly growing public demand for \nthe use of public land, it is increasingly difficult for federal \nmanagers to address problems created by inholdings in many areas.\n  This legislation directs the Department of the Interior to identify \ninholdings existing within Federal land management units that \nlandowners that have indicated a desire to sell to the Federal \ngovernment. Inholdings will only be considered for acquisition by the \nSecretary of Interior if, after public notice, landowners indicate \ntheir willingness to sell. The Secretary will then establish a priority \nfor their acquisition considering, among other factors, those which \nhave existed as inholdings for the longest time.\n  Additionally, this legislation authorizes the use of the proceeds \ngenerated from sale of land no longer needed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM) to purchase these inholdings from willing sellers. \nThis will enhance the ability of the Federal land management agencies \nto work cooperatively with private land owners, and with State and \nlocal governments, to consolidate the ownership of public and private \nland in a manner that would allow for better overall resource \nmanagement.\n  There is an abundance of public domain land that the BLM has \ndetermined it no longer needs to fulfil its mission. Under the Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), the BLM has identified \nan estimated four to six million acres of public domain land for \ndisposal, with public input and consultation with State and local \ngovernments as required by law.\n  Let me state this very clearly--the BLM already has authority under \nan existing law, FLPMA, to exchange or sell land out of Federal \nownership. Through its public process for land use planning, when the \nagency has determined that certain land would be more useful to the \npublic under private or local governmental control, it is already \nauthorized to dispose of this land, either by sale or exchange. This \nlegislation maintains every aspect of existing law. It also provides an \norderly process, and sufficient resources, for the BLM to exercise it.\n  The sale or exchange of land which I have often referred to as \n``surplus,'' would be beneficial to local communities, adjoining land \nowners, and BLM land mangers, alike. First, it would allow for the \nreconfiguration of land ownership patterns to better facilitate \nresource management. Second, it would contribute to administrative \nefficiency within federal land management units, by allowing for better \nallocation of fiscal and human resources within the agency. Finally, in \ncertain locations, the sale of public land which has been identified \nfor disposal is the best way for the public to realize a fair value for \nthis land.\n  The problem is that an orderly process for the efficient disposition \nof lands identified for disposal does not currently exist. This \nlegislation corrects that problem by directing the BLM to fulfil all \nlegal requirements for the transfer of land out of Federal ownership, \nand providing a dedicated source of funding generated from the sale of \nthis land to continue this process.\n  I want to make it clear that this program will in no way detract from \nother programs with similar purposes. The bill clearly states that \nproceeds generated from the disposal of public land, and dedicated to \nthe acquisition of inholdings, will supplement, and not replace, funds \nappropriated for that purpose through the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. In addition, the bill states that the BLM should rely on non-\nFederal entities to conduct appraisals and other research required for \nthe sale or exchange of this land, allowing for the least disruption of \nexisting land and resource management programs.\n  This bill has been a long time in the making. For over a year, now, I \nhave been working with and talking to knowledgeable people, both inside \nand outside of the current administration, to develop many of the ideas \nembodied in this bill. Prior to adjournment of the 105th Congress, my \nstaff and I worked closely with the administration on this legislation. \nI have since received additional comments from the\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\nInterior Department, and have included many of their suggestions into \nthis bill.\n  I feel comfortable in stating that by working together, we have \nreached agreement in principle on the best way to proceed with these \nvery important issues involving the management of public land \nresources, namely, the disposition of surplus public land in \ncombination with a program to address problems associated with \ninholdings within our Federal land management units.\n  I look forward to hearings on this matter, and anticipate that most \nof my fellow Senators will agree that Federal Land Transaction \nFacilitation Act logically addresses this management issue. I believe \nthat in the end, we will be able to stand together and tell the \nAmerican people that we truly have accomplished a great and innovative \nthing with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Land Transaction \n     Facilitation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.) to sell land identified for disposal under its \n     land use planning;\n       (2) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under that \n     Act to exchange Federal land for non-Federal land if the \n     exchange would be in the public interest;\n       (3) through land use planning under that Act, the Bureau of \n     Land Management has identified certain tracts of public land \n     for disposal;\n       (4) the land management agencies of the Department of the \n     Interior have authority under existing law to acquire land \n     consistent with land use plans and the mission of each \n     agency;\n       (5) the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal \n     and the acquisition of certain non-Federal land from willing \n     landowners would--\n       (A) allow for the reconfiguration of land ownership \n     patterns to better facilitate resource management;\n       (B) contribute to administrative efficiency within Federal \n     land management units; and\n       (C) allow for increased effectiveness of the allocation of \n     fiscal and human resources within the Federal land management \n     agencies;\n       (6) a more expeditious process for disposal and acquisition \n     of land, established to facilitate a more effective \n     configuration of land ownership patterns, would benefit the \n     public interest;\n       (7) many private individuals own land within the boundaries \n     of Federal land management units and desire to sell the land \n     to the Federal Government;\n       (8) such land lies within national parks, national \n     monuments, national wildlife refuges, and other areas \n     designated for special management;\n       (9) Federal land management agencies are facing increased \n     workloads from rapidly growing public demand for the use of \n     public land, making it difficult for Federal managers to \n     address problems created by the existence of inholdings in \n     many areas;\n       (10) in many cases, inholders and the Federal Government \n     would mutually benefit from Federal acquisition of the land \n     on a priority basis;\n       (11) proceeds generated from the disposal of public land \n     may be properly dedicated to the acquisition of inholdings \n     and other land that will improve the resource management \n     ability of the Bureau of Land Management and adjoining \n     landowners;\n       (12) using proceeds generated from the disposal of public \n     land to purchase inholdings and other such land from willing \n     sellers would enhance the ability of the Federal land \n     management agencies to--\n       (A) work cooperatively with private landowners and State \n     and local governments; and\n       (B) promote consolidation of the ownership of public and \n     private land in a manner that would allow for better overall \n     resource management;\n       (13) in certain locations, the sale of public land that has \n     been identified for disposal is the best way for the public \n     to receive fair market value for the land; and\n       (14) to allow for the least disruption of existing land and \n     resource management programs, the Bureau of Land Management \n     may use non-Federal entities to prepare appraisal documents \n     for agency review and approval consistent with applicable \n     provisions of the Uniform Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisition.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, with respect \nto liability of motor vehicle rental or leasing companies for the \nnegligent operation of rented or leased motor vehicles; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               motor vehicle rental fairness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Motor Vehicle \nRental Fairness Act of 1999. The measure is short, simple and \nimportant. It will assure that companies who rent or lease motor \nvehicles are not held liable for accidents caused by their customers \nwhen there is no way the companies could prevent these accidents.\n  Normally under our system of jurisprudence, defendants in lawsuits \nare held liable based upon their action or inaction. Unfortunately, a \nsmall number of states ignore this general principle. This minority of \nstates subject rental and leasing companies to unlimited liability for \naccidents caused by their customers that involve the company's \nvehicles--despite the fact that the company was not at fault. This type \nof vicarious liability, liability without fault, holds these companies \nliable even when they have not been negligent in any way and the \nvehicle operated perfectly.\n  The measure I am introducing prevents states from holding companies \nliable for accidents based solely upon their ownership of the vehicles. \nThe bill makes clear that rental companies would still be liable if the \nvehicle did not operate properly. It makes clear that companies are not \nexcused from meeting state minimum insurance requirements on their \nmotor vehicles. Minimum insurance requirements ensure that people \ninvolved in accidents with vehicles owned by rental companies have \nrecourse to recover some damages.\n  The reason most often cited for imposing vicarious liability is to \nensure that an innocent third party can recover damages in an accident. \nUnfortunately, this quest for a financially responsible defendant has \nlead to absurd results. If a vehicle is purchased from a bank or \nfinance company, then there is no vicarious liability. However, if that \nsame vehicle is leased, vicarious liability applies.\n  This problem attracted my attention because of the impact the \npolicies of a small number of states have on interstate commerce. \nSettlements and judgments from vicarious liability claims against \nrental companies cost the industry over $100 million annually. And let \nme be clear, it is the consumer who is paying this cost.\n  For these reasons, this bill and the reforms it implements are long \noverdue. Everyone, companies and individuals alike should be held \nliable only for harm they caused or could have prevented. The only way \nthese companies can prevent this harm would be to go out of business. \nThis is an absurd expectation that will be remedied by this bill.\n  I look forward to hearings on this matter and working with my \ncolleagues to ensure its passage. I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1130\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Motor Vehicle Rental \n     Fairness Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDING.\n\n       The Congress finds that the vicarious liability laws, the \n     ultimate insurer laws, and the common law in a small minority \n     of States--\n       (1) impose a disproportionate and undue burden on \n     interstate commerce by increasing rental rates for motor \n     vehicle rental and leasing customers throughout the United \n     States; and\n       (2) pose a significant competitive barrier to entry for \n     smaller motor vehicle rental and leasing companies attempting \n     to compete in these markets,\n\n     in contravention of a fundamental principle of fairness that \n     there should be no liability in the absence of fault.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part C of subtitle VI of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\n    ``CHAPTER 333.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Section 33301 of title 49, United States Code, as added by \n     section 3 of this Act, applies to any civil action commenced \n     on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation being introduced by the distinguished Chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee--the senior Senator from Arizona. I strongly \nsupport the reforms to state vicarious liability laws contained in the \n``Motor Vehicle Rental Fairness Act of 1999'' and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important bill and move it swiftly towards enactment.\n  I commend the chairman for taking the lead on this important \nlegislation. His bill, of which I am proud to be an original co-\nsponsor, seeks to put a halt to an absurd aberration in our legal \nsystem. Under the vicarious liability laws of a very small number of \nstates, companies that rent or lease motor vehicles are held strictly \nliable if their renters or lessees are negligent and cause an accident. \nThe company does not have to be negligent in any way. The vehicle may \noperate perfectly and be maintained properly. These states simply hold \nthe company liable because of their ownership of the vehicle.\n  The only way for these companies to avoid this liability would be to \nstop renting or leasing these vehicles. This is not an acceptable \nresolution to this problem. The American justice system should be based \non the general principle that a defendant should be held liable only \nfor harm he or she could prevent--not merely because the defendant has \na ``deep pocket.''\n  Vicarious liability laws undermine competition in these states and \nhave driven smaller rental and leasing companies out of business. In \nfact, vicarious liability acts as a tax on all rental and leasing \ncompanies--and their customers--nationwide because these companies must \ntry to recover their losses from vicarious claims through rental rates \nnationwide.\n  It is time to put a stop to this legal disconnect. Hold these \ncompanies liable if they are negligent. Hold them liable if they fail \nto properly maintain one of the vehicles they rent or lease. But do not \nhold them liable simply for being in business--for fulfilling the needs \nof our traveling constituents.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to hearings on the Senator from \nArizona's legislation at the earliest possible date and hope to move \nthis legislation through this body as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1131. A bill to promote research into, and the development of an \nultimate cure for, the disease known as Fragile X; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              fragile x research breakthrough act of 1999\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nHagel, to introduce the Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999.\n  Most of my colleagues have probably never heard of Fragile X. But it \nis the leading known cause of mental retardation. And the measure we \nintroduce today could help put us on the path to treat and ultimately, \nwe hope, cure the disorder. This measure will launch a concerted and \naggressive federal effort to deal with Fragile X.\n  Fragile X--which is a genetic defect that results in mental \nretardation--was only recently discovered. Given its prevalence, it's \nsurprising that it took us so long to discover this problem.\n  One in 2,000 males and one in 4,000 females have the gene defect. One \nin every 260 women is a carrier. Current studies estimate that as many \nas 90,000 Americans suffer from Fragile X. Yet up to 80 to 90 percent \nof them are undiagnosed. It does not affect one racial or ethnic group \nmore than another.\n  Scientists have only known exactly what causes Fragile X since 1991. \nFragile X occurs when a specific gene, which should hold a string of \nmolecules that repeat six to fifty times, over-expands. It causes the \ngene to hold anywhere from 200 to 1,000 copies of the same sequence, \nrepeating over and over, much like a record skipping out of control. \nThe result of this error is that instructions needed for the creation \nof a specific protein in the brain are lost. Consequently, the Fragile \nX protein is either low or absent in the affected person. The lower the \nlevel of the protein, the more severe the resulting disabilities.\n\n  People with Fragile X have effects ranging from mild learning \ndisabilities to severe mental retardation. Behavioral problems \nassociated with Fragile X include aggression, anxiety, and seizures. \nThe effects on both the victims of the disorder and their families are \nprofound, taking a huge emotional and financial toll. People with \nFragile X have a normal life expectancy but usually incur special costs \nthat add up to over $2 million on average over their lifetime. Because \nit is inherited, many families have more than one child with Fragile X.\n  But although Fragile X is now known in the scientific community, it \nis still neither widely studied by scientists nor known by the public \nat large.\n  That's shocking, considering its devastating effect. Let me give you \nan example. In 1989 Katie Clapp gave birth to her first child, Andy. \nShe and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia were thrilled. There were \nsome concerns initially because Andy was missing one kidney and had \nsome other medical problems. But they were quickly remedied, and \nMichael knew from his training as a medical doctor that Andy could do \nfine with one kidney. Testing did not reveal any other problems, so the \ncouple breathed easy.\n  But soon Andy started showing other signs of problems. He had \ndifficulty feeding and was inconsolable except when held by his mother. \nHe was not as responsive as other children his age, except to scream \nwhen put down. Over the first year of life, he began to miss \nachievement milestones, such as sitting up and walking. Michael was in \nhis residency training at the University of North Carolina hospital, so \na\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\nwealth of medical resources were within his reach. Andy was seen by \nneurologists and geneticists, but there were no answers.\n  When Andy was two years old, Katie became pregnant with a second \nchild. She wanted to be sure that her next baby would be born free of \nAndy's problems. So Andy was tested some more for genetics \nabnormalities, but nothing showed up. Yet Andy's problems were becoming \nmore and more apparent, and causing greater difficulties for the \nfamily.\n  Finally, when he was three and a half years old, Andy went to a new \nphysician, a developmental pediatrician. During the initial visit with \nthe doctor, Michael and Katie got their first indication that there \nmight be a name for the problem they had been living with. The doctor \nsuggested that Andy be tested for something called Fragile X. The test \nwas performed, and came back positive. Katie Clapp and Michael \nTranfaglia soon learned that not only did Andy have this inherited \ngenetic disorder, but that their baby daughter Laura was also \nafflicted.\n  Recent advances in Fragile X research now make it possible to test \ndefinitively for the disorder through DNA analysis. Yet many doctors \nare still not familiar with Fragile X, and subtle symptoms in early \nchildhood can make it difficult to detect.\n  But there is good news. Because scientists have identified the \nmissing protein that causes the disorder, there is hope for a cure. And \nbecause Fragile X is the only single-gene disease known to directly \nimpact human intelligence, understanding the disease can give us \ninsight into human intelligence and learning and into dealing with \nother single gene defects. Understanding Fragile X may also unlock some \nof the mysteries of autism, schizophrenia, and other neurological \ndisorders. But we need to fund research efforts into this devastating \ndisease.\n  Mr. President, my proposal seeks to capitalize on the good news. It \nwould:\n  Expand and coordinate research into Fragile X under the direction of \nthe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development--a \ndivision of the National Institutes of Health;\n  Establish at least three Fragile X centers, which would receive \ngrants for research and development aimed at improving the diagnosis \nand treatment of, and finding a cure for, Fragile X;\n  Allow patients with Fragile X to participate in clinical trials;\n  Coordinate activities and exchange of information between the centers \nfor better understanding of the disorder, and\n  Encourage wide scale research into Fragile X by allowing qualified \nhealth professionals who conduct research into the disorder to be \nrepaid for principal and interest on educational loans under the \nNational Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program.\n  Today, in our country, thousands of children have Fragile X, but \ntheir parent have never heard of the disease. These parents know \nsomething is wrong, but they cannot give the problem a name, and \nneither can any doctor they have consulted. Like Katie and Michael, \nthey may know their child has a disability, but they do not know why. \nThey do not know that if they have more children, those children may \nalso be at risk. They do not know there are treatments for the problem.\n  They do not know that someone is working on a cure.\n  The same holds true for many adults in our society. They are living \nin group homes and in institutions around the country. They have been \ncared for during entire lifetimes by devoted family members. Yet they \nhave never had a diagnosis beyond ``mental retardation.''\n  This summer in North Carolina, we are hosting a very special \ngathering of very special people. The Special Olympics World games will \nbegin with an opening ceremony in Raleigh on June 26th, and the Games \nwill run through July 4th. Among the participants will be many athletes \nwho have Fragile X. Some of them know it, but many others, along with \ntheir families, do not even know that their particular disorder has a \nname. And with a name comes knowledge, and with knowledge comes hope \nfor a better future--even for a cure.\n  The job of these extraordinary athletes this summer is to make the \nmost of their abilities and to achieve personal goals and triumphs. Our \nrole in the games is to support their efforts, and to cheer them on. \nBut our responsibility does not end there. It is our responsibility to \nmake the most of the knowledge we now have, to expand that knowledge, \nand to give these folks the best chance possible. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important research. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fragile X Research \n     Breakthrough Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental \n     retardation. It affects 1 in every 2,000 boys and 1 in every \n     4,000 girls. One in 260 women is a carrier.\n       (2) Most children with Fragile X require a lifetime of \n     special care at a cost of over $2,000,000 per child.\n       (3) Relatively newly-discovered and relatively unknown, \n     even in the medical profession, Fragile X is caused by the \n     absence of a single protein that can be produced \n     synthetically but that cannot yet be effectively assimilated.\n       (4) Fragile X research, both basic and applied, is vastly \n     underfunded in view of its prevalence, the potential for the \n     development of a cure, the established benefits of currently \n     available interventions, and the significance that Fragile X \n     research has for related disorders.\n       (5) Fragile X is a powerful research model for other forms \n     of X-linked mental retardation, as well as neuropsychiatric \n     disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, mood disorders, \n     and pervasive developmental disorder. Individuals with \n     Fragile X are a homogeneous study population for advancing \n     understanding of these disorders.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my colleague \nand friend, the distinguished junior Senator from North Carolina, \nSenator Edwards, in introducing the Fragile X Breakthrough Act of 1999.\n  Although many of you may not have heard of Fragile X, it is the \nleading cause of inherited mental retardation. It affects tens of \nthousands of children in this country every year. Fragile X is caused \nby a defective gene that fails to product specific protein necessary \nfor proper brain function. Those afflicted with this condition often \nsuffer mild to severe mental retardation, anxiety, seizures, and a \nvariety of learning disorders. Most children with Fragile X will \nrequire a lifetime of specialized care at a cost of over $2 million \neach.\n  For those afflicted and their families--like John and Megan Massey \nfrom Scottsbluff, Nebraska, whose two sons Jack and Jacob suffer from \nthis disease--it is a frustrating, life-crippling, and heart-wrenching \ncondition. But there is hope. In 1991, medical researchers were able to \nidentify the specific gene that fails to produce the necessary protein \nand is responsible for Fragile X. Since then, researchers have been \nable to develop a synthetic version of this protein, and are now \nworking on a way to deliver it to the brain's flawed cells.\n  Congress has an unprecedented opportunity to play a key role in \nsolving the mystery of this disease, and encouraging the development of \na treatment and eventual cure. The Fragile X Breakthrough Act is a \npractical, pro-active, and cost-effective vehicle by which Congress can \naccomplish these goals.\n  The National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) is \nrequired by law to establish research centers in order to conduct \nclinical and scientific research aimed at helping infants and children. \nIn accordance with that charge, the Fragile X Breakthrough Act \nauthorizes $10 million for the NICHD, to make grants or enter into \ncontracts with public or private entities to develop and operate three \nFragile X research centers. It also provides $2 million for a program \nthat encourages physicians to conduct Fragile X research, by offering \nto repay a portion of their educational loans. These proposals closely \nfollow the recommendations that emerged from an international \nscientific conference held by the NICHD and the Fragile X Foundation \n(FRAXA) in December of 1998.\n  We are closing in on one of the principal genetic causes of mental \nretardation. Let's give the NICHD the authority and funding to \naccelerate Fragile X research, so that the final, critical \nbreakthroughs can be made. Let's give these children the chance to lead \nnormal, productive lives. If not for Jacob and Jack Massey, then for \nthose children who will inevitably follow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1132. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe reinvestment of employee stock ownership plan dividends without the \nloss of any dividend reduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    esop dividend reinvestment and participant security act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwill not only promote employee ownership, but also enhance retirement \nsavings. The ``ESOP Dividend Reinvestment and Participant Security Act \nof 1999'' will grant many workers their long-sought desire to share in \nthe growth of their company while not sacrificing one nickel of their \nretirement security. This legislation will permit employees to reinvest \ndividends paid on employer securities held in an ESOP without going \nthrough the administrative complexity that companies currently face in \norder to encourage workers to keep their dividends in the plan.\n  Under current law, an employer may deduct the dividends paid on \nemployer securities in an ESOP only if the dividends are used to repay \nan ESOP loan or they are paid in cash to participants. This runs \ncounter to one of the most important themes expressed by this \nadministration as well as many others since the passage of ERISA--what \nto do about ``leakage'' in our retirement programs, or assets coming \nout of plans prematurely. In short, we need to encourage our nation's \nworkers to keep their money in their retirement plans and not let small \namounts drip out over time so that little is left by the time they \nenter retirement. The bill I am introducing today addresses this issue \nand would bolster the retirement security of ESOP participants because \nit would encourage both employees and employers to reinvest their \ndividends in the company.\n  Not only does the current approach of denying a deduction for \nreinvested dividends discourage the accumulation of assets for \nretirement, it also thwarts one of the primary purposes of an ESOP--\nproviding an efficient means for employees to build an ownership \ninterest in their company. Congress has steadfastly maintained the ESOP \ndividend deductibility rules for over 15 years in order to encourage \nemployers to establish ESOPs that hold dividend-paying company stock. \nThese rules clearly are intended to provide ESOP participants a broader \nopportunity to share in the company's growth and to ultimately use such \ngrowth to provide retirement assets. Unfortunately, our present rules \nfall short of the mark.\n  This bill fulfills the promise inherent in the original ESOP dividend \ndeduction provision. The ``ESOP Dividend Reinvestment and Participant \nSecurity Act of 1999'' would give employees the ability to retain the \ndividends paid on employer stock in the ESOP and to reinvest these \namounts in the employer stock for continuing growth and accumulation. \nNo employee would then be forced to receive dividends that could \ninstead be used to build retirement savings. And, all employees could \nreceive the benefit of participating in their company's growth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Poultry Products Inspection Act to cover \nbirds\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nof the order Ratitae that are raised for use as human food; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n         poultry products inspection act amendments legislation\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \namend the Poultry Products Inspection Act to include birds of the \nRatitae order, such as ostriches, emus, and rheas, in the mandatory \nUSDA meat inspection program. Currently producers of ratitae \nparticipate in a voluntary inspection program, but costs are borne by \nthe producers and can add as much as $2 per pound to the price of the \nproduct. The USDA currently absorbs the cost of inspection for the more \ntraditional agricultural products, such as turkey, poultry, and beef.\n  I introduce this legislation to encourage agricultural \nentrepreneurship and diversification, and to level the economic playing \nfield for those farmers willing to take innovative risks to bring new \nproducts to American and global consumers. Ratite meat is reported to \nbe high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and byproducts from \nthe animals are being studied by universities and medical labs for \ntheir potential uses. I would also note that farmers engaged in \nproducing ratite meat can now be found all over the country, not just \nin Minnesota.\n  With the increasing focus in our country on food safety, I believe \nthis bill is a small but important step toward both encouraging \ndevelopment of alternative agricultural products and ensuring the \nsafety of the food our citizens consume.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in support of this bill to help \nfamily farms diversify into new products that will provide them with \nnew income sources and give American consumers more variety at the \ngrocery store.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 1134.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide \nthat the lowest unit rate for campaign advertising shall not be \navailable for communication in which a candidate attacks an opponent of \nthe candidate unless the candidate does so in person; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            POLITICAL CANDIDATE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Congressman Walden in the House of Representatives, that would \nfight the scourge of negative political campaigns with the simple yet \npowerful tool of accountability. If candidates choose to run for office \nby disparaging their opponents rather than standing on their own \nrecords and beliefs, they should at least be expected to take \nresponsibility for the ad campaigns that they run. Under this \nlegislation, there would be meaningful financial penalty--in the form \nof higher advertising rates--for those who fail to do so.\n  For me, this bill arises out of unpleasant personal experience. I was \nelected to this body in a special election against the man I am now \nproud to call my friend and colleague, Gordon Smith. That campaign was \nthe nastiest, most negative, least edifying political season that my \nstate has ever been through. The unabashedly negative ads that both of \nour campaigns put on the air were a sour departure from Oregon's \ntradition of responsible, thoughtful politics.\n  I eventually became so disgusted with what my own campaign had \nbecome, that with only a few weeks before the election, I got rid of \nall my ads, destroyed negative mailings that were about to be sent out, \nasked others who were airing negative ads on my behalf to desist, and \nstarted over with a campaign that was 100 percent positive. I didn't \nknow if it would be a smart campaign strategy or a kind of political \nsuicide, and I didn't much care. Win or lose, I wanted to be proud of \nthe way that I had conducted myself.\n  What I learned all too well in that campaign is that negative \npolitics corrupts everything that it touches. It harms not only its \ntarget, but its sponsor as well. Negative ads are one of the biggest \nreasons for the cynicism and even disgust that so many Americans feel \ntoward the political process. They cheapen the very institution of \ndemocracy.\n  There's no way, of course, to mandate a sense of shame or legislate \nan end to negative ads. But in an era when elections are determined \nmore and more by television and radio advertising, it is not too much \nto ask that candidates be held responsible for the statements they make \nin their ads.\n  Under current campaign law, broadcasters are required to give \nqualified candidates for federal office their lowest price for ads, \nwhat is known as the lowest unit broadcast rate. In order to qualify \nfor this rate, candidates must comply with federal campaign finance \nlaws, and include proper disclaimers in the ad, among other \nregulations. The Political Candidate Personal Responsibility Act would \nattach two additional requirements to the discounted ad rate. The first \nrequirement is that for both television and radio advertisements, the \nlowest unit rate will only be available if a candidate, when referring \nto his or her opponent, makes the reference him or her self. Radio \nadvertisements must also contain a statement by the candidate in which \nthe candidate identifies him or herself and the office for which the \nperson is running. The second requirement is that in any television or \nradio ad where a candidate makes reference to his or her opponent, the \ncandidate must appear or be heard for at least 75 percent of the \nbroadcast time. If a candidate chooses to air an advertisement that \ndoes not comply with these requirements, he or she will be ineligible \nto receive the lowest unit rate for a period of 45 days in a primary \nand 60 days in a general election.\n  In other words, if you want the benefits of discounted broadcast \ntime, you can't make disparaging statements that you aren't willing to \nsay yourself. No more hiding behind grainy photographs, ominous music, \nand anonymous announcers.\n  Ultimately, one of our greatest responsibilities as elected officials \nis to encourage greater public participation in all levels of the \npolitical process. Campaign activities should not only represent the \nviews of the candidates, but they should also encourage voters to \nparticipate in the democratic process. The growing negative trend of \ncampaign advertisements degrades the process and discourages people \nfrom becoming involved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Political Candidate Personal \n     Responsibility Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Local broadcasters are currently required to offer the \n     ``lowest unit charge'' for advertising to candidates for all \n     political offices 45 days before a primary election, and 60 \n     days before a general election.\n       (2) The ``lowest unit charge'' requirement represents a \n     federally mandated subsidy for political candidates.\n       (3) Campaigns for Federal office are too frequently \n     dominated by negative and attack-oriented television and \n     radio advertising.\n       (4) The Government should take action to ensure that it \n     does not subsidize negative and attack oriented advertising \n     where the candidate fails to demonstrate personal \n     responsibility for the tenor of the candidate's advertising.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat an organization shall be exempt from income tax if it is created \nby a State to provide property and casualty insurance coverage for \nproperty for which such coverage is otherwise unavailable; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n  exemption from income tax for state created organizations providing \n                    property and casualty insurance\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Graham and I introduce \nlegislation that would help protect Florida from economic devastation \nin the event of a catastrophic windstorm or other peril.\n  Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue \nCode to grant tax-exempt status to the Florida Windstorm Underwriting \nAssociation (FWUA), the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint \nUnderwriting Association (JUA) and similar state-chartered, not-for-\nprofit insurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not \navailable. The FWUA and JUA are non-profit entities established by the \nstate to provide property and casualty insurance coverage in those \nmarkets not adequately served by other insurers.\n  In most years, Florida is not hit by a major hurricane or natural \ncatastrophe. In those years, the FWUA and JUA take in more premiums \nthan are paid out in claims or expenses. Since these entities are not-\nfor-profit, state law prevents those funds from being distributed--they \nare instead literally saved for a severely rainy or windy day. \nNonetheless, the Internal Revenue Code requires 35% of those funds to \nbe sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than used to fund \nreserves. Designating the FWUA and JUA as tax-exempt will help Florida \nto accumulate the necessary reserves to pay claims brought on by a \ncatastrophe. This bill gives the two Florida catastrophe funds the same \ntax-exempt status that is already enjoyed by a number of not-for-profit \ninsurance provers.\n  State law authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property \ninsurance policyholders throughout Florida to pay for losses generated \nby catastrophic storms or other perils. Thus, the benefits of the tax \nexemption would reduce the frequency and severity of assessments levied \nagainst individual policyholders. Greater funds would be available to \ncover losses which otherwise would be paid for by higher assessments on \nFlorida policyholders--cutting taxes for the approximately 5,000,000 \nproperty owners in the state of Florida.\n  This legislation has the bipartisan support of the entire Florida \nCongressional delegation in addition to strong backing from Governor \nJeb Bush, the State Insurance Commissioner, the Florida Senate \nPresident and Florida's House Speaker. And this change in the tax code \nwould result in only a negligible loss of federal tax revenue, \naccording to Joint Tax.\n  Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses \nthroughout the state of Florida, all of whom are subject to assessment \nif reserves are not sufficient to pay claims in the event of a severe \nhurricane or other catastrophe. With hundreds of miles of magnificent \ncoastline, Florida remains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment \nof our legislation permits Florida to prepare for the next Hurricane \nAndrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on \nFlorida property owners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as we prepare for next week's start \nof the 1999 Hurricane Season, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Mack, in introducing legislation that will help protect Florida \nfrom economic devastation in the event of a catastrophic disaster.\n  Our legislation would amend Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue \nCode to grant tax-exempt status to state chartered, not-for-profit \ninsurers serving markets in which commercial insurance is not \navailable. In our state, this legislation will primarily assist the \nFlorida Windstorm Underwriting Association (FWUA) and the Florida \nResidential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association (JUA).\n  The Florida Windstorm Association was created in 1970. Twenty-two \nyears later, in 1992, the legislature authorized the Joint Underwriting \nAssociation. These organizations operate as residual market mechanisms. \nThey provide residential property and casualty insurance coverage for \nthose residents who need, but are unable to procure through the \nvoluntary market.\n  The JUA was created in direct response to $16 billion in covered \nlosses during Hurricane Andrew. The destructive force of Andrew \nrendered a number of property insurance companies insolvent. Other \nfirms recovered from the catastrophe by withdrawing from Florida \nmarkets.\n  During those fortunate years when we are not impacted by major \nhurricanes or other natural catastrophes, the FWUA and JUA take in more \npremiums that are paid out in claims and expenses. Florida law prevents \nthose funds from being distributed so that needed reserves will \naccumulate in preparation for inevitable disasters.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service penalizes Florida for \nthis responsible, forward thinking practice. It requires that 35% of \nthose funds be sent to Washington as federal income taxes rather than \nused to fund reserves. Designating state chartered, non profit insurers \nas tax-exempt will help Florida accumulate the necessary reserves to \npay claims brought on by a catastrophe.\n  State law also authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property \ninsurance policyholders for losses generated by natural disasters. Tax \nexemptions should reduce the frequency and severity of assessments \nlevied against individual policyholders, because it would make more \nfunds available to cover losses which otherwise would be paid for by \nhigher assessments on policyholders.\n  Mr. President, even seven years later, Hurricane Andrew is still a \nnightmarish memory for Floridians. The 1999 Hurricane season will begin \non June 1, 1999. The National Weather Service expects this hurricane \nseason--which begins next Tuesday, to be another active storm season. \nIt is imperative that the federal government avoids the comfortable \nhabit of ignoring lessons presented by Andrew and other recent \ncatastrophes.\n  This legislation has bipartisan support in the state's Congressional \ndelegation. It is backed by our state governor, our insurance \nCommissioner, our state Senate President and House Speaker.\n  Also, Mr. President, the Joint Committee on Taxation has ruled that \nthis legislation will have a negligible effect on the federal budget.\n  Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses \nthroughout Florida, all whom are subject to assessment if reserves are \nnot sufficient to pay claims in the event of a catastrophe. Florida \nremains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment of this \nlegislation will permit our state to prepare for the next Hurricane \nAndrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on \nFlorida property owners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 1139. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, relating to \ncivil penalties for unruly passengers of air carriers and to provide \nfor the protection of employees providing air safety information, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n  increase of civil penalties on unruly airline passengers legislation\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, years ago, when air travel was in its \ninfancy, the greatest threat to passenger safety was mechanical \nfailure.\n  Over the last half-century, the dedication of the men and women who \nservice our airlines, coupled with advances in technology and know-how, \nhave made air travel the safest method of transportation we have.\n  But it's not always the most convenient way to travel. As air travel \nhas become safer, it has also become more popular--and more crowded.\n  As all of my colleagues in this chamber well know, air travel is an \nincreasingly stressful and chaotic experience, at times trying even the \nmost patient among us.\n  I commend my colleagues for introducing the passenger's bill of \nrights earlier this Congress, which hopefully will alleviate some of \nthe stress of air travel.\n  I rise today to address a different aspect of that stress, and that \nis the safety hazard created to all passengers when a passenger who \ncan't control his behavior or emotions, or simply refuses to do so, \nacts in a way that jeopardizes the safety of the flight.\n  Over the last few years, the number of reported incidents in which \nunruly airline passengers have interfered with flight crews, or even \nphysically assaulted them, has increased dramatically and dangerously.\n  One airline alone reports that the number of incidents caused by \nviolent or unruly passengers more than tripled in only three years--\nfrom 296 cases in 1994 to 921 cases in 1997.\n  In 1996, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed civil penalties \nagainst 121 unruly passengers. In 1997, that number jumped to 195--a \nsixty percent increase in only one year.\n  These incidents represent a serious threat to the safety of both \nflight crews and passengers alike.\n  Today I, along with my colleague Senator Frist, am introducing a bill \nthat addresses this problem.\n  Briefly, my bill will allow the Secretary of Transportation to \nincrease the civil penalty from its current level of $1,100, up to \n$25,000, on any airline passenger who interferes with the duties or \nresponsibilities of the flight crew or cabin crew or takes any action \nthat poses an imminent threat to the safety of the aircraft or other \nindividuals on the aircraft.\n  We need not only to punish passengers who threaten the safety of \ntheir passengers. We also need to give airlines the power to prevent \nparticularly violent or disruptive passengers from committing similar \nacts in the future.\n  When someone drives in an unsafe manner on our roads, local police \nhave the power to fine them. When that someone commits the same \noffenses repeatedly, or drives in a way that is especially dangerous, \nlocal authorities have the power to revoke or suspend their driver's \nlicenses--to take those drivers off the road.\n  I think we need to do something similar with air travelers who commit \nparticularly dangerous acts, or who insist on repeatedly disrupting \nairline flight crews. We need them off of our airlines, so that they do \nnot have the opportunity to jeopardize the lives of other passengers in \nthe future.\n  The bill I am introducing today gives the Secretary of Transportation \nthe authority to raise the civil penalty up to $25,000.\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\n  Second, and most important, my bill would also give the Secretary of \nTransportation the authority to impose a ban of up to one year on all \ncommercial air travel on passengers guilty of such incidents.\n  The bill enforces this ban by making airlines which provides air \ntransportation to a banned traveler liable to the Government for a \ncivil penalty of up to $25,000.\n  Third, this bill would give whistleblower protection to flight \nattendants who report unsafe behavior by co-workers.\n  Fourth, this bill will make the investigation of in-flight incidents \neasier by giving the Attorney General the authority to deputize local \nlaw enforcement officials to investigate incidents when the plane \nlands, wherever it lands.\n  Mr. President, everyone in this body travels extensively by air. \nEvery time we get into an airline, we put our lives in the hands of the \nhardworking men and women who staff our airlines.\n  When we, or any other American, gets on an airplane, we should be \nable to sit back and relax, confident in the knowledge that those men \nand women can perform the jobs they were trained to do without \ninterference by unreasonable or violent passengers.\n  We should also be able to board an airline secure in the knowledge \nthat the man or woman sitting in the seat next to us, doesn't have an \nextensive history of violent or disruptive behavior on airplanes.\n  We should also have the security of knowing that if a passenger does \nchoose to commit a particularly unruly or violent act that threatens \nthe safety of other passengers or the flight crew, that passenger won't \nbe able to get on another airplane tomorrow and do the same thing to \nanother unsuspecting planeload of passengers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.\n  Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Community-Army Cooperation \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Between 1945 and 1989, the national security interests \n     of the United States required the construction, and later, \n     the deployment and storage of weapons of mass destruction \n     throughout the geographical United States.\n       (2) The United States is a party to international \n     commitments and treaties which require the decommissioning or \n     destruction of certain of these weapons.\n       (3) The United States has ratified the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention which requires the destruction of the United \n     States chemical weapons stockpile by April 29, 2007.\n       (4) Section 1412 of the Department of Defense Authorization \n     Act, 1986 (50 U.S.C. 1521) provides that the Department of \n     the Army shall be the executive agent for the destruction of \n     the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (5) In 1988, the Department of the Army determined that on-\n     site incineration of chemical weapons at the eight chemical \n     weapons storage locations in the continental United States \n     would provide the safest and most efficient means for the \n     destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (6) The communities in the vicinity of such locations have \n     expressed concern over the safety of the process to be used \n     for the incineration of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (7) Sections 174 and 175 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484) \n     and section 8065 of the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208) require that the Department of \n     the Army explore methods other than incineration for the \n     destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (8) Compliance with the 2007 deadline for the destruction \n     of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in accordance \n     with\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\n     the Chemical Weapons Convention will require an accelerated \n     decommissioning and transporting of United States chemical \n     weapons.\n       (9) The decommissioning or transporting of such weapons has \n     caused, or will cause, environmental, economic, and social \n     disruptions.\n       (10) It is appropriate for the United States to mitigate \n     such disruptions.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to provide \n     for the mitigation of the environmental, economic, and social \n     disruptions to communities and Indian tribes resulting from \n     the onsite decommissioning of chemical agents and munitions, \n     and related materials, at chemical demilitarization \n     facilities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1303. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Secretary of the Army should streamline the \n     administrative structure of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of the Army, respectively, in order that the \n     officials within such departments with immediate \n     responsibility for the demilitarization of chemical agents \n     and munitions, and related materials, have authority--\n       (1) to meet the April 29, 2007, deadline for the \n     destruction of United States chemical weapon stockpile as \n     required by the Chemical Weapons Convention; and\n       (2) to employ sound management principles, including the \n     negotiation and implementation of contract incentives, to--\n       (A) accelerate the decommissioning of chemical agents and \n     munitions, and related materials; and\n       (B) enforce budget discipline on the chemical \n     demilitarization program of the United States while \n     mitigating the disruption to communities and Indian tribes \n     resulting from the onsite decommissioning of the chemical \n     weapons stockpile at chemical demilitarization facilities in \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1304. DECOMMISSIONING OF UNITED STATES CHEMICAL WEAPONS \n                   STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) In General.--As executive agent for the chemical \n     demilitarization program of the United States, the Department \n     of the Army shall facilitate, expedite, and accelerate the \n     decommissioning of the United States chemical weapons \n     stockpile so as to complete the decommissioning of that \n     stockpile by April 29, 2007, as required by the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention.\n       (b) Management within Department of the Army.--The \n     Secretary of the Army shall designate or establish in the \n     Office of the Secretary of the Army an office to facilitate \n     compliance with the requirements in subsection (a).\n       (c) Responsibilities of Office.--The office designated or \n     established under subsection (b) shall have the following \n     responsibilities:\n       (1) To provide oversight and policy guidance to the \n     Department of the Army on issues relating to compliance with \n     the requirements in subsection (a).\n       (2) Except as provided in section 1305, to allocate within \n     the Department amounts appropriated for the Department for \n     chemical demilitarization activities.\n       (3) To negotiate, renegotiate, and execute contracts, \n     including performance-based contracts and incentive-based \n     contracts, with nongovernmental entities.\n       (4) To negotiate and execute agreements, including \n     incentive-based agreements, with other departments, agencies, \n     and instrumentalities of the United States.\n       (5) To delegate authority and functions to other \n     departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United \n     States.\n       (6) To negotiate and execute agreements with the chief \n     executive officers of the States.\n       (7) Such other responsibilities as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 1305. ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Upon the direction of the Secretary of the \n     Army, the Comptroller of the Army may make economic \n     assistance payments to communities and Indian tribes directly \n     affected by the decommissioning of chemical agents and \n     munitions, and related materials, at chemical \n     demilitarization facilities in the United States.\n       (b) Source of Payments.--Amounts for payments under this \n     section shall be derived from appropriations available to the \n     Department of the Army for chemical demilitarization \n     activities.\n       (c) Total Amount of Payments.--(1) Subject to paragraph \n     (2), the aggregate amount of payments under this section with \n     respect to a chemical demilitarization facility during the \n     period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and \n     ending on April 29, 2007, may not be less than $50,000,000 or \n     more than $60,000,000.\n       (2) Payments under this section shall cease with respect to \n     a facility upon the transfer of the facility to a State-\n     chartered municipal corporation pursuant to an agreement \n     referred to in section 1412(c)(2)(B) of the Department of \n     Defense Authorization Act, 1986, as amended by section 1306 \n     of this Act.\n       (d) Date of Payment.--(1) Payments under this section with \n     respect to a chemical demilitarization facility shall be made \n     on March 1 and September 2 each year if the decommissioning \n     of chemical agents and munitions, and related materials, \n     occurs at the facility during the applicable payment period \n     with respect to such date.\n       (2) For purposes of this section, the term ``applicable \n     payment period'' means--\n       (A) in the case of a payment to be made on March 1 of a \n     year, the period beginning on July 1 and ending on December \n     31 of the preceding year; and\n       (B) in the case of a payment to be made on September 2 of a \n     year, the period beginning on January 1 and ending on June 30 \n     of the year.\n       (e) Allocation of Payment--(1) Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), each payment under this section with respect \n     to a chemical demilitarization facility shall be allocated \n     equally among the communities and Indian tribes that are \n     located within the positive action zone of the facility, as \n     determined by population.\n       (2) The amount of an allocation under this subsection to a \n     community or Indian tribe shall be reduced by the amount of \n     any tax or fee imposed or assessed by the community or Indian \n     tribe during the applicable payment period against the value \n     of the facility concerned or with respect to the storage or \n     decommissioning of chemical agents and munitions, or related \n     materials, at the facility.\n       (f) Computation of Payment.--(1) Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), the amount of each payment under this section \n     with respect to a chemical demilitarization facility shall be \n     the amount equal to $10,000 multiplied by the number of tons \n     of chemical agents and munitions, and related materials, \n     decommissioned at the facility during the applicable payment \n     period.\n       (2)(A) If at the conclusion of the decommissioning of \n     chemical agents and munitions, and related materials, at a \n     facility the aggregate amount of payments made with respect \n     to the facility is less than the minimum amount required by \n     subsection (c)(1), unless payments have ceased with respect \n     to the facility under subsection (c)(2), the amount of the \n     final payment under this section shall be the amount equal to \n     the difference between such aggregate amount and the minimum \n     amount required by subsection (c)(1).\n       (B) This paragraph shall not apply with respect to a \n     facility if the decommissioning of chemical agents and \n     munitions, and related materials, continues at the facility \n     after April 29, 2007.\n       (g) Interest on Untimely Payments.--(1) Any payment that is \n     made under this section for an applicable payment period \n     after the date specified for that period in subsection (d) \n     shall include, in addition to the payment amount otherwise \n     provided for under this section, interest at the rate of 1.5 \n     percent per month.\n       (2) Amounts for payments of interest under this paragraph \n     shall be derived from amounts available for the Department of \n     Defense, other than amounts available for chemical \n     demilitarization activities.\n       (h) Use of Payments.--A community or Indian tribe receiving \n     a payment under this section may utilize amounts of the \n     payment for such purposes as the community or Indian tribe, \n     as the case may be, considers appropriate in its sole \n     discretion.\n\n     SEC. 1306. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND USE OF FACILITIES.\n\n       Paragraph (2) of section 1412(c) of the Department of \n     Defense Authorization Act, 1986 (50 U.S.C. 1521(c)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2)(A) Facilities constructed to carry out this section \n     may not be used for any other purpose than the destruction of \n     the following:\n       ``(i) The United States stockpile of lethal chemical agents \n     and munitions that exist on November 8, 1985.\n       ``(ii) Any items designated by the Secretary of Defense \n     after that date to be lethal chemical agents and munitions, \n     or related materials.\n       ``(B) Facilities constructed to carry out this section \n     shall, when no longer needed for the purposes for which they \n     were constructed, be disposed of in accordance with \n     agreements between the office designated or established under \n     section 1304(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2000 and the chief executive officer of the State \n     in which the facilities are located.\n       ``(C) An agreement referred to in subparagraph (B) that \n     provides for the transfer of facilities from the United \n     States to a State-chartered municipal corporation shall \n     include provisions as follows:\n       ``(i) That any profits generated by the corporation from \n     the use of such facilities shall be used exclusively for the \n     benefit of communities and Indian tribes located within the \n     positive action zone of such facilities, as determined by \n     population.\n       ``(ii) That any profits referred to in clause (i) shall be \n     apportioned among the communities and Indian tribes concerned \n     on the basis of population, as determined by the most recent \n     decennial census.\n       ``(iii) That the transfer of such facilities shall include \n     any lands extending 50 feet in all directions from such \n     facilities.\n       ``(iv) That the transfer of such facilities include any \n     easements necessary for reasonable access to such facilities.\n       ``(D) An agreement referred to in subparagraph (B) may not \n     take effect if executed after December 31, 2000.''.\n\n     SEC. 1307.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Community-Army Cooperation \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Between 1945 and 1989, the national security interests \n     of the United States required the construction, and later, \n     the deployment and storage of weapons of mass destruction \n     throughout the geographical United States.\n       (2) The United States is a party to international \n     commitments and treaties which require the decommissioning or \n     destruction of certain of these weapons.\n       (3) The United States has ratified the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention which requires the destruction of the United \n     States chemical weapons stockpile by April 29, 2007.\n       (4) Section 1412 of the Department of Defense Authorization \n     Act, 1986 (50 U.S.C. 1521) provides that the Department of \n     the Army shall be the executive agent for the destruction of \n     the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (5) In 1988, the Department of the Army determined that on-\n     site incineration of chemical weapons at the eight chemical \n     weapons storage locations in the continental United States \n     would provide the safest and most efficient means for the \n     destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (6) The communities in the vicinity of such locations have \n     expressed concern over the safety of the process to be used \n     for the incineration of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (7) Sections 174 and 175 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484) \n     and section 8065 of the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208) require that the Department of \n     the Army explore methods other than incineration for the \n     destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile.\n       (8) Compliance with the 2007 deadline for the destruction \n     of the United States chemical weapons stockpile in accordance \n     with the Chemical Weapons Convention will require an \n     accelerated decommissioning and transporting of United States \n     chemical weapons.\n       (9) The decommissioning or transporting of such weapons has \n     caused, or will cause, environmental, economic, and social \n     disruptions.\n       (10) It is appropriate for the United States to mitigate \n     such disruptions.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to provide \n     for the mitigation of the environmental, economic, and social \n     disruptions to communities and Indian tribes resulting from \n     the onsite decommissioning of chemical agents and munitions, \n     and related materials, at chemical demilitarization \n     facilities in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1303. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Secretary of the Army should streamline the \n     administrative structure of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of the Army, respectively, in order that the \n     officials within such departments with immediate \n     responsibility for the demilitarization of chemical agents \n     and munitions, and related materials, have authority--\n       (1) to meet the April 29, 2007, deadline for the \n     destruction of United States chemical weapon stockpile as \n     required by the Chemical Weapons Convention; and\n       (2) to employ sound management principles, including the \n     negotiation and implementation of contract incentives, to--\n       (A) accelerate the decommissioning of chemical agents and \n     munitions, and related materials; and\n       (B) enforce budget discipline on the chemical \n     demilitarization program of the United States while \n     mitigating the disruption to communities and Indian tribes \n     resulting from the onsite decommissioning of the chemical \n     weapons stockpile at chemical demilitarization facilities in \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1304.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a \ntruly historic event that took place in my state of New Mexico last \nSaturday--the nation's largest act of Native American repatriation. The \n``Jemez-Pecos Repatriation'' resulted in the reburial of nearly 2,000 \nhuman remains and artifacts unearthed from what should have been their \nfinal resting place over 70 years ago.\n  On the Wednesday before the reburial, over 300 people started the 120 \nmile walk from Jemez Pueblo in northern New Mexico to the ruins of the \nPecos Pueblo. The journey is a long one in the dry New Mexico sun. The \ngroup, both young and old, traveled across three counties and through \nthe beautiful Jemez Mountains before arriving at the former site of the \nPecos Pueblo. But the journey of their ancestors is much more \nremarkable.\n  Prior to the 1820's, the Pueblo was a thriving community and center \nfor trade. The Pecos interacted extensively with the Plains Indians to \nthe east, the neighboring Pueblos to the west and the nearby Spanish \ncommunities. However, years of disease and warfare eventually decimated \nthe population. In 1838, the remaining residents of Pecos Pueblo \nrelocated to the Pueblo of Jemez, in order to protect their traditional \nleaders, sacred objects and culture. This decision reflects the fact \nthat Jemez and Pecos cultures were intricately linked by blood, \nlanguage and spiritual beliefs as well as through their ``origin \nstories''. In 1936, Congress formally merged the two tribes into one, \nwith the Pueblo of Jemez named as the legal representative of the Pecos \nculture and administrative matters.\n  When the Pecos Pueblo was abandoned in 1838, it likely did not occur \nto the few surviving members of the Pecos that their burial site would \nbe disturbed during the next century. However, the famed archaeologist \nAlfred V. Kidder unearthed the remains and artifacts during ten \nexcavations between 1915 and 1929. The remains were housed at the \nPeabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Cambridge,\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\nMassachusetts and the artifacts were held at the Robert S. Peabody \nMuseum of Archaeology at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. On \nMay 18, 1999, Harvard University turned over the human remains and \nartifacts of nearly 2,000 people formerly buried at the Pecos Pueblo to \nthe Pueblo of Jemez.\n  Last Saturday, in a solemn private ceremony, the thousands of human \nremains and artifacts were reburied in the Pecos National Historical \nPark in a grave that was 6 feet deep, 600 feet long and 10 feet wide. \nThe current burial site is near the former Pecos Pueblo.\n  The historical event last Saturday reflects the close relationship of \nthe Jemez and Pecos people and the strong commitment the Pueblo of \nJemez has to the beliefs of their ancestors. Some of the remains and \nartifacts that were reburied date back to the 12th century.\n  With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and \nRepatriation Act in 1990, the current members of the Pueblo of Jemez \nwere able to fulfill the dreams of many of their ancestors who longed \nto have the remains of their people returned to their homeland. NAGPRA \nwas drafted to protect burial sites on tribal and federal land and to \nenable tribes to obtain the return of human remains and associated \nfunery objects to the culturally affiliated tribes.\n  I commend the Pueblo of Jemez, and particularly the Governor, Raymond \nGachupin, and the many governors before him, who worked tirelessly to \nget to this day of repatriation. It took eight years of negotiations \nand persistence to achieve the final goal of repatriation. In a private \ntribal ceremony on May 22, 1999, the remains and artifacts of the Pecos \nancestors were returned to their rightful place. Many people would be \nangry or resentful if their ancestors were unearthed and relocated. But \nfor the descendants of the Pueblos of Jemez and Pecos, May 22, 1999 was \nlooked upon as a day of unity and healing. By focusing on the future, \nthe descendants truly honored their ancestors. I understand that at the \nend of the ceremony, the New Mexico sky turned dark and the rain began \nto fall. Mr. President, rain in May is not a common occurrence in New \nMexico, but neither is the repatriation of 2,000 Native Americans. I \nwant to convey my respect and admiration to the members of the Pueblo \nof Jemez, past and present, for their commitment and dedication to the \nJemez-Pecos Repatriation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6081-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION'S YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR: MR. \n                          THOMAS MICHAEL DUNN\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nstand before this body to congratulate yet another truly remarkable \nMissourian, Mr. Thomas Michael Dunn--the Small Business \nAdministration's Young Entrepreneur of the Year. Mr. Dunn, at the age \nof 26, is the second Missourian to win a national award from the Small \nBusiness Administration this year.\n  This young man's story is impressive. Tom began his lawn care \nbusiness while still attending St. Louis University High School, and \ncontinued to operate his business during the summers while pursuing a \ndouble major in marketing and management at Indiana University. In his \njunior year of college, Tom began his first venture, operating a party \nfavor franchise. By his senior year, the business was transformed into \na flourishing million dollar industry.\n  Beginning in 1994, Dunn Lawn and Land employed only two staff \nmembers, and had only two lawn mowers.

Mr. President, David Ignatius has written a \ncharming brief essay for The Washington Post on his former teacher \nDaniel Bell, ``the dean of American sociology.'' Professor Bell, who is \nnow Scholar in Residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences \nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, was a colleague and neighbor of mine for \nmany years and a friend for even longer. He has no equal, and as he \nturns 80 he is indeed, as Mr. Ignatius writes, ``a kind of national \ntreasure--a strategic intellectual reserve.'' The nation is hugely in \nhis debt. (A thought which I fear would horrify him!)\n  I ask that the article by David Ignatius in The Washington Post of \nMay 23, 1999 be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From The Washington Post, May 23, 1999]\n\n                     Big Questions for Daniel Bell\n\n                          (By David Ignatius)\n\n       Cambridge--Having a conversation about ideas with Daniel \n     Bell is a little like getting to rally with John McEnroe. \n     Trying to keep up is hopeless, but it's exhilarating just to \n     be on the court with him.\n       Bell, the dean of American sociology, turned 80 this month. \n     In an era when big ideas have largely gone out of fashion, he \n     continues to think bigger than anyone I know, of any age. \n     That makes him a kind of national treasure--a strategic \n     intellectual reserve.\n       The questions that interest Bell today remain the great, \n     woolly ones that make most people throw up their hands: What \n     are the forces shaping modern life? What are the \n     relationships between economics, politics and culture? Where \n     is the human story heading?\n       You can chart the intellectual history of the past 50 years \n     in part through Bell's attempts to answer these big \n     questions: ``The End of Ideology,'' published in 1960; ``The \n     Coming of Post-Industrial Society,'' published in 1973; ``The \n     Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism,'' published in 1976.\n       Next month, Basic Books will reissue Bell's prophetic study \n     of post-industrial society. This was in many ways the first \n     serious effort to describe the new technological society that \n     has emerged in the United States over the past quarter-\n     century. Many of Bell's ideas are now commonplace--we are \n     surrounded by evidence that his analysis was correct--but at \n     the time, the transformation wasn't so obvious.\n       To accompany the 1999 edition, Bell has written a new \n     30,000-word foreword. (``I don't know how to write short,'' \n     he says.) Bell writes that in the new information age, even \n     the boundaries of time and space no longer hold. Economic \n     activity is global and instantaneous; the traditional \n     infrastructure that gave rise to cities--roads, rivers and \n     harbors--is becoming irrelevant. We are connected with \n     everywhere. Yet with all diffusion of information, Bell \n     observes, true knowledge remains rare and precious.\n       The problem that vexes Bell is one of scale. He argues that \n     societies tend to work smoothly when economic, social and \n     political activities fit well together. But there is an \n     obvious mismatch in today's global economy--where financial \n     life is centralized as never before but political life is \n     increasingly fragmented along ethnic and even tribal lines.\n       ``The national state has become too small for the big \n     problems of life, and too big for the small problems,'' Bell \n     writes. ``We find that the older social structures are \n     cracking because political scales of sovereignty and \n     authority do not match the economic scales.''\n       Bell is part of the Dream Team of American letters--the \n     group of Jewish intellectuals who grew up poor in New York in \n     the 1930s, learned their debating skills in the alcoves of \n     City College and went on to found the magazines and write he \n     books that\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\n     shaped America's understanding of itself. Because of the \n     antisemitism of American universities at the time, most of \n     them couldn't get teaching jobs at first. But today, their \n     names are legendary: Irving Kristol, Irving Howe, Nathan \n     Glazer, Norman Podhoretz and Bell.\n       What's especially admirable about Bell is how little he's \n     changed over the years. Many of the New York intellectuals \n     began as radical socialists and ended up as neo-\n     conservatives--a long journey, indeed. But Bell holds roughly \n     the same views he did when he was 15.\n       ``I'm a socialist in economics, a liberal in politics and a \n     conservative in culture.'' he said. He thinks it's a mistake \n     to force these different areas of thought onto a single \n     template. That ways lies dogmatism.\n       Another of Bell's virtues is that he doesn't go looking for \n     fights. He explains that as a matter of life history. His \n     father died in the influenza epidemic of 1920, when Bell was \n     just eight months old. His mother had to work in a garment \n     factory--leaving him in an orphanage part of the time. Bell \n     wanted to hold onto his friends, he says.\n       Religion has been an anchor in Bell's life, too. Indeed, he \n     said he began to doubt the Marxist view of history when he \n     considered the durability of the world's great religions. He \n     concluded that there were certain fundamental, existential \n     questions--about the meaning of life and death--that were \n     universal and unchanging, for which the great religions had \n     provided enduring answers.\n       The most endearing aspect of Bell's personality is his \n     sense of humor. Big thinkers are not always nimble and light-\n     hearted, but Bell can't go five minutes without telling a \n     joke--usually some sort of Jewish folk tale. Ask why he left \n     an early job at Fortune to go teach at Columbia, and he \n     recalls telling his boss, Henry Luce, that there were four \n     reasons: ``June, July, August and September.''\n       Recounting his family history, Bell remembers a \n     grandmother's remark when told at the end of World War I that \n     because of a border change, the family now lived in Poland, \n     rather than Russia. ``Thank God! I was getting so tired of \n     those Russian winters!''\n       Bell was my teacher and friend nearly 30 years ago at \n     Harvard. In those days, he taught a seminar on the history of \n     avant-garde movements. One of the assignments was to think up \n     a name for a polemical avant-garde journal.\n       So I ask Bell to take his own test. what name would he give \n     a journal if he was to start one today? He replies instantly: \n     ``THINK.''\n       As much as anyone in American life, he can lay claim to \n     that one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6082-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL DRUG COURT WEEK\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as I did around this time last \nyear, I want to recognize National Drug Court Week which is taking \nplace next week. Since the Senate will be in recess at that time, I \ntake this opportunity today to applaud our nation's drug courts and the \npeople who have made them the successes they are today.\n  Next week, the National Association of Drug Court Professionals will \nsponsor a training conference, suitably titled ``Celebrating Ten Years \nof Drug Courts: Honoring the Past, Looking to the Future,'' which will \nbe held in Miami Beach, Florida. This year approximately 3,000 \nprofessionals from across the country, including judges, prosecutors, \ndefense attorneys, law enforcement officers, corrections personnel, \nrehabilitation and treatment providers, educators, researchers and \ncommunity leaders will be attending the conference. These Drug Court \nprofessionals' dedication has had a significant positive impact on the \ncommunities they serve.\n  The two and a half day conference will coincide with National Drug \nCourt Week, June 1st though 7th, 1999. All across America, state and \nlocal governments have been recognizing drug courts and their dedicated \nprofessionals with resolutions, ceremonies and celebrations.\n  The Drug Court growth rate has been accelerating over the past \nseveral years. While the first Drug Court was established in 1989, \nthere are currently over 600 Drug Courts that are either operating or \nbeing established. This surge in growth is a product of success.\n  Drug Courts are revolutionizing the criminal justice system. The \nstrategy behind Drug Courts departs from traditional criminal justice \npractice by placing non-violent drug abusing offenders into intensive \ncourt supervised drug treatment programs instead of prison. Some Drug \nCourts target first time offenders, while others concentrate on \nhabitual offenders. They all aim to reduce drug abuse and crime by \nemploying a number of tools including comprehensive judicial \nmonitoring, drug testing and supervision, treatment and rehabilitative \nservices, and sanctions and incentives for drug offenders.\n  Statistics show us that Drug Courts work. It has been well documented \nthat both drug use and associated criminal behavior are substantially \nreduced among those offenders participating in the Drug Courts. More \nthan 70 percent of drug court clients have successfully completed the \nprogram or remain as active participants.\n  Drug Courts are also clearly cost-effective and help convert many \ndrug-using offenders into productive members of society. Traditional \nincarceration has yielded few gains for our drug offenders. The costs \nare too high and the rehabilitation rate is minimal. Our Drug Courts \nare proving to be an effective alternative to traditional \nrehabilitation methods and are make strides forward in our fight \nagainst both drugs and crime.\n  In 1997, General McCaffrey and I had the opportunity to visit the \nDenver Drug Court. Through this experience I was able to meet with \nDenver's Drug Court professionals and observe their judicial procedures \nand other program activities first hand. I was impressed with the \nDenver Drug Court professionals and procedures, and believe they will \nyield many successes.\n  Today, as the chairman of the Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Subcommittee, which funds the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, I feel it is fitting to recognize on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate the important contributions our nation's Drug Court \nprofessionals are making toward reducing drug use and crime in our \ncommunities in time for National Drug Court Week.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6082-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6082-S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO TIOGUE SCHOOL: 1999 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BLUE RIBBON \n                                 SCHOOL\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievement of Tiogue School of Coventry, Rhode Island, which was \nrecently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School. \nThis is the second time in 3 years that a school from Coventry has \nearned this honor.\n  It is a highly regarded distinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School. \nThrough an intensive selection process beginning at the state level and \ncontinuing through a federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, 266 of \nthe very best public and private schools in the Nation were identified \nas deserving of this special recognition. These schools are \nparticularly effective in meeting local, state, and national goals. \nHowever, this honor signifies not just who is best, but what works in \neducating today's children.\n  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to \nreach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and \nthat we make their education come alive. That is what Tiogue School is \ndoing. Tiogue is a kindergarten through sixth grade school, which \nproudly says that it is a school ``where everybody is somebody'' and \nwhere children come first. These are more than just catch-phrases for \nTiogue, which seeks to reach out to every student in the community and \nengages teachers, parents, and business and community leaders in the \nimportant job of education.\n  Teams of teachers work to develop appropriate but rigorous standards \nfor all students. The results are impressive. Tiogue students have \nexceeded the norms on state assessments in each of the past five years. \nBut Tiogue's teachers also work to develop a curriculum that extends \nfar beyond what the assessments measure. Each year, the school focuses \non a particular issue, subject, or theme. As a preface to the Summer \nOlympics, students studied world cultures with a focus on the diverse \nbackground of the student population. During another year, students \nstudied the arts and worked to develop their skills as artists, \nwriters, musicians, and dancers. This year, Tiogue is taking their \neducation to another level with an exploration of outer space.\n  Mr. President, Tiogue School is dedicated to the highest standards. \nIt is a school committed to a process of continuous improvement with a \nfocus on high student achievement. Most importantly, Tiogue recognizes \nthe value of the larger community and seeks its support and \ninvolvement. This school and community are making a huge difference in \nthe lives of its students.\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very \nbest we can do for students and the techniques that can be replicated \nin other schools to help all students succeed. I am proud to say that \nin Rhode Island we can look to a school like Tiogue School. Under the \nleadership of its principal, Denise Richtarik, its capable faculty, and \nits involved parents, Tiogue School will continue to be a shining \nexample for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6083-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        93RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nnational Federated Boys Clubs, known today as the Boys and Girls Club \nof America.\n  Although the Boys Clubs were not organized nationally until 1906, \norigins of the club can be traced as far back as the mid-1800s. As \nearly as 1853, a Club-like facility was established in New York City \nfor the purpose of lodging newsboys. However, the first Boys Club, as \nwe know it today, wasn't established until 1860. The Dashaway Club in \nHartford, Connecticut is recognized as the first known Boys Club, which \nprovided afterschool activities for children from disadvantaged homes.\n  Soon the idea of a shelter for youth to spend time during non-school \nhours caught on. These clubs offered a safe place for children to \ncongregate and stay out of trouble. Rapidly, Boys Clubs sprouted up \naround the country. In the early years, the clubs were concentrated \nmostly in New England. By 1906, 53 separate Boys Clubs were in \nexistence. It was decided that these clubs should somehow work \ncollectively. On May 13, 1906, a group of businessmen and Boys Clubs \nrepresentatives met to discuss the idea of a national federation. Thus, \nthe Boys Clubs of America was born.\n  Although the clubs continue to operate autonomously, the national \norganization provides staff recruitment and training, program research, \nfacility construction, fundraising, and marketing. In addition, the \nnational club addresses legislative and public policy issues affecting \nyoung people. In 1956, the Boys Club celebrated its 50th anniversary \nand received a U.S. Congressional Charter. As more and more clubs were \nformed, the organization grew and began serving girls as well as boys. \nIn 1990, the name was officially changed to the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica. Today, there are over 2,200 clubs operating nationwide, \nserving over three million children. Minnesota is proud to be home to \n21 Boys and Girls Clubs, serving 33,456 children.\n  The Boys and Girls Clubs provides hope, inspiration, and the \nopportunity for children to realize their full potential as citizens. \nThese clubs provide guidance, support, and leadership, while \nencouraging youth to abstain from drugs and alcohol, strive for \nscholastic achievement, become involved in community service, develop \npersonal talents such as music or art, and explore career \nopportunities. Dedicated volunteers have helped the Boys and Girls \nClubs of America become a success.\n  Mr. President, on the 93rd anniversary of its founding, I applaud the \nhard work and dedication of the men, women and youth who have \ncontributed to the success of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. \nThrough their persistence and encouragement, youth across the country \nhave benefitted greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6083-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO 1998 AIR FORCE ACADEMY FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of the 1998 United States Air Force Academy Football \nTeam.\n  The 1998 ``Falcons'' may go down in history as one of the greatest \nfootball teams in Academy history. Their 12-1 record included their \nfirst outright Western Athletic Conference Championship, a bowl victory \nover the University of Washington, and the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, \nwhich is the most prized possession of the three service academies.\n  This team of over-achieving young men was lead by their Head Football \nCoach Fisher DeBerry, and his assistant coaches Richard Bell, Todd \nBynum, Dee Dowis, Dick Enga, Larry Fedora, Jimmy Hawkins, Jeff Hayes, \nCal McCombs, Tom Miller, Bob Noblitt, Jappy Oliver, Chuck Peterson, and \nSammy Steinmark. They are recognized as one of the finest coaching \nstaffs in the country.\n  On offense, the team was lead by seniors Mike Barron, Joe Cashman, \nSpanky Gilliam, Ryan Hill, Frank Mindrup, Blane Morgan, James Nate, \nDylan Newman, Matt Paroda, Brian Phillips, Barry Roche, Jemal \nSingleton, Matt Waszak, and Eric Woodring.\n  The defense was lead by seniors Tim Curry, Bryce Fisher, Billy Free, \nJeff Haugh, Jason Sanderson, Mike Tyler, and Charlton Warren.\n  Special team seniors Jason Kirkland and Alex Wright took care of the \npunting and place kicking duties.\n  The most impressive thing about these outstanding young men is that \nfollowing their graduation from the Academy they will all be moving on \nto serve our county as 2nd Lieutenants in the United States Air Force. \nThey are true student athletes who play the game for the enjoyment of \nthe sport. These young men are tremendous role models for the youth of \nour country, and our nation can take pride in their accomplishments.\n  I commend the Superintendent of the Air Force Academy, Lt. General \nTad Oelstrom, and Athletic Director Randy Spetman for their leadership \nin development an outstanding group of young men. They clearly possess \nthe ``right stuff.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6083-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO TWO GREAT NAVAL HEROES\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the wartime \nheroism and distinguished military service of Commander David H. \nMcClintock and Captain Bladen D. Claggett, retired officers of the \nUnited States Navy. Few men have exhibited the degree of bravery shown \nby these two men during the Second World War. While fighting for the \nU.S. Navy, these men took part in the greatest naval battle of all \ntime, Leyte Gulf. Their actions at this, the most substantial attack of \nthe Pacific War, severely limited the Japanese fleet at Leyte Gulf and \neventually led to a Japanese retreat from the area.\n  In October of 1944, Commander David H. McClintock of the U.S.S. \nDarter discovered the Japanese main fleet and fired the first shots of \nthe Battle for Leyte Gulf sinking the Japanese Flagship Atago, and \ncrippling the Japanese heavy cruiser Takao. Captain Bladen D. Claggett \nof the U.S.S. Dace was also involved in the battle engaging and sinking \nthe Japanese heavy Cruiser Maya. In attempting to close on the crippled \ncruiser, the Darter ran aground. The Darter's entire crew was rescued \nby the Dace, which ran the risk of grounding herself during the rescue.\n  The actions of these two brave men and their crews will be remembered \nforever, not only because of the heroics involved, but because they \nplayed a major role in preventing a disastrous defeat of the landing \nforce at Leyte Gulf.\n  Today, I salute the captains and crews of the U.S.S. Darter and \nU.S.S. Dace. I commend Captain David H. McClintock and Captain Bladen \nD. Claggett for their distinguished careers and contributions to the \nUnited States of America. I extend my sincerest congratulations to \nCaptain David H. McClintock and Captain Bladen D. Claggett, who will be \npresent at a ground-breaking ceremony May 29th, 1999, to establish an \nexhibit to the Marquette Maritime Museum commemorating their most \nheroic deeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6083-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6083-S6084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO IDA KLAUS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just days ago Ida Klaus, properly \ndescribed as a ``labor law pioneer,'' died at the age of 94. I had the \ngreat privilege of working with her in the Kennedy Administration in \n1961 when she advised us on the development of Executive Order 10988, \n``Employee-Management Cooperation in the Federal Service,'' a defining \nevent in the history of federal employment. She was a brilliant person, \nwarm and concerned for others in a way that made possible her great \nachievements.\n  Mr. President, I ask that her obituary from The New York Times of May \n20, 1999 be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\n        Ida Klaus, 94, Labor Lawyer For U.S. and New York, Dies\n\n                             (By Nick Ravo)\n\n       Ida Klaus, a labor law pioneer who became a high-ranking \n     New York City official in the 1950's and who wrote the law \n     that gave city employees the right to bargain collectively, \n     died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.\n       Ms. Klaus was a lifelong labor advocate whose sympathy for \n     the working classes was instilled in her by her mother. As a \n     young child growing up in the Brownsville section of \n     Brooklyn, she helped give free food from the family grocery \n     to striking factory workers.\n       She organized her first union while still in her teens. She \n     was one of three college women working as a waitress in the \n     summer with several professional waiters at the Gross & Baum \n     Hotel in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. One day, she heard that the \n     hotel planned to lay off some of the waiters.\n       ``I don't known where I got the nerve, but I said, `Let's \n     get together and have a meeting,' '' she said in a 1974 \n     interview in The New York Times.\n       Ms. Klaus became the spokeswoman for the waiters and \n     waitresses, and told the hotel management that if anyone was \n     discharged, they would all go.\n       ``At which point, Mr. Baum said he knew he shouldn't have \n     hired college girls,'' she recalled. ``But he didn't fire \n     anyone.''\n       Ms. Klaus's desire to become a lawyer also derived from the \n     experience of watching her mother battle the court system for \n     10 years over her husband's estate.\n       But after graduating from Hunter College and, in 1925, from \n     the Teachers Institute of Jewish Theological Seminary of \n     America, now the Albert A. List College, she was denied \n     admission to Columbia University Law School because she was a \n     woman.\n       She taught Hebrew until 1928, when she was admitted to the \n     law school with the first class to accept women. She received \n     her law degree in 1931.\n       After graduation, Ms. Klaus worked as a review lawyer for \n     the National Labor Relations Board in Washington. In 1948, \n     she took the post of solicitor for the National Labor \n     Relations Board, a position that made her the highest-ranking \n     female lawyer in the Federal Government.\n       In 1954, she was hired as counsel to the New York City \n     Department of Labor under Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She became \n     known as the author of the so-called Little Wagner Act, the \n     city version of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, \n     which recognized workers' rights to organize and bargain \n     collectively through unions of their choosing. The Federal \n     Wagner Act was named for the Mayor's father, Senator Robert \n     F. Wagner.\n       She also wrote Mayor Wagner's executive order creating the \n     first detailed code of labor relations for city employees.\n       ``She is one of the pioneers and champions of bringing law \n     and order into labor relations,'' said Robert S. Rifkin, a \n     lawyer and longtime friend whose father, Simon H. Rifkin, was \n     a law clerk for Ms. Klaus. ``She believed labor relations \n     ought not to be under the rule of tooth and claw.''\n       Ms. Klaus briefly worked in the Kennedy Administration in \n     1961 as a consultant for the first labor relations task force \n     for Federal employees.\n       She returned to New York in 1962 as director of staff \n     relations for the Board of Education, where she negotiated \n     what was reported to be the first citywide teachers' contract \n     in the country.\n       She left in 1975 to become a private arbitrator. In 1980, \n     President Jimmy Carter appointed her one of the three \n     negotiators in the Long Island Rail Road strike.\n       Ms. Klaus, was born on Jan. 8, 1905, received Columbia Law \n     School's Medal for excellence in 1996, and an honorary \n     doctorate in 1994 from the Jewish Theological Seminary.\n       No close relatives survive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6084-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6084-S6085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS: A GENTLEMAN OF PRINCIPLE\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Monday morning I was delighted--and \nhighly gratified--to find that the national media are finally catching \nup to a fact that many of us have known all along: The Honorable Mr. \nJustice Clarence Thomas is one of the brightest, most principled, and \nintellectually engaging member of the United States Supreme Court in a \ngeneration.\n  An article in Monday's The Washington Post headed ``After a Quiet \nSpell, Justice Finds Voice'' drew a profile of a Justice who refuses to \nsubvert to his own personal views the plain meaning of statutes passed \nby Congress; a Justice who is committed to protecting our basic \nAmerican political structure by respecting state sovereignty; and who \nexercises the patient to undertake the exhaustive historical research \nneeded to ascertain the original intent of the Founding Fathers in \nframing our Constitution.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, Mr. Justice Thomas is a remarkable American--\none who bears no resemblance to the often cruel and totally false \ncaricatures his critics have attempted to create. I shall not catalogue \nor dwell upon the many injustices Mr. Justice Thomas has suffered at \nthe hands of those who--for their own petty political purposes--have \nheaped abuse upon this fine man except to make this simple observation: \nClarence Thomas has found the strength to serve his country and remain \ntrue to his principles in the face of viciously unfair personal \ncriticism and his courage speaks volumes about the strength of his \ncharacter.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article from The Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 24, 1999]\n\n After a Quite Spell, Justice Finds Voice--Conservative Thomas Emerges \n                       From the Shadow of Scalia\n\n                           (By Joan Biskupic)\n\n       He's been known by the company he's kept.\n       For the past eight years, Supreme Court Justice Clarence \n     Thomas has walked in the shadow of Justice Antonin Scalia. \n     The pair have voted together more than any other two \n     justices, staking out the court's conservative flank but also \n     inspiring criticism that Thomas is simply a ``clone'' or \n     ``puppet'' of the forceful, fiery-tempered Scalia.\n       But increasingly, Thomas has been breaking from Scalia, \n     taking pains to elaborate his own views and securing his \n     position as the most conservative justice on the court.\n       So far this term, Thomas has more than doubled the number \n     of opinions he has written to explain his individual \n     rationale, compared with the two previous terms. And even \n     though the most controversial, divisive cases of the term are \n     yet to be announced, Thomas already has voted differently \n     from Scalia in several significant disputes, including last \n     week's case on welfare payments for residents new to a state \n     and an earlier case on how public schools must treat disabled \n     children. Through these and other opinions, a more complex \n     portrait is emerging of the court's second black justice, who \n     had been best known among the public for the sexual \n     harassment accusations made against him during his 1991 \n     confirmation hearings.\n       ``I think Thomas has turned out to be a much more \n     interesting justice than his critics and probably even his \n     supporters expected,'' said Cass R. Sunstein, a University of \n     Chicago law professor. ``He is the strongest originalist on \n     the court, more willing to go back to history and `first \n     principles' of the Constitution.''\n       ``People in conservative legal circles are definitely \n     noticing that Thomas has found his voice,'' said Daniel E. \n     Troy, a District lawyer and protege of former conservative \n     judge Robert H. Bork. ``He is more willing to strike out on \n     his own.''\n       This term offers new evidence of Thomas's independent \n     thinking. Of the 45 decisions handed down so far (31 still \n     remain), Thomas has differed from Scalia in the bottom-line \n     ruling of five, and in five other cases he has been on the \n     same side as Scalia but has offered a separate rationale. \n     It's a substantial departure from their previous pattern: \n     Since 1991, Thomas and Scalia have voted together about 90 \n     percent of the time. As recently as two years ago, the two \n     voted together in all but one case.\n       For years, the reputations and practices of the two men \n     have helped feed the widespread impression that Thomas was \n     content to follow Scalia's lead. Scalia, a former law \n     professor at the University of Chicago and a longtime judge, \n     was already known for his narrow textualist reading of the \n     Constitution and federal statutes when he joined the high \n     court in 1986. His creative, aggressive approach inspired an \n     admiring appeals court judge to call Scalia a ``giant \n     flywheel in the great judicial machine.''\n       Thomas, meanwhile, had little reputation as a scholar when \n     he joined the court in 1991. He had worked in the federal \n     bureaucracy for nearly a decade, becoming prominent as \n     chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. His \n     conservatism, which included opposition to affirmative action \n     programs, was viewed mostly in political terms.\n       These impressions were reinforced by the two justices' \n     behavior at the high court. Scalia, the first Italian \n     American justice, is a stylist of the first order, with a \n     sharp, sardonic edge. Last year, for example, when he \n     rejected a legal standard used by the majority, he took a \n     page from Cole Porter, saying: ``Today's opinion resuscitates \n     the ne plus ultra, the Napoleon Brandy, the Mahatma Ghandi, \n     the Celophane of subjectivity, th' ol' shocks-the-conscience' \n     test. In another case, he said, ``I join the opinion of the \n     court except that portion which takes seriously, and thus \n     encourages in the future, an argument that should be laughed \n     out of court.''\n       Thomas, by contrast, was quiet in his early years, rarely \n     speaking during oral arguments and writing few of his own \n     concurring or dissenting opinions. He let Scalia hold the \n     pen: Whatever their joint views, Scalia, 63, tended to \n     write them up. Thomas, 50, merely signed on. Legal \n     scholars on both the right and left publicly criticized \n     Thomas as a pawn.\n       Now, however, Thomas is showing an increased willingness to \n     express himself, speaking before broader audiences and \n     writing more of his own opinions.\n       Thomas and Scalia are still very like-minded justices. More \n     than the other conservative members of the Rehnquist Court,\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\n     they believe the Constitution should be interpreted by \n     looking at its exact words and establishing the intentions of \n     the men who wrote it. They are unwilling to read into a \n     statute anything not explicitly stated. They want the \n     government--particularly the federal government--to get out \n     of people's lives.\n       But Thomas is becoming the more consistent standard-bearer \n     of this brand of conservatism. He would go further than \n     Scalia in overturning past court rulings that he believes \n     conflict with the Constitution. And he is more likely than \n     Scalia to delve into legal history predating the writing of \n     the Constitution in 1787 and more inclined to reject recent \n     case law.\n       In last week's welfare case, for example, Thomas began by \n     tracing a core constitutional provision from the 1606 Charter \n     of Virginia: ``Unlike the majority, I would look to history \n     to ascertain the original meaning of the Clause,'' he wrote. \n     While Scalia signed onto the majority opinion striking down \n     limited welfare benefits for residents newly arrived in a \n     state, Thomas and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist \n     dissented. Thomas wrote that the majority was wrongly \n     interpreting the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities \n     Clause, raising ``the specter that the . . . Clause will \n     become yet another convenient tool for inventing new rights, \n     limited solely by the predilections of those who happen at \n     the time to be members of this court.''\n       Thomas has also distinguished himself from Scalia by \n     seeking more strongly to buttress state authority. He has \n     emphasized that the Constitution's authority flows from ``the \n     consent of the people of each individual state, not the \n     consent of the undifferentiated people of the nation as a \n     whole.''\n       This accent on states' rights was evident in a case earlier \n     this term when only Thomas fully dissented from a voting \n     rights decision that he believed too broadly interpreted a \n     federal law targeting discrimination at the polls. ``The \n     section's interference with state sovereignty is quite \n     drastic,'' he complained.\n       In another example of Thomas's narrower reading of federal \n     law, he and Scalia were on opposite sides when the court \n     interpreted a statute intended to guarantee equal educational \n     opportunities for disabled school-children. Scalia voted with \n     the majority in the March case to find that the federal \n     disabilities law requires public schools to provide a wide \n     variety of medical care for children with severe handicaps.\n       Thomas dissented with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. \n     ``Congress enacted [the law] to increase the educational \n     opportunities available to disabled children, not to provide \n     medical care for them,'' Thomas wrote. ``[W]e must . . . \n     avoid saddling the states with obligations that they did not \n     anticipate.''\n       Because Scalia did not write separately in any of those \n     three recent cases--on welfare, voting rights and disabled \n     children--it is impossible to compare directly his thinking \n     with Thomas's. But differences between the two were visible \n     when they both dissented from an April ruling that said \n     defendants who plead guilty do not lose their right to remain \n     silent during a sentencing hearing and that judges cannot use \n     their silence against them. Scalia wrote the main opinion for \n     the four dissenting justices, attempting to discredit the \n     case law on which the majority relied. But Thomas also wrote \n     a separate opinion that went still further, suggesting that \n     an earlier case should be overturned altogether. The ``so-\n     called penalty'' of having one's silence used adversely, \n     Thomas wrote, ``lacks any constitutional significance.''\n       Some legal experts observe that Thomas's willingness to \n     give voice to his solitary views recalls Rehnquist's position \n     on the court in the 1970s and Scalia's in the late 1980s, \n     before Thomas came on. He's at a point, said Troy and other \n     observers, where he is comfortable enough to express his \n     singular views but not so frustrated with writing alone that \n     he is prepared to compromise.\n       ``Thomas comes to it more as an outsider,'' said Alan \n     Meese, a William and Mary law professor, who has followed the \n     writings of Scalia and Thomas. ``He probably says when he \n     looks at [an earlier ruling], `My God, we said that? That's \n     loony.' ''\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is abundantly clear that more judges \nlike Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court * * *. As further proof, I \noffer the disastrous decision of the Supreme Court--from which Justice \nThomas sensibly dissented--in the case of Davis v. Monroe County School \nBoard. By a 5-4 margin, the Supreme Court held that public schools can \nbe held liable under federal law for failing to stop so-called sexual \nharassment on the part of school children.\n  Exactly what constitutes sexual harassment on the part of children is \nnot defined by the Court, Mr. President. Moreover, what constitutes the \nvague ``deliberate indifference'' standard that public school \nadministrators must now avoid is anyone's guess. The meaning will no \ndoubt be haggled over in countless frivolous lawsuits in federal court \nthat will impose unnecessary financial costs on beleaguered school \ndistricts.\n  As the cacophony countless exhortations to spend ever-increasing \namounts of money on federal education programs continue, Mr. President, \nshould we not also address the financial problems federal laws cause to \nlocal school boards in our increasingly litigious society? For if more \ndistinguished judges like Clarence Thomas are not present to rein in \nlawsuit-happy interest groups (e.g. the National Women's Law Center, \nwhich brought this case in the first place), we will find even the most \ntrivial aspects of children's regrettable but predictable boorishness \nregulated by federal judges.\n  Playground teasing and immature behavior does not require a federal \nlawsuit, Mr. President; it may require a good spanking. Unfortunately, \nwe often find that reasonable discipline measures result in legal \naction as well. Pity the taxpayer who pays the bill, Mr. President--and \npity the students and teachers who must navigate this baffling legal \nminefield.\n  So thank Heaven for Clarence Thomas, who is doing his level best to \nhold the line against foolish decisions. We must hope the Senate will \nsoon act to rectify the devastating financial effects frivolous \nlawsuits are imposing on school boards and local taxpayers across the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6085-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6085-S6153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  On May 20, 1999, the Senate passed S. 254, the Violent and Repeat \nJuvenile Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) at the outset of the 20th century, the States adopted a \n     separate justice system for juvenile offenders;\n       (2) violent crimes committed by juveniles, such as \n     homicide, rape, and robbery, were an unknown phenomenon then, \n     but the rate at which juveniles commit such crimes has \n     escalated astronomically since that time;\n       (3) in 1994--\n       (A) the number of persons arrested overall for murder in \n     the United States decreased by 5.8 percent, but the number of \n     persons who are less than 15 years of age arrested for murder \n     increased by 4 percent; and\n       (B) the number of persons arrested for all violent crimes \n     increased by 1.3 percent, but the number of persons who are \n     less than 15 years of age arrested for violent crimes \n     increased by 9.2 percent, and the number of persons less than \n     18 years of age arrested for such crimes increased by 6.5 \n     percent;\n       (4) from 1985 to 1996, the number of persons arrested for \n     all violent crimes increased by 52.3 percent, but the number \n     of persons under age 18 arrested for violent crimes rose by \n     75 percent;\n       (5) the number of juvenile offenders is expected to undergo \n     a massive increase during the first 2 decades of the twenty-\n     first century, culminating in an unprecedented number of \n     violent offenders who are less than 18 years of age;\n       (6) the rehabilitative model of sentencing for juveniles, \n     which Congress rejected for adult offenders when Congress \n     enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, is inadequate and \n     inappropriate for dealing with many violent and repeat \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (7) the Federal Government should encourage the States to \n     experiment with progressive solutions to the escalating \n     problem of juveniles who commit violent crimes and who are \n     repeat offenders, including prosecuting such offenders as \n     adults, but should not impose specific strategies or programs \n     on the States;\n       (8) an effective strategy for reducing violent juvenile \n     crime requires greater collection of investigative data and \n     other information, such as fingerprints and DNA evidence, as \n     well as greater sharing of such information--\n       (A) among Federal, State, and local agencies, including the \n     courts; and\n       (B) among the law enforcement, educational, and social \n     service systems;\n       (9) data regarding violent juvenile offenders should be \n     made available to the adult criminal justice system if \n     recidivism by criminals is to be addressed adequately;\n       (10) holding juvenile proceedings in secret denies victims \n     of crime the opportunity to attend and be heard at such \n     proceedings, helps juvenile offenders to avoid accountability \n     for their actions, and shields juvenile proceedings from \n     public scrutiny and accountability;\n       (11) the injuries and losses suffered by the victims of \n     violent crime are no less painful or devastating because the \n     offender is a juvenile; and\n       (12) the prevention, investigation, prosecution, \n     adjudication, and punishment of criminal offenses committed \n     by juveniles, and the rehabilitation and correction of \n     juvenile offenders are, and should remain, primarily the \n     responsibility of the States, to be carried out without \n     interference from the Federal Government.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reform Federal juvenile justice programs and \n     policies in order to promote the emergence of juvenile \n     justice systems in which the paramount concerns are providing \n     for the safety of the public and holding juvenile wrongdoers \n     accountable for their actions, while providing the wrongdoer \n     a genuine opportunity for self-reform;\n       (2) to revise the procedures in Federal court that are \n     applicable to the prosecution of juvenile offenders; and\n       (3) to encourage and promote, consistent with the ideals of \n     federalism, adoption of policies by the States to ensure that \n     the victims of violent crimes committed by juveniles receive \n     the same level of justice as do victims of violent crimes \n     that are committed by adults.\n\n     SEC. 3. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n                    TITLE I--JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101.

GRANTS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE RELATED \n                   STRESS TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that a child's brain is \n     wired between the ages of 0-3. A child's ability to learn, \n     develop healthy family and social relationships, resist peer \n     pressure, and control violent impulses depends on the quality \n     and quantity of brain stimulation he receives. Research shows \n     that children exposed to negative brain stimulation in the \n     form of physical and sexual abuse and violence in the family \n     or community causes the brain to be miswired making it \n     difficult for the child to be successful in life. \n     Intervention early in a child's life to correct the miswiring \n     is much more successful than adult rehabilitation efforts.\n       (b) In General.--The Secretary shall award grants, enter \n     into contracts or cooperative agreements to public and \n     nonprofit private entities, as well as to Indian tribes, \n     Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Native nonprofit corporations to \n     establish national and regional centers of excellence on \n     psychological trauma response and to identify the best \n     practices for treating psychiatric and behavioral disorders \n     resulting from children witnessing or experiencing such \n     stress.\n       (c) Priorities.--In awarding grants, contracts or \n     cooperative agreements under subsection (a) related to the \n     identifying best practices for treating disorders associated \n     with psychological trauma, the Secretary shall give priority \n     to programs that work with children, adolescents, adults, and \n     families who are survivors and witnesses of child abuse, \n     domestic, school, and community violence, and disasters.\n       (d) Geographical Distribution.--The Secretary shall ensure \n     that grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under \n     subsection (a) with respect to centers of excellence are \n     distributed equitably among the regions of the country and \n     among urban and rural areas.\n       (e) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall require that each \n     applicant for a grant, contract or cooperative agreement \n     under subsection (a) submit a plan as part of his application \n     for the rigorous evaluation of the activities funded under \n     the grant, contract or agreement, including both process and \n     outcomes evaluation, and the submission of an evaluation at \n     the end of the project period.\n       (f) Duration of Awards.--With respect to a grant, contract \n     or cooperative agreement under this section, the period \n     during which payments under such an award will be made to the \n     recipient may not be less than 3 years. Such grants, contract \n     or agreement may be renewed.\n       (g) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the General Accounting Office \n     shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives a \n     report concerning whether individuals are covered for post-\n     traumatic stress disorders under public and private health \n     plans, and the course of treatment, if any, that is covered.\n       (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section for fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal \n     years.\n     TITLE IV--VOLUNTARY MEDIA AGREEMENTS FOR CHILDREN'S PROTECTION\n                   Subtitle A--Children and the Media\n\n     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Children's Protection \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television is seen and heard in nearly every United \n     States home and is a uniquely pervasive presence in the daily \n     lives of Americans. The average American home has 2.5 \n     televisions, and a television is turned on in the average \n     American home 7 hours every day.\n       (2) Television plays a particularly significant role in the \n     lives of children. Figures provided by Nielsen Research show \n     that children between the ages of 2 years and 11 years spend \n     an average of 21 hours in front of a television each week.\n       (3) Television has an enormous capability to influence \n     perceptions, especially those of children, of the values and \n     behaviors that are common and acceptable in society.\n       (4) The influence of television is so great that its images \n     and messages often can be harmful to the development of \n     children. Social science research amply documents a strong \n     correlation between the exposure of children to televised \n     violence and a number of behavioral and psychological \n     problems.\n       (5) Hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that \n     children who are consistently exposed to violence on \n     television have a higher tendency to exhibit violent and \n     aggressive behavior, both as children and later in life.\n       (6) Such studies also show that repeated exposure to \n     violent programming causes children to become desensitized to \n     and more accepting of real-life violence and to grow more \n     fearful and less trusting of their surroundings.\n       (7) A growing body of social science research indicates \n     that sexual content on television can also have a significant \n     influence on the attitudes and behaviors of young viewers. \n     This research suggests that heavy exposure to programming \n     with strong sexual content contributes to the early \n     commencement of sexual activity among teenagers.\n       (8) Members of the National Association of Broadcasters \n     (NAB) adhered for many years to a comprehensive code of \n     conduct that was based on an understanding of the influence \n     exerted by television and on a widely held sense of \n     responsibility for using that influence carefully.\n       (9) This code of conduct, the Television Code of the \n     National Association of Broadcasters, articulated this sense \n     of responsibility as follows:\n       (A) ``In selecting program subjects and themes, great care \n     must be exercised to be\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n     sure that the treatment and presentation are made in good \n     faith and not for the purpose of sensationalism or to shock \n     or exploit the audience or appeal to prurient interests or \n     morbid curiosity.''.\n       (B) ``Broadcasters have a special responsibility toward \n     children. Programs designed primarily for children should \n     take into account the range of interests and needs of \n     children, from instructional and cultural material to a wide \n     variety of entertainment material. In their totality, \n     programs should contribute to the sound, balanced development \n     of children to help them achieve a sense of the world at \n     large and informed adjustments to their society.''.\n       (C) ``Violence, physical, or psychological, may only be \n     projected in responsibly handled contexts, not used \n     exploitatively. Programs involving violence present the \n     consequences of it to its victims and perpetrators. \n     Presentation of the details of violence should avoid the \n     excessive, the gratuitous and the instructional.''.\n       (D) ``The presentation of marriage, family, and similarly \n     important human relationships, and material with sexual \n     connotations, shall not be treated exploitatively or \n     irresponsibly, but with sensitivity.''.\n       (E) ``Above and beyond the requirements of the law, \n     broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in which \n     many of their programs are viewed. There shall be no graphic \n     portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. The portrayal of \n     implied sexual acts must be essential to the plot and \n     presented in a responsible and tasteful manner.''.\n       (10) The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned the \n     code of conduct in 1983 after three provisions of the code \n     restricting the sale of advertising were challenged by the \n     Department of Justice on antitrust grounds and a Federal \n     district court issued a summary judgment against the National \n     Association of Broadcasters regarding one of the provisions \n     on those grounds. However, none of the programming standards \n     of the code were challenged.\n       (11) While the code of conduct was in effect, its \n     programming standards were never found to have violated any \n     antitrust law.\n       (12) Since the National Association of Broadcasters \n     abandoned the code of conduct, programming standards on \n     broadcast and cable television have deteriorated \n     dramatically.\n       (13) In the absence of effective programming standards, \n     public concern about the impact of television on children, \n     and on society as a whole, has risen substantially. Polls \n     routinely show that more than 80 percent of Americans are \n     worried by the increasingly graphic nature of sex, violence, \n     and vulgarity on television and by the amount of programming \n     that openly sanctions or glorifies criminal, antisocial, and \n     degrading behavior.\n       (14) At the urging of Congress, the television industry has \n     taken some steps to respond to public concerns about \n     programming standards and content. The broadcast television \n     industry agreed in 1992 to adopt a set of voluntary \n     guidelines designed to ``proscribe gratuitous or excessive \n     portrayals of violence''. Shortly thereafter, both the \n     broadcast and cable television industries agreed to conduct \n     independent studies of the violent content in their \n     programming and make those reports public.\n       (15) In 1996, the television industry as a whole made a \n     commitment to develop a comprehensive rating system to label \n     programming that may be harmful or inappropriate for \n     children. That system was implemented at the beginning of \n     1999.\n       (16) Despite these efforts to respond to public concern \n     about the impact of television on children, millions of \n     Americans, especially parents with young children, remain \n     angry and frustrated at the sinking standards of television \n     programming, the reluctance of the industry to police itself, \n     and the harmful influence of television on the well-being of \n     the children and the values of the United States.\n       (17) The Department of Justice issued a ruling in 1993 \n     indicating that additional efforts by the television industry \n     to develop and implement voluntary programming guidelines \n     would not violate the antitrust laws. The ruling states that \n     ``such activities may be likened to traditional standard \n     setting efforts that do not necessarily restrain competition \n     and may have significant procompetitive benefits . . . . Such \n     guidelines could serve to disseminate valuable information on \n     program content to both advertisers and television viewers. \n     Accurate information can enhance the demand for, and increase \n     the output of, an industry's products or services.''.\n       (18) The Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-\n     437) states that television broadcasters in the United States \n     have a clear obligation to meet the educational and \n     informational needs of children.\n       (19) Several independent analyses have demonstrated that \n     the television broadcasters in the United States have not \n     fulfilled their obligations under the Children's Television \n     Act of 1990 and have not noticeably expanded the amount of \n     educational and informational programming directed at young \n     viewers since the enactment of that Act.\n       (20) The popularity of video and personal computer (PC) \n     games is growing steadily among children. Although most \n     popular video and personal computer games are educational or \n     harmless in nature, many of the most popular are extremely \n     violent. One recent study by Strategic Record Research found \n     that 64 percent of teenagers played video or personal \n     computer games on a regular basis. Other surveys of children \n     as young as elementary school age found that almost half of \n     them list violent computer games among their favorites.\n       (21) Violent video games often present violence in a \n     glamorized light. Game players are often cast in the role of \n     shooter, with points scored for each ``kill''. Similarly, \n     advertising for such games often touts violent content as a \n     selling point--the more graphic and extreme, the better.\n       (22) As the popularity and graphic nature of such video \n     games grows, so do their potential to negatively influence \n     impressionable children.\n       (23) Music is another extremely pervasive and popular form \n     of entertainment. American children and teenagers listen to \n     music more than any other demographic group. The Journal of \n     American Medicine reported that between the 7th and 12th \n     grades the average teenager listens to 10,500 hours of rock \n     or rap music, just slightly less than the entire number of \n     hours spent in the classroom from kindergarten through high \n     school.\n       (24) Teens are among the heaviest purchasers of music, and \n     are most likely to favor music genres that depict, and often \n     appear to glamorize violence.\n       (25) Music has a powerful ability to influence perceptions, \n     attitudes, and emotional state. The use of music as therapy \n     indicates its potential to increase emotional, psychological. \n     and physical health. That influence can be used for ill as \n     well.\n\n     SEC. 403.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be referred to as the ``Criminal Use of \n     Firearms by Felons (CUFF) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tragedies such as those occurring recently in the \n     communities of Pearl, Mississippi, Paducah, Kentucky, \n     Jonesboro, Arkansas, Springfield, Oregon, and Littleton, \n     Colorado are terrible reminders of the vulnerability of \n     innocent individuals to random and senseless acts of criminal \n     violence.\n       (2) The United States Congress has responded to the problem \n     of gun violence by passing numerous criminal statutes and by \n     supporting the development of law enforcement programs \n     designed both to punish the criminal misuse of weapons and \n     also to deter individuals from undertaking illegal acts.\n       (3) In 1988, the Administration initiated an innovative \n     program known as Project Achilles. The concept behind the \n     initiative was that the illegal possession of firearms was \n     the Achilles heel or the area of greatest vulnerability of \n     criminals. By aggressively prosecuting criminals with guns in \n     Federal court, the offenders were subject to stiffer \n     penalties and expedited prosecutions. The Achilles program \n     was particularly effective in removing the most violent \n     criminals from our communities.\n       (4) In 1991, the Administration expanded its efforts to \n     remove criminals with guns from our streets with Project \n     Triggerlock. Triggerlock continued the ideas formulated in \n     the Achilles program and committed the Department of Justice \n     resources to the prosecution effort. Under the program, every \n     United States Attorney was directed to form special teams of \n     Federal, State, and local investigators to look for gang and \n     drug cases that could be prosecuted as Federal weapon \n     violations. Congress appropriated additional funds to allow a \n     large number of new law enforcement officers and Federal \n     prosecutors to target these gun and drug offenders. In 1992, \n     approximately 7048 defendants were prosecuted under this \n     initiative.\n       (5) Since 1993, the number of ``Project Triggerlock'' type \n     gun prosecutions pursued by the Department of Justice has \n     fallen to approximately 3807 prosecutions in 1998. This is a \n     decline of over 40 percent in Federal prosecutions of \n     criminals with guns.\n       (6) The threat of criminal prosecution in the Federal \n     criminal justice system works to deter criminal behavior \n     because the Federal system is known for speedier trials and \n     longer prison sentences.\n       (7) The deterrent effect of Federal gun prosecutions has \n     been demonstrated recently by successful programs, such as \n     ``Project Exile'' in Richmond, Virginia, which resulted in a \n     22 percent decrease in violent crime since 1994.\n       (8) The Department of Justice's failure to prosecute the \n     criminal use of guns under existing Federal law undermines \n     the significant deterrent effect that these laws are meant to \n     produce.\n       (9) The Department of Justice already possesses a vast \n     array of Federal criminal statutes that, if used aggressively \n     to prosecute wrongdoers, would significantly reduce both the \n     threat of, and the incidence of, criminal gun violence.\n       (10) As an example, the Department of Justice has the \n     statutory authority in section 922(q) of title 18, United \n     States Code, to prosecute individuals who bring guns to \n     school zones. Although the Administration stated that over \n     6,000 students were expelled last year for bringing guns to \n     school, the Justice Department reports prosecuting only 8 \n     cases under section 922(q) in 1998.\n       (11) The Department of Justice is also empowered under \n     section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code, to prosecute \n     adults who transfer handguns to juveniles. In 1998, the \n     Department of Justice reports having prosecuted only 6 \n     individuals under this provision.\n       (12) The Department of Justice's utilization of existing \n     prosecutorial power is 1 of the most significant steps that \n     can be taken to reduce the number of criminal acts involving \n     guns, and represents a better response to the problem of \n     criminal violence than the enactment of new, symbolic laws, \n     which, if current Departmental trends hold, would likely be \n     underutilized.\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\n     SEC. 803.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that States receiving Federal \n     elementary and secondary education funding should require \n     local educational agencies to conduct, for each of their \n     employees (regardless of when hired) and prospective \n     employees, a nationwide background check for the purpose of \n     determining whether the employee has been convicted of a \n     crime that bears upon his fitness to have responsibility for \n     the safety or well-being of children, to serve in the \n     particular capacity in which he is (or is to be) employed, or \n     otherwise to be employed at all thereby.\n              TITLE XII--TEACHER LIABILITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n     SEC. 1201.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The ability of teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals to teach, inspire and shape the intellect of \n     our Nation's elementary and secondary school students is \n     deterred and hindered by frivolous lawsuits and litigation.\n       (2) Each year more and more teachers, principals and other \n     school professionals face lawsuits for actions undertaken as \n     part of their duties to provide millions of school children \n     quality educational opportunities.\n       (3) Too many teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals face increasingly severe and random acts of \n     violence in the classroom and in schools.\n       (4) Providing teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals a safe and secure environment is an important \n     part of the effort to improve and expand educational \n     opportunities.\n       (5) Clarifying and limiting the liability of teachers, \n     principals and other school professionals who undertake \n     reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline and an \n     appropriate educational environment is an appropriate subject \n     of Federal legislation because--\n       (A) the national scope of the problems created by the \n     legitimate fears of teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals about frivolous, arbitrary or capricious \n     lawsuits against teachers; and\n       (B) millions of children and their families across the \n     Nation depend on teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals for the intellectual development of the \n     children.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide \n     teachers, principals and other school professionals the tools \n     they need to undertake reasonable actions to maintain order, \n     discipline and an appropriate educational environment.\n\n     SEC. 1203. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This title preempts the laws of any State \n     to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this \n     title, except that this title shall not preempt any State law \n     that provides additional protection from liability relating \n     to teachers.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This \n     title shall not apply to any civil action in a State court \n     against a teacher in which all parties are citizens of the \n     State if such State enacts a statute in accordance with State \n     requirements for enacting legislation--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this title \n     shall not apply, as of a date certain, to such civil action \n     in the State; and\n       (3) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 1204.

LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any civil action against a teacher, \n     based on an action of a teacher acting within the scope of \n     the teacher's responsibilities to a school or governmental \n     entity, the liability of the teacher for noneconomic loss \n     shall be determined in accordance with subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant who is a teacher, shall be \n     liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to \n     that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect \n     to which that defendant is liable. The court shall render a \n     separate judgment against each defendant in an amount \n     determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant who is a teacher under this section, the trier of\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\n     fact shall determine the percentage of responsibility of that \n     defendant for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 1206.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Violence Prevention \n     Training for Early Childhood Educators Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide grants to \n     institutions that carry out early childhood education \n     training programs to enable the institutions to include \n     violence prevention training as part of the preparation of \n     individuals pursuing careers in early childhood development \n     and education.\n\n     SEC. 1303. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Aggressive behavior in early childhood is the single \n     best predictor of aggression in later life.\n       (2) Aggressive and defiant behavior predictive of later \n     delinquency is increasing among our Nation's youngest \n     children. Without prevention efforts, higher percentages of \n     juveniles are likely to become violent juvenile offenders.\n       (3) Research has demonstrated that aggression is primarily \n     a learned behavior that develops through observation, \n     imitation, and direct experience. Therefore, children who \n     experience violence as victims or as witnesses are at \n     increased risk of becoming violent themselves.\n       (4) In a study at a Boston city hospital, 1 out of every 10 \n     children seen in the primary care clinic had witnessed a \n     shooting or a stabbing before the age of 6, with 50 percent \n     of the children witnessing in the home and 50 percent of the \n     children witnessing in the streets.\n       (5) A study in New York found that children who had been \n     victims of violence within their families were 24 percent \n     more likely to report violent behavior as adolescents, and \n     adolescents who had grown up in families where partner \n     violence occurred were 21 percent more likely to report \n     violent delinquency than individuals not exposed to violence.\n       (6) Aggression can become well-learned and difficult to \n     change by the time a child reaches adolescence. Early \n     childhood offers a critical period for overcoming risk for \n     violent behavior and providing support for prosocial \n     behavior.\n       (7) Violence prevention programs for very young children \n     yield economic benefits. By providing health and stability to \n     the individual child and the child's family, the programs may \n     reduce expenditures for medical care, special education, and \n     involvement with the judicial system.\n       (8) Primary prevention can be effective. When preschool \n     teachers teach young children interpersonal problem-solving \n     skills and other forms of conflict resolution, children are \n     less likely to demonstrate problem behaviors.\n       (9) There is evidence that family support programs in \n     families with children from birth through 5 years of age are \n     effective in preventing delinquency.\n\n     SEC. 1304. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) At-risk child.--The term ``at-risk child'' means a \n     child who has been affected by violence through direct \n     exposure to child abuse, other domestic violence, or violence \n     in the community.\n       (2) Early childhood education training program.--The term \n     ``early childhood education training program'' means a \n     program that--\n       (A)(i) trains individuals to work with young children in \n     early child development programs or elementary schools; or\n       (ii) provides professional development to individuals \n     working in early child development programs or elementary \n     schools;\n       (B) provides training to become an early childhood \n     education teacher, an elementary school teacher, a school \n     counselor, or a child care provider; and\n       (C) leads to a bachelor's degree or an associate's degree, \n     a certificate for working with young children (such as a \n     Child Development Associate's degree or an equivalent \n     credential), or, in the case of an individual with such a \n     degree, certificate, or credential, provides professional \n     development.\n       (3) Elementary school.--The term ``elementary school'' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n       (4) Violence prevention.--The term ``violence prevention'' \n     means--\n       (A) preventing violent behavior in children;\n       (B) identifying and preventing violent behavior in at-risk \n     children; or\n       (C) identifying and ameliorating violent behavior in \n     children who act out violently.\n\n     SEC. 1305.

LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL ALCOHOL PROHIBITIONS \n                   THAT REDUCE JUVENILE CRIME IN REMOTE ALASKA \n                   VILLAGES.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the \n     following:\n       (1) Villages in remote areas of Alaska lack local law \n     enforcement due to the absence of a tax base to support such \n     services and to small populations that do not secure \n     sufficient funds under existing State and Federal grant \n     program formulas.\n       (2) State troopers are often unable to respond to reports \n     of violence in remote villages if there is inclement weather, \n     and often only respond in reported felony cases.\n       (3) Studies conclude that alcohol consumption is strongly \n     linked to the commission of violent crimes in remote Alaska \n     villages and that youth are particularly susceptible to \n     developing chronic criminal behaviors associated with alcohol \n     in the absence of early intervention.\n       (4) Many remote villages have sought to limit the \n     introduction of alcohol into their communities as a means of \n     early intervention and to reduce criminal conduct among \n     juveniles.\n       (5) In many remote villages, there is no person with the \n     authority to enforce these local alcohol restrictions in a \n     manner consistent with judicical standards of due process \n     required under the State and Federal constitutions.\n       (6) Remote Alaska villages are experiencing a marked \n     increase in births and the number of juveniles residing in \n     villages is expected to increase dramatically in the next 5 \n     years.\n       (7) Adoption of alcohol prohibitions by voters in remote \n     villages represents a community-based effort to reduce \n     juvenile crime, but this local policy choice requires local \n     law enforcement to be effective.\n       (b) Grant of Federal Funds.--(1) The Attorney General is \n     authorized to provide to the State of Alaska funds for State \n     law enforcement, judicial infrastructure and other costs \n     necessary in remote villages to implement the prohibitions on \n     the sale, importation and possession of alcohol adopted \n     pursuant to State local option statutes.\n       (2) Funds provided to the State of Alaska under this \n     section shall be in addition to and shall not disqualify the \n     State, local governments, or Indian tribes (as that term is \n     defined in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638, as amended; 25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e) (1998)) from Federal funds available under other \n     authority.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this section--\n       (A) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (B) $17,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       (2) Source of sums.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     under this subsection may be derived from the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 1629.

BOUNTY HUNTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) bounty hunters, also known as bail enforcement officers \n     or recovery agents, provide law enforcement officers and the \n     courts with valuable assistance in recovering fugitives from \n     justice;\n       (2) regardless of the differences in their duties, skills, \n     and responsibilities, the public has had difficulty in \n     discerning the difference between law enforcement officers \n     and bounty hunters;\n       (3) the availability of bail as an alternative to the \n     pretrial detention or unsecured release of criminal \n     defendants is important to the effective functioning of the \n     criminal justice system;\n       (4) the safe and timely return to custody of fugitives who \n     violate bail contracts is an important matter of public \n     safety, as is the return of any other fugitive from justice;\n       (5) bail bond agents are widely regulated by the States, \n     whereas bounty hunters are largely unregulated;\n       (6) the public safety requires the employment of qualified, \n     well-trained bounty hunters; and\n       (7) in the course of their duties, bounty hunters often \n     move in and affect interstate commerce.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``bail bond agent'' means any retail seller of \n     a bond to secure the release of a criminal defendant pending \n     judicial proceedings, unless such person also is self-\n     employed to obtain the recovery of any fugitive from justice \n     who has been released on bail;\n       (2) the term ``bounty hunter''--\n       (A) means any person whose services are engaged, either as \n     an independent contractor or as an employee of a bounty \n     hunter employer, to obtain the recovery of any fugitive from \n     justice who has been released on bail; and\n       (B) does not include any--\n       (i) law enforcement officer acting under color of law;\n       (ii) attorney, accountant, or other professional licensed \n     under applicable State law;\n       (iii) employee whose duties are primarily internal audit or \n     credit functions;\n       (iv) person while engaged in the performance of official \n     duties as a member of the Armed Forces on active duty (as \n     defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States \n     Code); or\n       (v) bail bond agent;\n       (3) the term ``bounty hunter employer''--\n       (A) means any person that--\n       (i) employs 1 or more bounty hunters; or\n       (ii) provides, as an independent contractor, for \n     consideration, the services of 1 or more bounty hunters \n     (which may include the services of that person); and\n       (B) does not include any bail bond agent; and\n       (4) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means a public \n     officer or employee authorized under applicable Federal or \n     State law to conduct or engage in the prevention, \n     investigation, prosecution, or adjudication of criminal \n     offenses, including any public officer or employee engaged in \n     corrections, parole, or probation functions, or the recovery \n     of any fugitive from justice.\n       (c) Model Guidelines.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall develop \n     model guidelines for the State control and regulation of \n     persons employed or applying for employment as bounty \n     hunters. In developing such\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\n     guidelines, the Attorney General shall consult with \n     organizations representing--\n       (A) State and local law enforcement officers;\n       (B) State and local prosecutors;\n       (C) the criminal defense bar;\n       (D) bail bond agents;\n       (E) bounty hunters; and\n       (F) corporate sureties.\n       (2) Recommendations.--The guidelines developed under \n     paragraph (1) shall include recommendations of the Attorney \n     General regarding whether--\n       (A) a person seeking employment as a bounty hunter should--\n       (i) be required to submit to a fingerprint-based criminal \n     background check prior to entering into the performance of \n     duties pursuant to employment as a bounty hunter; or\n       (ii) not be allowed to obtain such employment if that \n     person has been convicted of a felony offense under Federal \n     or State law;\n       (B) bounty hunters and bounty hunter employers should be \n     required to obtain adequate liability insurance for actions \n     taken in the course of performing duties pursuant to \n     employment as a bounty hunter; and\n       (C) State laws should provide--\n       (i) for the prohibition on bounty hunters entering any \n     private dwelling, unless the bounty hunter first knocks on \n     the front door and announces the presence of 1 or more bounty \n     hunters; and\n       (ii) the official recognition of bounty hunters from other \n     States.\n       (3) Effect on bail.--The guidelines published under \n     paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of the estimated \n     effect, if any, of the adoption of the guidelines by the \n     States on--\n       (A) the cost and availability of bail; and\n       (B) the bail bond agent industry.\n       (4) No regulatory authority.--Nothing in this subsection \n     may be construed to authorize the promulgation of any Federal \n     regulation relating to bounty hunters, bounty hunter \n     employers, or bail bond agents.\n       (5) Publication of guidelines.--The Attorney General shall \n     publish model guidelines developed pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     in the Federal Register.\n\n     SEC. 1631.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The Nation's highest priority should be to ensure that \n     children begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of brain cells actually changes the physical \n     structure of the brain itself and that without a stimulating \n     environment, a baby's brain will suffer. At birth, a baby's \n     brain contains 100,000,000,000 neurons, roughly as many nerve \n     cells as there are stars in the Milky Way, but the wiring \n     pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children \n     who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains \n     that are 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n       (3) This scientific research also conclusively demonstrates \n     that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits \n     for children, families, and the Nation.\n       (4) Since more than 50 percent of the mothers of children \n     under the age of 3 now work outside of the home, society must \n     change to provide new supports so young children receive the \n     attention and care that they need.\n       (5) There are 12,000,000 children under the age of 3 in the \n     United States today and 1 in 4 lives in poverty.\n       (6) Compared with most other industrialized countries, the \n     United States has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher \n     proportion of low-birth weight babies, and a smaller \n     proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n       (7) National and local studies have found a strong link \n     between--\n       (A) lack of early intervention for children; and\n       (B) increased violence and crime among youth.\n       (8) The United States will spend more than $35,000,000,000 \n     over the next 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or \n     delinquent youth and child welfare programs, which address \n     crisis situations that frequently could have been avoided or \n     made much less severe through good early intervention for \n     children.\n       (9) Many local communities across the country have \n     developed successful early childhood efforts and with \n     additional resources could expand and enhance opportunities \n     for young children.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Federal funding for early childhood development \n     collaboratives should be a priority in the Federal budget for \n     fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years.\n\n     SEC. 1633.

EXTENSION OF BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO GUN SHOWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than 4,400 traditional gun shows are held annually \n     across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees \n     per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers;\n       (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and \n     other organized events, at which a large number of firearms \n     are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the \n     national firearms market;\n       (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n     organized events move easily in and substantially affect \n     interstate commerce;\n       (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at a gun show, flea market, or other \n     organized event, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, \n     and the raw materials from which it is manufactured have \n     moved in interstate commerce;\n       (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at \n     which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at \n     which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often \n     without background checks and without records that enable gun \n     tracing;\n       (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events \n     at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns without \n     background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be \n     traced to later commit crimes;\n       (7) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows, \n     flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to \n     attend these events and engage in the interstate \n     transportation of firearms obtained at these events;\n       (8) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is \n     exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea \n     markets, and other organized events;\n       (9) firearms associated with gun shows have been \n     transferred illegally to residents of another State by \n     Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, \n     and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug \n     offenses, crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal \n     possession of firearms by felons and other prohibited \n     persons; and\n       (10) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that criminals \n     and other prohibited persons\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n     do not obtain firearms at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n     organized events.\n       (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(35) Gun show.--The term `gun show' means any event--\n       ``(A) at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited \n     for sale, transfer, or exchange, if 1 or more of the firearms \n     has been shipped or transported in, or otherwise affects, \n     interstate or foreign commerce; and\n       ``(B) at which--\n       ``(i) not less than 20 percent of the exhibitors are \n     firearm exhibitors;\n       ``(ii) there are not less than 10 firearm exhibitors; or\n       ``(iii) 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, transfer, \n     or exchange.\n       ``(36) Gun show promoter.--The term `gun show promoter' \n     means any person who organizes, plans, promotes, or operates \n     a gun show.\n       ``(37) Gun show vendor.--The term `gun show vendor' means \n     any person who exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, \n     or exchanges 1 or more firearms at a gun show, regardless of \n     whether or not the person arranges with the gun show promoter \n     for a fixed location from which to exhibit, sell, offer for \n     sale, transfer, or exchange 1 or more firearms.''\n       (c) Regulation of Firearms Transfers at Gun Shows.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``James Guelff Body Armor \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 1642. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n     facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly \n     weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n       (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n     interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n       (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n     affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n     over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n     control this traffic within their own borders through the \n     exercise of their police power;\n       (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n     Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers \n     of body armor and a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n     California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n     outfitted in body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to \n     community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor \n     during the commission of a violent crime;\n       (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n     of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been \n     saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 \n     times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n       (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n     of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n       (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n     police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n     needed by Federal agencies; and\n       (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n     that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\n     SEC. 1643.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Citizens have an individual right, under the Second \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, to keep and bear \n     arms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearms Owners \n     Protection Act of 1986 specifically state that it is not the \n     intent of Congress to frustrate the free exercise of that \n     right in enacting Federal legislation. The free exercise of \n     that right includes law abiding firearms owners buying, \n     selling, trading, and collecting guns in accordance with \n     Federal, State, and local laws for whatever lawful use they \n     deem desirable.\n       (2) The Internet is a powerful information medium, which \n     has and continues to be an excellent tool to educate citizens \n     on the training, education and safety programs available to \n     use firearms safely and responsibly. It has, and should \n     continue to develop, as a 21st century tool for ``e-\n     commerce'' and marketing many products, including firearms \n     and sporting goods. Many web sites related to these topics \n     are sponsored in large part by the sporting firearms and \n     hunting community.\n       (3) It is the intent of Congress that this legislation be \n     applied where the Internet is being exploited to violate the \n     applicable explosives and firearms laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1663. PROHIBITIONS ON USES OF THE INTERNET.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) at the outset of the 20th century, the States adopted a \n     separate justice system for juvenile offenders;\n       (2) violent crimes committed by juveniles, such as \n     homicide, rape, and robbery, were an unknown phenomenon then, \n     but the rate at which juveniles commit such crimes has \n     escalated astronomically since that time;\n       (3) in 1994--\n       (A) the number of persons arrested overall for murder in \n     the United States decreased by 5.8 percent, but the number of \n     persons who are less than 15 years of age arrested for murder \n     increased by 4 percent; and\n       (B) the number of persons arrested for all violent crimes \n     increased by 1.3 percent, but the number of persons who are \n     less than 15 years of age arrested for violent crimes \n     increased by 9.2 percent, and the number of persons less than \n     18 years of age arrested for such crimes increased by 6.5 \n     percent;\n       (4) from 1985 to 1996, the number of persons arrested for \n     all violent crimes increased by 52.3 percent, but the number \n     of persons under age 18 arrested for violent crimes rose by \n     75 percent;\n       (5) the number of juvenile offenders is expected to undergo \n     a massive increase during the first 2 decades of the twenty-\n     first century, culminating in an unprecedented number of \n     violent offenders who are less than 18 years of age;\n       (6) the rehabilitative model of sentencing for juveniles, \n     which Congress rejected for adult offenders when Congress \n     enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, is inadequate and \n     inappropriate for dealing with many violent and repeat \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (7) the Federal Government should encourage the States to \n     experiment with progressive solutions to the escalating \n     problem of juveniles who commit violent crimes and who are \n     repeat offenders, including prosecuting such offenders as \n     adults, but should not impose specific strategies or programs \n     on the States;\n       (8) an effective strategy for reducing violent juvenile \n     crime requires greater collection of investigative data and \n     other information, such as fingerprints and DNA evidence, as \n     well as greater sharing of such information--\n       (A) among Federal, State, and local agencies, including the \n     courts; and\n       (B) among the law enforcement, educational, and social \n     service systems;\n       (9) data regarding violent juvenile offenders should be \n     made available to the adult criminal justice system if \n     recidivism by criminals is to be addressed adequately;\n       (10) holding juvenile proceedings in secret denies victims \n     of crime the opportunity to attend and be heard at such \n     proceedings, helps juvenile offenders to avoid accountability \n     for their actions, and shields juvenile proceedings from \n     public scrutiny and accountability;\n       (11) the injuries and losses suffered by the victims of \n     violent crime are no less painful or devastating because the \n     offender is a juvenile; and\n       (12) the prevention, investigation, prosecution, \n     adjudication, and punishment of criminal offenses committed \n     by juveniles, and the rehabilitation and correction of \n     juvenile offenders are, and should remain, primarily the \n     responsibility of the States, to be carried out without \n     interference from the Federal Government.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reform Federal juvenile justice programs and \n     policies in order to promote the emergence of juvenile \n     justice systems in which the paramount concerns are providing \n     for the safety of the public and holding juvenile wrongdoers \n     accountable for their actions, while providing the wrongdoer \n     a genuine opportunity for self-reform;\n       (2) to revise the procedures in Federal court that are \n     applicable to the prosecution of juvenile offenders; and\n       (3) to encourage and promote, consistent with the ideals of \n     federalism, adoption of policies by the States to ensure that \n     the victims of violent crimes committed by juveniles receive \n     the same level of justice as do victims of violent crimes \n     that are committed by adults.\n\n     SEC. 3. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n                    TITLE I--JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101. SURRENDER TO STATE AUTHORITIES.\n\n       Section 5001 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking the first undesignated paragraph and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``Whenever any person who is less than 18 years of age is \n     been arrested and charged with the commission of an offense \n     (or an act of delinquency that would be an offense were it \n     committed by an adult) punishable in any court of the United \n     States or of the District of Columbia, the United States \n     Attorney for the district in which such person has been \n     arrested may forego prosecution pursuant to section \n     5032(a)(2) if, after investigation by the United States \n     Attorney, it appears that--\n       ``(1) such person has committed an act that is also an \n     offense or an act of delinquency under the law of any State \n     or the District of Columbia;\n       ``(2) such State or the District of Columbia, as \n     applicable, can and will assume jurisdiction over such \n     juvenile and will take such juvenile into custody and deal \n     with the juvenile in accordance with the law of such State or \n     the District of Columbia, as applicable; and\n       ``(3) it is in the best interests of the United States and \n     of the juvenile offender.''.\n\n     SEC. 102.

GRANTS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE RELATED \n                   STRESS TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that a child's brain is \n     wired between the ages of 0-3. A child's ability to learn, \n     develop healthy family and social relationships, resist peer \n     pressure, and control violent impulses depends on the quality \n     and quantity of brain stimulation he receives. Research shows \n     that children exposed to negative brain stimulation in the \n     form of physical and sexual abuse and violence in the family \n     or community causes the brain to be miswired making it \n     difficult for the child to be successful in life. \n     Intervention early in a child's life to correct the miswiring \n     is much more successful than adult rehabilitation efforts.\n       (b) In General.--The Secretary shall award grants, enter \n     into contracts or cooperative agreements to public and \n     nonprofit private entities, as well as to Indian tribes, \n     Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Native nonprofit corporations to \n     establish national and regional centers of excellence on \n     psychological trauma response and to identify the best \n     practices for treating psychiatric and behavioral disorders \n     resulting from children witnessing or experiencing such \n     stress.\n       (c) Priorities.--In awarding grants, contracts or \n     cooperative agreements under subsection (a) related to the \n     identifying best practices for treating disorders associated \n     with psychological trauma, the Secretary shall give priority \n     to programs that work with children, adolescents, adults, and \n     families who are survivors and witnesses of child abuse, \n     domestic, school, and community violence, and disasters.\n       (d) Geographical Distribution.--The Secretary shall ensure \n     that grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under \n     subsection (a) with respect to centers of excellence are \n     distributed equitably among the regions of the country and \n     among urban and rural areas.\n       (e) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall require that each \n     applicant for a grant, contract or cooperative agreement \n     under subsection (a) submit a plan as part of his application \n     for the rigorous evaluation of the activities funded under \n     the grant, contract or agreement, including both process and \n     outcomes evaluation, and the submission of an evaluation at \n     the end of the project period.\n       (f) Duration of Awards.--With respect to a grant, contract \n     or cooperative agreement under this section, the period \n     during which payments under such an award will be made to the \n     recipient may not be less than 3 years. Such grants, contract \n     or agreement may be renewed.\n       (g) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the General Accounting Office \n     shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives a \n     report concerning whether individuals are covered for post-\n     traumatic stress disorders under public and private health \n     plans, and the course of treatment, if any, that is covered.\n       (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section for fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal \n     years.\n     TITLE IV--VOLUNTARY MEDIA AGREEMENTS FOR CHILDREN'S PROTECTION\n                   Subtitle A--Children and the Media\n\n     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Children's Protection \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television is seen and heard in nearly every United \n     States home and is a uniquely pervasive presence in the daily \n     lives of Americans. The average American home has 2.5 \n     televisions, and a television is turned on in the average \n     American home 7 hours every day.\n       (2) Television plays a particularly significant role in the \n     lives of children. Figures provided by Nielsen Research show \n     that children between the ages of 2 years and 11 years spend \n     an average of 21 hours in front of a television each week.\n       (3) Television has an enormous capability to influence \n     perceptions, especially those of children, of the values and \n     behaviors that are common and acceptable in society.\n       (4) The influence of television is so great that its images \n     and messages often can be harmful to the development of \n     children. Social science research amply documents a strong \n     correlation between the exposure of children to televised \n     violence and a number of behavioral and psychological \n     problems.\n       (5) Hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that \n     children who are consistently exposed to violence on \n     television have a higher tendency to exhibit violent and \n     aggressive behavior, both as children and later in life.\n       (6) Such studies also show that repeated exposure to \n     violent programming causes children to become desensitized to \n     and more accepting of real-life violence and to grow more \n     fearful and less trusting of their surroundings.\n       (7) A growing body of social science research indicates \n     that sexual content on television can also have a significant \n     influence on the attitudes and behaviors of young viewers. \n     This research suggests that heavy exposure to programming \n     with strong sexual content contributes to the early \n     commencement of sexual activity among teenagers.\n       (8) Members of the National Association of Broadcasters \n     (NAB) adhered for many years to a comprehensive code of \n     conduct that was based on an understanding of the influence \n     exerted by television and on a widely held sense of \n     responsibility for using that influence carefully.\n       (9) This code of conduct, the Television Code of the \n     National Association of Broadcasters, articulated this sense \n     of responsibility as follows:\n       (A) ``In selecting program subjects and themes, great care \n     must be exercised to be\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n     sure that the treatment and presentation are made in good \n     faith and not for the purpose of sensationalism or to shock \n     or exploit the audience or appeal to prurient interests or \n     morbid curiosity.''.\n       (B) ``Broadcasters have a special responsibility toward \n     children. Programs designed primarily for children should \n     take into account the range of interests and needs of \n     children, from instructional and cultural material to a wide \n     variety of entertainment material. In their totality, \n     programs should contribute to the sound, balanced development \n     of children to help them achieve a sense of the world at \n     large and informed adjustments to their society.''.\n       (C) ``Violence, physical, or psychological, may only be \n     projected in responsibly handled contexts, not used \n     exploitatively. Programs involving violence present the \n     consequences of it to its victims and perpetrators. \n     Presentation of the details of violence should avoid the \n     excessive, the gratuitous and the instructional.''.\n       (D) ``The presentation of marriage, family, and similarly \n     important human relationships, and material with sexual \n     connotations, shall not be treated exploitatively or \n     irresponsibly, but with sensitivity.''.\n       (E) ``Above and beyond the requirements of the law, \n     broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in which \n     many of their programs are viewed. There shall be no graphic \n     portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. The portrayal of \n     implied sexual acts must be essential to the plot and \n     presented in a responsible and tasteful manner.''.\n       (10) The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned the \n     code of conduct in 1983 after three provisions of the code \n     restricting the sale of advertising were challenged by the \n     Department of Justice on antitrust grounds and a Federal \n     district court issued a summary judgment against the National \n     Association of Broadcasters regarding one of the provisions \n     on those grounds. However, none of the programming standards \n     of the code were challenged.\n       (11) While the code of conduct was in effect, its \n     programming standards were never found to have violated any \n     antitrust law.\n       (12) Since the National Association of Broadcasters \n     abandoned the code of conduct, programming standards on \n     broadcast and cable television have deteriorated \n     dramatically.\n       (13) In the absence of effective programming standards, \n     public concern about the impact of television on children, \n     and on society as a whole, has risen substantially. Polls \n     routinely show that more than 80 percent of Americans are \n     worried by the increasingly graphic nature of sex, violence, \n     and vulgarity on television and by the amount of programming \n     that openly sanctions or glorifies criminal, antisocial, and \n     degrading behavior.\n       (14) At the urging of Congress, the television industry has \n     taken some steps to respond to public concerns about \n     programming standards and content. The broadcast television \n     industry agreed in 1992 to adopt a set of voluntary \n     guidelines designed to ``proscribe gratuitous or excessive \n     portrayals of violence''. Shortly thereafter, both the \n     broadcast and cable television industries agreed to conduct \n     independent studies of the violent content in their \n     programming and make those reports public.\n       (15) In 1996, the television industry as a whole made a \n     commitment to develop a comprehensive rating system to label \n     programming that may be harmful or inappropriate for \n     children. That system was implemented at the beginning of \n     1999.\n       (16) Despite these efforts to respond to public concern \n     about the impact of television on children, millions of \n     Americans, especially parents with young children, remain \n     angry and frustrated at the sinking standards of television \n     programming, the reluctance of the industry to police itself, \n     and the harmful influence of television on the well-being of \n     the children and the values of the United States.\n       (17) The Department of Justice issued a ruling in 1993 \n     indicating that additional efforts by the television industry \n     to develop and implement voluntary programming guidelines \n     would not violate the antitrust laws. The ruling states that \n     ``such activities may be likened to traditional standard \n     setting efforts that do not necessarily restrain competition \n     and may have significant procompetitive benefits . . . . Such \n     guidelines could serve to disseminate valuable information on \n     program content to both advertisers and television viewers. \n     Accurate information can enhance the demand for, and increase \n     the output of, an industry's products or services.''.\n       (18) The Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-\n     437) states that television broadcasters in the United States \n     have a clear obligation to meet the educational and \n     informational needs of children.\n       (19) Several independent analyses have demonstrated that \n     the television broadcasters in the United States have not \n     fulfilled their obligations under the Children's Television \n     Act of 1990 and have not noticeably expanded the amount of \n     educational and informational programming directed at young \n     viewers since the enactment of that Act.\n       (20) The popularity of video and personal computer (PC) \n     games is growing steadily among children. Although most \n     popular video and personal computer games are educational or \n     harmless in nature, many of the most popular are extremely \n     violent. One recent study by Strategic Record Research found \n     that 64 percent of teenagers played video or personal \n     computer games on a regular basis. Other surveys of children \n     as young as elementary school age found that almost half of \n     them list violent computer games among their favorites.\n       (21) Violent video games often present violence in a \n     glamorized light. Game players are often cast in the role of \n     shooter, with points scored for each ``kill''. Similarly, \n     advertising for such games often touts violent content as a \n     selling point--the more graphic and extreme, the better.\n       (22) As the popularity and graphic nature of such video \n     games grows, so do their potential to negatively influence \n     impressionable children.\n       (23) Music is another extremely pervasive and popular form \n     of entertainment. American children and teenagers listen to \n     music more than any other demographic group. The Journal of \n     American Medicine reported that between the 7th and 12th \n     grades the average teenager listens to 10,500 hours of rock \n     or rap music, just slightly less than the entire number of \n     hours spent in the classroom from kindergarten through high \n     school.\n       (24) Teens are among the heaviest purchasers of music, and \n     are most likely to favor music genres that depict, and often \n     appear to glamorize violence.\n       (25) Music has a powerful ability to influence perceptions, \n     attitudes, and emotional state. The use of music as therapy \n     indicates its potential to increase emotional, psychological. \n     and physical health. That influence can be used for ill as \n     well.\n\n     SEC. 403.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be referred to as the ``Criminal Use of \n     Firearms by Felons (CUFF) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tragedies such as those occurring recently in the \n     communities of Pearl, Mississippi, Paducah, Kentucky, \n     Jonesboro, Arkansas, Springfield, Oregon, and Littleton, \n     Colorado are terrible reminders of the vulnerability of \n     innocent individuals to random and senseless acts of criminal \n     violence.\n       (2) The United States Congress has responded to the problem \n     of gun violence by passing numerous criminal statutes and by \n     supporting the development of law enforcement programs \n     designed both to punish the criminal misuse of weapons and \n     also to deter individuals from undertaking illegal acts.\n       (3) In 1988, the Administration initiated an innovative \n     program known as Project Achilles. The concept behind the \n     initiative was that the illegal possession of firearms was \n     the Achilles heel or the area of greatest vulnerability of \n     criminals. By aggressively prosecuting criminals with guns in \n     Federal court, the offenders were subject to stiffer \n     penalties and expedited prosecutions. The Achilles program \n     was particularly effective in removing the most violent \n     criminals from our communities.\n       (4) In 1991, the Administration expanded its efforts to \n     remove criminals with guns from our streets with Project \n     Triggerlock. Triggerlock continued the ideas formulated in \n     the Achilles program and committed the Department of Justice \n     resources to the prosecution effort. Under the program, every \n     United States Attorney was directed to form special teams of \n     Federal, State, and local investigators to look for gang and \n     drug cases that could be prosecuted as Federal weapon \n     violations. Congress appropriated additional funds to allow a \n     large number of new law enforcement officers and Federal \n     prosecutors to target these gun and drug offenders. In 1992, \n     approximately 7048 defendants were prosecuted under this \n     initiative.\n       (5) Since 1993, the number of ``Project Triggerlock'' type \n     gun prosecutions pursued by the Department of Justice has \n     fallen to approximately 3807 prosecutions in 1998. This is a \n     decline of over 40 percent in Federal prosecutions of \n     criminals with guns.\n       (6) The threat of criminal prosecution in the Federal \n     criminal justice system works to deter criminal behavior \n     because the Federal system is known for speedier trials and \n     longer prison sentences.\n       (7) The deterrent effect of Federal gun prosecutions has \n     been demonstrated recently by successful programs, such as \n     ``Project Exile'' in Richmond, Virginia, which resulted in a \n     22 percent decrease in violent crime since 1994.\n       (8) The Department of Justice's failure to prosecute the \n     criminal use of guns under existing Federal law undermines \n     the significant deterrent effect that these laws are meant to \n     produce.\n       (9) The Department of Justice already possesses a vast \n     array of Federal criminal statutes that, if used aggressively \n     to prosecute wrongdoers, would significantly reduce both the \n     threat of, and the incidence of, criminal gun violence.\n       (10) As an example, the Department of Justice has the \n     statutory authority in section 922(q) of title 18, United \n     States Code, to prosecute individuals who bring guns to \n     school zones. Although the Administration stated that over \n     6,000 students were expelled last year for bringing guns to \n     school, the Justice Department reports prosecuting only 8 \n     cases under section 922(q) in 1998.\n       (11) The Department of Justice is also empowered under \n     section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code, to prosecute \n     adults who transfer handguns to juveniles. In 1998, the \n     Department of Justice reports having prosecuted only 6 \n     individuals under this provision.\n       (12) The Department of Justice's utilization of existing \n     prosecutorial power is 1 of the most significant steps that \n     can be taken to reduce the number of criminal acts involving \n     guns, and represents a better response to the problem of \n     criminal violence than the enactment of new, symbolic laws, \n     which, if current Departmental trends hold, would likely be \n     underutilized.\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\n     SEC. 803.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that States receiving Federal \n     elementary and secondary education funding should require \n     local educational agencies to conduct, for each of their \n     employees (regardless of when hired) and prospective \n     employees, a nationwide background check for the purpose of \n     determining whether the employee has been convicted of a \n     crime that bears upon his fitness to have responsibility for \n     the safety or well-being of children, to serve in the \n     particular capacity in which he is (or is to be) employed, or \n     otherwise to be employed at all thereby.\n              TITLE XII--TEACHER LIABILITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n     SEC. 1201.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The ability of teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals to teach, inspire and shape the intellect of \n     our Nation's elementary and secondary school students is \n     deterred and hindered by frivolous lawsuits and litigation.\n       (2) Each year more and more teachers, principals and other \n     school professionals face lawsuits for actions undertaken as \n     part of their duties to provide millions of school children \n     quality educational opportunities.\n       (3) Too many teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals face increasingly severe and random acts of \n     violence in the classroom and in schools.\n       (4) Providing teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals a safe and secure environment is an important \n     part of the effort to improve and expand educational \n     opportunities.\n       (5) Clarifying and limiting the liability of teachers, \n     principals and other school professionals who undertake \n     reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline and an \n     appropriate educational environment is an appropriate subject \n     of Federal legislation because--\n       (A) the national scope of the problems created by the \n     legitimate fears of teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals about frivolous, arbitrary or capricious \n     lawsuits against teachers; and\n       (B) millions of children and their families across the \n     Nation depend on teachers, principals and other school \n     professionals for the intellectual development of the \n     children.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide \n     teachers, principals and other school professionals the tools \n     they need to undertake reasonable actions to maintain order, \n     discipline and an appropriate educational environment.\n\n     SEC. 1203. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This title preempts the laws of any State \n     to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this \n     title, except that this title shall not preempt any State law \n     that provides additional protection from liability relating \n     to teachers.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This \n     title shall not apply to any civil action in a State court \n     against a teacher in which all parties are citizens of the \n     State if such State enacts a statute in accordance with State \n     requirements for enacting legislation--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this title \n     shall not apply, as of a date certain, to such civil action \n     in the State; and\n       (3) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 1204.

LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any civil action against a teacher, \n     based on an action of a teacher acting within the scope of \n     the teacher's responsibilities to a school or governmental \n     entity, the liability of the teacher for noneconomic loss \n     shall be determined in accordance with subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant who is a teacher, shall be \n     liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to \n     that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect \n     to which that defendant is liable. The court shall render a \n     separate judgment against each defendant in an amount \n     determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant who is a teacher under this section, the trier of\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\n     fact shall determine the percentage of responsibility of that \n     defendant for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 1206.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Violence Prevention \n     Training for Early Childhood Educators Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide grants to \n     institutions that carry out early childhood education \n     training programs to enable the institutions to include \n     violence prevention training as part of the preparation of \n     individuals pursuing careers in early childhood development \n     and education.\n\n     SEC. 1303. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Aggressive behavior in early childhood is the single \n     best predictor of aggression in later life.\n       (2) Aggressive and defiant behavior predictive of later \n     delinquency is increasing among our Nation's youngest \n     children. Without prevention efforts, higher percentages of \n     juveniles are likely to become violent juvenile offenders.\n       (3) Research has demonstrated that aggression is primarily \n     a learned behavior that develops through observation, \n     imitation, and direct experience. Therefore, children who \n     experience violence as victims or as witnesses are at \n     increased risk of becoming violent themselves.\n       (4) In a study at a Boston city hospital, 1 out of every 10 \n     children seen in the primary care clinic had witnessed a \n     shooting or a stabbing before the age of 6, with 50 percent \n     of the children witnessing in the home and 50 percent of the \n     children witnessing in the streets.\n       (5) A study in New York found that children who had been \n     victims of violence within their families were 24 percent \n     more likely to report violent behavior as adolescents, and \n     adolescents who had grown up in families where partner \n     violence occurred were 21 percent more likely to report \n     violent delinquency than individuals not exposed to violence.\n       (6) Aggression can become well-learned and difficult to \n     change by the time a child reaches adolescence. Early \n     childhood offers a critical period for overcoming risk for \n     violent behavior and providing support for prosocial \n     behavior.\n       (7) Violence prevention programs for very young children \n     yield economic benefits. By providing health and stability to \n     the individual child and the child's family, the programs may \n     reduce expenditures for medical care, special education, and \n     involvement with the judicial system.\n       (8) Primary prevention can be effective. When preschool \n     teachers teach young children interpersonal problem-solving \n     skills and other forms of conflict resolution, children are \n     less likely to demonstrate problem behaviors.\n       (9) There is evidence that family support programs in \n     families with children from birth through 5 years of age are \n     effective in preventing delinquency.\n\n     SEC. 1304. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) At-risk child.--The term ``at-risk child'' means a \n     child who has been affected by violence through direct \n     exposure to child abuse, other domestic violence, or violence \n     in the community.\n       (2) Early childhood education training program.--The term \n     ``early childhood education training program'' means a \n     program that--\n       (A)(i) trains individuals to work with young children in \n     early child development programs or elementary schools; or\n       (ii) provides professional development to individuals \n     working in early child development programs or elementary \n     schools;\n       (B) provides training to become an early childhood \n     education teacher, an elementary school teacher, a school \n     counselor, or a child care provider; and\n       (C) leads to a bachelor's degree or an associate's degree, \n     a certificate for working with young children (such as a \n     Child Development Associate's degree or an equivalent \n     credential), or, in the case of an individual with such a \n     degree, certificate, or credential, provides professional \n     development.\n       (3) Elementary school.--The term ``elementary school'' has \n     the meaning given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8801).\n       (4) Violence prevention.--The term ``violence prevention'' \n     means--\n       (A) preventing violent behavior in children;\n       (B) identifying and preventing violent behavior in at-risk \n     children; or\n       (C) identifying and ameliorating violent behavior in \n     children who act out violently.\n\n     SEC. 1305.

LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL ALCOHOL PROHIBITIONS \n                   THAT REDUCE JUVENILE CRIME IN REMOTE ALASKA \n                   VILLAGES.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the \n     following:\n       (1) Villages in remote areas of Alaska lack local law \n     enforcement due to the absence of a tax base to support such \n     services and to small populations that do not secure \n     sufficient funds under existing State and Federal grant \n     program formulas.\n       (2) State troopers are often unable to respond to reports \n     of violence in remote villages if there is inclement weather, \n     and often only respond in reported felony cases.\n       (3) Studies conclude that alcohol consumption is strongly \n     linked to the commission of violent crimes in remote Alaska \n     villages and that youth are particularly susceptible to \n     developing chronic criminal behaviors associated with alcohol \n     in the absence of early intervention.\n       (4) Many remote villages have sought to limit the \n     introduction of alcohol into their communities as a means of \n     early intervention and to reduce criminal conduct among \n     juveniles.\n       (5) In many remote villages, there is no person with the \n     authority to enforce these local alcohol restrictions in a \n     manner consistent with judicical standards of due process \n     required under the State and Federal constitutions.\n       (6) Remote Alaska villages are experiencing a marked \n     increase in births and the number of juveniles residing in \n     villages is expected to increase dramatically in the next 5 \n     years.\n       (7) Adoption of alcohol prohibitions by voters in remote \n     villages represents a community-based effort to reduce \n     juvenile crime, but this local policy choice requires local \n     law enforcement to be effective.\n       (b) Grant of Federal Funds.--(1) The Attorney General is \n     authorized to provide to the State of Alaska funds for State \n     law enforcement, judicial infrastructure and other costs \n     necessary in remote villages to implement the prohibitions on \n     the sale, importation and possession of alcohol adopted \n     pursuant to State local option statutes.\n       (2) Funds provided to the State of Alaska under this \n     section shall be in addition to and shall not disqualify the \n     State, local governments, or Indian tribes (as that term is \n     defined in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638, as amended; 25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e) (1998)) from Federal funds available under other \n     authority.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this section--\n       (A) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (B) $17,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       (2) Source of sums.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     under this subsection may be derived from the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 1629.

BOUNTY HUNTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) bounty hunters, also known as bail enforcement officers \n     or recovery agents, provide law enforcement officers and the \n     courts with valuable assistance in recovering fugitives from \n     justice;\n       (2) regardless of the differences in their duties, skills, \n     and responsibilities, the public has had difficulty in \n     discerning the difference between law enforcement officers \n     and bounty hunters;\n       (3) the availability of bail as an alternative to the \n     pretrial detention or unsecured release of criminal \n     defendants is important to the effective functioning of the \n     criminal justice system;\n       (4) the safe and timely return to custody of fugitives who \n     violate bail contracts is an important matter of public \n     safety, as is the return of any other fugitive from justice;\n       (5) bail bond agents are widely regulated by the States, \n     whereas bounty hunters are largely unregulated;\n       (6) the public safety requires the employment of qualified, \n     well-trained bounty hunters; and\n       (7) in the course of their duties, bounty hunters often \n     move in and affect interstate commerce.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``bail bond agent'' means any retail seller of \n     a bond to secure the release of a criminal defendant pending \n     judicial proceedings, unless such person also is self-\n     employed to obtain the recovery of any fugitive from justice \n     who has been released on bail;\n       (2) the term ``bounty hunter''--\n       (A) means any person whose services are engaged, either as \n     an independent contractor or as an employee of a bounty \n     hunter employer, to obtain the recovery of any fugitive from \n     justice who has been released on bail; and\n       (B) does not include any--\n       (i) law enforcement officer acting under color of law;\n       (ii) attorney, accountant, or other professional licensed \n     under applicable State law;\n       (iii) employee whose duties are primarily internal audit or \n     credit functions;\n       (iv) person while engaged in the performance of official \n     duties as a member of the Armed Forces on active duty (as \n     defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States \n     Code); or\n       (v) bail bond agent;\n       (3) the term ``bounty hunter employer''--\n       (A) means any person that--\n       (i) employs 1 or more bounty hunters; or\n       (ii) provides, as an independent contractor, for \n     consideration, the services of 1 or more bounty hunters \n     (which may include the services of that person); and\n       (B) does not include any bail bond agent; and\n       (4) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means a public \n     officer or employee authorized under applicable Federal or \n     State law to conduct or engage in the prevention, \n     investigation, prosecution, or adjudication of criminal \n     offenses, including any public officer or employee engaged in \n     corrections, parole, or probation functions, or the recovery \n     of any fugitive from justice.\n       (c) Model Guidelines.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall develop \n     model guidelines for the State control and regulation of \n     persons employed or applying for employment as bounty \n     hunters. In developing such\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\n     guidelines, the Attorney General shall consult with \n     organizations representing--\n       (A) State and local law enforcement officers;\n       (B) State and local prosecutors;\n       (C) the criminal defense bar;\n       (D) bail bond agents;\n       (E) bounty hunters; and\n       (F) corporate sureties.\n       (2) Recommendations.--The guidelines developed under \n     paragraph (1) shall include recommendations of the Attorney \n     General regarding whether--\n       (A) a person seeking employment as a bounty hunter should--\n       (i) be required to submit to a fingerprint-based criminal \n     background check prior to entering into the performance of \n     duties pursuant to employment as a bounty hunter; or\n       (ii) not be allowed to obtain such employment if that \n     person has been convicted of a felony offense under Federal \n     or State law;\n       (B) bounty hunters and bounty hunter employers should be \n     required to obtain adequate liability insurance for actions \n     taken in the course of performing duties pursuant to \n     employment as a bounty hunter; and\n       (C) State laws should provide--\n       (i) for the prohibition on bounty hunters entering any \n     private dwelling, unless the bounty hunter first knocks on \n     the front door and announces the presence of 1 or more bounty \n     hunters; and\n       (ii) the official recognition of bounty hunters from other \n     States.\n       (3) Effect on bail.--The guidelines published under \n     paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of the estimated \n     effect, if any, of the adoption of the guidelines by the \n     States on--\n       (A) the cost and availability of bail; and\n       (B) the bail bond agent industry.\n       (4) No regulatory authority.--Nothing in this subsection \n     may be construed to authorize the promulgation of any Federal \n     regulation relating to bounty hunters, bounty hunter \n     employers, or bail bond agents.\n       (5) Publication of guidelines.--The Attorney General shall \n     publish model guidelines developed pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     in the Federal Register.\n\n     SEC. 1631.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The Nation's highest priority should be to ensure that \n     children begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of brain cells actually changes the physical \n     structure of the brain itself and that without a stimulating \n     environment, a baby's brain will suffer. At birth, a baby's \n     brain contains 100,000,000,000 neurons, roughly as many nerve \n     cells as there are stars in the Milky Way, but the wiring \n     pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children \n     who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains \n     that are 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n       (3) This scientific research also conclusively demonstrates \n     that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits \n     for children, families, and the Nation.\n       (4) Since more than 50 percent of the mothers of children \n     under the age of 3 now work outside of the home, society must \n     change to provide new supports so young children receive the \n     attention and care that they need.\n       (5) There are 12,000,000 children under the age of 3 in the \n     United States today and 1 in 4 lives in poverty.\n       (6) Compared with most other industrialized countries, the \n     United States has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher \n     proportion of low-birth weight babies, and a smaller \n     proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n       (7) National and local studies have found a strong link \n     between--\n       (A) lack of early intervention for children; and\n       (B) increased violence and crime among youth.\n       (8) The United States will spend more than $35,000,000,000 \n     over the next 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or \n     delinquent youth and child welfare programs, which address \n     crisis situations that frequently could have been avoided or \n     made much less severe through good early intervention for \n     children.\n       (9) Many local communities across the country have \n     developed successful early childhood efforts and with \n     additional resources could expand and enhance opportunities \n     for young children.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Federal funding for early childhood development \n     collaboratives should be a priority in the Federal budget for \n     fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years.\n\n     SEC. 1633.

EXTENSION OF BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO GUN SHOWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than 4,400 traditional gun shows are held annually \n     across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees \n     per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers;\n       (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and \n     other organized events, at which a large number of firearms \n     are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the \n     national firearms market;\n       (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n     organized events move easily in and substantially affect \n     interstate commerce;\n       (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at a gun show, flea market, or other \n     organized event, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, \n     and the raw materials from which it is manufactured have \n     moved in interstate commerce;\n       (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at \n     which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at \n     which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often \n     without background checks and without records that enable gun \n     tracing;\n       (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events \n     at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns without \n     background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be \n     traced to later commit crimes;\n       (7) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows, \n     flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to \n     attend these events and engage in the interstate \n     transportation of firearms obtained at these events;\n       (8) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is \n     exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea \n     markets, and other organized events;\n       (9) firearms associated with gun shows have been \n     transferred illegally to residents of another State by \n     Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, \n     and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug \n     offenses, crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal \n     possession of firearms by felons and other prohibited \n     persons; and\n       (10) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that criminals \n     and other prohibited persons\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n     do not obtain firearms at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n     organized events.\n       (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(35) Gun show.--The term `gun show' means any event--\n       ``(A) at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited \n     for sale, transfer, or exchange, if 1 or more of the firearms \n     has been shipped or transported in, or otherwise affects, \n     interstate or foreign commerce; and\n       ``(B) at which--\n       ``(i) not less than 20 percent of the exhibitors are \n     firearm exhibitors;\n       ``(ii) there are not less than 10 firearm exhibitors; or\n       ``(iii) 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, transfer, \n     or exchange.\n       ``(36) Gun show promoter.--The term `gun show promoter' \n     means any person who organizes, plans, promotes, or operates \n     a gun show.\n       ``(37) Gun show vendor.--The term `gun show vendor' means \n     any person who exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, \n     or exchanges 1 or more firearms at a gun show, regardless of \n     whether or not the person arranges with the gun show promoter \n     for a fixed location from which to exhibit, sell, offer for \n     sale, transfer, or exchange 1 or more firearms.''\n       (c) Regulation of Firearms Transfers at Gun Shows.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``James Guelff Body Armor \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 1642. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n     facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly \n     weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n       (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n     interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n       (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n     affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n     over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n     control this traffic within their own borders through the \n     exercise of their police power;\n       (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n     Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers \n     of body armor and a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n     California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n     outfitted in body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to \n     community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor \n     during the commission of a violent crime;\n       (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n     of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been \n     saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 \n     times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n       (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n     of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n       (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n     police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n     needed by Federal agencies; and\n       (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n     that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\n     SEC. 1643.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Citizens have an individual right, under the Second \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, to keep and bear \n     arms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearms Owners \n     Protection Act of 1986 specifically state that it is not the \n     intent of Congress to frustrate the free exercise of that \n     right in enacting Federal legislation. The free exercise of \n     that right includes law abiding firearms owners buying, \n     selling, trading, and collecting guns in accordance with \n     Federal, State, and local laws for whatever lawful use they \n     deem desirable.\n       (2) The Internet is a powerful information medium, which \n     has and continues to be an excellent tool to educate citizens \n     on the training, education and safety programs available to \n     use firearms safely and responsibly. It has, and should \n     continue to develop, as a 21st century tool for ``e-\n     commerce'' and marketing many products, including firearms \n     and sporting goods. Many web sites related to these topics \n     are sponsored in large part by the sporting firearms and \n     hunting community.\n       (3) It is the intent of Congress that this legislation be \n     applied where the Internet is being exploited to violate the \n     applicable explosives and firearms laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1663. PROHIBITIONS ON USES OF THE INTERNET.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

Mr. President, I would like to make three comments on \nthe nomination of Mr. Kent Wiedemann, a career foreign service officer \nslated to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Let \nme say at the outset: I strongly oppose this nomination.\n  First, it is apparent that Mr. Wiedemann has done little to further \nthe cause of democracy in Burma where he has been Charge in Rangoon for \nthe past several years. When we met in my office a few months ago, I \nasked him to cite specific instance where he supported Burmese \ndemocracy activists. Mr. Wiedemann produced a single letter from \ndemoracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. However, he could not cite a single \naction or activity that he undertook on the ground to help strengthen \njustice and freedom in Burma. Not one.\n  In addition, I asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to \nrequest copies of all statements or speeches Mr. Wiedemann gave while \nserving in Burma which support the U.S. policy to restore the \nlegitimate government of Aung San Suu Kyi to office. During his entire \ntenure, he could not provide a single example of remarks made at a \nBurmese forum supporting U.S. policy or democracy.\n  Pro-democracy Burmese activists wrote to me to share their views of \nMr. Wiedemann's tenure in Rangoon:\n\n       The arrival of Mr. Wiedemann . . . has not changed much in \n     respect to our democracy movement.\n       [Wiedemann] remained inactive and ignorant to our vital \n     problems, human rights, democracy and refugee, and made no \n     efforts at seeking cooperation with our NGOs who had \n     extensive experience in these regards * * *. We were left in \n     the cold.\n       [There was] no coordination or effort on the part of the \n     embassy, to help the democracy movement of the exiles * * *. \n     Apart from regular meetings with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, we \n     knew of no efforts by Mr. Wiedemann.\n\n  These are not my words; they are those of courageous Burmese men and \nwomen who dare to stand for principles and justice. Yet, less than one \nmonth after the passing of Aung San Suu Kyi's husband, I understand \nthat Mr. Wiedemann again requested a letter from her in support of his \nnomination. He seems more interested in personal and career promotion \nthan advancing the cause of freedom in Burma.\n  Second, Mr. Wiedemann is simply the wrong American representative to \nsend to Cambodia at this difficult time. My colleagues may be \ninterested to know that in March, I visited that war ravaged country \nand was not encouraged by what I saw and heard. From Khmer Rouge trials \nto narcotics trafficking by the Cambodian military to rampant \ncorruption and pervasive lawlessness, the next U.S. Ambassador must be \na vocal advocate of human rights and the rule of law. When Mr. \nWiedemann's nomination was being considered last year, Prince Norodom \nRanariddh--then the First Prime Minister who had been outsted in a \nbloody coup d'etat in July 1997--and Sam Rainsy--an opposition leader \nwho has survived two assassination attempts since March 1997--expressed \ntheir grave concerns:\n\n       We urge you not to replace Ambassador Kenneth Quinn after \n     his term expires in Phnom Penh, and certianly not with Kent \n     Wiedemann who we believe may be less than supportive of the \n     cause of democracy in Cambodia.\n\n  Other Cambodian democracy activists have since joined the chorus of \nconcern with his nomination. Again, in their own words:\n\n       [We are] deeply concerned that Mr. Wiedemann will court CPP \n     [the Cambodian People's Party] strongman Hun Sen--at the \n     expense of the democratic opposition--in an attempt to win \n     him over.\n       This particular nomination sends the wrong message at the \n     wrong time to a government characterized by lawlessness and \n     corruption. Mr. Wiedemann may lack the credentials to \n     effectively promote American interests in Cambodia * * *. He \n     is not known as a vocal supporter of democracy in Southeast \n     Asia.\n\n  Despite my strong beliefs and the legitimate fears of those who would \nbe most affected by Mr. Wiedemann's appointment, it is clear that he \nwill be confirmed by the Senate. Therefore, let me make clear my \nexpectations of Mr. Wiedemann once he receives his credentials in Phnom \nPenh.\n  I expect him to meet regularly and publicly with opposition political \nparty leaders as well as democracy and human rights activists. I expect \nhim to openly embrace and actively encourage the rule of law in \nCambodia, even if this causes tensions with Prime Minister Hun Sen and \nthe ruling CPP party. I expect him to support international and local \nnongovernmental organizations in Phnom Penh committed to legal and \npolitical reforms. And, I expect that he will not shirk the awesome \nresponsibilities as the American people's representative to Cambodia, a \ntask that President Ronald Reagan described in February 1983:\n\n       The task that has fallen to us as Americans is to move the \n     conscience of the world, to keep alive the hope and dream of \n     freedom. For if we fail or falter, there'll be no place for \n     the world's oppressed to flee to. This is not the role we \n     sought. We preach no manifest destiny. But like the Americans \n     who brought a new nation into the world 200\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\n     years ago, history has asked much of us in our time. \n     (February 18, 1983)\n\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that Mr. Wiedemann will do a more \nnoteworthy job in Cambodia supporting democracy, human rights, and the \nrule of law than his lackluster performance in Burma. I will be \nfollowing his tenure in Cambodia to ensure that he does.\n  I have had this nomination on hold for more than a year. During that \ntime, Mr. Wiedemann has waged a campaign to support his nomination, \nenergy which might have been better directed by securing the declared \nU.S. goal of restoring the National League for Democracy to office. \nNonetheless, I do not think one Senator should thwart the nomination \nprocess. So, I leave it to my colleagues to allow his nomination to \nmove forward. I, for one, vote no.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say that we in the Senate tend to \nlook at these nominations as mere numbers. Because we deal with so many \nnominations in this body, we tend to forget that these numbers stand \nfor real people whose lives and dreams we are deciding upon.\n  I would like to talk in particular about one of these numbers, number \n77. He is someone who, in a way, represents all of these numbers.\n  Number 77--otherwise known as Dr. Ikram Khan--is a resident of the \nState of Nevada, and one of the most important citizens we have in \nNevada. He has served on the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners. \nHe has been involved in many, many charitable activities over the \ncourse of the past two decades. He is a skilled physician, an \noutstanding surgeon. He comes from a very substantial family, a family \nthat is highly regarded in the State of Nevada.\n  I say these things because Dr. Khan is an outstanding man. And he is \nall the more remarkable because he is a new citizen of the United \nStates--he immigrated from Pakistan. He exemplifies what is good about \nour country. He is someone who has come here from another country on \nanother continent, arrived in the United States, and hit the ground \nrunning. He worked hard and made a name for himself and his family and \nbuilt a successful career in a very short time.\n  And he was able to do all of that while taking the time to help \nothers. I'm not even including those whose health and lives he has \nsaved in his medical practice. I can't think of an event held in Nevada \ninvolving the public good that he has not been involved with in some \nway. We recently inaugurated a new Governor of the State of Nevada. Dr. \nKhan served very capably on his transition team.\n  In short, number 77 is an outstanding person, just as are all of \nthese people who are numbered here, 18, 72, 73, 74, 77 through 91. It's \nregrettable that we here tend to rush through these nominations, for \neach one of these people will dedicate significant time and effort in \nservice to this country.\n  Many of these nominations are of men and women who are being promoted \nto general officers in the armed forces, or are being promoted within \nthe rank of general. Dr. Khan, however, will serve as a Member of the \nBoard of Regents of the Uniformed Services University of the Health \nSciences, a nomination that I think sets him apart even in this group \nof good and able men and women. He will serve the University and this \ncountry at his own expense. He will devote many hours and days and \nweeks of his time doing this, and he does it willingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6155-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Older Americans Month is drawing to a \nclose. Before it ends, I would like to describe another Iowan whose \naccomplishments reflect an ageless spirit.\n\n\n                            margaret swanson\n\n  Margaret Swanson of Des Moines has been called the city's ``best \nknown and most beloved volunteer.'' Approaching age 80, she has \ncompleted 50 years of volunteer service.\n  Despite her pledge to slow down, she still maintains a heavy \nschedule. She estimates that she volunteers 20 hours to 25 hours a \nweek. Sometimes, she has four or five board meetings in a single day.\n  New causes present themselves, and Mrs. Swanson is not of a mind to \nsay no. Her varied interests have included the Iowa Lutheran Hospital, \nthe American Red Cross, the Girl Scouts, the East Des Moines Chamber of \nCommerce and the Iowa Caregivers Foundation. She identifies a need, \nimmerses herself in the task and produces the desired result.\n  When her church needed an elevator, she raised money to buy one. When \na used car center tried to open in her neighborhood, she fought for a \nday care center instead. When a home for children had an out-of-tune \npiano, she found an inexpensive tuner. No challenge appears too large \nor too small for her attention.\n  Mrs. Swanson's volunteer work has earned her such esteem that other \ncommunity activists clear their ideas with her before proceeding. Her \nfellow volunteers prize her knowledge and judgment.\n  Age doesn't seem to play a role in Mrs. Swanson's approach to \nvolunteerism. She is an outstanding volunteer, rather than an \noutstanding senior volunteer. Growing older means only that she brings \nmore experience and more wisdom to her work. In volunteerism, as in so \nmany other aspects of life, maturity is an asset, certainly not a \nliability.\n  During Older Americans Month, I want to thank Mrs. Swanson for her \nlimitless gifts of time and energy to the citizens of Des Moines. By \nsetting high standards of altruism, and by inspiring new generations of \nvolunteers, Mrs. Swanson perfectly illustrates the theme of Older \nAmericans Month, ``Honor the Past, Imagine the Future: Toward a Society \nfor All Ages.''\n\n\n                              ED JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is a saying that success is the \nrepetition of meaningful acts day after day. The most successful \nindividuals identify a single purpose and work toward that cause in any \ncapacity they can find.\n  An Iowan named Ed Johnston perfectly fits this definition of success. \nMr. Johnston, of Humboldt, Iowa, tirelessly devotes his days to helping \npeople with disabilities. He serves on the Governor's Developmental \nDisabilities Council, a position he earned after immersing himself in \nlearning about the agencies that serve those with disabilities.\n  Several days a week, he volunteers at the Humboldt County Courthouse \nto help people with special needs in five\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nsurrounding counties. He interacts with legislators about the \nimportance of providing proper job training to persons with \ndisabilities. He offers his expertise when someone seeks a wheelchair \nramp or assistive technology to accommodate a physical need.\n  Mr. Johnston brings the invaluable insight to his work of someone who \nhas lived the life of the people he seeks to help. He himself has a \nphysical disability, although no one would consider him limited in any \nway.\n  Those familiar with his work admire his compassion and persistence. \nHe is able to navigate the layers of government agencies that sometimes \nappear impenetrable to those who need services.\n  Another impressive element of Mr. Johnston's advocacy work is that it \nis his second career. In the early 1990s, he retired after 38 years of \nrunning his own shoe repair business and devoted himself to his current \nvocation.\n  The Humboldt Independent newspaper called Mr. Johnston ``a man on the \nmove.'' The description is accurate. He moves government agencies, \nlegislators and his community to respond to the needs of persons with \ndisabilities. At age 64, Mr. Johnston is the youngest of the Iowans I \nhave honored during Older Americans Month. I wish him many more years \nof his priceless work.\n\n\n                           fred and fern robb\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Fairfield Ledger of Fairfield, IA, \nprinted a photo of a newly married couple earlier this month. The groom \nis wearing a stylish suit and a wide smile. The equally resplendent \nbride has eyes only for her new husband.\n  The couple is picture-perfect, just like any other couple starting a \nnew life together. Unlike any other couple, the groom in this case is \nage 102.\n  The Rev. Fred Robb of Washington, Iowa, married Fern Claxton, 25 \nyears younger, at the Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Iowa, on April \n9, 1999. The couple renewed an old friendship at the Rev. Robb's 100th \nbirthday celebration in 1996. Among other meetings, they shared in the \n100th birthday celebration of the minister's brother, Milt Robb, in \nJanuary.\n  The Rev. Robb is one of more than 750 centenarians in Iowa. I don't \nknow for a fact, but I'd bet many of them approach aging with the same \npositive spirit as the Rev. Robb.\n  I run into a lot of older Iowans who don't impose unnatural limits on \nthemselves because of their age.

Mr. President, I would like to draw the Senate's \nattention to a growing embarrassment in our efforts to support counter-\ndrug programs in Mexico. The story would be funny if it weren't so \nserious and had not been going on for so long.\n  In 1996, the Department of Defense began the process of giving 73 \nsurplus UH-1H helicopters--Hueys--to Mexico to assist in counter \nsmuggling operations. The President approved this transfer in September \nand the helicopters began arriving in December.\n  The main justification at the time for this contribution was to stop \nmajor air smuggling into Mexico. The Colombian and Mexican drug cartels \nwere flying large quantities of drugs into Mexico in private airplanes. \nSometimes these were multiple flights, sometimes single ones. Usually \nthey were twin-engine propeller-driven aircraft, but occasionally they \nwere larger, commercial-sized cargo jets. Earlier in the 1990's, the \nU.S. State Department had instituted a program with Mexico's Attorney \nGeneral of developing a helicopter-based interdiction force. One can \nonly assume that DoD sought to engage Mexico's military in a similar \nway. Somewhere along the way, however, something went wrong.\n  Here's one for the books. We have a civilian State Department program \nwith the civilian Attorney General's office in Mexico operating an air \nforce that works. And we have the U.S. military operating a program \nwith the Mexican military to operate an air force that doesn't work.\n  It not only doesn't work, it does not have a purpose, so far as I can \ntell. I have asked the GAO to look at this issue twice, and they have \nhad a problem in identifying a purpose or results.\n  I have asked the Defense Department and it seems to be stumped as \nwell. The Mexican Government is puzzled. We ought to be dumbfounded.\n  Today, none of the 70-plus helicopters is flying. No one can tell me \nwhen they might be flying. No one seems to know how many might fly if \nthey ever do. No one seems to know what they are to do if they do fly. \nIt is unclear how they will be maintained. Or how much it will cost. Or \nwho is going to pay. Since no one knows the answer to any of these \nquestions, no one can tell me how many helicopters might be needed. Is \n70 too many? No one knows. Is this any way to run a airline?\n  I cannot seem to get a straightforward answer from the Administration \nabout what the plan for these helicopters is. As one U.S. embassy \nofficial noted to my staff last year, what to do with and about the \nhelicopters is a muddle. It is a muddle all right; but it is one of our \nmaking.\n  When plans were first announced about putting these helicopters in \nMexico, I began asking about the need for radars. Mexico lacks any \nsustained radar coverage of its southern approaches. If you are \nplanning an air interdiction program, it would seem logical to include \na plan for developing the eyes needed to make the program work. The \nresponse I got from both U.S. and Mexican officials to questions about \nradars was a deafening silence. Or vague promises. I kept asking. \nFinally, after about six months, the U.S. and Mexican Administrations \ninformed me that no radars were necessary. And why? Because there was \nno longer a major air trafficking threat; it was mostly maritime. And \nwhen did we know there was no longer a major air threat? In 1995. And \nwhen did we give Mexico the helicopters? In 1996. So far as I can tell, \nwe gave Mexico a capability to deal with a problem that both countries \nknew we no longer faced. Today the threat is mostly maritime. So why \nhelicopters?\n  Well, having taken that on board, the next question is, what are we \ngoing to have the helicopters do? It turns out that the best idea is to \nhave them ferry troops around to chop poppies or marijuana. But this is \nmostly in the mountains and the helos aren't very capable in the \nmountains. And how many helos are needed? It turns out there is no very \nclear answer. But before we got very far down that road, a problem was \ndiscovered that grounded all Hueys in 1998. This necessitated a \nworldwide assessment of the air worthiness of the equipment. Although \nthis was eventually done, the Mexican military refused to fly the \nhelicopters until they had more assurances that there were no air \nsafety questions. They also wanted more resources to fly the equipment. \nSo nothing was done and the helos sit.\n  As it happens, Hueys are old, Vietnam War-vintage aircraft. They are \nstill serviceable, but they are aging and need a lot of care and \nfeeding. It is also harder to get spare parts for them.\n  And being old, they are sometimes cranky. We gave Mexico 73 of these \nbirds in the spirit of cooperation. So, today, the helos in Mexico have \nbeen on the ground becoming very expensive museum-quality memorials to \nthe United States-Mexican partnership. While they sit, the air crews' \nqualifications for flying the equipment is in doubt. So even if we \ncould get the birds up tomorrow, it is not clear that the air crews are \nqualified to fly them. And we still aren't sure what they are supposed \nto do if we did. We are not even sure at this point if the Mexicans \nstill want the helos.\n  It is in this environment that I have asked the Department of Defense \nto provide me and Congress with a plan. Since no one in the past two to \nthree years seems to have a clue about what we are doing, I think it is \nreasonable and prudent to have a plan on the\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nrecord. This is not rocket science. But so far, I have not had much \nluck. Now, you would think that there would already be a plan.\n  Given the importance of our drug cooperation with Mexico it would not \nbe unreasonable to expect one. We have bilateral agreements. We have \nbinational strategies. We have joint measures of effectiveness. We have \nhad ``high-level contact group'' meetings at great public expense to \nboth countries. But apparently we have no plan. We have had recently \nseveral Administration visits to Mexico and more discussions. But there \nis no plan. The administration cannot seem to tell the difference \nbetween ``talking'' and a ``plan.''\n  I, for one, do not think that this is a situation we can accept any \nlonger. After three years of asking, one has to begin to wonder just \nwhat it is we think we are doing. I have not mentioned the C-26 \nairplanes that we gave to Mexico and other countries for which there \nappears to be just as much lack of thinking. That is for another time. \nBut there is one more piece to the helicopter story.\n  As of last week, a new problem has developed and all Hueys are \ngrounded again. This doesn't affect the helicopters in Mexico since \nthey weren't flying anyway, but it leaves us even more in doubt. The \nresult is an embarrassment for both countries.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/26/senate-section/article/S6157-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
