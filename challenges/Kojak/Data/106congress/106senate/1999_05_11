The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \nbegin consideration of the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \nAccountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999.\n  There are few issues that will come before the Senate this Congress \nthat touch the lives of more of our fellow Americans than our national \nresponse to juvenile crime. Crime and delinquency among our young \npeople is a problem that troubles us in our neighborhoods, in our \nschools and in our parks. It is the subject across the dinner table, \nand in those late night, worried conversations all parents have had at \none time or another. The subject is familiar--how can we prevent our \nchildren from falling victim--either to crime committed by another \njuvenile, or to the lure of drugs, crime, and gangs?\n  Their concerns are shared by all of us. Most of us are parents. Many \nof us are now proud grandparents. We have dealt with the challenges of \nraising children--the joys and the trying times. But for today's \nparents, the challenges they face are more complex. The temptations \nchildren confront come from many different directions and parents \nseemingly have less and less control over what it is their children are \nexposed to.\n  There is a sense among many Americans that we are powerless to \nreverse this trend, that we are powerless to deal with violent juvenile \ncrime, that we are powerless to change our culture. It is this feeling \nof powerlessness which may restrain our collective ambition for \nmeaningful, penetrating solutions in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. \nAs Dr. William Bennett said recently on a national talk show, if the \ntwo students who committed the murders at Columbine High had ``carried \nBibles and [said] Hail the Prince of Peace and King of Kings, they \nwould have been hauled into the principal's office.'' Instead, these \nyoung people who committed these crimes saluted Hitler and they were \nignored. Ironically, it seems the only time we promote morality in \nschool these days is when mourners\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\nvisit on-school memorials in the wake of tragedies like Littleton.\n  If the murder of twelve innocent students and one teacher cannot give \nus the backbone to shed this defeatism and to do what is right, then we \nare doomed to see more tragedies. I believe that as a nation we must do \nmore--and expect more--from our schools, the entertainment industry, \nour juvenile justice systems, and--where appropriate--the Department of \nJustice. We must also do more to empower parents in the raising of \ntheir children and help the States reform our juvenile justice systems.\n  True--the tragedy in Littleton was a bizarre and complex crime. For \nthat reason, we should resist the temptation to claim we have all of \nthe answers. And we should also fight the temptation to play politics \nwith the matter. We should examine this and other acts of school \nviolence and not single out one politically attractive interest as a \ncause.\n  Yet, we must also do more than simply talk about the problem. \nAccordingly, I along with several of my colleagues have developed--and \nwill advance this week--a comprehensive legislative plan to respond to \nthe problem of violent juvenile crime. Our Youth Violence Plan contains \nfour main components:\n  No. 1, prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local \ngovernment;\n  No. 2, parental empowerment and stemming the influence of cultural \nviolence;\n  No. 3, getting tough on violent juveniles and those who commit \nviolent crimes with a firearm; and\n  No. 4, providing for safe and secure schools.\n  Allow me to discuss each of these in more detail:\n  No. 1, prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local \ngovernment: The first tier of this plan involves passage of the measure \nwe are beginning consideration of today--S. 254, the Violent and Repeat \nJuvenile Offender and Accountability Act. We believe we should provide \na targeted infusion of funds to state and local authorities to combat \njuvenile crime. S. 254 provides $1 billion a year to the States to \nfight juvenile crime and prevent juvenile delinquency. We need to reach \nout to young children early in life, ensure that parents are empowered \nto do what they believe is best for their children, and take meaningful \nsteps to give local education and enforcement officials the tools they \nneed to hold violent juveniles accountable. I will discuss the \nunderlying bill in greater detail shortly.\n  No. 2, parental empowerment and stemming the influence of cultural \nviolence: The second tier of our plan involves steps Congress should \ntake to empower parents, educators and the entertainment industry to do \nmore to limit the exposure of America's children to violence in our \npopular culture. We plan to offer several amendments to the underlying \nbill which will further this leg of our plan. For example, parents \nshould be given the power to screen undesirable material from entering \ntheir homes over the Internet. I have an amendment I will offer to this \nbill which does just that. Senator Brownback's hearings on marketing \nviolence to children provided powerful evidence of the exposure of \nchildren to violence in music, movies, and video games. He and I plan \nto offer a measure to give the entertainment industry the tools it \nneeds to develop and enforce pre-existing ratings systems so that \nchildren are not exposed to material that the industry itself has \ndeemed unsuitable for children.\n  In recent years, the movies our children watch have become \nincreasingly violent. The video games they play reward virtual \nkillings. The lyrics of popular music have grown more violent and \ndepraved. And much of the violence and cruelty in modern music and \ncinema is directed toward women.\n  The President of the Motion Picture Association of America, Jack \nValenti, is a man of great intellect and a man who I admire. He \nrecently testified at a hearing that, ``I do earnestly believe that the \nmovie/TV industry has a solemn obligation . . . [to engage in] \ncreative scrutiny.'' He also notes that the industry has ``a duty to \ninform parents about film content.'' I agree with him and commend the \nindustry for some of the steps they have taken. But I believe the \nentertainment industry's ``obligation'' and ``duty'' go a bit further. \nIndeed, what good is a ratings system if it is not enforced? Is the \nindustry fulfilling its obligation to parents if, out of one side of \nits mouth, it take steps to inform parents that a particular video \ngame, movie, or CD is not suitable for children and then, out of the \nother side of its mouth, advertises, promotes, and sells this same \nmaterial to children?\n\n  Let me be clear. I am not standing here arguing that this filth \nshould be banned or regulated by the government. I simply believe we \nshould limit our young people's exposure to it. It is one thing to say \nthat Marilyn Manson or Eminem should be prohibited from producing their \nmaterial. It's another thing for Congress to condone the entertainment \nindustry's embracing of this garbage and its sale to children.\n  Exposure to violent and depraved material is just one part of a \ncomplex problem. But I do hope that we can encourage the industry to \nwork with us to do what is best for our children. Why can't this \nindustry, which is a source for so much good in America, do more to \ndiscourage the production and marketing of filth to children? Why \nshouldn't the industry help fight the marketing of violence to young \npeople? This week, I intend to give them the opportunity to do more.\n  No. 3, getting tough on violent juveniles and enforcing existing law: \nA third tier of our plan insures that violent juveniles--teenagers who \ncommit violent crimes--will be held accountable. Part of the solution \nis to insure that when a teenager brings a gun to school, he or she is \nheld accountable by the criminal justice system. The Administration--\nand several of my colleagues--have called for more gun control. I plan \nto offer and support many of the proposals that have been discussed. I \nsupport the extension of the Youth Handgun Safety Act to semi-automatic \nrifles. Indeed, the Republican bill before the Senate contains reforms \nlike the juvenile Brady provision--a measure which will prohibit \nfirearms possession by violent juvenile offenders. Republicans have \nbeen fighting for this provision for years, but the Administration has, \nuntil recently, largely ignored our efforts.\n  The test for the Senate over the coming days will be whether we \nchoose to play politics with the gun issue or work in a bipartisan \nmanner to insure that access to firearms by juveniles is tightly \ncontrolled and that the laws are fully enforced. You see, we need to \nremember that it seems the Clinton Justice Department has trouble \nprosecuting violations of existing gun laws, especially gun crimes \ncommitted at school or involving minors. Arguably, we should not simply \nrush to enact more gun control--some of which cannot even be remotely \nassociated with the Littleton tragedy--without taking steps to insure \nthat existing federal laws are being enforced. So, we plan to propose \nlegislation to insure that the Department of Justice will walk the \nwalk--not just talk the talk--when it comes to prosecuting violent gun \noffenders and providing needed funding to the States to build detention \nfacilities for violent and recidivist juvenile offenders.\n  No. 4, safe and secure schools: The fourth tier of our plan revolves \naround the basic right that all students share--the right to receive \nthe quality education they deserve. Our teachers and students need to \nknow that their schools are safe and that, should they take action to \ndeal with a violent student, the teacher will be protected. Our plan \nwill also promote safe and secure schools, free of undue disruption and \nviolence, so that our teachers can teach and our children can learn.\n  The sad reality is that we can no longer sit silently by as children \nkill children, as teenagers commit truly heinous offenses, or as our \njuvenile drug abuse rate continues to climb. In 1997, juveniles \naccounted for nearly one fifth--18.7 percent--of all criminal arrests \nin the United States. Persons under 18 committed 13.5 percent of all \nmurders, over 17 percent of all rapes, nearly 30 percent of all \nrobberies, and 50 percent of all arsons.\n  In 1997, 183 juveniles under 15 were arrested for murder. Juveniles \nunder 15 were responsible for 6.5 percent of all rapes, 14 percent of \nall burglaries, and one third of all arsons. And, unbelievably, \njuveniles under 15--who are not\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\nold enough to legally drive in any state--in 1997 were responsible for \n10.3 percent of all auto thefts.\n  To put this in some context, consider this: in 1997, youngsters age \n15 to 19, who are only 7 percent of the population, committed 22.2 \npercent of all crimes, 21.4 percent of violent crimes, and 32 percent \nof property crimes.\n  And although there are endless statistics on our growing juvenile \ncrime problem, one particularly sobering fact is that, between 1985 and \n1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year olds increased 207 \npercent. We have kids involved in murder before they can even drive.\n  Cold statistics alone cannot tell the whole story. Crime has real \neffects on the lives of real people. Last fall, I read an article in \nthe Richmond Times-Dispatch by my good friend, crime novelist Patricia \nCornwell. It is one of the finest pieces I have read on the effects of \nand solutions to our juvenile crime problem.\n\n  Let me share with my colleagues some of what Ms. Cornwell, who has \nspent the better part of her adult life studying and observing crime \nand its effects, has to say. She says ``when a person is touched by \nviolence, the fabric of civility is forever rent, or ripped, or \nbreached. . . .'' This is a graphic but accurate description. Countless \nlives can be ruined by a single violent crime. There is, of course, the \nvictim, who may be dead, or scarred for life. There are the family and \nfriends of the victim, who are traumatized as well, and who must live \nwith the loss of a loved one. Society itself is harmed, when each of us \nis a little more frightened to walk on our streets at night, to use an \nATM, or to jog or bike in our parks. And, yes, there is the offender \nwho has chosen to throw his or her life away. Particularly when the \noffender is a juvenile, family, friends, and society are made poorer \nfor the waste of potential in every human being. One crime, but \npermanent effects when ``the fabric of civility is rent.''\n  This is the reality that has driven me to work for the last three \nyears to address this issue. In this effort, I have been joined by a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which last \nCongress reported comprehensive legislation on bipartisan, two to one \nvote.\n  Our legislation from last Congress, which S. 254 is modeled after and \nimproved upon in an effort to gain the support of more Democrats, was \nsupported by law enforcement organizations such as the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and the National Troopers \nCoalition, as well as the support of juvenile justice practitioners \nsuch as the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, and \nvictim's groups including the National Victims Center and the National \nOrganization for Victims Assistance. S. 254 is enthusiastically \nsupported by law enforcement. It has been endorsed by the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nNational Sheriffs Association, and the National Troopers Coalition. \nVictim's groups including the National Center for Victims of Crime and \nthe National Organization for Victims Assistance support the bill and \nits pro-victim provisions. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America, \nundeniably experts in what it takes to prevent juvenile crime and \ndelinquency, has urged passage of S. 254. And the National \nCollaboration for Youth, which includes a wide array of front-line \njuvenile crime and delenquency prevention providers such as the \nAmerican Red Cross, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, the National \n4-H Council, the National Network for Youth, and the YMCA and YWCA of \nthe USA, has called S. 254 a ``strong bill'' and praised ``the \nincreasingly balanced emphasis S. 254 places on prevention \nactivities''.\n  Mr. President, allow me to spell out in greater detail the major \nprovisions of this bill--the first tier in our plan to deal with \nviolent juvenile crime. And how it will help reform the juvenile \njustice system that is failing the victims of juvenile crime, failing \ntoo many of our young people, and ultimately, failing to protect the \npublic.\n  First, this bill reforms and streamlines the federal juvenile code, \nto responsibly address the handful of cases each year involving \njuveniles who commit crimes under federal jurisdiction. Our bill sets a \nuniform age of 14 for the permissive transfer of juvenile defendants to \nadult court, permits prosecutors and the Attorney General to make the \ndecision whether to charge a juvenile offender as an adult, and permits \nin certain circumstances juveniles charged as an adult to petition the \ncourt to be returned to juvenile status.\n\n  It also provides that when prosecuted as adults, juveniles in Federal \ncriminal cases will be subject to the same procedures and penalties as \nadults, except for the application of mandatory minimums in most cases. \nOf course, the death penalty would not be available as punishment for \nany offense committed before the juvenile was 18.\n  Finally, in reforming the federal system, I believe that we must lead \nby example. So our bill provides that the federal criminal records of \njuveniles tried as adults, and the federal delinquency records of \njuveniles adjudicated delinquent for certain serious offenses such as \nmurder, rape, armed robbery, and sexual abuse or assault, will be \ntreated for all purposes in the same manner as the records of adults \nfor the same offenses. Other federal felony juvenile criminal or \ndelinquency records would be treated the same as adult records for \ncriminal justice or national security background check purposes.\n  The bill also permits juvenile federal felony criminal and \ndelinquency records to be provided to schools and colleges under rules \nissued by the Attorney General, provided that recipients of the records \nare held to privacy standards and that the records not be used to \ndetermine admission.\n  Let me assure any who may be concerned that it is not our intent in \nreforming the federal juvenile code to federalize juvenile crime--\nindeed, no conduct that is not a federal crime now will be if this \nreform is enacted. I do not intend or expect a substantial increase in \nthe number of juvenile cases adjudicated or prosecuted in federal \ncourt. It is our intent, rather, to ensure that when there is a federal \ncrime warranting the federal prosecution of a juvenile, the federal \ngovernment assumes its responsibility to deal with it, rather than \nsaddling the states with that burden.\n  Second, at the heart of this bill is an historic reform and \nreauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act \nof 1974, the most comprehensive review of that legislation in 25 years. \nThe States--under the leadership of a new breed of young, no-nonsense \nGovernors, like Mike Leavitt of Utah, then-Governor George Allen and \ncurrent Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia, and Frank Keating of \nOklahoma--have for several years have been far ahead of the Federal \nGovernment in implementing innovative reforms of their juvenile justice \nsystems. For example, between 1992 and 1996, of the 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, 48 made substantive changes to their juvenile \njustice systems. Among the trends in State law changes are the removal \nof more serious and violent offenders from the juvenile justice system, \nin favor of criminal court prosecution; new and innovative disposition/\nsentencing options for juveniles; and the revision, in favor of \nopenness, of traditional confidentiality provisions relating to \njuvenile proceedings and records.\n\n  While the States have been making fundamental changes in their \napproaches to juvenile justice, the Federal Government has made no \nsignificant change to its approach and has done little to encourage and \nreward State and local reform. Thus, the juvenile justice terrain has \nshifted beneath the Federal Government, leaving its programs an \npolicies out of step and largely irrelevant to the needs of State and \nlocal governments. This bill corrects this imbalance between State and \nFederal juvenile justice policy, and will help ensure that federal \nprograms support the needs of State and local governments.\n  First, our bill reforms and strengthens the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP, of the Department of \nJustice. The effectiveness of the OJJDP will be enhanced by requiring \nits Administrator to present to Congress annual plans, with measurable \ngoals, to control and prevent youth crime, coordinate all Federal \nprograms relating to controlling and preventing youth crime, and \ndisseminate to States and local governments data on the prevention, \ncorrection and\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\ncontrol of juvenile crime and delinquency, and report on successful \nprograms and methods.\n  And, most important to state and local governments, in the future, \nOJJDP will serve as a single point of contact for States, localities, \nand private entities to apply for and coordinate all federal assistance \nand programs related to juvenile crime control and delinquency \nprevention. This one-stop-shopping for federal programs and assistance \nwill help state and local governments focus on the problem, instead of \non how to navigate the federal bureaucracy.\n  Second, our reform bill consolidates numerous JJDPA programs, \nincluding Part C Special Emphasis grants, State challenge grants, boot \ncamps, and JJDPA Title V incentive grants, under an enhanced $200 \nmillion per year prevention challenge block grant to the States. The \nbill also reauthorizes the JJDPA Title II Part B State formula grants. \nIn doing so, it also reforms the current core mandates on the States \nrelating to the incarceration of juveniles to ensure the protection of \njuveniles in custody while providing state and local governments with \nneeded flexibility.\n  This flexibility is particularly important to rural states, where \nimmediate access to a juvenile detention facility might be difficult. \nSince many communities cannot afford separate juvenile and adult \nfacilities, law enforcement officers must drive hours to transport \njuvenile offenders to the nearest facility, instead of patrolling the \nstreets. Another unintended consequence of JJDPA is the release of \njuvenile offenders because no beds are available in juvenile facilities \nor because law enforcement officials cannot afford to transport youths \nto juvenile facilities. Juvenile criminals are released even though \nspace is available to detain them in adult facilities. Our reform will \nprovide the states with a degree of flexibility which currently does \nnot exist.\n  However, this flexibility is not provided at the expense of juvenile \ninmate safety. The bill strictly prohibits placing juvenile offenders \nin jail cells with adults. No one supports the placing of children in \ncells with adult offenders. To be clear--nothing in the bill will \nexpose juveniles to any physical contact by adult offenders. Indeed, \nthe legislation is explicit that, if states are to qualify for federal \nfunds, they may not place juvenile delinquents in detention under \nconditions in which the juvenile can have physical contact, much less \nbe physically harmed by, an adult inmate.\n  These provisions are largely based on H.R. 1818 from the 105th \nCongress, but are improved to ensure that abuse of juvenile delinquent \ninmates is not permitted by incorporating definitions of what \nconstitutes unacceptable contact between juvenile delinquents and adult \ninmates.\n  Third, and finally, our reform of the JJDPA reauthorizes and \nstrengthens those other parts of the JJDPA that have proven effective. \nFor example, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Act are reauthorized and funded. Gang \nprevention programs are reauthorized. And important, successful \nprograms to provide mentoring for young people in trouble with the law \nor at risk of getting into trouble with the law are reauthorized and \nexpanded. Operating through the Cooperative Extension Service program \nsponsored by the Department of Agriculture, the University of Utah has \ndeveloped a ground-breaking and highly successful program that mentors \nto entire families--pairing college age mentors with juveniles in \ntrouble or at risk of getting in trouble with the law, and pairing \nsenior citizen couples with the juvenile's parents and siblings. This \nprogram gets great bang for the buck. So our bill provides \ndemonstration funds to expand this program and replicate its success in \nother states.\n  Finally, our bill provides an important new program to encourage \nstate programs that provide accountability in their juvenile justice \nsystems. All or nearly all of our states have taken great strides in \nreforming their systems, and it is time for the federal government's \nprograms to catch up and provide needed assistance.\n\n  Despite reforms in recent years, all too often, the juvenile justice \nsystem ignores the minor crimes that lead to the increasingly frequent \nserious and tragic juvenile crimes capturing headlines. Unfortunately, \nmany of these crimes might have been prevented had the warning signs of \nearly acts of delinquency or antisocial behavior been heeded. A \ndelinquent juvenile's critical first brush with the law is a vital \naspect of preventing future crimes, because it teaches an important \nlesson --what behavior will be tolerated. Accountability is not just \nabout punishment--although punishment is frequently needed. It is about \nteaching consequences and providing rehabilitation to young offenders.\n  According to a recent Department of Justice study, juveniles \nadjudicated for so-called index crimes--such as murder, rape, robbery, \nassault, burglary, and auto theft--began their criminal careers at an \nearly age. The average age for a juvenile committing an index offense \nis 14.5 years, and typically, by age 7, the future criminal is already \nshowing minor behavior problems. If we can intervene early enough, \nhowever, we might avert future tragedies. Our bill provides a new \nJuvenile Accountability Block Grant to reform federal policy that has \nbeen complicit in the system's failure, and provide states with much \nneeded funding for a system of graduated sanctions, including community \nservice for minor crimes, electronically monitored home detention, boot \ncamps, and traditional detention for more serious offenses.\n  And let there be no mistake--detention is needed as well. Our first \npriority should be to keep our communities safe. We simply have to \nensure that violent people are removed from our midst, no matter their \nage. When a juvenile commits an act as heinous as the worst adult \ncrime, he or she is not a kid anymore, and we shouldn't treat them as \nkids.\n  State receipt of the incentive grants would be conditioned on the \nadoption of three core accountability policies: the establishment of \ngraduated sanctions to ensure appropriate correction of juvenile \noffenders, drug testing juvenile offenders upon arrest in appropriate \ncases; and recognition of victims rights and needs in the juvenile \njustice system.\n  Meaningful reform also requires that a juvenile's criminal record \nought to be accessible to police, courts, and prosecutors, so that we \ncan know who is a repeat or serious offender. Right now, these records \nsimply are not generally available in NCIC, the national system that \ntracks adult criminal records. Thus, if a juvenile commits a string of \nfelony offenses, and no record is kept, the police, prosecutors, judges \nor juries will never know what he did. Maybe for his next offense, \nhe'll get a light sentence or even probation, since it appears he's \ncommitted only one felony in his life instead 10 or 15. Such a system \nmakes no sense, and it doesn't protect the public.\n  So the reform we offer in this bill also provides the first federal \nincentives for the integration of serious juvenile criminal records \ninto the national criminal history database, together with federal \nfunding for the system.\n  Finally, we all recognize the value of education in preventing \njuvenile crime and rehabilitating juvenile offenders. When trouble-\ncausing juveniles remain in regular classrooms, they frequently make it \ndifficult for all other students to learn. Yet, removing such juveniles \nfrom the classroom without addressing their educational needs virtually \nguarantees that they will fall further into the vortex of crime and \ndelinquency. The costs are high--to the juvenile, but also to victims \nand to society. These juveniles too frequently become crime committing \nadults, with all the costs that implies--costs to victims, and the cost \nof incarcerating the offenders to protect the public. So our bill tries \nto break this cycle, by providing a three-year $45 million \ndemonstration project to provide alternative education to juveniles in \ntrouble with or at risk of getting in trouble with the law.\n  The bill we are debating today authorizes significant funding for the \nprograms I have described. In all, our bill authorizes a total of $5 \nbillion in assistance to state and local governments. This breaks down \nto $1 billion per year for five years, in the following categories:\n  $450 million per year for Juvenile Accountability Block Grants;\n  $435 million per year for prevention programs under the JJDPA, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\n$200 million for Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grants, $200 \nmillion for Part B Formula grant prevention programs, and $35 million \nfor Gangs, Mentoring and Discretionary grant programs;\n  $75 million per year for grants to states to upgrade and enhance \njuvenile felony criminal record histories and to make such records \navailable within NCIC, the national criminal history database used by \nlaw enforcement, the courts, and prosecutors; and\n  $40 million per year for NIJ research and evaluation of the \neffectiveness of juvenile delinquency prevention programs.\n  Additionally, the bill authorizes $100 million per year for joint \nfederal-state-local law enforcement task forces to address gang crime \nin areas with high concentrations of gang activity. $75 million per \nyear of this funding is authorized for establishment and operation of \nHigh Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas, and the remaining $25 \nmillion per year is authorized for community-based gang prevention and \nintervention for gang members and at-risk youth in gang areas.\n  And, finally, as I have already noted, the bill authorizes $45 \nmillion over three years for innovative alternative education programs \nto make our schools safer places of learning while helping ensure that \nthe youth most at risk do not get left behind.\n  Under the leadership of a crime conscious Republican Congress and the \nleadership of our nation's governors, we as a nation have seen a \ndecrease in our overall violent crime rate. Consider that since 1995, \nwe have made significant progress against crime--much of it in \npartnership with public officials like Governors Mike Leavitt of Utah, \nJim Gilmore of Virginia, George Pataki of New York and George W. Bush \nof Texas, and Mayors Rudy Giulianni of New York City and Richard \nRiordan of Los Angeles. Consider that violent crime is down 18 percent \nfrom 1993 to 1997, murders are down 28 percent from 1993 to 1997, and \noverall crime is down 10 percent from 1993 to 1997.\n\n  These declines have put a serious dent in our crime rates for the \nfirst time since the 1960's. Congress since 1995 has supported the \nefforts of our state and local officials with legislation that has \nprovided real funding and real solutions to crime, rather than feel-\ngood measures. We cleared out our courts with habeas corpus and \nprisoner litigation reform. We have added thousands of border guards to \nstop criminal aliens from entering the country. We have returned \nbillions of the taxpayers' dollars directly to our governors to build \nprisons and equip our police. Now it is time to address the problem of \njuvenile crime in the same way--with real solutions and real support to \nstate and local efforts.\n  Meaningful reforms like truth-in-sentencing laws, which replaced the \nliberal indeterminate sentencing systems with longer and binding \nsentences for violent, drug, and repeat offenders, zero-tolerance \npolicing, which put law enforcement officers back in our neighborhoods, \nand habeas corpus reform, which insured death sentences for heinous \ncriminals would be carried out, have all contributed to this improving \npicture.\n  Yet, in the face of this improving domestic environment, depraved \nacts of school and related violence by young people are becoming \nincreasingly more commonplace and increasingly more depraved. While \noverall, juvenile crime may be headed down slightly, juvenile drug use \nis up and juveniles increasingly account for the violent crime being \ncommitted.\n\n  Our states are responding to this trend. They recognize, as this \nfirst chart shows, that the average age of delinquency or problem \nbehaviors for tomorrow's adult violent offenders begins very early in \nlife--with the average age of a first serious offense occurring before \nthe child turns 12 years old. It is this fact--that many of tomorrow's \nviolent crime problems are today's juvenile delinquents--which caused \nSenator Sessions and me to take this issue head-on more than three \nyears ago.\n  This chart shows the average age of the onset of problem behaviors of \ndelinquency in male juveniles for minor problem behavior is 7 years \nold; moderately serious problem behavior is 9.5 years old; serious \ndelinquency, 11.9 years of age, almost 12; and first court contact for \nindex offenses, 14.5 years old.\n  This is data based on the statements of the oldest sampling in the \nPittsburgh Youth Study and on statements made by their mothers. It was \nalso in the OJJDP Juvenile Justice Bulletin, ``Serious and Violent \nJuvenile Offenders,'' in May 1998.\n  I am concerned that the Clinton Administration has been slow to \nrespond and provide assistance. They have failed to enforce the gun \nlaws already on the books and they have sat silently by, failing to \nendorse our bill because it was too tough on violent juveniles and \nbecause it wanted more control over how the monies would be spent. As \nrecently as last week, I offered the Attorney General the opportunity \nto endorse S. 254 or provide us with her suggested improvements but we \nhave heard nothing. Instead the Administration holds summits which \nproduce nothing in terms of assisting the states. Instead of concrete \nproposals, the Administration offers the public poll-driven, \nlegislative trinkets. They hold press conferences ``announcing'' as \ntheir own industry driven reforms aimed at making the Internet more \nsafe for children.\n  Desperate for something to crticize, I expect the Administration will \nargue that our bill is short on the prevention-side of the equation--a \nclaim they have to know just doesn't add up. Consider the fact that, \nunder our bill, Justice Department juvenile justice spending will reach \nunprecedented heights. Since 1994, the Republican Congress has steadily \nincrease funding for OJJDP--from $107 million in FY 94 to $267 million \nin FY 99. Our bill continues this trend by increasing authorized \nfunding levels over existing appropriations from $267 million to $435 \nmillion in FY 2000.\n  So, it is left to the Congress--once again--to step forward to \nprovide the necessary leadership at the federal level. I hope the \nAdministration will see its way clear to do what's right and come out \nin support of our efforts to help fight juvenile crime.\n  Mr. President, in the face of a confounding problem like juvenile \ncrime and school violence, it is tempting to look for easy answers. It \nis also tempting to play politics and advance poll-driven, legislative \ntrinkets in lieu of meaningful reform. I do not believe that we should \nsuccumb to this temptation. We are faced with a complex problem which \ncannot be solved solely by the enactment of new criminal prohibitions. \nIt is at its core a problem of our nation's values. But I believe that \nby parents and communities working together to teach accountability by \nexample, by early intervention when the signs clearly point to violent \nand antisocial behavior, and by demanding more of our popular culture \nand industry leaders, we will be taking a postitive step forward.\n  Mr. President, that is what our efforts are all about. Our efforts \nare a comprehensive approach to this national problem. I hope we can \nwork together to develop a bipartisan solution to these problems as \nwell.\n\n  To that degree, I appreciate the work of my colleagues, especially \nSenator Sessions, who worked so long and hard on our side, as well as \nSenator Campbell, who has been very concerned about these juvenile \ncrime issues, and my colleagues on the Democratic side, Senator Biden, \nSenator Leahy, and others, who are working with us to try to come up \nwith what needs to be done.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent floor privileges be granted to \nthe following staff for the duration of the Senate's consideration of \nS. 254: Sharon Prost, Rhett DeHart, Michael Kennedy, Craig Wolf, Ed \nHarden, Leah Belaire, and David Muhlhausen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges be granted to Beryl Howell, Bruce Cohen and Edward Pagano \nfor the duration of both the debate and all votes on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Emilia \nBeskind, an intern, be permitted floor privileges during the duration \nof the debate.\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have had a series of shocking schoolyard \nshootings. I cannot imagine any Senator, as a human being or as a \nparent or citizen, who would not be shocked, just as have most people \naround the world. The Senate is now finally turning its attention to \ndoing something about youth violence in this country. Two weeks ago, \nthe distinguished majority leader promised the American people that \nthis week he would permit full and open debate on this issue. I commend \nhim for that, because for 3 years we have not been given the \nopportunity to discuss this critical issue on the floor of the Senate \nwithout some kinds of procedural gimmicks or artificial limits on \ndebate or amendments. I think the American people do not want to see \nthat. They want to see a full and real debate.\n  Over that same 3-year period when we tried to have this debate, this \ncountry has witnessed schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas and \nWashington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, \nMississippi, and most recently in Littleton, CO. I say to the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and all Members on the floor, none of \nus can look at our States and say with certitude that we are immune to \nsuch a tragedy.\n  Finally, after the deaths and injury of 41 children just in the \nincidents to which I have referred, the Senate is turning its attention \nto this matter. Violence in our Nation's schools, committed by or \nagainst children, devastates all of us--as parents or as grandparents, \nas educators, as civic leaders or whatever. But devastating as it is to \nus, most importantly these incidents scar and upset our children. \nObviously, it takes them away from the learning, which should be the \nfocus at this important time in their lives, a time that should be a \ntime of joy, a time of growth, a time of learning--a time that will set \ntheir path, really, for the rest of their lives. They should not be \ndistracted by these terrible things.\n  This is a complex issue. Frankly, no one party has all the right \nanswers. It is time we as Democrats and Republicans discuss all of our \nideas and proposals for actions and then choose the best among them. A \ngood proposal that works should get the support of all of us.\n  Our first question really should be whether a program or proposal \nwill help our children effectively, not whether it is a Democrat or \nRepublican proposal. I have learned through the years that good \nlegislators coming together can make good proposals. I have been \nhonored to see passed into law numerous law enforcement proposals I \nhave sponsored and co-sponsored with like-minded Members on the other \nside of the aisle. But we also have to recognize that legislation alone \nis not enough to stop youth violence. We can pass a law saying we don't \nwant violence. We can also pass a law saying we would like the Sun to \nrise in the west and set in the east. Either one would be about as \neffective as the other. We have to do a lot more than that.\n  We can pass an assortment of new laws and still turn on the news and \nfind out some child in the country has turned violent and turned on \nother teachers or children with a weapon, with terrible results. So \nthis is not just about Littleton. Littleton is the most recent, it is \nthe most bloody, but it is the seventh incident of schoolyard killings \nin the past years and no area of the country has escaped the bomb \nthreats or fears these incidents have generated. Each incident of \nschool violence leaves us with more questions than answers. It is easy \nto say each is related to the next, but together they all point to \nproblems we must do something about. There is not one major catalyst \nthat touches off an eruption of violence in a school; there are a whole \nlot of contributing causes.\n  We can certainly point to inadequate parental involvement. Frankly, \nthat is an area about which I worry--very, very busy parents and very, \nvery little time for their children. In an increasingly affluent \nsociety, we have to ask whether we are paying a terrible price for our \naffluence.\n  We can talk about overcrowded classrooms and oversized schools that \nadd to students' alienation. When we have high schools with 1,200, \n1,500, 1,600 people, how can they possibly have a sense of community \nwithin that high school?\n  We can talk about the easy accessibility of guns. We can speak of the \nviolence depicted on television and movies and video games. We can talk \nabout the inappropriate--more than inappropriate--disgusting content \nnow available on the Internet. There is no single cause, and because \nthere is no single cause, there is no single legislative solution that \nwill cure the ill of youth violence in our schools and in our streets.\n  Just as those who look at a fire know if you remove enough kindling, \nyou can prevent the fire, so there are things we can do right now, and \nthere is no excuse for not trying. Everybody has a role to play in the \nsolution. While we cannot legislate the problems away, we all have a \nrole, and that means parents, teachers, lawmakers, Hollywood, Internet \nproviders and gun manufacturers and sellers. But we should also \nrecognize that despite the recent and shocking school shootings, we \nhave been doing some things right.\n  By any measure you want to use--victimizations reported by police or \ncrimes reported by police or arrests--the serious violent crime rate is \ngoing down. Let me show this chart. This is something of which we ought \nto be proud. Since 1973, the total violent crime rate has gone down. In \nfact, it has gone down the most in the last 6 years, certainly more \nthan I have seen it go down at any time.\n  According to the most recent statistics from the Bureau of Justice, \nthe overall crime rate has fallen more than 18 percent since 1993.\n  This next chart is remarkable. It is something in which we should \ntake pride. After seeing for decades, during my adult life, the crime \nrate go up, up, up and up, to see it these last 6 years go down is very \nsignificant.\n  The rate of serious violent crime being committed by juveniles is \nalso on the way down. Following a period of going up in the late 1980s \nand early 1990s, they peaked in 1993. That also is something in which \nwe should take some pride and we should take comfort as Americans and \nas citizens.\n  The reduction in the murder rate alone is truly good news. In 1997, \nthe murder rate was 28 percent lower than 1993. And in 1998, this rate \nhad fallen to its lowest level in three decades. That, again, is \nsomething in which we should take some comfort, even though any murder \nis one murder too many.\n  In the years I have been here, in 30 years--this goes back to the \ntime when I was a prosecutor and throughout all this--I have seen \nthrough each administration, Republican or Democrat, the murder rate go \nup. Finally, we have seen in the last 6 years the murder rate come down \nto where it is now, the lowest level in three decades.\n  Over the past few months, we have begun hearing criticism that this \nadministration is not focusing sufficient resources on enforcing our \ngun laws. Of course, there is always room for improvement, as there is \nwith anybody. But let's not let political name-calling detract from the \nindisputable fact that the murder rate for teenagers and young adults \nrose sharply in the late eighties and early nineties due to a rise in \ngun violence that is now on the decline. In fact, juvenile murder and \nnon-negligent manslaughter arrests declined almost 40 percent between \n1993 and 1997. To use real numbers, there were 3,800 juvenile arrests \nfor murder at the peak in 1993. By 1997, that number was down to 2,500 \nout of a population of 30 million children between the ages of 10 and \n17.\n\n  As we talk about juvenile crime legislation, it is important to keep \nin mind these statistics show some successes and we should be promoting \nand expanding those programs that are helping to produce these \nsuccesses.\n  We have some complex, sweeping legislation before us. S. 254 was \nnever referred to the Judiciary Committee for consideration, which is \nextraordinarily unusual. I look forward to discussing this.\n  It was introduced by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \ncosponsored by the distinguished Senator from Alabama, who is on the \nfloor. I wait to hear from the distinguished chairman as to what will \nbe accomplished with it.\n  While we did not examine the bill in the Judiciary Committee because \nthe majority chose, as they have a right to, to place the bill directly \non the Senate Calendar, instead the Judiciary Committee has been busy \non a bankruptcy\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\nbill protecting creditors and a proposed constitutional amendment to \nprotect the flag. Protecting the flag and protecting creditors may be \nimportant issues, but frankly, as a parent, I am far more interested in \nprotecting children from violence, both in the schoolyard and outside \nschool.\n  Last Congress, we had an earlier version of this bill, S. 10. We \ntried to improve it, and I think we did. I will describe in more detail \nS. 254. The juvenile crime bill we turn to today reflects that \nprogress, and I commend Senator Hatch for his leadership in continuing \nto push forward and building a consensus of Republicans and Democrats. \nI thought we missed opportunities in the last Congress to come together \non legislative efforts to deal with youth violence. I hope we will not \nmiss that opportunity in this Congress and we can come together.\n  In fact, many of the improvements we tried to make to the juvenile \ncrime bill, S. 10, were rejected mostly along party-line votes in the \nJudiciary Committee, and by nearly a party-line vote we saw it passed \nout of committee. Not surprising, because it was a partisan bill, and \ncrime should not be a partisan issue, it was hard to find anybody who \nliked it when it came to the floor. I made, as did others, a number of \ncriticisms of the bill, and those criticisms were echoed by virtually \nevery major newspaper in the United States, as well as by national \nleaders, and ranged across the spectrum from Chief Justice William \nRehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's \nDefense Fund.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer called the bill ``fatally flawed.'' The Los \nAngeles Times described the bill ``peppered with ridiculous poses and \npenalties'' and as taking a ``rigid, counterproductive approach'' to \njuvenile crime prevention. The St. Petersburg Times called the bill \n``an amalgam of bad and dangerous ideas.''\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized S. 10 because it would, as he \nsaid, ``eviscerate [the] traditional deference to state prosecutions, \nthereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal \njudiciary.''\n  He was concerned that federalizing juvenile crimes meant that \n``federal prosecution should be limited to those offenses that cannot \nand should not be prosecuted in state courts.''\n  The National District Attorneys Association, having been the vice \npresident of that association, I listened to them. They expressed \nconcern that ``S. 10 goes too far'' in changing the ``core mandates'' \nwhich have kept juveniles safer and away from adults while in jail for \nover 25 years, and that S. 10's new juvenile record-keeping \nrequirements were ``burdensome and contrary to most state laws.''\n  Similarly, the National Governors' Association, the Council of State \nGovernments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of \nCounties, the National Conference of State Legislatures expressed \nconcerns about the restrictions S. 10 would place on their ability to \ncombat and prevent juvenile crime effectively.\n  So with all this criticism, when the Republican leadership said we \ncould not have real debate in the last Congress, that became an \nunacceptable situation and one, frankly, which created a lot of concern \namong a number of Republican legislators.\n  Despite the wellspring of concern by the Federal judiciary and by \nState and local law enforcement and public officials over significant \nparts of S. 10 as reported by the Judiciary Committee, we were not \ngoing to be allowed to debate it.\n  In September 1998, the majority propounded a unanimous consent \nrequest to permit the Republicans to offer a substitute that contained \nchanges to over 160 separate paragraphs of the bill, but not allow \nDemocrats the same opportunity. That did not allow full and fair \ndebate.\n  I suggested a plan that would have ensured debate on the more \ncontroversial aspects of last year's bill by placing in the Record on \nSeptember 25, 1998, a proposal for a limited number of Democratic \namendments. My proposal was never responded to.\n  I say that because that was in the past. And I accept the majority \nleader's representation that this will not happen this year, that we \nwill not allow narrow procedural devices to limit debate on S. 254. And \nI think we will have a better bill because of that.\n  There are very good ideas on both the Republican and Democratic side \nof the aisle here in the Senate to improve this legislation. After all, \nkeeping children safe, both in school and out of school is not a \nRepublican or Democratic idea; that is a basic, automatic feeling that \nevery parent, every family and every person in this Chamber of either \nparty feels strongly.\n  The concerns I outlined about S. 10 are shared by many others, as \nwell as by child advocates, judges, law enforcement and State and local \nofficials, and were shared here on November 13, 1997; January 29, 1998; \nApril 1, 1998; June 23, 1998; September 8, 1998, and October 15, 1998. \nI said the bill skimped on effective prevention efforts to stop \nchildren from getting into trouble in the first place.\n  Second, I said the bill would have gutted the core protections which \nhave been in place for over 20 years to protect children who come into \ncontact with the criminal justice system and keep them out of harm's \nway from adult inmates, to keep status and nonoffenders out of jail \naltogether, and to address disproportionate minority confinement.\n  Thirdly, I expressed concern about the federalization of juvenile \ncrime resulting from S. 10's elimination of the requirement that \nFederal courts only get involved in prosecutions of juveniles if the \nState cannot or declines to prosecute the juveniles.\n  Finally, I was concerned that the new accountability block grant in \nS. 10 contained onerous eligibility requirements which would end up \nimposing on the States a one-size-fits-all uniform sewn up in \nWashington for dealing with juvenile crime. The States simply did not \nwant this straitjacket. In fact, at one stage, the way it was written \nin the bill, no State would have qualified for the block grant; no \nState of the 50 would have.\n\n  So I say this, and I say this as a compliment to Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who worked on S. 254: It is a much more improved \nbill than S. 10 in the last Congress. It incorporates many of the \nimprovements we suggested last Congress. I am delighted to see that \nproposals that the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee specifically \nvoted down in 1997 have now been put back in the bill. These are \nchanges that we have been pushing for a number of years. It is the \nright approach now to put them back in the bill.\n  So let's make progress together. I hope through an open floor debate \nand an open amendment process, without procedural games, we will be \nable to make sufficient progress to be able to support a Senate bill \nthat can make a difference.\n  We tried in July 1997 to amend S. 10 to protect the States' \ntraditional prerogative in handling juvenile offenders. And my \namendment would have limited the Federal trial as an adult of juveniles \ncharged with nonviolent felonies to circumstances when the State is \nunwilling or unable to exercise jurisdiction. That was defeated. \nWhereas, the language in S. 254 contains a new provision analogous to \nmy previously rejected amendment that would direct Federal prosecutors \nto ``exercise a presumption in favor of referral'' of juvenile cases to \nthe appropriate State or tribal authorities.\n  While the language used in this S. 254 section may need some \nclarification, particularly since it appears to contradict other \nlanguage in the bill requiring Federal trial of juveniles who commit \nany Federal offense, it is a provision in the right direction.\n  In July 1997, we tried to amend S. 10 before the Judiciary Committee \nto permit limited judicial review of a Federal prosecutor's decision to \ntry certain juveniles as adults. S. 10 granted sole, nonreviewable \nauthority to Federal prosecutors to try juveniles as adults for any \nFederal felony, removing Federal judges from that decision altogether.\n  I am a little bit hesitant to give authority to any Federal \nprosecutor--special prosecutors or regular Federal prosecutors--that \ncannot be reviewed. And my amendment would have granted Federal judges \nauthority in appropriate cases to review a prosecutor's decision. Only \nthree States in the country granted prosecutors the extraordinary \nauthority over juvenile cases that S. 10 proposed, including Florida.\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\n  I mention that because sometimes we get the impression that here in \nWashington we always know better than the States. In criminal \nprocedures, criminal process, we should look at the States and their \nexperience in determining whether we should step in and change things. \nAnd when you find that only three States have done what we were asking \nto do, you ask why. And I mentioned Florida as being one of the States \nthat granted this extraordinary authority.\n  Earlier this year, we saw the consequences of that kind of authority, \nwhen a local prosecutor in that State charged, as an adult, a 15-year-\nold mildly retarded boy with no prior record, who stole $2 from a \nschool classmate to buy lunch. The local prosecutor locked up this \nretarded boy in an adult jail for weeks. You can imagine what that was \nlike, for this $2 theft, before national press coverage forced a review \nof the charging decision in this case. We do not want to see that kind \nof incident on the Federal level.\n  Unfortunately, my proposal for a ``reverse waiver'' procedure \nproviding judicial review of a prosecutor's decision was voted down, \nwith no Republican on the committee voting for it.\n  S. 254 contains a virtually identical ``reverse waiver'' provision to \nthe one proposed that was rejected almost 2 years ago. So that is a \nwelcome change in the bill.\n  S. 254 also contains a provision to increase penalties for witness \ntampering that I first suggested and included in the Youth Violence, \nCrime and Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997, S. 15, which was introduced \nin the first weeks of the 105th Congress, at the end of the last \nCongress in the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of \n1998, S. 2484, and again in S. 9, the Comprehensive package crime \nproposals introduced with the Senator Daschle at the beginning of this \nCongress.\n\n  This provision would increase the penalty for using or threatening \nphysical force against any person with intent to tamper with a witness, \nvictim or informant from a maximum of 10 to 20 years imprisonment. In \naddition, the provision adds a conspiracy penalty for obstruction of \njustice offenses involving witnesses, victims and informants.\n  I have long been concerned about the undermining of our criminal \njustice system by criminal efforts to threaten or harm witnesses, \nvictims and informants, to stop them from cooperating with and \nproviding assistance to law enforcement. I tried to include this \nprovision, along with other law enforcement initiatives, by amendment \nto S. 10. It was voted down in the committee. I am now pleased to see \nit is included in S. 254. I think that is an improvement.\n  S. 254 substantially relaxes the eligibility requirements for the new \njuvenile accountability block grant. That is a positive step. S. 10 in \nthe last Congress would have required States to comply with a host of \nnew Federal mandates to qualify for the first cent of grant money, an \nawful lot of recordkeeping mandates, and make all juvenile delinquency \nrecords available to law enforcement agencies and to schools, including \ncolleges and universities. We could not find any State that would have \nqualified for this grant money. We tried to get the Judiciary Committee \nto revise this. My amendment was then voted down, but I am glad to see \nthat 2 years later S. 254 reflects the criticism that I and other \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee leveled at the recordkeeping \nrequirements.\n\n  The current bill removes the recordkeeping requirements altogether \nfrom the juvenile accountability block grant, as we had requested. In \nfact, it sets up an entirely new juvenile criminal history block grant \nfunded at $75 million per year. To qualify for a criminal history \ngrant, States would have to promise within 3 years to keep fingerprint-\nsupported records of delinquency adjudications of juveniles who \ncommitted a felony act. No more photographs required; no more records \nof mere arrests required. No more dissemination of petty juvenile \noffense records to schools required. Only juvenile delinquency \nadjudications for murder, armed robbery, rape, or sexual molestation \nmust be disseminated in the same manner as records.\n  So the eligibility requirements for the juvenile accountability block \ngrant now number only three, including that the State have in place a \npolicy of drug testing for appropriate categories. This reflects an \namendment that we offered to S. 10 in July of 1997.\n  One problem I do have is that S. 254 does not allow substance abuse \ncounseling or treatment as an allowable use of grant funds. I hope that \nis something we can rectify as the bill goes forward.\n  Now, we have children in custody provisions that were enacted in the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. This was done \nto address the horrific conditions in which children were being \ndetained by State authorities in close proximity to adult inmates. \nThese were conditions that often resulted in tragic assaults, rapes, \nand suicides of those children.\n  As it has evolved, we have four core protections that have been \nadopted and, frankly, are working: separation of juvenile offenders \nfrom adult inmates in custody, so-called sight and sound separation; \nremoval of juveniles from adult jails or lockups with exceptions for \nrural areas, travel, weather-related conditions; deinstitutionalization \nof status offenders; to study and direct prevention efforts toward \nreducing the disproportionate confinement of minority youth by the \njuvenile justice system.\n  S. 254 is an improvement over S. 10, which tried to take out three of \nthe four core protections. S. 254 includes the sight and sound standard \nfor juveniles in Federal custody. The same standard is used to apply to \njuvenile delinquents in State custody.\n  S. 254 incorporates changes I recommended to S. 10 in the last \nCongress to ensure the continued existence and role of State advisory \ngroups. That, I think, is going to be very important. The bill \nauthorizes the use of grant funds to support the SAGs, but it doesn't \nrequire States to commit funds. I hope that is an omission that we may \nbe able to work out.\n  Now, there are a lot of improvements, but there are still some \nproblems. S. 254 does not provide adequate assurance of funding for \nprimary prevention programs. I understand that Senator Hatch may agree \nto an amendment to earmark 25 percent of the funds appropriated from \nthe juvenile accountability block grant for primary prevention. That is \ngood news. It is less than we had hoped for, but it is certainly \nprogress. I commend him for that.\n\n  When Senator Specter tried to earmark funds from this grant program \nfor prevention during committee markup in 1997, his amendment failed. I \nhope we can do better than that.\n  Secondly, the bill weakens the core protections under the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act. This would reverse progress \nmade over the past 25 years, and I do not think we should do it. It \nalso includes a sense-of-the-Senate resolution urging States to try \njuveniles 10 to 14 years old as adults for crimes, such as murder, that \nwould carry the death penalty if committed by an adult. The resolution \ndoes not urge the death penalty for such children, but asks for adult \nprosecution. This is really something the States should make up their \nminds. We shouldn't be telling them what to do on that.\n  I say this as a representative of one of the very, very few States in \nthe country that allows the prosecution of juveniles 10 years and older \nas an adult for certain crimes. We really have in Vermont the toughest \nlaw of any State on that, but it is something that the Vermont \nLegislature decided. It probably shouldn't be opined on by the Senate.\n  Lastly, the bill is completely silent on how we should address the \nproblem of the easy accessibility of guns to children.\n  Mr. President, one of the reasons for this debate, one of the best \nthings about this debate, if it is allowed, is a full and open debate, \nsomething we were not allowed before. We can address all of these \nissues.\n  Again, I urge Senators to come together as Senators, not as \nRepublicans or Democrats, about what would be best. Is there too much \nviolence in the media today? Of course there is. I find it very, very \ndifficult to have any enthusiasm for going to a very violent movie or \nwatching a violent television show. I have been to too many murder \nscenes. It seems they are always at 2 or 3 in the morning.\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\n  If anybody thinks a murder scene is somehow glamorous, talk to people \nwho have been there. I have had a murder victim dying while he was \ntelling me the name of the person who killed him. You can imagine the \nshock when the person he was telling me had killed him was his own son.\n  There is nothing exciting or glamorous about this. There is nothing \nexciting or glamorous about the stench, the sight, the view of a murder \nscene. Anybody who has visited them knows that. Anybody who has visited \nas many as I have knows it very, very well. We should talk about that--\nare there too many violent scenes in an antiseptic way given to our \njuveniles--but at the same time let us be honest enough to say that \nguns do kill people and there are too many guns available to young \npeople. I say this, coming from a State that is probably the only State \nin the Union that has no gun laws and also has an extremely low crime \nrate, a State where parents still teach their youngsters a safe and \nresponsible way to use guns. But there is no reason why a teenager \nshould be allowed to walk in to a gun show anywhere they want and buy \nany kind of high-powered weaponry they want, with no parental \nresponsibility, no parental supervision.\n  We should also know that simply saying let's increase penalties does \nnot stop crime. You stop crime by stopping crime, and that means we \nhave to address prevention programs that work and have to understand \nthat a prevention program that may work very well in Alabama may not \nwork in Vermont or vice versa.\n  The prevention programs, such as the one that stopped youth murders \nin Boston, is something which should be looked at, and it can be \nfunded, if people want to. We should accept that.\n  As I said in the opening part of my statement, Mr. President, we also \nhave to accept the fact that parents are not spending enough time with \ntheir children and that we ought to get back off this hurly-burly world \nand understand that nothing we will ever do in life--career, money \nmaking, or anything else--is as important as how we raise our children. \nA lot of parents are going to have to accept that fact. We are going to \nhave to look at the size of our schools and say that you can't have a \nsense of community in a high school of 1,200 or 1,500 people.\n  There are a lot of things we can do, and, working together, we can \nmake it better. The murder rate has come down. We have done some very \ngood things in the Congress. The administration deserves credit for it. \nLaw enforcement deserves credit for it. But there is still more to do. \nWorking together, we can do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell and Mr. Leahy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 996 are located in today's record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say that Senator Leahy has been a \nprosecutor, has been interested in these issues, and has spent a lot of \ntime and effort on it.\n  We indeed attempted to respond, as you know, to a number of the \nconcerns he has had. Some of the suggestions and concerns he has raised \nI believe are worthy. We made a number of corrections which I think \nwould be helpful to that. I know Senator Hatch has also worked hard on \nit.\n  Let me say first that juvenile crime is in fact a serious national \nproblem. We have had some very real progress in the crime situation in \nAmerica. We had some reductions in the 1980s. Then, in the mid-1980s, \nwe had a crack epidemic which I think drove the number up some. But it \nhas been declining among adult criminals steadfastly for quite a number \nof years.\n  I have watched those numbers carefully--not as a Senator but as an \nattorney general of Alabama and as a U.S. attorney and Federal \nprosecutor in Alabama. I have observed the numbers and what has been \nhappening. There are some good trends. We need to keep those trends \ngoing.\n  A lot of people may not realize that from about 1980 until today we \nhave quadrupled--four times--the number of people in prison as there \nwere before.\n  During a time when many people thought the crime rate was going to \ncontinue to go up, this Nation--mostly at the State level--has begun to \nstep forward and identify repeat, dangerous offenders, and not just act \nas a revolving door but to incarcerate them for longer periods of time, \nkeeping them off the streets, keeping them from being gang leaders and \ninvolving other, more impressionable young people in their criminal \nactivity.\n  We have had some nice reductions in violent crimes and, in crimes \ngenerally, some reduction among adults. We have not had the same kind \nof success in juvenile crime. There are a lot of reasons for that. I \nwould like to suggest the fundamental reason, in my opinion; that is, \nwe have not responded as a nation to juvenile crime as we have to adult \ncrime. Most people may not know that 99.9999 percent of all juvenile \ncases are tried in State court. There are almost no juvenile cases \ntried in Federal court.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor, U.S. attorney, for 12 years. I think I \nprosecuted one juvenile case in 12 years. There are so many impediments \nto it, so many difficulties, that it kept those prosecutions from going \nforward even when they should have gone forward. We need to improve \nthat and make it a little bit better and easier in appropriate cases \nfor U.S. attorneys, Federal prosecutors, to prosecute juvenile cases.\n  But the thrust of our reform and the thrust of S. 254 is to encourage \nand strengthen the ability of State and local governments to prosecute \nand handle and deal with young people who are committing crimes, are \nabout to commit crimes, and who are running afoul of the law.\n  We know that in the last several years there has been a reduction in \njuvenile violent murders and the rates have gone down--not \ndramatically, but it has been a good number. Overall, from 1993 through \n1997, however, there has been an increase of 14 percent in arrests of \njuveniles for criminal activities; we are not seeing a decline. This is \nafter an incredible period of explosive growth in the last 15 or 20 \nyears in juvenile crime--maybe even 25 or 30 years in juvenile crime. \nWe have an extraordinarily high, unprecedented level of juvenile crime. \nUnfortunately, we have not responded to that.\n\n  Mr. President, I have seen it in my State. And my State is typical. \nWe have increased adult prisoners, but we have not done anything to \ndeal with what happens when a youngster is arrested for a serious \ncrime. Judges don't have options. They don't have the ability to deal \nwith them in an effective way, and they are coming back time and time \nand time again.\n  There was a murder in Montgomery, AL, when I was attorney general, by \nthree young people. They were 16 and 15. I asked the police chief what \nkind of criminal history those three young people had. They were out on \nthe streets. They were free, running loose. One had 5 prior arrests; \nanother one had 5 prior arrests; and the third one had 15 prior \narrests.\n  A New York Times writer, Mr. Butterfield, within the last year did an \nanalysis of what is happening in juvenile courts. He went to Chicago \nIL, a major city. What he found there is too typical of what is going \non in juvenile justice. What he found was that judges were spending 5 \nminutes per case--5 minutes per case--because of the crush of these \ncases.\n  That is unacceptable. It is our responsibility, if we care about \nthose young people coming before that judge, standing in court having \nbeen apprehended for a serious crime--if we care about them, if we \nreally love them--to do something with them. We will not spend 5 \nminutes on their case; we will confront youngsters of 13, 14, or 15 \nyears of age and find out what has been troubling them, find out what \ntheir problems are, and intervene effectively.\n  Some say, Well, Senator Sessions, you just want to spend money on \ncourts and lock kids up.\n  I don't want to lock kids up. But what we are doing today is not \ndoing anything to help them. Some kids have to be locked up, \nunfortunately. I wish it weren't so. Some do. Some have been back 3, 4, \n6, 8, 10 times.\n  Finally, if a judge at some point does not have the capacity to \nvalidate the integrity of his order of probation which prohibits them \nfrom committing\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nfurther crimes, and he just ignores it time and time again, the whole \nlaw becomes a mockery. It becomes a joke. It undermines respect for \nlaw. It undermines respect for the police officer who is out doing his \nduty.\n  Some of these youngsters will kill you. A police officer goes out and \nmakes arrest after arrest, and one of them is liable to pull a gun. One \nof them is liable to pull a knife. This is a dangerous world. Why \nshould he go out and do his best to apprehend and commit himself to \nthose cases if the judges and prosecutors are unable to proceed with \neffective punishment?\n  I want to say, first of all, that if we care about what is happening \nin America, I suggest we look at what is happening in our communities, \ntalk to our police officers, juvenile probation officers, juvenile \njudges, and ask them: What is happening? Are you sufficiently funded \nand do you have the resources to intervene effectively at the earliest \npossible stage of criminality by a young person?\n  If we do that, we can perhaps avoid more serious consequences down \nthe road.\n  I know a lot of people have talked about Littleton, Jonesboro, \nPaducah, and other mass shootings that have occurred in school. I don't \nknow if those could have been prevented. In my own personal survey, \nreading the newspapers, I have found that in every one of those cases \nthose young people had been before a judge previously for a serious \noffense. Had that judge had the time and the resources--an alternative \nschool, a boot camp, a detention facility, mental health treatment, \ndrug treatment, a drug testing program to determine whether or not \nthese kids were in serious trouble--perhaps these crimes could have \nbeen prevented.\n  I know people say what we really need is prevention. I think the \nphrase is ``primary prevention.'' I am not against prevention. This \nbill has an awful lot of money in it for prevention. I will show you in \na moment some of the prevention programs that already exist.\n  Based on my experience and what I know with a virtual certainty in my \nown mind, if we want to prevent serious criminal behavior and we have a \nlimited amount of money--and we do; for every project that comes before \nthis body, our money is limited--then we ought to focus on that group \nof people who can be best served by the application of that money. Who \nis it? It is the ones who are already getting in trouble with the law, \nthe ones who are already being arrested. They are the ones on whom we \nought to focus.\n  I assure Members, all over this country we are not able to do that \neffectively. Call the juvenile judge in your community, if you know \nhim, call your police officer or your prosecutors, and talk to them and \nsee if they don't think we could do better.\n  I have visited with Judge Grossman in Ohio. He has a magnificent \ncourt system that Senator DeWine and I visited. When those kids are \narrested, they are interviewed by probation officers. Backgrounds are \ndone. The judge studies it. He promptly analyzes their case. He has a \nschool there, a drug treatment program, mental health treatment, family \ncounseling--all these things--when that child comes before him and his \nteam of judges; they have a program to deal with it effectively.\n  That is what I want to see happen all over America. In fact, I \nbelieve local communities are considering that all over America. I know \nin Alabama they are. Cities are sending people up to Boston, which has \nsome terrific innovative programs that have dramatically reduced their \nmurder rate by young people. They are thinking about what to do.\n  How can we help this? We are a Federal Government. How can we help \nour local county juvenile judge, local county probation officer, do \nthat job? We ought to encourage them to study programs that are \nworking. I think we ought to encourage them to visit programs such as \nthe one in Boston and to develop their own programs.\n  The problem is they need, oftentimes, more money to accomplish that \nthan they have in the immediate short term. What we have is a block \ngrant program that will allow them to receive partial funding from the \nFederal Government as an encouragement, as an inducement, to create the \nkind of programs that take place in Ohio and Boston and in my hometown \nof Mobile, AL. Judge John Butler, who serves on the board of the \nJuvenile Judges Association, is a long-time friend. He has probably the \nfinest boot camp in the United States. It has an education program. I \nhave been there. I have visited that boot camp. I helped start it years \nago. I supported it for years.\n  We have a drug court in Mobile where young people--and adults, too, \nfor that matter--are examined for drug problems. Those are the kind of \nthings that ought to be done. The school is so good that a lot of the \nyoung people who have been arrested and put into that detention boot \ncamp facility with an education component want to continue their \neducation there. They don't want to go back to their regular school. \nThey want to stay in that school. That is what we need. That is the \nabsolute best application of limited dollars to reduce serious violent \ncrime, in my opinion.\n  We can find out if there is a serious problem at home. Maybe it is \nchild abuse. Maybe one of the parents is a drug addict or an alcoholic. \nMaybe the child is totally neglected and there is psychological abuse \ngoing on in the home. Maybe they are running around with very bad \nfriends and gang members. If the family is brought in, if the probation \nofficers are brought in, if they are drug tested, if they are analyzed \ncarefully, then progress can be made to turn around some of those young \npeople. Some of them will continue a life of crime.\n  We care about our young people. Most of the victims of crimes by \nyoung people are other young people. We simply have to remove some of \nthem from the community because they are not safe. Innocent kids who \nhave done nothing wrong can be shot, killed, or abused by violent \nyoungsters who are not able to be changed by the court system.\n  That is basically the philosophy. We call it ``graduated sanctions.'' \nThat is the phrase we are using in this bill, S. 254. It says if you \nreceive money under this grant program, develop a system that is \nconsistent with your own philosophy, your own local community, that \nincreases punishment for repeat offenders. This idea a lot of people \nhave that we are putting young people in jail for light or transient \ncrimes is not true. It is not true. They know it. Minor kids don't get \nsent to jail.\n  I recently talked to a judge who had a serious case, a repeat of two \nor three household burglaries. He said he had one bed in the State \njuvenile system. If it is not an approved juvenile facility, according \nto the Federal Government, they can't even spend one night in it. He \nsaid he had one minor there for assault with intent to murder and he \nwas not going to let him out to put the burglar in jail, so he had to \nlet him go.\n  That is what is happening in the America. If we are not serious about \nit and don't invest in it and allow our judges, in a humane, \ndisciplined, and effective way, to validate the rule of law, to \nvalidate decency and morality, to establish a system that disciplines \nwrongdoing instead of accommodating to it, we will continue to have \nmore juvenile crime. I believe that is a significant way to prevent \ncrime.\n  I know, regarding general prevention programs, it is the politically \ncorrect thing for people to say we need to spend more money. I am not \nopposed to it, if they work. I will say this: Our program had $40 \nmillion spent for the National Institute of Justice to research and \nevaluate the effectiveness of the various juvenile prevention programs. \nI know Senator Fred Thompson, from Tennessee, who worked on this \ncommittee, used to say: We don't know what works. We need to study more \neffectively what we are doing. We have had a commitment in this bill to \nresearch, to analyze, what really does work to reduce crime.\n  Mr. President, I have no pride of authorship. I want to spend the \nresources we are prepared to spend as a Congress as wisely as we \npossibly can so we can get an effective reduction of crime. School \nprograms probably ought to be funded through the school and not through \na crime bill.\n  The general philosophy of most experts in dealing with juvenile crime \nis to make that young person's first brush with the law their last. \nThat does not mean they have to be locked up for weeks on end, but it \nmeans a\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\nmeaningful confrontation about their wrongdoing must occur.\n  Families need to be involved. A probation officer needs to be \ninvolved, one who has the time to analyze the problem--perhaps in the \nfamily or perhaps that child's own problem. Sometimes it is not a \nfamily problem; sometimes the child has the problem-- to confront it \nand take the steps necessary to improve that circumstance.\n  Police officers all over America tell me this is what is happening. \nThey are out patrolling. They catch a young person who is burglarizing \na house or business. The child is arrested and taken down to the police \nstation. I would say the overwhelming majority of communities in \nAmerica do not have a juvenile jail facility in their community, so \nthat means the nearest jail is some hours away. They are not able to \nkeep that child for 1 hour in an adult prison, even if it is on a \nseparate floor or separate wing, totally apart from adults. They cannot \nkeep that child 1 hour. They leave the child sitting in the police \nstation lobby waiting for mother and daddy to come and take them home.\n  Some say, oh, that is not true.\n  It is true. That is what is happening all over America, and a lot of \nit is because the Federal regulations on detaining young people are too \nsevere, in my opinion.\n  I know some think, oh, you want to put young people in jail with \nadults. I don't want to put them in jail with adults. But I don't want \nevery local community in America to have to build a separate juvenile \njail when they may have no more than two or three people. They have new \nfacilities and they can carve our wings or sections of those jails for \nshort-term detention of young people, because if they are arrested, \nbail has to be set. If they are not able to make it right away, they \nhave to have a hearing within 72 hours. So if they have to take them to \na distant facility at night--maybe there is only one police officer \nstill on duty. I know the Senator from New York has more police \nofficers on duty than one, but there are a lot of communities in New \nYork State and Alabama that may only have one officer on duty. So it is \njust not a practical thing.\n  I believe we ought to be more realistic because juvenile judges do \nnot want children to be harmed. Police chiefs do not want children to \nbe harmed. They are not going to put them in these places so they can \nbe abused. That is ``Easy Rider'' myth, that stuff. That is myth. \nPeople get sued if you allow somebody in prison to be abused while in \nprison. We ought not allow that to happen.\n  I just say that first of all. That is my general view of where we \nare.\n  We did make a commitment--and Senator Leahy referred to it --not to \nfederalize juvenile justice. I really do not believe that is an \nappropriate thing for us to do. As I said, virtually all juvenile cases \nare handled in State courts. They have procedures for it. They have \ndetention systems that ought to be expanded, but they have them \nalready. They have their own laws that have been set up. They have \njuvenile judges. They have, many times, prosecutors who specialize in \njuvenile cases. They have probation officers who specialize in it. They \nhave boot camps, halfway houses, mental health treatment, drug \ntreatment--systems already set up around these systems, and we ought to \nencourage that and encourage them to invest more and not create a new \nFederal system for it. There has been some concern. I think anyone who \nreads this bill will realize we have not made any move to federalize \njuvenile justice.\n\n  Let me mention a few things now. There is some question about what \ndoes it require to get a grant out of this bill if you are going to \nimprove your juvenile justice system, if you want to help your judge in \nyour town have an expanded capacity to confront youngsters and deal \nwith them.\n  You need to have a graduated sanctions. We just do not believe we \nought to give money where there is business as usual and a revolving \ndoor. You ought to have some plan--it doesn't tell you how--of \ngraduated punishments so when they come back the second and third time, \nthere is an ability for the judge to impose more serious punishments.\n  You need to have a policy of drug testing upon arrest. If we care \nabout young people who are committing crime and we want to improve them \nand see they do not continue a life of crime, we ought to test them for \nillegal drugs.\n  We have known for the last 20 years--there was a survey by, I \nbelieve, the National Institute of Justice, of major cities around the \ncountry that showed that almost 70 percent--everywhere it usually runs \n67 to 70 percent--of the people arrested in those cities when drug \ntested upon arrest test positive for an illegal drug. That drugs are an \naccelerator to crime cannot be denied. There is no doubt about it. What \nI believe is every court system--this doesn't mandate exactly the way I \nwould like to see it--but it does encourage every court system to have \na program to drug test young people when they are arrested. Because if \nthey are on drugs, we need to start treating them. We need to start \ndealing with it effectively.\n  You say, even for small crimes like theft? Yes. Because oftentimes \nthe thief, the person who is stealing, is stealing to get money for \ndrugs. Frequently those people who show up with drug use, who are more \nlikely to have a drug problem, are more likely to shoot somebody than \nsomeone who gets mad at a football game. So you just don't know. In \nWashington, DC, it has been done for years. I met with the director \nhere 15 years ago and I have studied this problem. I really believe we \nneed to do a better job. So it says you should have a plan.\n  Then we need to recognize the rights of victims. We continually have \nthe complaint, if you are burglarized or robbed by a young person, \noftentimes you do not even know when they are tried or what the \nprosecutor and judge decide to do about it. Your opinion is not asked. \nIt gets settled. There is never a court hearing and you are not told \nanything about it. Victims have rights in juvenile court, too. So we \nare asking them to address that and establish some policy that will \nimprove the victims' right to participate. Some States do, some do not.\n  These are some of the things we try to do in funding this bill. It is \none thing to say you ought to do these things; it is another thing for \nthe Federal Government to ante up and help pay for it. So our block \ngrant proposal deals with that. It provides money that can be used for \ngraduated sanctions. It helps them build detention facilities. There \nare a lot of them that are modern, are first rate, that have a lot of \ngood things about them. We need to encourage every community in America \nto analyze its detention facilities and see if it can do a better job. \nI think we ought to provide matching funds for it, which this bill \ndoes. We have been doing some of that for the last 2 years in our \nbudget, but I would like to make it permanent with this.\n  We have money for drug testing. If you set up a drug testing program, \nyou can have the Federal Government, basically, pay for it--because we \nbelieve it is important.\n  Recordkeeping--there is a famous case about a youngster in New York \nwho committed an assault with intent to murder; went to New Jersey, \ncommitted another violent crime and was released on bail and then \nmurdered a police officer. A judge in New Jersey did not know about the \nserious violent crime in New York.\n  We were not putting those records in the National Crime Information \nCenter. I know some will say this is juvenile, but I say this is \nserious. People who are committing serious violent crimes need to have \ntheir records in the National Crime Information Center, because when \nthey are arrested again--that is the pattern; they will be arrested \nagain--the judges will not know their prior history.\n  We have a good bit of money for that in this legislation which I \nbelieve will help States set up a first-class program; Mr. President, \n$75 million, in fact, for them to update their criminal records. We \nneed to encourage the States to start putting their records in the \nNational Crime Information Center. Director Louis Freeh said they will \naccept those records, they want those records, and they do not need any \nmoney from the Federal Government to receive them. They can receive \nthem without additional cost.\n  We want to promote restitution programs. That is what this grant \nmoney can be spent for.\n  We want to promote programs requiring juveniles to attend and \ncomplete\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\nschool programs and vocational programs.\n  We want to require parents to work and pay for some of these \nprograms.\n  We want antitruancy programs. Truancy is a serious problem. It is an \nindicator of an oftentimes deeper problem. If we can create a better \ntruancy program in America, we can improve and reduce crime.\n  We want identification and treatment of serious juvenile offenders, \nthose who have real problems, and prevention and disruption of gangs, \ntechnology and training programs for juvenile crime control, and moneys \nfor programs that punish adults who knowingly and intentionally use a \njuvenile during the commission of a crime.\n  There are, in fact, in America today cold-blooded drug dealers and \nother criminals who actually use juvenile offenders to commit crimes \nbecause not much will be done to them if they are caught. We believe \nthat is a horrible thing and we ought to have a program to end it.\n  I am going to talk about prevention now. Again, I have no objection \nto good prevention programs, but since 1974, we have put no money--and \nin my hometown of Mobile, AL, the juvenile detention center there was \nbuilt in 1974 or 1975, partly with Federal funds. It encouraged them to \ncreate what, at the time, was a first-rate, state-of-the-art facility. \nBut that all ended many, many years ago. We have no money dedicated \ntoday to help juvenile law enforcement, detention or otherwise. There \nare no dedicated moneys for that, except what we have as part of our \neffort last year, which is not enough.\n  We are spending $4.4 billion per year on juvenile prevention \nprograms. GAO has found there are 117 of these programs--117 juvenile \nprograms, spending $4.4 billion a year. We are asking for $450 million \nonly for juvenile accountability in a block grant and only a portion of \nthat so we can improve our detention facilities.\n  Look at this chart. I think we ought to understand this. There is a \nlot of money being spent now on prevention programs, and some of it is \nnot being spent wisely. That is why we have money in this bill, to \nreview the effectiveness of these programs.\n  Listen to this: There are 62 programs that provide training and \ntechnical assistance for young people who may be in trouble; 62 for \ncounseling; 55 for research and evaluation; violence prevention, 53 \nprograms; parental and family intervention, 52; support service, 51; \nsubstance abuse prevention, 47; self-sufficiency skills--I don't know \nwhat that means, but I guess it is a good program--46; mentoring, 46; \njob assistance training--people say we need to get these young people \njobs. All right, we have 45 programs doing that; substance abuse \ntreatment, 26, and there are others.\n\n  That is some of the money we are already spending. I am not sure we \nare spending it well. What we probably should do is have a total \nanalysis of all that is being spent in the different agencies and \ndepartments.\n  I used to be in the 4-H Club. I had the best hog in Wilcox County. I \nreceived a little pin for it from the 4-H Club. I was able to go to \nAuburn. It was a big deal to go to Auburn University. My friend almost \nwon the tractor driving contest in Auburn. That was a big deal for me, \nbut they have a 4-H Club program now for the inner city. That sounds \nlike a good idea, I guess. Maybe it is a good idea. I don't know \nwhether it is working or not. Maybe we ought to see if money we are \nspending on inner-city 4-H Clubs as prevention projects is well spent \nand whether those programs are working. I would like to look at that.\n  There is also a strong feeling that after we have a tragic shooting, \nas we did in Littleton, CO, we ought to do something about guns; we \nought to do more about guns. We have quite a number of Federal gun laws \non the books today.\n  I served as a prosecutor for 12 years. President Bush sent out a \nmessage that he wanted a crackdown on illegal guns in America. He \nwanted us as prosecutors--there were three districts in Alabama and 92 \nFederal districts, 92 U.S. attorneys in America. He said: I want you to \ncrack down on these gun cases and prosecute criminals who are using \nguns.\n  We started a project called Triggerlock. In 1992, when I left office, \nthere were 7,048 prosecutions under existing Federal gun laws. After \nPresident Clinton took office, he said we have to have more gun laws.\n  Since he has been in office, he has pushed for more, more, more, \nmore, shoving the second-amendment right to bear arms as far as it can \nbe shoved. Those of us who believe in the second amendment and the \nright of people individually to bear arms find that troubling. It is \nalways more, more, more, but at the same time, the prosecutors he \nappoints, the U.S. attorneys who are Presidential appointments, are \nallowing the cases to drop. It dropped, in 1998, to 3,807. That comes \nright out of the U.S. attorneys' statistical report.\n  You say, ``Jeff, I don't know what that proves.'' I say to you, if \nAttorney General Reno tomorrow made a commitment and sent a message to \nall U.S. attorneys that she wanted these cases prosecuted, those \nnumbers would be up to the rate of 7,000 within a month or two.\n  These are not complicated questions. It is a question of the priority \nof the Department of Justice. A good prosecutor can prosecute 100 gun \ncases in the time he can spend on one complex tax case, for example. I \nam telling you, they can prosecute 100 of them for one complex tax \ncase, one corruption case. We ought not to abandon tax cases and \ncorruption cases, but just a little emphasis on this will help.\n  Since the President took office, he said we have to have a lot of new \ngun laws because this will reduce violence. We want new laws. The \nCongress responded and gave him new laws.\n  One of them is possession of firearms on school grounds. The First \nLady said the other day there were 6,000 incidents of guns being \nbrought onto school grounds last year--6,000. Look at how many this \nDepartment of Justice, President Clinton's personally appointed \nprosecutors, prosecuted. In 1997, they prosecuted five defendants for \nthat violation. They had to have this law. In 1998, they prosecuted \neight. That is not going to affect the crime rate in America. That is \nall I am saying. I am not saying how many cases ought to be prosecuted.\n  What I am saying is we need to get away from symbolism and we need to \nstrengthen our juvenile justice system in America.\n  Look at this one: Unlawful transfer of firearms to juveniles. It is \nnot a bad law. If you transfer a gun to a juvenile, it is against the \nlaw. It ought to be a crime. It was not a crime until it was passed, \n922 (x)(1). Five were prosecuted in 1997 and six in 1998.\n  Look at this one: Possession or transfer of semiautomatic weapons, \nassault weapons. That was the assault weapons bill that was so \ncontroversial. An assault weapon looks horrible, but it is, in effect, \na semiautomatic rifle. It fires one time when you pull the trigger. It \nis not fully automatic, which is already illegal and has been illegal \nfor years.\n  There was debate on it, and Congress voted to make it illegal. It was \nthe first time that a semiautomatic was made illegal. In 1997, four \ncases were prosecuted; in 1998, four cases.\n  My view is that if we have a good gun law that needs to be passed \nthat can make our communities safer, I am willing to support it as long \nas it does not violate the second amendment of the Constitution. But I \ntook an oath to uphold the Constitution.\n  This legislation has a good provision called the Juvenile Brady \nprovision which says if a youngster is convicted of a crime of \nviolence, that record has to be maintained, and they cannot get a \nweapon when they get older. Adults who have been convicted of a felony \ncannot possess a firearm in America. That is against the law. But if \nyou were convicted of a serious crime as a juvenile, it did not count \nagainst you and you could possess a gun as an adult when you became an \nadult. So we are going to close that loophole.\n  Finally, this legislation has gained great support throughout \nAmerica. The Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have \nendorsed this legislation. The National Troopers Association, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, and the National Collaboration for \nYouth have commented extremely favorably on the bill, as has the \nNational Juvenile Judges Association, which has been much involved in \nhelping us draft it. They are very positive about this.\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\n  I strongly believe that we have responded to the concerns of the \nDemocratic Members and have tried to craft a bill that would be \nacceptable to them. I know Senator Leahy has worked on it, and Senator \nBiden. I see he would like the floor. He has sponsored many crime bills \nover the years and has been active in his interest in this legislation. \nAs ranking member on our subcommittee, he will be talking about the \nlegislation in a minute.\n  I believe we have a good bill. I think it is time for America to \nrespond to juvenile crime in an effective way. This bill will do many \nof the things that are necessary--not all, but it will do many of the \nthings necessary for us to create an effective response to juvenile \nviolence in America.\n  I have a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that \nuntil 2:15 today debate only be in order on the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this bill has been a long time in coming. We have been \ndebating this bill in the Judiciary Committee for some time. We have \nattempted to come up with a compromise that made sense. Later in the \nday--if not today, tomorrow--the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and I are going to offer an amendment that is essentially a \nsubstitute, but we will not probably offer it in the form of a \nsubstitute; it will be offered in the form of an amendment. At that \ntime, I will speak to the distinctions of the bill before us and the \nprovisions Senator Hatch and I will be amending.\n  Let me speak to the general proposition of juvenile crime in America.\n  I listened to my friend from Alabama and others who have spoken \ntoday, and I sometimes get confused. I get confused because the \nassertions that are made do not always comport with what the \nlegislation says.\n  For example, there is a general assertion made, and a general \nconsensus, that we should not be federalizing juvenile crimes; we \nfederalize too much already, yet we do that in this bill in terms of \nattempts to deal with preemptive jurisdiction, imposing upon the States \njudgments about how and under what circumstances they should try \nadults, and children as adults, and so on.\n  The second thing that we do is we go through episodic periods in this \nbody. I have been around long enough that I have been in more than one \nepisode. I remember when I first came here, I say to my friend from \nMinnesota. We all kind of forget the consensus, the academic consensus, \nthe criminal justice consensus, the political consensus we reached in \nthe early 1970s. That was that we had horrible cases--and legions of \nthem--where we put juveniles in adult prisons, we put juveniles in \nadult holding tanks, we put juveniles in circumstances where they were \nexposed to adult-convicted criminals.\n  There were legions of reports about their being raped, their being \nbeaten, their being sodomized, their being dealt with in the most \nhorrendous way. The Nation rose up in the late 1960s and early 1970s, \nled by the academics of this Nation, led by the criminologists, who \nsaid this has to stop, this has to stop.\n  I was here when Birch Bayh, the distinguished father of the Senator \nfrom Indiana, led the fight on the Judiciary Committee and the \nbipartisan consensus to change the rules. We ended up with things \ncalled sight and sound requirements. We ended up with things that dealt \nwith recordkeeping. We ended up with changes in the law that dealt with \nthe ability to try juveniles as adults and under what circumstances. \nAnd they worked. They worked. They worked very well, because you are \nnot reading in our press about 13-year-old boys being sodomized in a \njail, while they are held in a holding tank to be arraigned. You are \nnot reading about that now.\n  For those of you who have not done this as long as I have, I suggest \nyou go back and look at the Record and what we read about in the 1960s. \nIt happened all the time. It does not happen anymore.\n  A little bit of power given to anybody is almost always abused. The \nbureaucrats got a little bit too much power, and over a long period of \ntime we came up with some stupid rules, stupid applications of the \nsight and sound restrictions.\n  For example, if you in fact are in a rural community, in your State, \nI say to my friend from Minnesota, and you arrest a kid, a 16-year-old \nat 2 o'clock in the morning for a violent crime and there is no \nfacility in town except one that has two adults in it, and the nearest \njuvenile facility is 4 hours away, we have been in some cases \ninsisting--it is rare--that that kid be driven 4 hours all the way to \nthat other facility when you have a one-cop town. It doesn't make \nsense. There should be accommodations made for 6 or 8 hours until the \nnext shift comes on so you can work this out. Well, what we do is we \nmake accommodations for that.\n\n  Let's not blow this out of proportion. I remind people, you are not \nreading in the press, as you did in the 1950s and 1960s and early \n1970s, about juveniles being abused in adult prisons. In my own State, \nit doesn't take much. Let me remind everybody: You put a young kid, \nmaybe even a status offender, not a violent criminal, in a cell next to \nsomebody who is a hardened criminal. You lock the door. The hardened \ncriminal starts telling the kid about what he is going to do to him and \nhow he is going to enjoy doing it to him. The records are replete with \njailers coming back and finding the kid hanging himself in a jail, \ncommitting suicide. They are not happening now. So let's not get \ntrigger happy here, no pun intended, and decide that we are going to \novercorrect.\n  Back in the bad old days, when I was chairman of this committee, a \nranking member for about 18 years, we had scores of hearings. We \nbrought everybody in. The cops who come in want to solve the problem--\nthe example I gave in Minnesota or Vermont or Montana or Delaware. We \ncan do that. But let us not go into this routine where somehow this \nsight-and-sound provision has taken on some bureaucratic hubris where \nwhat happens is that we have people going awry with power and \npreventing us from trying violent juvenile children or young adults and \nthey are on the rampage in the countryside because of this stupid \nFederal rule. Not true. Not true.\n  Let's get some facts straight. Remember when I introduced the Biden \ncrime bill back in 1984. It took 6 years to get it passed finally, the \none with the 100,000 cops in it. I used to say all the time, Why can't \nwe learn to walk and chew gum at the same time? When the crime bill, \nwhich everyone has stood up here and is giving great credit to for the \nsignificant reduction in violent crime among adults in particular, was \nwritten, I might point out, a number of people giving it credit here \nvoted against it, thought it was a bad idea, for 2 years tried to amend \nit.\n  Well, there have been a couple altar calls. I welcome everybody to \nthe party. What is that old expression: Success has 1,000 fathers; \ndefeat, none. I am delighted there are so many strong supporters for \nthe crime bill now. I am delighted. But let them remember why it \nworked.\n  We finally got liberals and conservatives to agree that they were \nboth wrong and both right. I don't know how many times my colleagues \nhad to listen to me on the floor during the 1980s and 1990s saying: \nLook, liberals have been harping on the following point: It is the \nsociety that makes these young criminals, and all we have to do is give \nthem love and affection. All we have to do is intervene with the right \nprograms. All we have to do is deal with prevention. All we have to do \nis deal with treatment.\n  My conservative friends would come in and say: The answer is tougher \npenalties, hang them higher, put them in jail longer.\n  The facts were sitting before us just as they are now. Let's get some \nof the statistics straight, lest we be confused. I know facts sometimes \nbother us in this debate. Our friend Alan Simpson, the former Senator, \nas you know well, used to say--I loved him, still do--he used to stand \non the floor and say--I will never get it as well as Alan said it and \nnever get it quite as right, but I think this was how his phrase went--\nhe would stand up, when someone was spouting off about something they \ndidn't know, and say: Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but \nthey are not entitled to their own facts.\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\n  Crime is the only issue on which everyone thinks they are entitled to \ntheir own facts. Everybody has an opinion on crime. Everybody has an \nanswer, whether they know anything about it or not. I am not talking \nabout my colleagues now. I mean the whole world. If you ask the public \nwhat caused the increase in the value of the dollar, they won't pretend \nto have an answer. If you ask them what will stop murder, they have an \nanswer. If you ask them why is there violent crime, they have an \nanswer. It is one of the areas that affects us all, and we are entitled \nto our opinion. But let us look at some of the facts.\n  Since 1993 the national rate of juvenile crime is down. Juvenile \narrests for murder and manslaughter have decreased almost 40 percent, \nfrom 1993 to 1997, the last time we have the numbers. Juvenile arrests \nfor forcible rape are down almost a quarter, 22.8 percent. Juvenile \nviolent crime arrests are down by 4 percent from 1996, from the \nprevious year. There was no decline in adult crime then.\n  Now, let's look at what we are talking about--again, the facts: There \nare basically three categories of kids. When I introduced the Biden \ncrime bill for adults years ago, which became the crime law, I used to \nstand on the floor and say there are basically three types of criminals \nwe have to deal with, and we need different solutions for each \ncategory. If I am not mistaken, I am the first one to write a report \nthat about 6 percent, only 6 percent of the violent criminals in \nAmerica back in the 1980s and 1990s, and even now, committed over 60 \npercent of all the violent crimes in America. If you went out and you \ncould gather up all 6 percent of the career criminals, gather them all \nup, put them in jail and throw the key away, violent crime would drop \nby over half. That is No. 1. So we need a specific program for career \ncriminals. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, had a career \ncriminal bill that became law, a gigantic help.\n  The second category is people who have committed a violent offense \nbut are not career criminals. The third category is people who had \ncrimes of property and status offender crimes, victimless crimes.\n  They all required different solutions. So that is why in the Biden \ncrime bill we did three things: We took about $10 billion and hired \nmore cops, about $10 billion and built more prisons, and about $10 \nbillion to deal with drug treatment, prevention, and other programs. \nGuess what. It works.\n  The conservatives were right, that you have to get tougher, but with \none segment. The liberals were right, you have to pay more attention to \nwhat brings people into the crime stream, for one section. One size \ndoesn't fit all. So we finally got it right, and crime has dropped \ndramatically.\n  Now guess what. For juvenile crime, we have decided we are going to \nreinvent the wheel.\n  What is the formula here? The formula is simple. It is simple but \nhard. G.K. Chesterton once said about Christianity: It is not that \nChristianity has been tried and found wanting; it has been found \ndifficult and left untried.\n  Well, it is not that this is so complicated, but boy is it political.\n  In all of America, in that first category of kids, career criminals \nfor adults, there are 115,000 kids who were arrested for murder or \narrested for a violent crime; 2,000 of the 115,000 were arrested for \nmurder; 113,000 were arrested for violent crime. They are clearly in \none category. They are the bad actors. Everybody wonders why they have \nall these floppy clothes. Walk through the train station down here, \nwalk in any city. Those floppy clothes allow you to conceal a gun. \nGuess what. These kids are bad. They are bad seeds.\n  I want to tell you something that the liberals do not like hearing \nsaid: Some of these 16-year-olds are beyond redemption. They are beyond \nredemption for all practical purposes. And if and when they are \nredeemed, we don't know why they were. They may have seen the Lord in a \nblinding light. They may have come to their senses. But when it occurs, \nwe don't know why. And it doesn't occur that often.\n  But think about it, all the children in America we are talking \nabout--115,000.\n  There is a second category.\n  There are 685,000 kids who are arrested for nonviolent property \ncrimes ranging from stealing your car to mutilating your property, or, \nas we say in my section of the country, ``turfing your lawn.'' \nNonviolent property crimes, 685,000. They require a different solution.\n  Mr. President, locking them up in juvenile detention facilities as \nthey are only getting into the crime stream usually only makes them \nbetter criminals. That is where the graduated offenses come in.\n  If I am not mistaken, I think I am the first guy who had James Q. \nWilson testifying before a committee up here. Everybody now talks about \nthe ``broken window theory.'' Most don't understand it. It is a simple \nproposition. It is not complicated. If, in fact, you have a sanction \nthe first time a young person is brought before the courts, no matter \nhow small the sanction is, it has a greater impact than waiting three \nor four times and throwing the book at them. It is not rocket science. \nIt is not a big deal. It is pretty easy to figure out.\n  Then there is a third category of kids. There are at least a few \nmillion of them. They are in the at-risk category. Biden, what is that \nfancy term, ``at-risk?''\n  From 8 to 5, walk into any schoolyard in America. Take two or three \nteachers. Say to them: Point out the kids out there who are the ones on \nthe edge and haven't done anything wrong, but the ones you are most \nworried about. They can identify the at-risk kids for you.\n  Again, a second time using the phrase ``not rocket science.'' They \ncan identify them for us. We have civil liberties and civil rights that \ndo not allow that to occur, and shouldn't. But, as Barry Goldwater used \nto say, ``In your heart you know I am right.'' You know that we know \nthat you can identify them.\n  What are we going to do about those kids? Are we going to build jails \nfor them? Are we not going to take the time and effort to use \nprevention programs that work?\n  That is a third category.\n  I wrote a report a couple of years ago referring to the ``baby \nboomlettes,'' pointing out that the largest cadre of young people since \nthe baby boom is about to reach their crime-committing years--39 \nmillion kids under the age of 10.\n  If not one single thing happens in terms of the crime rates going up \nwith juveniles, every single category of crime will increase \nsignificantly--every one of them--because, guess what. There is just a \nheck of a lot more kids.\n  If we do ``as well as we have been doing,'' and there is not a one \none-hundredth of 1 percent increase in crime among juveniles that \noccurs, we are going to have several thousand more murders; we are \ngoing to have a 20-percent increase in the juvenile murders by the year \n2005, and the overall murder rate will go up 5 percent. Violent crime \nwill increase by the same percentage if we do not allow one single \npercentage increase, because there are so many kids coming.\n\n  Mr. President, the interesting thing about crime--only a few things \nwe know perhaps even with certainty--is that if we have a cop on this \ncorner and no cop on that corner, and there is a crime going to be \ncommitted, it will be committed on the corner where there is no cop. \nThat is one thing we know. Another thing we know is that violent crime \ndecreases when you get older.\n  Do you know why? It is harder to jump that chain-link fence. It is a \nlittle harder. It is harder to jump that chain-link fence. That is why \nit decreases.\n  You don't need a degree in criminology to figure this stuff out.\n  So why do we keep trying to reinvent the wheel?\n  I remember when I introduced the first crime bill; there was a New \nYork Times editorial saying: But we have tried this before.\n  More cops, we never tried that before. For the previous 20 years, the \ntop 20 cities in America had less than a 1-percent increase in the \ntotal number of police on their forces, yet their population increased \nby about 18 percent. We used to have three cops for every one violent \ncrime committed in America. We have gotten to the point where we have \none cop for every three violent crimes.\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n  So we did it. We hired more cops. And it is working.\n  The same principles work with regard to juveniles.\n  Look, a couple of my friends said: You know what we ought to really \ndo is, this Clinton administration ought to get in gear. Get in gear? \nThis Clinton administration has done better than any administration in \nhistory in reducing crime.\n  By the way, that ``truth in sentencing,'' I am the guy that wrote \nthat law. It is called ``The Federal Sentencing Commission.''\n  I might add that a lot of people who are speaking about it now were \nagainst it then. As a matter of fact, a colleague who used to be on the \nfloor, Mac Mathias, called the Biden law ``the same-time-for-the-same-\ncrime law.''\n  So what are we doing now? We are changing the game. This \nadministration that came along and supported ``truth in sentencing'' is \nthe administration that pushed community policing; is the \nadministration that has targeted the most violent criminals; is the \nadministration that has provided more money and effort from the Federal \nlevel for fighting crime than any in the history of the United States \nof America, and has succeeded. Let's get off this poppycock about \nwhether or not this is a Democrat or Republican deal. The hope was that \nonce we passed the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994--by the way, it is \nnot coincidental. If you notice when all the charts go up, violent \ncrime starts to drop in 1993. Guess what. That is when we introduced \nthe bill, and it passed in early 1994.\n  Mr. President, juvenile justice requires our attention. It requires \nus to be honest with one another and honest with the American people.\n  There are three categories of kids we have to focus on. The 115,000, \n2,000 of whom have been charged with murder, but 115,000 who are the \nviolent offenders, we should be building prisons for them. We should \nput them in juvenile facilities. And we should treat them in some cases \nas adults.\n  I might add, all my States rights guys, guess what. Most States have \na surplus.\n  I love these Governors. They come and tell us about how to run the \nFederal Government. And then they come to us and tell us if we want to \ndeal with building a juvenile facility, we had better send Federal \nmoney. But it is a local issue, it is a local problem, and it is a \nlocal crime. Local law enforcement does it, but you send the money, \nFederal Government, to build the prisons.\n  They can build the prisons. There is money in here to allow help for \nthat. But they should get responsible, I would respectfully suggest, in \nthe State legislature in Dover, DE; in Springfield, IL; and every other \ncapital in America to acknowledge what their responsibility is.\n  There is a second category, Mr. President--those that committed \ncrimes against property.\n  We can save these kids. We can intervene. A lot of them we can keep \nfrom being violent criminals. But it doesn't mean building more jails \nfor them.\n  The third category of 3 million-plus is those at-risk kids. We don't \nhave to reinvent the wheel. Just look at what we have done.\n  Mr. President, at some point I will be joining my friend, the Senator \nfrom Utah, the chairman of the committee, to introduce an amendment in \nthe nature of a substitute that makes the necessary corrections in a \nbill which has already made some progress.\n  My colleagues have heard me say this over and over again for the last \n15 years. A trial lawyer with whom I used to practice used to always \nsay to a jury: Keep your eye on the ball. The prosecution will tell you \nthis, this, this, and this about the defendant. The question is, Did \nthe defendant pull the trigger? Keep your eye on the ball.\n  I respectfully suggest that in this debate we keep our eye on the \nball. What are we going to do about the 115,000 very violent kids in \nAmerica? What are we going to do about the 680,000 in the crime stream \nwho have not committed crimes of violence but are on the edge? What are \nwe going to do about the 3 million kids who are on the edge, who are \nready to slip into the crime stream?\n  The problem that still exists beyond what we have to deal with here \nand beyond guns and beyond prevention--and the Hatch-Biden substitute \nputs in more money for prevention--what we really have to do is deal \nwith the drug problem in America.\n  I said before that we learned in the early 1980s that if we could \ntake the 6 percent of career criminals in America and remove them from \nthe scene by an act of God, violent crime in America would drop over 50 \npercent. Nobody disputes that now. I respectfully suggest, if any \nMember can have one wish that would fundamentally alter youth violence \nin America, ask God to come down and take alcohol and drug abuse out of \nthe system. If we did that one thing and nothing else, we would affect \nthe course of juvenile justice in America more than anything we can do.\n  Obviously, we can't do that. As I said years ago when I introduced \nthe first bill, there are three things we have to do: One, deal with \nadult crime, particularly focusing on violence against women; two, we \nhave to fix the juvenile justice system; and three, we have to deal \nwith the drug problem. They are the three pieces. It hasn't changed.\n  I urge my colleagues, as the debate gets underway, keep your eye on \nthe ball. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Look at what is working. \nStick with what is working. I am not suggesting we don't try new ideas, \nbut stick with what is working.\n  By the way, I point out that the very people who now are all for \njuvenile Brady--what was in the original juvenile justice bill I \nintroduced--are the very people who were against the Brady bill before. \nSo there is progress. There is hope.\n  Brady made a difference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask a question. The Senator and I have talked \nfor a very long time about afterschool programs. We had a conversation \nabut the Hatch-Biden amendment. I am very glad the two Senators were \nable to work something out with a bipartisan thrust.\n  Could the Senator clarify for me the language the Senators have both \nagreed to regarding block grants and setting aside 25 percent for \nprevention, and what afterschool programs fit into that definition in \nthe bill?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be brief because we will discuss this when the \namendment comes up, but I am happy to answer the question.\n  There are four block grants in the bill. The one in which the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah has agreed to make an alteration is the \nprovision for $450 million that is available for up to 25 percent; $113 \nmillion of that will now be able to be used for afterschool programs, \nfor drug treatment programs, and for any program which is designed to \ndeal with the cadre of kids who, from the time the school bill rings at \n2:30 until they go to a supervised situation at 6 or 7 o'clock at \ndinner, commit the majority of crimes committed by young people.\n  However, there are two other provisions in the bill. There are two \nother block grants of $200 million apiece. Those two allow money to be \nused for prevention and afterschool programs.\n  As I told the Senator, I happen to think in the original bill which I \nintroduced 2 years ago--that was the juvenile justice bill--that had a \nnumber of cosponsors.\n  I think we should be spending closer to $1 billion on this prevention \nnotion. From the time I was a kid, I went to a Catholic grade school. I \ndon't know whether the nuns got this from my mother, or my mother got \nthis from the nuns, but as my Mother would say, an idle mind is the \nDevil's workshop.\n  Give a kid no supervision from 2:30 in the afternoon until \ndinnertime, and I promise--I promise--good kids are going to get in \ntrouble and bad kids are going to do very bad things. This is not \nrocket science. We should be doing much more.\n  The Senator from California has focused very much as a Congresswoman \nand now as a Senator on dealing with afterschool programs. Again, if \nyou could wave a wand, and all the school boards and school districts \nthat say they care so much about their children--and they do--if they \ncould have baseball, basketball, cheerleading, chess, girls' field \nhockey, lacrosse, I would have those programs for every junior high in \nAmerica. Almost no junior high in America has the programs. Do you want \nto keep kids out of trouble? This is not hard. This is not hard.\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\n The people in the gallery know it; they understand it. The American \npeople understand it. Why don't we understand it? Why don't the local \nauthorities understand it? It is hard to tell people you will raise \nyour taxes in order to do this.\n  The other thing this bill does, with the help of Senators Phil Gramm \nand Robert Byrd: When the Biden crime bill passed in 1994, we set up a \nviolent crime trust fund. We let go 300,000 Federal workers. Under this \nadministration, we have the smallest federal workforce since John \nKennedy was President. I know the Senator knows this, but what we did \nwith that money is take the paycheck that used to go to the person \nworking at the IRS or the Department of Energy or wherever, and when \nthey left their job, we didn't rehire people. We reduced the workforce. \nWe put their paycheck in a trust fund, like the highway trust fund. \nThis extends the trust fund until the year 2005.\n  I say to my friend that there are a lot of programs worth spending \nmoney on--education and defense--but I can't think of anything more \nfundamental than taking the streets back and giving our kids a safe \nenvironment in which to live.\n  There are two things we do. We add prevention money as a permissible \nuse. We earmark it. It adds up only to $113 million. It has part of the \nother $400 million in this bill that can be used for prevention, but it \nis short of what we should be doing.\n  I am looking forward to supporting the Senator from California when \nshe tries to do more for afterschool programs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from Delaware. I am very happy he is \ngoing to support the amendment. We have $200 million in here for after \nschool--and this administration deserves a lot of credit--up from $40 \nmillion.\n  Guess how many applications came in. Another $500 to $600 million on \ntop of the $200 million. We have a very big void to fill.\n  As my friend said, crime happens after school. The FBI has shown \nthat. I think for this bill to be balanced it needs to go to tougher \npenalties for certain crimes but also to prevention and modest gun \ncontrol measures. I am looking forward to working with my friend on all \nthese matters.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As I said, at some point when it is appropriate, when the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee decides we should introduce our \namendment, we will. I thank him for reaching out, because it has not \nbeen easy for him to be able to do this, and I look forward at the end \nof the day to this entire bill being a bipartisan consensus when it \nleaves the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished Senator and I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota is about to take the floor.\n  Does the distinguished Senator from California wish to speak before \nlunch?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, I can wait until after lunch.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I suggest after the Senator from Minnesota completes \nhis remarks we recess for the policy meeting. Is there any objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I could not hear the \nfirst part of what the Senator from Utah said.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator would be the last speaker before the policy \nmeetings of both parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if my friend \ncould expand that to include a list, with Senator Schumer and Senator \nBoxer on our side? Is it possible to make this a little broader so we \nknow for certain, when we come back here after lunch, we can talk on \nthis bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am hoping after lunch we will be able to start on the \nfirst amendment. But we will certainly accommodate the Senators as they \ncome to the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What my friend is saying is we could speak in favor or \nopposition to an amendment. Is it possible to line it up in that way?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. Of course it is. We will try to go back and forth, \nif we can, on the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent request pending.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will add to that and see if my friend will accept this: \nThat the speakers to be decided on his side of the aisle, that of \nSenator Hatch, and from our side of the aisle it will be Senators \nSchumer and Boxer, in that order, after lunch? And we would add that to \nthis.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator withhold until after we have offered an \namendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HATCH. After we have offered an amendment, then we will work it \nout.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will withdraw it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this will just be an opening statement. \nI presume we are going to have a lot of time to debate this legislation \nand all of us will have the opportunity to have amendments we think are \nrelevant and important. Then we will have substantive debate. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about.\n  Once upon a time this bill was S. 10. Now it is S. 254. I am not \nexactly sure about all the provisions in this legislation. I am not \nexactly sure as to what the Biden-Hatch, or Hatch-Biden, amendment will \nsay, as well. But let me just say at the beginning, what I am quite \nsure of is that, as I look at this, I do not see a lot of balance. I \nsee a whole lot of emphasis on punitive measures, locking up more \nchildren. I do not see a whole lot by way of efforts to keep children \nfrom getting into trouble in the first place. I am actually surprised \nthat we have not learned some of the lessons which I think the people \nwho are down in the trenches, working with at-risk kids, have learned.\n  I heard my colleague from Alabama talk, and I like what he did. He \ntalked to people back home. I think if you talk to cops on the beat and \nyou talk to judges and you talk to sheriffs and you talk to counselors \nand you talk to youth workers, they will tell you we should be doing a \nwhole lot more by way of prevention. As I heard Senator Biden talk \nabout the substitute amendment, it sounds like a pittance we are really \nputting into prevention.\n  Let me also just say I am not a lawyer, I am trying to wade my way \nthrough this argument, but I want to make sure this legislation does \nnot weaken certain core protections we have had for children. There is \nno doubt in my mind that when certain kids commit violent crimes they \nmay very well be tried as adults and they may be faced with stiff \nsentences. But we have had certain protections for kids which make sure \nwe do not have too many kids in adult facilities.\n  I do not really know exactly whether or not we have a judicial review \nprocess of what prosecutors might want to do. I do not know what kind \nof protections are there. But to me it is really important, because \neven if you call some of these facilities ``colocated facilities,'' \nthat may just be a fancy word for adult facilities with juvenile wings. \nAs Senator Biden was saying, with a considerable amount of power and \neloquence, there is disturbing evidence that a whole lot of children--\nmany more children--commit suicide in adult facilities; eight times \nmore often than children held in juvenile detention facilities. I do \nnot think we can take these kinds of risks with young people's lives. \nAgain, I want to really understand whether or not we have the \nprotection we need for kids.\n  I will tell you what is a huge flaw in this legislation, not fixed at \nall by the substitute amendment or the amendment to the bill or the \nlegislation that is before us right now. This legislation undermines \nour efforts--and I hope every Senator will feel strongly about this--to \ndeal with the disproportionate confinement of ``minority youth'' in our \nNation's jails.\n  In practically every State, children of color are overrepresented at \nevery stage of the juvenile justice system, especially when it comes to \nsecure confinement. Furthermore, they receive unequal treatment by the \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\n  A study in California showed that minority children consistently \nreceive more severe punishments and were more likely to receive jail \ntime than white children for the same crime. Black males are four times \nmore likely to be admitted to State juvenile jails for property crimes \nthan their white counterparts and 30 times more likely to be detained \nin State juvenile jails for drug offenses than white males. The source \nis the Youth Law Center study called ``Juvenile Offenders Taken Into \nCustody.''\n  Also, let me say at the very beginning of my remarks that it is \nincredible that here we are at the end of the century--working with \nkids up to adults--it is my understanding that, roughly speaking, one-\nthird of all African American males ages 18 to 26 or 18 to 30 are \neither in prison, awaiting to be sentenced, or on probation--one-third \nof African American males in this country.\n  We ought to think seriously about what that means. In the State of \nCalifornia, I read and, again, I think it is ages 18 to 26--it may be \n18 to 30--there are five times as many African American men serving \nsentences, incarcerated in prison, than in college. We ought to think \nabout what this means.\n  Last month, along with Senator Dorgan, I visited the Oakhill Juvenile \nDetention Center in Maryland. We were joined by Judge George Mitchell \nwho sits on the D.C. Superior Court. He made an astonishing statement, \nif anybody wants to pay close attention to this. In talking about the \ndisparity of the treatment of minority children, in his 15 years, as a \njuvenile judge, having had thousands of juveniles in his courtroom, he \nhas had only two white youths appear before him. That is unbelievable. \nBy the way, this is not due to a dearth of white youth in the District \nof Columbia, nor is it that they never run afoul of the law.\n  We have a current law that says: States, you need to address this \nproblem and States are directed to identify the extent to which \ndisproportionate minority confinement exist in their State and try to \nidentify the problem, the causes, and what can be done about it.\n  This requirement has never resulted in the release of juveniles who \nhave broken the law, nor any kind of quota system on arrest or release \nof youth based on race. As a result of the current legal requirement, \n40 States to date are implementing intervention plans to address this \nproblem.\n  It seems to me we would want to do this as a nation. S. 254 is a \npiece of legislation that does not want to mention race and has removed \nthis current DMC requirement. Efforts to remedy the disparate treatment \nof minority youth that are underway in States is going to be seriously \nundermined as a consequence of this legislation. As a result of this, \nour juvenile justice system will fail, as it is now failing, to treat \nevery youth fairly and equitably, regardless of race.\n  I oppose this legislation, given the way it is now framed, and I \nthink other Senators should oppose this legislation for this reason \nalone.\n  Another issue that is going to come up in our debate--and the \nlegislation does not really address this in any major way--has to do \nwith the issue of gun violence. Please do not misunderstand me. I have \nbeen very careful in talking about Littleton and what happened at \nColumbine High School to simply not make a one-to-one correlation of \nany particular agenda that I am for because sometimes events in human \nexperience are so dark, so evil that they cannot be flippantly \nexplained. I do not know why those kids did what they did, why they \ncommitted murder. It is hard for me to know what really happened.\n\n  I will tell you this--and by the way, I have been so impressed with \ndiscussions with students in Minnesota. Just yesterday at Harding High \nSchool, we had a great discussion about education, violence in schools, \nviolence in communities, and those students had so many poignant and \nimportant things to say. This I do know: A Washington Post editorial \npointed out that 13 children a day in this country are killed by guns. \nThat is, in effect, one Littleton massacre each and every day in the \nUnited States. Of the 13 children killed by guns, 8 are murdered, 4 \ncommit suicide--there is a lot of youth suicide in this country; it is \nhard for me to accept as a father and grandfather--and 1 is killed \naccidentally by a firearm.\n  I will leave it up to other colleagues to go over the legislation we \nwill have on the floor that is going to be much tougher in terms of how \nto keep guns out of the hands of kids, much tougher on adults who \npeddle guns to kids, et cetera. I am saying we have to get a whole lot \nmore courageous and tougher when it comes to this gun legislation.\n  What I want to focus on is the whole question of the criminalization \nof mental illness. We are talking about a juvenile justice bill. I \npoint out--and I will talk about a piece of legislation that I have \nintroduced, the Juvenile Justice Mental Health Act which has 40 \nsponsors, including the American Bar Association--a lot of people are \ntalking about juvenile justice and a lot of people are talking about \nmental health services. I want to make sure we are of substance. I want \nto make sure we do not engage in symbolic politics. I want to make sure \nthis debate is real.\n  That may sound self-righteous. Sometimes I worry about everybody \ncarrying on about this legislation and the legislation then going \nnowhere, or people staking out a lot of positions, maybe not even based \nupon having had any experience for this. I hope we remain very, very \nfocused.\n  One of the things that is going on right now is we have criminalized \nmental illness. There are a whole lot of people--I am going to talk \nabout kids today--who should not be incarcerated in the first place. \nThere are many children in their very short lives who have been through \nwhat children should not go through.\n  When we look at the statistics on kids who are incarcerated, roughly \nspeaking, 1 out of every 5 is struggling with some kind of mental \ndisorder, struggling with mental illness. Moreover--and Senator Biden \ntalked about this--many of them struggle with substance abuse, many of \nthem have learning disabilities, many of them come from troubled homes, \nmany of them come from homes where they have seen violence every day.\n  The question becomes whether or not we are going to make some changes \nin this juvenile justice legislation that responds to these kids' \nlives. In setting the context, I will say that, despite popular \nopinion, most of the kids we lock up are not violent. The Justice \nDepartment study shows that 1 in 20 youth in the juvenile justice \nsystem have committed violent offenses--1 in 20. What has happened is \nthat, No. 1, a lot of kids who could be in community-based treatment \nwho have not committed a violent act instead wind up in these so-called \ncorrectional facilities which are not very correctional. And, No. 2, \nonce there--and I am talking about 20 percent of the kids, probably \nmore, kids who struggle with mental illness--the law enforcement \ncommunity, the guards, the police at these facilities do not know how \nto treat these kids. Quite often, they do not know with what these kids \nare dealing. As a result, many kids end up being disciplined within \nthese facilities and put in solitary confinement.\n\n  As the juvenile justice system casts a wider and wider net, which is \nthe direction of this legislation, and as we have more fear and more \nintolerance of kids who misbehave or commit nonviolent crimes, we are \npushing more and more children into the juvenile system who would not \nhave ended up there in earlier times. In particular, what bothers me to \nno end is a lot of these kids should not be there. A lot of these kids \nare struggling with mental illness and should be treated in a community \nsetting, and that is not happening.\n  The warnings are there. There is the school failure. There is the \ndrug and alcohol abuse. There is the family violence. There is the \npoverty at home. Yet, we do not put the emphasis on community \nprevention. We do not put the emphasis on early intervention services \nfor these kids. We do not put the emphasis on mental health treatment. \nAs a result, we make the same mistake over and over.\n  There are two amendments--or several amendments--that I am going to \noffer to this bill. But two of the amendments that I am going to offer \nare based upon the Mental Health Juvenile Justice Act. It is a \ncomprehensive strategy. We get the money to State and local communities \nand we provide the mental health services. There is strong support from \n40 organizations. When we introduced it with Congressman Miller about a \nmonth ago, I\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nguess, there was strong support from 40 organizations--every \norganization, from the American Bar Association to the American \nPsychiatric Association, the Children's Defense Fund, you name it. And \nwhat we are basically saying is, as opposed to warehousing children \nwith mental illness, we provide moneys to State and local communities \nto identify kids with these problems on the front end of the system, \nlook to alternatives to incarceration, provide mental health services \nfor these kids.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Minnesota yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am not yielding the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nbe able to continue his statement and that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business at the conclusion of his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Montana, I am going to \nhurry right up. I waited about 3 hours. I am just trying to go through \nthis. I do not plan on going on a long time, but I just want you to \nunderstand. I appreciate it.\n  The Mental Health Juvenile Justice Act, which I will basically offer \nas an amendment, says, A, let's do careful assessments on the front \nend. Let's not incarcerate kids who do not need to be incarcerated; \nand, B, let's provide the funding for these facilities to provide \nmental health services for kids; and let's make sure that the law \nenforcement community, whether it be on the front end or whether it be \nin these facilities, is trained to recognize kids who are struggling \nwith mental illness. That is the direction to go in.\n  Right now the situation is absolutely brutal--absolutely brutal. I \nhave spoken on the floor of the Senate before--and I could go on for \nhours on this, and I will not--about some trips I have taken to some of \nthese facilities. One trip to Tallulah, LA, was enough, although there \nare other Justice Department reports on Georgia and Kentucky as well, \nand it is the tip of the iceberg.\n  It is really just unbelievable to read about kids who spend as much \nas 7 weeks, 23 hours a day, in solitary confinement, to go to these \nfacilities where these kids do not get any treatment whatsoever, kids \nwho are brutalized. To go to the Tallulah ``correction'' facility with \nall of it privatized out to a private company--TransAmerica \nCorporation, I think, is the name of the company--and to have kids just \nblow the whistle on the whole facility, I say to my colleague from \nMontana, is just absolutely unbelievable. There have been lawsuits \nfiled.\n  It really is, frankly, unconscionable that we put so many of these \nkids in this situation. And 95 percent of the kids in Tallulah have not \ncommitted a violent crime. We are talking about racial disparity. There \nwas a sea of African American faces. There were up to 650 kids, and I \nbet you 80 percent of the kids were African American children. That is \nmy first point.\n  What I want to do is really put a very strong emphasis on mental \nhealth in juvenile justice. I want us to do a much better job as a \nNation, and we need to get the resources to the State and local \ncommunities to do the assessment, to do the alternatives to \nincarceration, to make sure kids who are in these facilities get the \ntreatment they need. And right now we are not doing it.\n  We have criminalized mental illness among kids and adults. Many of \nthem should not be in these facilities. And when they are in these \nfacilities, they receive no treatment whatsoever. I want to make sure \nthat with the debate on this legislation and the amendments that are \noffered we have a very strong focus on juvenile justice and the mental \nhealth of kids. That is my first point.\n  My second point is, I think that--well, no. In deference to my \ncolleague from Montana, I will just sort of say it in 1 minute, and \nmake my final two arguments. We are getting to the point now where we \nhave six States, led by California, that are spending more money on \nprisons than on State colleges and universities. In the State of New \nYork, keeping a juvenile in New York's Division of Youth now costs \n$75,000 a year. You can send three kids to Harvard for the same amount \nof money.\n  And I think we have to come to terms with some basic facts. There is \na higher correlation between high school dropouts and incarceration \nthan cigarette smoking and lung cancer. It would seem to me, again, we \nwould be doing a whole lot more by way of prevention--I certainly do \nnot think it is in this legislation, albeit there is some minor \nimprovement with the Hatch-Biden amendment which is helpful, but I \nthink it does not give the legislation the balance that it should have.\n\n  I do not see us doing very much when it comes to the early years. I \ndo not see us doing very much at all. Frankly, if we really want to \nmake a difference, we are going to have to pay some attention to all of \nthese reports that have come out about childhood development.\n  Where is the focus on early childhood development? I thought we were \ngoing to do a whole lot to make sure that we do well for children from \nright after birth to age 3, much less before kindergarten. Why are we \nnot doing that? Kids who come to school behind fall further behind, \ndrop out, and then wind up in jail. When are we going to begin to get \nreal about responding to these children in America? It is not in this \nlegislation. I have not seen it in any legislation that has come out on \nthe floor.\n  The second amendment that I am going to offer has to do with domestic \nviolence. I hope there will be overwhelming support for this. Let me \njust tell you that above and beyond the focus on women, I am sorry to \nsay that still about every 13 seconds or 15 seconds--what difference \ndoes it make; it is just outrageous--a woman is battered in her home. A \nhome should be a safe place.\n  I have been working with a number of people and staff--Charlotte \nOldham-Moore, my wife Sheila--and now we find out that we have not done \na very good job of really providing support for kids. They may not be \nbattered, but the effect of seeing this in their home over and over and \nover again, and then going to school, and not doing well, is that they \nwind up in trouble.\n  So one of the amendments we are going to have is to provide, again, \nthe funding to be able to recognize this and to be able to bring \ntogether all of the actors in the community to provide support for \nthese kids. In other words, we can have the greatest teachers, the \nsmallest class sizes, the greatest technology, and a lot of these \nchildren are not going to learn unless we get the support services to \nthem early.\n  We are also going to have an amendment, a third amendment, which \nreally does a good job of having much more focus on school-based mental \nhealth services. Again, I will have a chance to speak on this, but I \nthink we have to develop a whole infrastructure that focuses on mental \nhealth services. And I think it has to be before these kids get into \ntrouble rather than afterwards.\n  Finally, let me just say that there were some comments here which \nwere made that I wish we would have more debate on. I hope when I have \namendments I can get people out here debating. But my colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, over and over and over again was talking \nabout drug testing and the rest. What I do not understand is, if you \nare going to do the drug testing, how about the treatment as well? We \ndo not do the treatment programs. We do not do the treatment programs. \nSo much of what we see is tied into substance abuse problems.\n  I am going to be working on legislation--we have the bill with \nSenator Domenici to try and end this discrimination in terms of \ncovering mental health services for people. We are not doing that. That \nis one piece of legislation--including any number of childhood \nillnesses, autism, or post-traumatic stress syndrome, which, \nunfortunately, also is something that affects children, or anorexia, or \nattention deficit disorder. We do not provide any treatment or any \ncoverage for treatment.\n  We act as if these illnesses are not illnesses. There is all this \nstigma. When are we going to get this right? If we are going to talk \nabout prevention in a juvenile justice bill, we have to have that \ncomponent. And in the substance abuse, it is the same issue.\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\n  Where is the parity? Where is there a way of making sure we get the \ntreatment to these kids? It is crazy. So much of this prison \nconstruction industry, so many of the people who we are now \nincarcerating--so many of these kids who are in trouble are in trouble \nbecause of addiction. I would love it if my colleagues would just look \nat the Moyers documentary. Many are viewing brain diseases. We are now \ntalking about the biochemical and neurological connection, and we do \nnot provide the funding. We do not provide the treatment.\n\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying I think we are going to have \nto do a whole lot better. I will talk a lot about some of my travel \naround the country and what I have seen with my own eyes, but I bring \nto the attention of my colleagues, to give this a little bit of \ncontext, a report by Amnesty International. It is called ``The United \nStates of America, Rights for All, Betraying the Young.'' Just a few \nquotes. I am not picking on any particular States, but it is important.\n\n       ``Judge Zintner, I have an important question to ask you! \n     Would you please move me out of here? Please don't leave me \n     here with all these adults. I can't relate to any of them. \n     They pick on me because I am just a kid. They tease me and \n     taunt me. They talk to me sexually. They make moves on me. \n     I've had people tell me I'm pretty and that they'll rape me . \n     . . I'm even too scared to go eat . . . It's too much for \n     anyone my age to handle . . . Please help me with this.'' \n     Letter from 15-year-old Paul Jensen, imprisoned in South \n     Dakota State Penitentiary, to his sentencing judge, 1997. In \n     September 1998, his mother told Amnesty International that he \n     had not been moved from the prison.\n       ``There are 2.5 psychologists to see the 300 juveniles in \n     general population. This is despite the fact that 40 percent \n     of the juveniles received will be identified . . . as having \n     mental health or suicide watch needs. Because of the number \n     of juveniles that need to be seen, the supervisor has told \n     his staff that they cannot see a juvenile more than three \n     times a month unless they indicate that the juvenile will die \n     if he is not seen more often.'' Official audit of facilities, \n     Virginia 1996.\n       ``. . . girls as young as twelve years old were subjected \n     to sexual abuse, received no counselling, no vocational \n     treatment, no case treatment plans or inadequate or \n     inappropriate medical care, were placed in a `levels' program \n     in which the length of time of the juveniles detention could \n     be unilaterally changed, lengthened or shortened depending on \n     the whims of Wackenhut's untrained staff members, and were \n     made to live in an environment in which offensive sexual \n     contact, deviate sexual intercourse and rape were rampant and \n     where residents were physically injured to the point of being \n     hospitalized with broken bones.'' Texas 1998--extract from a \n     complaint filed in court alleging abuses at a juvenile \n     correctional facility operated by the Wackenhut Corporation, \n     a private for-profit company.\n       On a Sunday morning Paul Doramus, recently appointed \n     director of the state agency that is responsible for juvenile \n     justice----\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator how long he \nis going to proceed? We are going past 12:30. In great deference to the \nPresiding Officer, we were supposed to finish at 12 o'clock.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be done in a moment. I started at 20 after. I \nwill be done in about 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Presiding Officer has let us proceed with great \ngenerosity.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague that I waited for 3 hours and I \nalso deferred to others. Senator Mack needed to speak, and others. I \nunderstand that. I will finish up. I said that several times, I think, \nto my colleague.\n\n       On a Sunday morning Paul Doramus, recently \n     appointed director of the state agency that is responsible \n     for juvenile justice institutions, visited the Central \n     Arkansas Observation and Assessment Center. He heard a boy \n     sobbing: ``Mister, get me out of here, I want my mother.'' \n     Doramus discovered a 13-year-old boy in an isolation cell, \n     ``sobbing so hard he could hardly speak.'' The boy had \n     been caught in a stolen car and was arrested for theft of \n     property. At the institution he had been disruptive, and \n     staff placed him in isolation. ``As I attempted to talk \n     with him, his calls for help just grew louder,'' Doramus \n     said. The boy's next words jarred Doramus even more. \n     ``Jesus doesn't love me anymore for what I did.'' Doramus \n     held the boy's hands through the cell bars. ``That's not \n     true, partner,'' he assured him. ``He does.''\n       ``All I could think of was my two kids who were at home, \n     who got the hugs and got the love and got the support,'' \n     Doramus said. ``I thought, God forgive us all.

I \nwill have a number of amendments dealing with domestic violence, \ndealing with mental health and juvenile justice that I have been \nworking on for the past year, dealing with the whole question of how we \ncan get more support for kids before they get into trouble.\n  I look forward to this debate, and I hope before it is all over we \nwill have a balanced piece of legislation.

Mr. President, in January, I joined Senators Moynihan, \nJeffords, and Kennedy to introduce S. 331, the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act of 1999. This legislation has a simple objective--to \nhelp people with disabilities go to work if they want to go to work, \nwithout fear of losing their health insurance lifeline.\n  S. 331 creates two new Medicaid options for States to make it \npossible for people with disabilities who choose to work to do so \nwithout jeopardizing health insurance access. The bill also extends \nMedicare part A coverage for a 10-year trial period for individuals on \nSSDI who return to work.\n  In addition to these health coverage innovations, the bill provides a \nuser-friendly, public-private approach to job placement. Because of a \nnew, innovative payment system, vocational rehabilitation agencies will \nbe rewarded for helping people remain on the job.\n  Mr. President, this combination of health care and job assistance \nwill help disabled Americans succeed in the workplace.\n  Tremendous progress has been made on many fronts in the 8 years \nfollowing the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. However, \nthere are still serious obstacles standing in the way of employment for \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  Unofrtunately, federal programs for individuals with disabilities too \noften discourage work. The most important barrier to employment \nidentified by disabled individuals is the fear of losing health \ninsurance.\n  The unemployment rate among working-age adults with severe \ndisabilities is nearly 75 percent. Many of these individuals would \nprefer to be working and paying taxes. Unfortunately, Mr. President, \nthe simple fact is that people with disabilities are\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\noften presented with a catch-22 between working and losing their \nMedicaid or Medicare. This is a choice that no one should have to make.\n  But even modest earnings can result in a loss of eligibility for \nMedicaid or Medicare, and disabled individuals cannot surrender their \ninsurance access without jeopardizing their health.\n  Today, more than 7.5 million disabled Americans receive cash benefits \nfrom SSI and SSDI. Disability benefit spending for these two programs \ntotals $73 billion a year. If only 1 percent--or 75,000--of these SSI \nand SSDI beneficiaries were to become employed, federal savings in \ndisability benefits would total $3.5 billion over the worklife of the \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, income tax day, April 15, is still fresh in our minds. \nIt is not very often, especially at this time of year, that we hear \nfrom millions of Americans eager to become taxpayers. I say we should \nwelcome Americans with disabilities into the ranks of taxpaying \ncitizens.\n  In my own State of Delaware, experts on disability policy have made \ntheir support for S. 331 clear. Larry Henderson, Chair of Delaware's \nDevelopmental Disabilities Planning Council, testified in support of S. \n331 at a Finance Committee hearing. He supports S. 331 ``because it \ndoes not penalize persons with disabilities for working in that it \nallows for continued access to health care.''\n  For this reason, more than 100 national groups have endorsed the \nbill, representing veterans, people with disabilities, health care \nproviders, and insurers.\n  Mr. President, on March 4, the Finance Committee marked up and passed \nS. 331 by a vote of 16 to 2. S. 331 was the first health care bill \npassed out of our committee this year, and I appreciate the spirit of \nbipartisan cooperation that made our vote possible.\n  The strong support for S. 331 shown by our committee is also \nreflected in the full Senate. Mr. President, a total of 75 Senators now \nsponsor S. 331. Let me say that again--75 Senators have signed on to S. \n331. That would be a remarkable total for any bill, let alone a health \ncare proposal.\n  I think S. 331 has been so popular on both sides of the aisle because \nit is all about helping disabled Americans work if that is what they \nwant to do. It is about helping people reach their potential. It is not \nabout big government--it is about getting government out of the way of \nindividual commitment and creativity.\n  Through my work on S. 331, it has become vividly clear to me that we \nare all just one tragedy away from confronting disability in our own \nfamilies.\n  Unfortunately, we cannot prevent all disabilities. But we can prevent \nmaking disabled individuals choose between health care and employment.\n  It is time now to act. Mr. President, together with Senators \nMoynihan, Jeffords, and Kennedy, I have asked that S. 331 be scheduled \nfor a vote before Memorial Day. I ask all my colleagues to join with us \non behalf of millions of disabled Americans.\n  With a Senate vote in support of S. 331, we can move another step \ncloser to unleashing the creativity and enthusiasm of millions of \nAmericans with disabilities ready and eager to work. I look forward to \nseeing S. 331 enacted into law this year.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join today with Senators Roth, \nKennedy, and Jeffords in announcing that we have a total of 75 \ncosponsors supporting the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This \nbill would address some of the barriers and disincentives that \nindividuals enrolled in Federal disability programs face in returning \nto work. We rise today to make the case that this measure deserves \nconsideration in the Senate as soon as possible. We are committed to \npassing this bill promptly and without amendment.\n  The great enthusiasm and broad support for this legislation has \ncreated its impressive momentum. Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Roth, and \nI introduced the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (S. 331) on \nJanuary 28 of this year. On February 4, the Finance Committee held a \nhearing on the bill. Our former chairman and majority leader among \nothers testified in emphatic support. On that day, we already had a \nbipartisan list of 42 Senators. The committee reported the bill without \namendment on March 4 by a vote of 16 to 2. At that time, the total \ncosponsor list reached 60, including 18 Republicans and 42 Democrats.\n  The President included the Senate legislation in his fiscal year 2000 \nbudget, and expressed his support for this bipartisan initiative in his \nState of the Union Address.\n  The overwhelming support for this legislation is not surprising given \nits simple and universal goal: to provide Americans with disabilities \nthe opportunity to work and contribute to the fullest of their ability. \nIts supporters include persons with disabilities and their families, \nveterans, health care providers, and health and disability insurers.\n  I join Senators Kennedy, Roth, and Jeffords in urging its earliest \npossible consideration and passage by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my friends and colleagues, \nthe Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth; and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nJeffords; and my colleague from New York, Mr. Moynihan, in urging the \nSenate to move ahead with this excellent piece of legislation which has \nbeen described by the Senator from Delaware and which I will summarize \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Once in a while the Members of this body get together and try to \nexercise a judgment which is going to have an important and dramatic \nimpact on improving the quality of life of the people of this country. \nThis is such an undertaking. The reason it is so powerful is because it \nreflects the best judgment of the disability community in its \nentirety--not only those who are affected by some particular kind of \nchallenge--it has the input of parents; it has the input of the medical \nprofession, both the doctors, nurses and the caretakers; it has the \ninput of those who have worked in this field for many, many years.\n  It is the result of the extraordinary work over a period of some 18 \nmonths, tireless work of the members of the community--not Democrat or \nRepublican, not just the four of us here today, but so many others on \nour committees and off our committees who are so strongly committed \ntoward providing this kind of opportunity for those who have a \ndisability to participate in the economy in our country.\n  This body took monumental steps a number of years ago when we passed \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act. However, we were reminded after \nthe passage of that act that we were no longer going to permit \ndiscrimination against those with disabilities in our country, those \nwho had the ability to be able to perform in the areas of employment. \nThat was a major, major step forward. What we found out very quickly is \nthat there was another barrier for those who had disabilities. That was \nthe fact that if individuals who had disabilities could work, wanted to \nwork, were able to gain entry into the employment in the country, they \nwere going to lose because of the cutoff in terms of cash payments or \nlose, in terms of their medical health and assistance, the kind of help \nand assistance in terms of health care and in terms of their income \nthat would put them at enormous risk.\n  What was worked out in this amendment and in this legislation \nunderstands that. That effectively says to those who have a disability \nor a challenge that they can go on out and be a part of the American \ndream, a part of the American economy, and that we are working in a \nprocess that will continue to make the health insurance available and \naffordable when a disabled person goes to work or develops a \nsignificant disability while working, and it will gradually phase out \nthe loss of cash payments as the incomes rise, instead of the unfair \nsudden cutoff which so many workers with disabilities face today. It \nwill give people with the disabilities greater access to the services \nthey need to become successfully employed.\n  I think many in this body and across the country think that \n``disabled'' applies to individuals who are born with some disability. \nIn fact, this occurs in only about 15 percent of those who are \ndisabled.\n  This is a challenge that is out there every single day, for every \nmember of this body, for every citizen in this\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\ncountry. We are an accident away from having the kind of physical \nor mental challenge where we could even be affected or impacted by this \nlegislation. Just look at the number of people in the workforce every \nsingle year who experience hazards and difficulties. Accidents happen.\n\n  This is not just dealing with something in the past, this is \nsomething about America today and America in the future. We have the \nexpanding economy, the growing economy which is offering such hope and \nopportunity for millions of Americans with the exception of those who \nhave some kind of disability. With this legislation, we are \nguaranteeing now for the first time, one, that they will not be \ndiscriminated against in terms of employment; second, that they will be \nable to get the training, be able to gain the employment, and be able \nto have useful, productive, and contributing lives and be part of the \nwhole process and system. That is the kind of opportunity this \nlegislation means for so many of our citizens.\n  I thank all who have been a part of this, including the leadership of \nSenator Jeffords, who has been strongly committed to this legislation, \nand our Human Resource Committee, that has worked so hard in the \ndevelopment of the legislation, so many of the other members of our \ncommittee, Republican and Democrat alike, and to the members of the \nFinance Committee, the chairman, who I have mentioned--Senator Roth, \nwho has been enormously committed to it--and our colleague and friend, \nSenator Moynihan. This has passed virtually unanimously in our Human \nResources Committee, it has that degree of support; and 16 to 2 in the \nFinance Committee.\n  We ought to be about the business of calling this legislation up, \nconsidering it and passing it. Every day that goes by we are denying \nthese opportunities to individuals; every day, every week, every month \nthat goes by. We have been through the legislative process. I daresay \nthe four of us are prepared to agree, as we have uniquely so in other \nsituations, on sort of a ``no amendment'' strategy. We feel, since we \nhave tried to gain input from so many of those who have been involved \nin this process, this legislation could pass in a relatively short \ntime, in the time of a couple of hours, and still it would reflect the \nbest judgment of so many of those in so many different parts of the \ncountry.\n  We are strongly committed. With the overwhelming support we have, 73 \nMembers reflecting every possible viewpoint in the Senate, and the \noverwhelming need, this is legislation that needs to pass, should pass, \nmust pass. I hope we can do it in the next few days. It should not take \nmuch time. The disability community deserves it.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, I strongly support the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act, and I urge Senator Lott to bring the bill to the floor \nand allow the Senate to complete action on this important bipartisan \nlegislation before the Memorial Day recess. Last month, under the \nimpressive leadership of Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, the act \npassed in the Senate Finance Committee by a 16-2 vote. Today, 75 \nMembers of the Senate stand behind this bill, which removes the \nbarriers that present so many of our citizens with disabilities from \nliving independent and productive lives.\n  As former Majority Senator Bob Dole stated in his eloquent testimony \nto the Finance Committee, ``this is about people going to work--it is \nabout dignity and opportunity and all the things we talk about, when we \ntalk about being an American.''\n  We know that a large proportion of the 54 million disabled men and \nwomen in this country want to work and are able to work. But they are \ndenied the opportunity to do so. Removing barriers to work will help \ndisabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency. It will also contribute \nto preserving the Social Security Disability Trust Fund.\n  For too long, Americans with disabilities have faced unfair penalties \nif the take jobs and go to work. They are in danger of losing their \nmedical coverage, which could mean the difference between life and \ndeath. They are in danger of losing their cash benefits, even if they \nearn only modest amounts from work. Too often, they face the harsh \nchoice between buying a decent meal and buying their medication.\n  The Work Incentive Improvement Act will remove these unfair barriers \nfacing people with disabilities who want to work.\n  It will continue to make health insurance available and affordable \nwhen a disabled person goes to work, or develops a significant \ndisability while working.\n  It will gradually phase out the loss of cash benefits as income \nrises--instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that so many workers with \ndisabilities face today.\n  It will give people with disabilities greater access to the services \nthey need to become successfully employed.\n  Many leaders in communities throughout the country have worked long \nand hard and well to help us reach this milestone. They are consumers, \nfamily members, citizens, and advocates. They see everyday that the \ncurrent job programs for people with disabilities are failing them and \nforcing them into poverty.\n  They have spent many months helping to develop effective ways to \nright that wrong. And to all of them I say, thank you for helping us to \nprepare this needed legislation. it truly represents legislation of the \npeople, by the people and for the people.\n  When we think of citizens with disabilities, we tend to think of men \nand women and children who are disabled from birth. But fewer than 15 \npercent of all people with disabilities are born with their \ndisabilities. A bicycle accident or a serious fall or a serious illness \ncan disable the healthiest and most physically capable person.\n  This legislation is important because it offers a lifeline to large \nnumbers of our fellow citizens. A disability need not end the American \ndream. That was the promise of the Americans With Disabilities Act a \ndecade ago, and this legislation dramatically strengthens our \ncommitment to that promise.\n  We know that disabled citizens are not unable. Our goal in this \nlegislation is to reform and improve the existing disability programs, \nso that they do more to encourage and support every disabled person's \ndream to work and live independently, and be a productive and \ncontributing member of their community. That goal should be the \nbirthright of all Americans--and when we say all, we mean all.\n  The road to economic prosperity and the right to a decent wage must \nbe more accessible to all Americans. That is our goal in this \nlegislation. For too long, our fellow disabled citizens have been left \nout and left behind. This bill is the right thing to do, and it is the \ncost effective thing to do. And now is the time to do it.\n  I especially commend Senators Jeffords, Senator Roth, and Senator \nMoynihan for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation. Now is \nthe time to enact this long overdue legislation and free up the \nenterprise, creativity, and dreams of millions of fellow Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his very kind words. I want to express my deep appreciation for his \nefforts throughout his time here in the Senate to assist those people \nwith difficulties and disabilities.\n  Mr. President, let me pose a question. What would most people do if \nthey had health insurance coverage if they stayed home but not if they \nworked? Believe it or not, this is exactly the dilemma that many \nindividuals with disabilities face today. They must choose between \nworking or having health care. This is an absurd choice. Current \nfederal law forces individuals with disabilities to make this choice. \nThe Work Incentives Improvement Act, S. 331, bipartisan legislation, \nwith 75 cosponsors, addresses this fundamental flaw.\n  Reaching this day has taken 2 years of hard work. Over 100 national \norganizations endorse our legislation and many helped us craft a \nconsensus-based bill.\n  Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan of the Finance Committee joined \nSenator Kennedy and I as original cosponsors along with 35 of our \ncolleagues. The cooperation and support we received, helped us move \nthis important legislation from introduction on January 28, to a full \nFinance Committee hearing on February 4th, a Finance Committee markup \non March 4,\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nand filing of the committee report on March 26.\n  It is time for the Senate to complete its work on S. 331. Many of our \nconstituents are watching and waiting for us to make this bill a law.\n  In my state, Vermont, 24,355 Social Security disability beneficiaries \nare waiting for S. 331 to become law. There are 9.5 million people \nwaiting across the country. Under current law, if these people work and \nearn over $500 per month, they lose cash payments and health care \ncoverage under Medicaid or Medicare.\n  This is health care coverage that they simply cannot get in the \nprivate sector. S. 331 allows them to work and have access to health \ncare coverage. It also provides them choices regarding job training and \nplacement assistance.\n  Do Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities really want to \nwork? The answer is a resounding ``Yes.'' Over the last 10 years, \nnational surveys consistently confirm that people with disabilities of \nworking age want to work, but only about one-third are working.\n  I have heard many compelling stories from individuals with \ndisabilities. Some sit at home waiting for S. 331 to become law, so \nthey can go to work. Others work part-time, careful not to exceed the \n$500 per month threshold which may trigger a cut-off of their health \ncare. Each of us has received letters in support of S. 331. Let me \nshare one story with you. Don is a 30 year-old man, who has mild mental \nretardation, cerebral palsy, a seizure disorder, and a visual \nimpairment. Don works, but only part-time.\n  At the end of his letter, Don wrote:\n\n       The Work Incentives Improvement Act will help my friends \n     become independent too. Then they can pay taxes too. But most \n     of all they will have a life in the community. We are adults. \n     We want to work. We don't need a hand out . . . we need a \n     hand up.\n\n  We should give Don and his friends a hand up. Doing so would be good \nfor Don and good for the Nation. The hard facts make a compelling case \nfor S. 331:\n  As I indicated, there are 9.5 million Social Security beneficiaries. \nOf those who work, very few make more than $500 per month. In fact, of \nworking individuals with disabilities on supplemental security income, \nonly 17 percent make over $500 per month and only 10 percent make over \n$1,000 per month. Another 29 percent make $65 or less per month. Let's \nassume that S. 331 becomes law, and just 200 Social Security disability \nbeneficiaries in each State work and forgo cash payments. That would be \n10,000 individuals across the country out of 9.5 million disability \nbeneficiaries. The annual savings to the Federal treasury in cash \npayments for these 10,000 people would be $133,550,000. Clearly, the \nWork Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is targeted, fiscally \nresponsible legislation.\n  It enables individuals with disabilities to enter the workforce for \nthe first time, re-enter the work force, or avoid leaving it in the \nfirst place.\n  These individuals would not need to worry about losing their health \ncare if they choose to work a 40-hour week, to put in overtime, or to \ngo for a career advancement. Individuals who need job training or job \nplacement assistance would get it. S. 331 reflects what individuals \nwith disabilities say they need. It was shaped by input across the \nphilosophical spectrum. It was endorsed by the President in his State \nof the Union Address. S. 331 will give us the opportunity to bring \nresponsible change to Federal policy and to eliminate a perverse \ndilemma for many Americans with disabilities--if you don't work, you \nget health care; if you do work, you don't get health care. S. 331 is a \nvital link in making the American dream an accessible dream, for \nAmericans with disabilities. In closing, I would like to tell you about \na young constituent of mine. Her name is Maria, and she faces many \ndaily challenges as a result of her disability. She recently contacted \nmy office to let me know that she is counting on S. 331. Maria is a \njunior majoring in Spanish at a college in Vermont. She plans to \ngraduate to become a billingual teacher for children and adults from \nCentral and South America.\n  Maria has her whole life ahead of her. She has dreams and she has \ncontributions to make. Enactment of S. 331 will make Maria's dreams \npossible. She will be able to pursue a career without fear of losing \nthe health care she needs. Let's enact S. 331 now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5002-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5002-S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION \n                              ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, under a previous unanimous consent order, I \nam to be recognized to speak on an amendment which I plan to offer to \nthe pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I had appeared on two previous occasions \ntoday believing that would be the time at which amendments would be \naccepted only to find that that had changed. Because I, like the Chair, \nhave responsibilities with the defense authorization committee and \nsubcommittee markups, I may be absent when that time eventually arises.\n  I rise now to discuss, rather than offer, an amendment, which I will \noffer as soon as we are permitted to do so, that I hope will add an \nessential component to the larger debate we have begun about school \nviolence and juvenile justice.\n  Given the last year of school tragedies in Arkansas, Kentucky, \nMississippi, Oregon, and now Colorado, discussions about seemingly \nrandom acts of school violence have moved from the school board meeting \nrooms to the kitchen tables of America. Our dialog has encompassed \neverything from Internet use and video games to gun control. If \nanything positive has resulted from these tragedies, it is that we, as \na nation, have finally started to focus on school violence by \nacknowledging that this is a multifaceted problem demanding \nmultifaceted solutions.\n  Unfortunately, the issue of violence in our schools is not new. Six \nyears ago, I stood in this Chamber to talk about school violence and \noffered an amendment to create a 2-year commission to study school \nviolence. I acted in response to shootings that involved students and \ntook place in the Norfolk area of Virginia.\n\n  When I spoke in 1993 about school violence, I mentioned that we had \nexperienced a cultural change. In fact, I brought this very chart to \nthe floor to illustrate that point.\n  In 1940, public schoolteachers were asked to cite the top \ndisciplinary problems they dealt with on a routine basis. The list \nincluded: Talking out of turn, chewing gum, students making noise, \nrunning in the halls, cutting in line, dress code violations, and \nlittering. The same list of routine disciplinary problems in 1990 \nlooked like this: Drug abuse, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, suicide, rape, \nrobbery, and assault.\n  That was 1990. If the same survey were done today, I suspect assault \nwould rank even higher on the list. In the 1996-1997 school year, 43 \npercent of our Nation's schools had no incidents of crime at all. For \nthose that did, the vast majority of crime involved theft and \nvandalism. But despite these facts, in the last year alone, 40 people \nhave died as a direct result of school shootings. The most serious of \nthem, of course, occurred 3 weeks ago today at Columbine High School in \nLittleton, CO.\n  The most common questions asked following incidents of school \nviolence are: Why? and, What could have been done to spot the warning \nsigns and intervene before it was tragically too late?\n  In an effort to better educate school districts across the country \nabout how to develop violence prevention and intervention strategies, \nthe Secretary of Education and the Attorney General last August issued \na comprehensive guide entitled ``Early Warning, Timely Response.'' The \nguide was developed with the help of experts from law enforcement, \neducation, juvenile justice, mental health, and other social services \nand was based upon extensive research about violence prevention plans. \nThe emphasis of this guide is communitywide involvement.\n  Our children come into contact every day not only with us as parents, \nbut also with teachers, administrators, pastors, bus drivers, coaches, \ncounselors, and so many others. We all have a responsibility to help \nparent and guide our Nation's children.\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\n  Furthermore, we all know that recognizing the warning signs of \nstress, depression, substance abuse, and violent behavior starts at \nhome and extends well into our communities. We, as public officials, \nhave a responsibility to work with States and communities to ensure \nthat we are doing all we can to keep our schools safe.\n  That is the thrust of the amendment I plan to offer. It is about the \nFederal Government becoming a better, more responsible partner with \nStates and localities to combat school violence in America. I use the \nword ``partner'' because there is not a single requirement that States \nor localities participate at all.\n  Instead, this proposal is about providing the sources and expert \nadvice to States and communities and schools who worry today about \nschool violence and want to renew their efforts to fight it. For those \nof us on both sides of the aisle who care deeply about education, this \namendment is a recognition that good schools are safe schools.\n  In this spirit, the amendment I will offer, hopefully later today, \nestablishes a national resource center for school safety and youth \nviolence prevention and authorizes additional funding to communities to \ndevelop violence prevention and intervention plans and to expand mental \nhealth services and treatment programs.\n\n  First, the national center that we envision will serve as an \n``education FEMA,'' if you will. In the event of an incident of school \nviolence, the center's experts would be dispatched directly to the \nschool involved to provide emergency response services. The center's \nteam of experts would provide crisis counseling, additional school \nsecurity personnel, and long-term counseling for students and families \nwho chose to take advantage of these services.\n  Second, the center will establish a toll-free, anonymous student \nhotline so that students may report, without fear of retaliation, \ncriminal activity or threats of criminal activity and other high-risk \nstudent behavior they witness or of which they become aware. For \nexample, a student could call such a hotline to report another \nstudent's substance abuse or gang affiliation. The center would work \nwith the Attorney General to develop guidelines about how to coordinate \nwith law enforcement agencies to both relay the information and protect \nstudent privacy.\n  The importance of this hotline became apparent to me during my own \nresearch on this bill, as well as during the visit I made with \nPresident Clinton to T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA, just \n2 days after the shooting in Littleton. It is clear to me that there \nhas been a void in our legislative approach to promoting school safety.\n  While we have substantially increased the funding of school safety \nplans under the COPS program over the last 2 years, we need to do a \nbetter job of encouraging and teaching our children that students \nthemselves also have a responsibility to report high-risk or \nthreatening behavior of which they are aware in themselves or other \nstudents. But to effectively encourage this, we have to provide \nstudents with safe channels through which to report this information. A \nstudent who is aware of a plan to build bombs or knows that another \nstudent is suicidal should have a confidential way to report that \nknowledge.\n  In the long run, an investment in prevention is an investment not \njust in the child who may be on the brink of pulling the trigger or \nthrowing the bomb, but an investment in the safety of all our children \nwho can all too quickly become tragic victims.\n  Third, the center will provide training and technical assistance to \nteachers, administrators, parents, law enforcement personnel, and \nothers in communities about ways to develop effective school safety \nstrategies. Components include helping schools effectively utilize tip \nhotlines, assisting with threat assessment, helping create partnerships \namong police, schools, parents, and social service agencies, developing \nmedia and police protocols to handle emergencies and, very important, \nworking with the Departments of Justice, Education, and HHS to help \ntrain teachers to learn to identify students at risk of bringing \nviolent behavior into their schools.\n  Fourth, the center will serve as a clearinghouse of information about \nmodel school safety plans across the country, with the center's staff \navailable to offer a wide array of plans to a community seeking \nassistance, from increased use of surveillance equipment to a community \ncase management process to deal with troubled youths. This includes the \noperation of a nonemergency, toll-free number for the public to obtain \ninformation about school safety.\n  Finally, the center would conduct research about school violence \nprevention and the extent to which smaller learning communities help \nreduce incidents of violence in our schools. We can do all this for \nless than $100 million. That is the center's authorization in the \nlegislation that we plan to offer.\n  From emergency response teams, to the student hotline, to the teacher \ntraining to identify violent behavior in school, this small investment \nin an education FEMA is well worth the expense.\n  In truth, however, nothing can ever compensate a family for the loss \nof a child. But we ought to be able to say to all communities \nthroughout this country that we are doing everything we can to prevent \nthese tragedies from happening in the first place.\n  The second part of this amendment provides direct support to \ncommunities as they look for resources to develop or enhance their own \nschool safety and youth violence prevention services. I believe \ncommunities will benefit tremendously from this amendment, because it \nauthorizes more funding for comprehensive community-wide school safety \nplans under the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Program, an existing \nprogram that was enacted in response to the tragic incident in \nJonesboro, AR.\n  I will not go into detail about this part of the amendment because I \nknow Senator Kennedy has been working on these issues for some time now \nand has particular expertise about the combined work that the \nDepartment of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services \nhave done with communities that have come together to improve or \nestablish mental health services for violence-related stress and other \ntypes of community efforts. I certainly applaud the Senator for all he \nhas done in this regard. He has been an outstanding advocate for \nchildren and families over the years.\n  Let me conclude by saying as a public official and as a former \nmarine, I have long believed that the first responsibility of the \nFederal Government is to keep our citizenry safe--safe from enemies \nboth foreign and domestic. Americans have a right to be safe in their \nhomes, on their streets, and in their workplaces. And our children have \na right to be safe in their schools.\n  Fear of violence should not threaten our children's learning \nenvironment. The bottom line is this: We cannot have good schools \nunless we have safe schools. As I said at the outset, there are many \ncomponents of this debate about school violence and juvenile justice. \nWe need to talk about parenting and values and teaching our children \nabout respecting their lives and the lives of those around them.\n  We need to talk about how we hold accountable those who endanger or \nharm our children. We need to talk about guns and the extent to which \nthere are loopholes in existing laws that can be changed to better \nprotect our children. But there is absolutely no question that we need \nto talk about prevention, and this amendment builds upon the work \nCongress has already done in the area of prevention.\n  This amendment will be just one component of a debate that I hope we \nwill all support to help our kids and their families, America's \nteachers and counselors, our law enforcement officials, and entire \ncommunities across our Nation who have one goal in common--to stop \nschool violence before it starts.\n  Here in Washington we can do our constructive share. We can provide \nexpertise. We can provide resources directly to communities. We can \nempower communities to better protect America's children. We can, and \nwe should.\n  As I said on the floor last week, simply going to school should not \nin and of itself be an act of courage.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is my understanding the distinguished Senator from New \nYork just wants to speak on the bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Correct. I have no intention of offering anything today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senators from \nUtah and Vermont for yielding me time on the floor as we begin to \ndiscuss juvenile violence.\n  First, let me say I appreciate the majority leader making this time \navailable, and at this crucial time, because some say, well, maybe we \nshould wait for the dust to settle in the aftermath of the tragedy in \nLittleton, CO. But I have found in years that sometimes when a terrible \ntragedy occurs people are focused on issues that might prevent future \nterrible tragedies; but if we wait several months, nothing much \nhappens. So I am grateful for the opportunity. I think it is correct \nlegislatively.\n  This is not a new issue. We have, unfortunately, seen other \ntragedies--in Springfield, OR, and Arkansas and throughout the country. \nMost of us have given lots of thought to the issue of how do we deal \nwith violence among juveniles? How do we deal with violence in the \nschools? I agree with all of those who have said there is no one road \nto Rome, that there are many, many different approaches. In fact, to \nme, an argument where one says, well, do A, which means don't do B, C, \nand D, is wrong. We have to examine all the causes of violence. We have \nto look at them. To advocate one particular course doesn't gainsay that \nanother course might help as well.\n\n  It is obviously a very complicated issue. The question I guess all of \nAmerica is asking itself is a simple one: Why now? Why all of a sudden \nhave we seen such a rash of violence in our schools?\n  I have given this a great deal of thought, first in my 18 years in \nthe House where, as a member of Judiciary, I focused on crime issues, \nand now in the last several months as a new Member of this body. In \naddition to thinking and reading about this, I also went out and talked \nto many young people. In fact, I have had conversations, been in \nclassrooms, either directly or by video, with schools across my State--\nEast High School in Rochester; Nottingham in Syracuse; Colony High \nSchool in Albany; Rockville Center in West Chester; New Rochelle High \nSchool; and two schools in New York City, Tottenville and Hunter High \nSchool. In each I sat down with a group of 30 to 50 young men and women \nand asked them their views, because I think it doesn't make much sense \nto talk about juvenile violence without talking to the juveniles.\n  Basically, what I found was quite interesting. I found that they, \ntoo, agreed that there were a number of causes, and many were perplexed \nas to why this happened. But I found some interesting thoughts. In \nevery school, the students talked about two things more than any other \nthat they thought led to this violence. In each school I went to--and \nthese schools were quite varied; one was in an upper-income \nneighborhood, one in a poor neighborhood, and the rest were in rather \nmiddle-class neighborhoods--there were two common themes:\n  First, students did stress isolation, that young people do feel \nisolated and alone. They realized that the adolescent condition \nsometimes was such that when someone was isolated and alone, instead of \nreaching out, the inclination was to pick on them. A number of schools \nhad suggestions as to how to deal with this problem. One school had an \nombudsman, a young teacher whom the students loved. If someone was in \ntrouble or feeling isolated or lonely, they could go to that ombudsman, \nand many did. Just as importantly, if it seemed to other students in \nthe school that a young person or a group of young people was headed \ntowards trouble, they could go to the ombudsman and the ombudsman would \ndo what was necessary to try to bring that group of young people into \nthe fold.\n  In another school up in Albany they had a human relations club. The \nheads of all the various student activities and the heads of different \ncliques or groups would get together once a month and discuss things \nand discuss their differences. It proved a good way of bridging gaps in \nthat high school. Finally, another school, one on Long Island, had a \nclub. It was sort of an elite club; it was hard to get into. I think it \nwas called Smiles. One of the ideas of Smiles was to reach out to \nothers and be inclusive. It was sort of taking the credo of \ninclusiveness and bringing people together and making it a thing that \neveryone aspired to do. I thought those ideas were pretty good and \npretty interesting. Maybe we should look at some of them this week.\n  One idea that every classroom I went to seemed to laugh at was the \nidea that seems to have gained some currency here in Washington, and \nthat is the culture of violence. I, for instance, myself, having seen \nthe video games and seen some of the movies that came out, when I \nstarted this process, thought this should be a reason young people \nwould be more violent.\n\n  The kids seemed not to feel that way. They laughed at the idea that a \nvideo game, a movie, a television show would push somebody to do \nsomething awful like at Littleton. I said to them, well, it may not \npush you, but it might push people who were isolated and alone. They \nsaid, no, it would take a lot more than that.\n  One youngster raised his hand and said to me: When did you grow up? I \nsaid in the 1950s. He said: You saw a lot of westerns. I said that, \nyes, I did. He said: Did that move you to be more violent? I said not \nat all.\n  We may disagree with it, but I thought it was interesting that from \none end of my State to the other, young people of all economic \nbackgrounds and races and creeds and ethnicities rejected that idea. \nAnd again, of course, I come from New York\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\nState, but these schools were spread throughout the State, many in \nquite conservative areas.\n  I found the one thing that was virtually universal is kids thought \nthat guns were too available for them. I asked each high school class, \nif you really wanted to get a gun, would you know where to go or who to \nask? And 60 to 100 percent said yes.\n  My point here today is this: Certainly we should consider other \ncauses of violence among young people. We should look at isolation. \nCertainly we should look at parental responsibility. I am the father of \na 4-year-old. It seems a lot of times she doesn't want to have her \nparents around her. But most of them wanted parental guidelines, wanted \nparental responsibility, wanted parental authority. There was no \ndisagreement about that.\n  If you looked at the one consistent thing that almost everyone agreed \nwith, it was that guns, the availability of guns, was too great; the \navailability of knowledge of how to make bombs and how to buy guns \nencouraged and created more violence. And it made me think of a useful \nparallel, which I just heard Senator Levin mention earlier today about \nhis community in Detroit, MI, and I have mentioned in mine in Buffalo \nand western New York. Both those communities are right across the \nborder from Canada. In both those communities, there is something \nstartling. There is the same culture, same video games, same movies, \nand they get the same TV stations. People in Windsor, ON, watch the \nsame TV as people in Detroit. People across the Niagara River in \nCanada, in Fort Erie, watch the same TV as the people in Buffalo and \nNiagara Falls.\n  Why are we so much more violent? It is not culture or violence. It is \nthe same in each. It is not really the idea that we have two parents \nworking and single moms and single dads, fewer parents around, less \nparental responsibility. That is the same in each. It is not the \nisolation that young adolescents often feel. That is the same in each. \nWhat is the difference between the situation in Canada and the \nsituation in America?\n  The one difference is the gun laws, where Canada's are much tougher \nthan ours.\n  It seems to me that if we go through this package--and we certainly \nshould consider other issues--but we ignore or short circuit, truncate, \na debate on gun violence, we will be making a serious mistake.\n  I heard one of my friends say this is political. Well, it is no more \npolitical to me than talking about Hollywood might be to some others in \nthis. I believe this would make a huge difference.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont. He has put together a package of \ngun amendments that just about everybody in our caucus could support. I \nam glad he did. I think they will make a difference. A group of us have \nbeen meeting, those of us who believe in tougher laws on guns, although \nwe tried to be very mindful of the law-abiding rights of citizens, of \ngun-owning citizens. We have put together a package of 10 amendments. \nEach of them meets two criteria: One, that they would do some good; \ntwo, that they have a chance of passing, that they are not going to get \n25 or 30 votes from people who agree with my position but, rather, that \nthey would be able to garner much greater support.\n  I say to the majority leader and to my chairman, the Senator from \nUtah, we do not want to speak on these amendments forever. We do want \nthe opportunity to debate them and to discuss them and to vote on them, \nbecause we think some of them have a real chance of passage.\n  I say to my colleagues that I am appreciative of this opportunity. I \nknow the issue of guns is not the only answer, but it seems to me, \nbecause there is a culture of violence, because parents are working, \nand because adolescents are young and often feel isolated, that none of \nthose gainsay the need for better laws on guns.\n  As I say, our package is moderate. It is careful. We have not put \neverything on the floor. Many times I would like to, because I would go \nfurther than this body would.\n  But I welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues. I believe we \nwill do it in a careful, respectful and bipartisan way. Our goal is not \nto have a Democratic v. Republican division. Our goal is to pass \nlegislation, and if we can do that in a bipartisan and nonrancorous \nway, I think we will have served America well.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont for \nyielding their time. I look forward to their debate.\n  I simply ask the majority leader to make sure, provided we are \nwilling to live within the time limits, that we have the time to \ndiscuss these 10 amendments--there may be others--and to discuss them, \nperhaps pass them, and finally do something real about the Littletons \nthat have plagued our Nation over the last year.\n  I thank the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator from \nMassachusetts would like to make a statement for debate only. Am I \ncorrect, the senior Senator from Massachusetts would like to make a \nstatement for debate only, and also the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia would like to make a statement for debate purposes only?\n  I ask unanimous consent they be permitted to proceed at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could ask the Chair--I appreciate \nthe opportunity to address the Senate--what is the pending matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending matter is S. 254.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is open for amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill has no amendments pending on it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The bill has no amendments pending at the moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we were hopeful that we could call up the \nHatch-Biden-Sessions amendment and get a vote on that. We would like to \ncooperate with fellow Senators and be able to do that. We hope the \nSenator from Massachusetts will defer any amendments until we finish \nwith that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe that the Robb amendment is \nbefore the Senate, and I intend to speak on behalf of this amendment. I \nwill be glad to follow leadership as to how we should proceed. I do not \nintend to delay the proceedings.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, we are looking at the Robb \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am having difficulty hearing my colleague and friend.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are looking at the Robb amendment and studying it to \ndetermine when and if it is to be brought up. If the Senator wants to \nspeak, it is not before the Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all respect to my friend and \ncolleague, I do not believe that the Senator from Utah can decide if \nSenator Robb's amendment can be brought up. It is my understanding that \nSenator Robb is perfectly entitled to bring it up.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator from Utah understands that. We chatted with \nSenator Robb and said we would look at the amendment to see if it is \nsomething we can accept. If not, he can bring it up any time he wants \nto in the regular course of business. He had to go to another meeting, \nand we will discuss the amendment as soon as he returns.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, I will explain it. The Senator \nfrom Virginia, Mr. Robb, brought up his amendment in the second degree \nto the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. The distinguished Senator from \nUtah is one of the sponsors of Hatch-Biden-Sessions. He withdrew it, \nthus withdrawing the second-degree amendment by Senator Robb. The \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia is thus waiting for time to bring \nhis amendment back up for consideration.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will speak briefly in support of the \nRobb amendment. Later, I intend to participate in the debate on the \nRobb amendment and other provisions underlying the legislation.\n  Over the next few days, we will have the opportunity to consider how \nwe can best respond to the anxieties and concerns of families and \nchildren across\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nthis country. In the wake of the tragedies that have affected a number \nof our schools over the past few years, it is appropriate that the \nSenate consider violence and its impact on children and families.\n\n  As we begin this debate and discussion in the Senate, we should \nunderstand that, in just a few days, we cannot develop a silver bullet \ncapable of responding to all of the complex issues raised by the \ntragedies that have occurred in Colorado, Paducah, and other \ncommunities and other schools across this country.\n  But even having noted that these are complex issues, we have to ask \nourselves: Can we at least evaluate some things that have been done in \nthe fairly recent past that have been helpful to students, that have \nbeen helpful to parents, that have been helpful to schools, and that \nhave been helpful to communities? Quite clearly the answer to this is \nyes.\n  I am not one of those who says that we don't have all the answers \nand, therefore, we don't have any of the answers. No one could say \nthat, coming from the City of Boston where we have seen dramatic \nreduction in youth homicide and youth violence in the country. It has \nbeen within the last probably 4 years. Boston has approximately 128 \nschools. We had only one youth homicide involving a firearm during a \n2.5 year period.\n  As we look at the underlying bill in terms of youth violence, it is \nappropriate that we also look at the current record to see if there are \nsome ideas that might be of some value and some use.\n  I think issues dealing with the media--perhaps the various \nexcessively violent video games and others are going to take some time, \nbut these are issues that we must consider. We have a chance to see \nwhat has been working out there, and to see whether those efforts \nshould be supported, perhaps enhanced, and if they can be shared in \nother parts of the country. That is what we are trying to do with the \nRobb amendment.\n  There are two important parts to this amendment. One is to establish \na resource center that will be a place where either parents or schools \nor school districts or communities are able to go to find out what is \nworking in other communities around the country. It will be an \nevaluation of information. It will have a collection of what is working \nin urban areas and what is working in rural communities, and what the \nresults have been and how communities utilize these efforts.\n\n  There have been a number of efforts. Some might be particularly \nappropriate to Boston. Others might be different and better suited in \nterms of dealing with the problems in Pocatello. There may be some \ndevelopment of efforts that have involved law enforcement, some that \nhave involved the schools, some that have involved the parents, some \nthat have involved the students in terms of mentoring, programs of \nreconciliation. A number of different initiatives that are out there \nmay just have some application in terms of different schools across the \ncountry, and those communities might be interested.\n  In the Robb amendment, we have a proposal for this clearinghouse that \nwill be a resource available to schools, a resource available to \ncommunities, a resource available to parents, a resource that will be \navailable to students who have responsibility in their schools, a \nresource that will be available to the law enforcement officials. It \nwill have other functions such as having available individuals who \nmight be able to respond if there is an immediate danger of violence. \nThis all makes a good deal of sense.\n  A second provision of the Robb amendment deals with the resources \nthat are out there within the community, within the Department of \nJustice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nDepartment of Education. It is called the Safe Schools/Healthy Students \ninitiative. This was developed in a nonpartisan effort to try to bring \ntogether a number of different programs that have a positive impact on \nreducing youth violence which the schools will be able to draw upon. \nThis program includes aspects to develop a safe school environment, \nincluding partnerships with the local law enforcement; it includes \naspects to enhance security measures for those schools where it is \nnecessary; it includes aspects to redesign school facilities to get \ninto smaller school units where teachers know the names of every \nstudent in the school, and every student knows the name of every \nteacher.\n  We have this program being implemented in a number of different \ncommunities. In Boston it is being developed in a number of different \nschools. It has been tried and is being utilized in a number of \ndifferent communities. It is very interesting and exciting, and we have \nseen positive results.\n  Prevention programs and early intervention, in terms of alcohol and \ndrugs--bringing in the mental health, preventive treatment and \nintervention services that exist in the SAMHSA program which deals with \nmental health and assistance and targeting help and assistance for \nchildren--have been particularly effective.\n  We know almost a third of all the children who go to the schools in \nthe inner city of Boston, for example, come from completely \ndysfunctional homes--either with substance abuse or violence, and these \nchildren are facing the most extraordinary set of circumstances. We \nhave to understand being young, being a child, and being at school \ntoday is no picnic. They are faced with enormous challenges. We don't \nhave, generally, health care centers in these schools; a few of them \ndo, but not many. The importance of mental health counselors, \npsychologists and nurses working with the early childhood \npsychological, social and emotional development services have been \nincluded in the second phase of this program. This was basically the \nresult of a very extensive review done by the Department of Justice \nworking with HHS, and the Department of Education, and the resulting \nrecommendations.\n  This evaluation shows that this kind of approach, with law \nenforcement and the preventive aspect, has provided some very important \nhelp and assistance to the schools.\n  I look forward to working with a number of our colleagues--Senator \nBoxer, Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin, Senator Lautenberg, Senator \nFeinstein and others--in terms of responsible ownership regarding \nweapons. I think that is certainly very important. We ought to expect \nresponsibility in terms of manufacturers making safe guns. We ought to \nexpect dealers are not going to sell to adolescents. We have to expect \nresponsibility of parents in storing their guns separate from the \nammunition. We will keep rapid automatic weapons out of the hands of \nchildren, extend the Brady bill, and include the background checks at \nthe gun shows. We will have a chance to debate all of those.\n  We can reduce the occasions when these violent impulses reflect \nthemselves in the use of weapons. One of the most disturbing factors is \nthe continued growth and explosion of youth suicides. Handguns are too \neasily accessible and available. We will have a chance to debate some \nof those issues.\n  It comes back to the recognition that the first responsibility for \nall of these matters rests in the home and with the parents, or with a \nsingle parent, working to provide the guidance to children who need \nguidance.\n  What we see in this chart is very disturbing, a gradual decline of \nthe time mothers are spending with their children. This is the \npercentage of time parents eat dinner with their children from ages 5 \nto 17 every day. We see the gradual decline in terms of the time \nmothers are spending with their children; and also the time fathers are \nspending. The fact is, generally speaking, in the last 15 years there \nis a third less quality time being spent with parents. Some of that is \nthe result of people working harder and working longer in order to \nmaintain their own income, a tragic reality for those at the lower \neconomic line that have to work one, two, or even three jobs--receiving \nminimum wage--in order to keep the family together. It is very \ndifficult to see how those people are able to spend any time at all \nwith their family. Some of that is the result of choice, some of that \nis out of necessity.\n  On this chart is the percentage of parents in the home who have \nprivate talks with their children ages 5-17 almost every day. The \nnumber has been cut in half by fathers, and there is an important \nreduction in terms of the\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nmothers. Again, we are talking about parental responsibilities.\n  This is a blowup of ``A Guide To Safe Schools''. Every school in \nAmerica has a copy of this particular publication. It was sent out by \nSecretary Riley and Secretary Reno. It contains a variety of early \nwarning tips for the parents. It has a whole page of action steps for \nthe students. It has suggestions for parents. It has suggestions for \nteachers. It has suggestions for school boards. It has a series of \nideas: what to look for, what to do, early warning signs--it is \nenormously comprehensive.\n  It is the result of the work of a number of different organizations \nthat came together and spent weeks and months in developing this \npublication. If anyone would take the time to go through it, it has an \nenormous wealth of information from which those involved in schools \nacross the country can benefit. It is a very, very instructive and \npositive document. It is a guide for schools, students, parents, about \nsome of the concerns they might have.\n  We may never fully understand the complex factors that led Eric \nHarris and Dylan Klebold to kill 13 members of the Columbine High \nSchool community, but there is one thing we do know--we must do more to \nprevent future tragedies. The deaths that have occurred at the hands of \nyoung people in Littleton, Colorado, Jonesboro, Arkansas, Pearl, \nMississippi, and other communities, are national tragedies. They are \nalso a call to action--a call that America must answer.\n  We have a responsibility to listen to our constituents, to answer the \ncalls for help by our children, and do more to protect the health and \nwelfare of the nation's youth. Children may make up one-eighth of the \npopulation, but they are 100 percent of our nation's future.\n  We know that there is no single, simple solution to this complex \nproblem. The mindless, heartless cruelty in Littleton is symptomatic of \nthe problems that exist in communities throughout America, and we need \nto find more effective ways to deal with them.\n  This latest tragedy is another wakeup call to the nation. We have an \nopportunity to work together to prevent youth violence, and reduce the \nlikelihood of future tragedies like Littleton. We can do more to make \nschools safer.\n  We know that school violence is a continuing festering problem. In \n1996, 5 percent of all 12th graders reported being injured with a \nweapon during the previous 12 months while they were at school. Another \n12 percent reported that they had been injured at school in an incident \nthat did not involve a weapon. An increasing number of students report \nfeeling unsafe at school, and avoid one or more places at school for \nfear of their own safety. Clearly, children cannot learn in this kind \nof environment.\n  We need to ask difficult questions about our society, the media, \nparenting, peer pressure, and other social forces. We have a shared \nresponsibility as parents, teachers, role models, and concerned, caring \nadults, Fifty million school children are now in their formative years. \nWe need to think about what kind of society we want these children to \ngrow up in.\n  In too many cases, television is raising far too many of the nation's \nchildren. On a daily basis, close to 20 percent of 9-year-olds watch 6 \nor more hours of television. Much of what they see is a steady stream \nof violence and aggression that is presented as legitimate and \njustified entertainment. By the time children leave elementary school, \nthey will have seen 8,000 murders and more than 100,000 other acts of \ntelevised violence. Violent video games which glorify killing are \nincreasingly popular.\n  The negative influences of violent programming and violent video \ngames are growing stronger, because positive influences--families, \nschools, churches, synagogues, and communities--are becoming weaker. \nParents are the most important influence in their children's lives, but \nthey are being stretched to the limit. We know the importance of strong \nparental guidance and support for healthy development. Spending time \ntogether is a basic ingredient for building strong parent-child \nrelationships. Yet time together is increasingly scarce.\n  Research indicates that parents are eating fewer meals and having \nfewer conversations with their children. Between 1988 and 1995, a \nsignificant drop took place in parent-child activities. Sixty-two \npercent of mothers reported eating dinner with their child on a daily \nbasis in 1988, but only 55 percent reported doing so in 1995. Fifty \npercent of fathers ate a daily dinner with their child in 1988, but \nthis rate dropped to 42 percent in 1995.\n  Parents and families want to spend more time together, but there \nsimply aren't enough hours in the day. We must pursue initiatives to \ngive parents the opportunity to spend more time with their children, \nand ensure that all parents have the skills they need to be strong \nmentors, role models, and caregivers for their children. We should \nsupport family-friendly work policies and flexible work hours, so that \nparents can eat dinner with their children, and talk to their children.\n  Yesterday, I spent time in Boston talking to students about youth \nviolence and the tragedy in Colorado to try and get some insight into \nwhat is going on with our youth. I asked them for a show of hands of \nhow many of them feel that their parents are too busy to talk to them--\nover \\3/4\\ths of the students raised their hands.\n  This is lack of communication is unacceptable and the American people \nagree. A recent Newsweek poll asked ``How important is it for the \ncountry to pay more attention to teenagers and their problems.'' 89 \npercent of those polled replied that it is very important. If we as \nparents are not raising our children, then we must worry about who is.\n\n  In the coming days, we will have a unique opportunity to begin to \nreverse the culture of youth violence. There are no quick fixes to this \nproblem--no easy solutions. We need a long-term strategy, and we must \nwork together to find appropriate remedies. To meet this challenge, we \nmust consider provisions that (1) promote healthy children and youth in \nsafe communities; (2) help parents with parenting skills from birth \nthrough adolescence; (3) equip teachers and school officials with tools \nto intervene before violence occurs; (4) give law enforcement the tools \nneeded to keep guns away from children; and (5) promote responsible \nmedia programming for children and youth.\n  There are also immediate steps that we can take. Congress has a \nresponsibility to act, to stop allowing the NRA to dictate what is \nright and what is wrong on guns. Surely, without threatening the \nactivities of honest sports men and women, we can agree on ways to make \nit virtually impossible for angry children to get their hands on guns. \nWe can give schools the resources and expertise they need to protect \nthemselves, without turning classrooms into fortresses. We can make gun \ndealers responsible for selling guns to adolescents, and make gun \nowners responsible for locking up firearms in their homes. We can \ninsist that gun manufacturers be smart enough to develop ``smart'' guns \nwith effective child safety locks. We can do more to dry up the \ninterstate black market in guns. We can crack down harder on assault \nweapons.\n  Surely, we can take sensible steps like these to reduce the tragedy \nof gun violence. America does more today to regulate the safety of toy \nguns than real guns--and it is a national disgrace. When we see and \nhear what gun violence has done to the victims in Pearl, MS--West \nPaducah, KY--Jonesboro, AR--Edinboro, PA--Fayetteville, TN--\nSpringfield, OR--and now Littleton, CO, we know that action is urgently \nneeded.\n  Practical steps can clearly be taken to protect children more \neffectively from guns, and to achieve greater responsibility by gun \nowners, gun dealers and gun manufacturers. The greatest tragedy of the \nColumbine High School killings is that these earlier tragedies did not \nshock us enough into doing everything we can to prevent them. By \nrefusing to learn from such tragedies, we have condemned ourselves to \nrepeat them. How many wake-up calls will Congress and the nation \ncontinue to ignore?\n  We can act now to provide communities and schools with more \ninformation and resources to prevent these tragedies. We can provide \nthe training needed to recognize the daily warning signs, long before \nactual violence occurs. Last year the Departments of Education and \nJustice jointly created a\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\n``Guide to Safe Schools--Early Warning: Timely Response.'' This guide \nhas extensive helpful information to assist parents, children, schools, \nand communities in keeping children and young people safer. The guide \ntells what to look for, and what to do. It lists Characteristics of \nSchools that are Safe and Responsive for all children. It has Tips to \nSchools, Tips to Parents, and Tips to Children.\n  This guide is part of an overall effort to make sure that every \nschool in the nation has a violence prevention plan in place. This \nguide is available to every school, every parent, and every community \nleader. You can download it from the Internet if you go to \nwww.usdoj.gov, and click on to ``early warning, timely response''\n  We also need to invest in services that ensure Safe Schools and \nHealthy Students. That means quality after-school programs, accessible \nmental health services for youth, and grassroots models that \nsuccessfully target youth violence. Results occur when there is a \ncooperative effort.\n  Boston has a remarkable program that has enabled the city to go from \nJuly 1995 to December 1997 with only one juvenile death that involved a \nfirearm. This program works because it involves the entire community--\npolice and probation officers, community leaders, mental health \nproviders, and even gang members themselves. The strategy is based on \nthree components: (1) tough law enforcement; (2) heavy emphasis on \ncrime prevention (including drug treatment); and (3) effective gun \ncontrol.\n  The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative can make such \ninitiatives a reality in many more communities. This cooperative effort \nby the Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services \ndraws on the best practices of the education, law enforcement, social \nservice, and mental health communities to achieve a realistic framework \nfor communities to prevent youth violence.\n  We must answer the call that children across the nation are so \ndesperately making. We have the knowledge, the skill, and the resources \nto make a difference.\n  The nation's children need us. And they need us now. We cannot afford \nto let them down. If we are to remain the strongest and fairest nation \non earth, we must deal with these festering problems. We cannot afford \nto abandon children to despair and depression. We can no longer allow \nchildren to have virtually unrestricted access to guns. We must reduce \nthe tide of violent images washing over children on a daily basis. We \nmust lead this nation into the next century by providing a safe, \nsecure, and gun free environment for children to grow and learn and \nthrive.\n  Our mission is clear. Let us work together to save our children, and \nby so doing, we will save our nation too.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Heather Bullock, Connie \nGarner, Kathleen Curran, David Goldberg, David Pollack, and Angela \nWilliams, fellows in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring the course of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before the Senator from California speaks, \nI ask unanimous consent that immediately following her speech I be \ngiven recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Vermont for their kindness in allowing me to take the \nfloor at this time. I hope to be succinct in my comments. I feel so \nstrongly about this bill and the opportunity we have to do something \ngood for the American people.\n  I wanted to have the chance to make some general comments on what I \nhope a good bill will do. I think a good juvenile justice bill would \nhave a good piece for prevention, a good piece for tougher penalties, \nand a good piece for strong enforcement. If we come out with that \nbalance we will have done a good job.\n  I really think this is a chance to make life better for our children \nand our families. I am glad it looks like we will have an open debate \nin order to put forward our ideas.\n  I think we have an emergency on our hands when the majority of \nparents are worried about the safety of their children at school. I \nthink those of us here, thinking back to the years that we went to \nelementary school and either junior high or high school, do not have \nany memory of being fearful. Yet that is the circumstance today, where \nthe majority of parents are now saying they are fearful for their \nchildren.\n  I think we have an emergency on our hands when many children tell us \nthey see the kind of hostility and isolation that evidenced itself in \nColumbine--they see that in their schools.\n  We have an emergency on our hands when 31 percent of teenagers know \nsomeone their age who carries a weapon--who carries a weapon, not who \njust owns a weapon, but who carries a weapon. An article appeared last \nweekend in the San Diego Union Tribune which reported that 138 out of \n150 of the brightest students in this country said they had seen guns \nat their high school.\n\n  We have an emergency on our hands when teachers say they do not feel \nsafe. We have an emergency when a million kids are looking for \nafterschool programs and they cannot get in because there is no room.\n  Let's take a look at when juvenile crime occurs. This is a juvenile \njustice bill. Let's look at when juvenile crime occurs. This chart \nshows it very clearly. Juvenile crime spikes up at 3 p.m., and it \nstarts going down after 6 p.m. So you do not need a degree in \ncriminology or child psychology or sociology or any ``ology'' to know \nthat juvenile crime occurs after school lets out. One million of our \nchildren are waiting in line for afterschool programs. I will be \noffering an amendment similar to the one I offered during the budget \ndebate to allow those 1 million children to get into afterschool \nprograms.\n  Again, I want to bring us back. This is a juvenile justice bill. It \nis no secret juvenile crime occurs after school. I think the first \nthing we ought to be looking at, what ought to be included in this \nbill, is a piece on afterschool. I want to give some credit to Senators \nBiden, Leahy, and Hatch, because in their amendment they will be \noffering soon they do a little bit for afterschool. In essence, they \ntake the block grant and they set aside 25 percent of it; that is about \n$115 million. One of the uses local districts can avail themselves of, \none of the uses, is afterschool programs. But it is not specifically an \nafterschool program. So we will be offering that and giving our \ncolleagues a chance to really act on the information we have had for so \nmany years.\n  I know the Senator from Utah understands this very clearly. After \nschool the kids get in trouble. We need to help them. I would like to \ndo even a little more than he has done in his amendment.\n  We have an emergency when schools cannot afford metal detectors. Some \nof them have them and they are broken. Or they cannot afford community \npolice on their campuses. We have an amendment, of which I am very \nproud, on this side of the aisle, which will allow us to put more \ncommunity police in the schools. I think it is about 25,000 additional \npolice would be added to community policing and we would waive the \nmatch, the local required match, if people put these community police \non school campuses. We know we do not have enough school counselors. We \nknow we do not.\n  By the way, there was a little press conference today with some \nschoolchildren and one of them had done this cartoon. This is a cartoon \nof a youngster from an elementary school. It shows a little boy and he \nhas a gun in his hand--very crudely drawn by this young girl--and he is \nthinking out loud. The little cartoon says, ``I'm going after So-and-So \nbecause she tortured me all year, verbally.'' And the little girl is \nthinking, ``Don't do that. Go to your counselor and talk it out. Go to \nan adult.''\n  That is good advice from this youngster. But, unfortunately, in many \nof our schools we are seeing one counselor for 500 kids, for 1,000 \nkids, for 1,500 kids. So we ought to do something to change this and \nchange the culture of violence by giving our kids grownups who care \nabout them during the school hours to whom they can take their \nproblems.\n  I agree with the President, there is not one particular thing we can \npoint out and say this is the problem. There are a number of problems \nin our society. We have to deal with all of them,\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\nand every one of us is responsible. Anytime someone stands up, wherever \nthat person is from, whatever industry, and says, oh, it's not my \nproblem, it's somebody else's problem, I simply lose respect for that \nperson who is saying that. I don't care whether he is from the gun \nlobby or makes videos; if that person says, I have nothing to do with \nthe problem, I don't give him any credibility, because every one of us \nhas responsibility, including every one of us in this Chamber, in our \nprivate lives, as parents, as grandparents, and in our public lives as \nSenators.\n\n  Too many children are not getting enough support, love, and guidance \nfrom their parents, or from their community. Too many are using drugs \nand alcohol, too many are seeing violent images on computer and TV and \nin the culture. A lot of those images affect certain children more than \nothers. We know that. But it has an impact just as everything has an \nimpact, a cumulative impact on our children.\n  Let me be very clear. If those two boys at Columbine High School had \nknives instead of guns, we would not have seen such devastating \nresults. In Jonesboro, AR, if those two boys had used baseball bats \ninstead of guns, that number of people certainly would not have died.\n  I do not want us to tiptoe around the gun issue. I know it is hard. I \nknow it steps on powerful toes, but we cannot tiptoe around the gun \nissue. It is not the only cause of the problem; it is one of the causes \nof the problem. Angry kids and guns add up to death. As a matter of \nfact, angry people with guns add up to death.\n  I want to show you this chart which gives this issue a sense of \nreality. Many of us came into politics after the Vietnam war, and we \nsaw this country fall to its knees over that war. It was such a \ndifficult time. We lost 58,168 Americans in the Vietnam war, every one \nof them a grievous loss, a tragic loss, a loss that can never be \nreplaced for so many families; their potential gone on the battlefield.\n  In an 11-year period, 396,572 Americans have been shot down by guns, \nevery one of those a horrible, deep, tragic loss to a family, to a \nmother, to a father, to a grandmother, to children. As a matter of \nfact, every single day in America there is a Columbine High School. \nThirteen children are killed every day, an ordinary day. Yet, we tiptoe \naround the gun issue.\n\n  We have to deal with it, I say to my colleagues, in a fair way, not \nsaying this is the only problem, but it is one of the problems.\n  People say, oh, in Columbine, there were laws; they just didn't work.\n  Not true. The young woman who transferred two guns to juveniles can \nstand behind the law. That was legal. I say it should not be legal to \ngive juveniles guns. That is one example of a gun law we ought to pass.\n  Let's look at our laws concerning 18-year-olds in this country. If \nyou are under 18 in this country, you cannot buy cigarettes, you cannot \nbuy beer or wine. If you are under 18, you cannot buy whiskey and you \ncannot buy a handgun. But if you are under 18, you can buy any one of \nthese long guns--a shotgun, a rifle, an assault weapon. You can.\n  That should not be the case. Oh, if a grandma or a grandpa or a mom \nor dad wants to give you a hunting rifle, that is OK. But they should \nhave to buy it and supervise you. They should not be able to say: \nHere's some money, go to the gun show and pick up a long gun, if you \nare 15 or you are 14 or you are 13 or even 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7. I \ncannot believe people say we do not need any more gun laws when a \njuvenile can walk in and buy a deadly weapon when they cannot buy \ncigarettes, beer, whiskey or a handgun, but they can buy these long \nguns.\n  You say to me, oh, Senator Boxer, there's no interest in youth owning \nguns and the gun manufacturers don't peddle to the youth.\n  Let me show you an ad. We took this off the Internet. This is a \nBeretta, a painted gun which is part of their youth collection. I want \nto tell you what they say in the catalog about their painted gun in \ntheir youth collection. Think about what I am saying and what it \ninvokes in your mind. This is what they say in their catalog:\n\n       An exciting, bold designer look that's sure to make you \n     stand out in a crowd.\n\n  ``An exciting, bold designer look that's sure to make you stand out \nin a crowd.'' What crowd are they talking about? It is surely not you \nand your grandma and your grandpa going out on a family hunting trip. \nThat is not what it means. You decide what it means.\n  Anyone who tells you that the gun manufacturers are not looking at \nthe youth, just take a look at this Internet page, the Beretta youth \ncollection, and read what they say about standing out in a crowd. They \nare playing to the psychology of a young person: How can they be seen \nas different, special, more important.\n  There are some things we can do to address this. I want to reiterate \na point. In our bill, we say, yes, if a parent--I say this to the \nSenator from Vermont--if a parent or a grandparent wants to give their \nchild a rifle for hunting, in our amendment we say fine. But we do not \nwant that 15-year-old or 14-year-old walking in and buying these guns \nor, for that matter, buying a used gun which would be more affordable \non the street.\n  We have an opportunity to do something that is relevant to the lives \nof our people. Our people are looking to us. Yes, I think the Robb-\nKennedy amendment is good. I am glad Senator Hatch is looking at it. \nThere are good, important things in there: a national center for school \nsafety and youth violence that will help our children, because it will \nprovide a rapid response to violent shootings. It will establish \nanonymous tiplines for kids to call in if there is some trouble spotted \nby a youth but he or she is afraid to come forward and go public with \nthe information. All schools will have safety plans. Senator Kennedy \ntalked about his contribution to that amendment which deals with \nconflict resolution and violence prevention, very important issues that \nwe need to take care of.\n  I hope Senator Murray will offer her amendment to put more teachers \nin the schools. If we have these huge class sizes, these kids get lost \nin the shuffle. If we have smaller class sizes, we can pick out those \nkids who cause trouble.\n  There are just two more points I wish to make, and then I will yield \nthe floor to my friends.\n  Senator Durbin is leading an effort in the Appropriations Committee \nto add some emergency funding for our children: more cops in schools, \nmore metal detectors, more afterschool programs, et cetera. I hope he \nwill be successful. We have billions going for the military. We have \nbillions for other purposes. What is more important than the safety of \nour children, or certainly as important as these other important \nneeds. I hope we will do some of that. But if we do not, this bill \nbecomes even more important, because it is our only hope for the \nfuture.\n\n  So what we will be seeing is a series of amendments, I assume from \nboth sides of the aisle--I will be working on some of those-- on the \ngun issue. I have talked about 18-year-olds. Also, I will be working \nwith Senator Kohl on locks, child safety locks that would have to be \nsold with handguns. We need to reestablish the 3-day Brady waiting \nperiod. We need to increase the age at which you can buy an assault \nweapon to 21.\n  I close on this point. The majority in the Senate has shown a lot of \ncompassion for business. They brought up the Y2K bill. Who will that \nhelp? Big business. They showed a lot of compassion for business when \nthey brought the Financial Modernization Act to the floor. Who does \nthat help? Big business--the big banks, the big securities companies, \nthe insurance companies. They want to bring the bankruptcy bill to the \nfloor. Who does that help? The big credit card companies.\n  That is fine. I do not have any problem with that as long as we in \nthe process take care of the consumers, the people who use these \nservices. But the other side has shown tremendous compassion for big \nbusiness. I am asking them to show equal compassion for our children.\n  This is our chance. We just celebrated Mother's Day, and Father's Day \nis coming. What a perfect moment for us to seize this time--after the \nColumbine tragedy, after the Arkansas tragedy--and say enough is \nenough, and to vote out a well balanced bill that gives us the \nprevention, gives us the treatment, gives us the enforcement, gives us \nthe tougher penalties,\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\naddresses the gun issue in a sensible way, and we can all come out of \nhere in a bipartisan way feeling that we have done something for our \nchildren and our families.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest in just a minute.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I assume, \nunless the rules have been changed, there would be an equal amount of \ntime on this side. Is that all right?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 \nminutes of debate on my amendment, 15 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment, which has been offered \ngraciously by the Senator from Utah on my behalf, is an amendment which \nreflects action which this Senate has already taken which has been \nextremely positive in the area of dealing with the issue of how we \nprotect our schools and our children who are in school.\n  Last year, this Senate, with great foresight, in the appropriations \nbill from the committee which I chair passed a funding proposal which I \ncalled the safe school proposal, which was bipartisanly agreed to and \nwhich was worked out through our subcommittee. Senator Hollings, my \nranking member, worked very hard on this. Senator Campbell had a \nspecial role in this. Senator Kohl from Wisconsin had a special role in \nthis.\n  We produced this piece of legislation, which is a step in the right \ndirection, funded at the level of $210 million, for the purposes of \nsetting up a grant program to allow schools to apply to the Justice \nDepartment for grants in order to address the issue of safety in \nschools.\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\n  Basically the grants were broken into three main goals. The first was \nfor allowing police officers to work with schools as resource officers \nor as actual security officers within the school systems so there could \nbe a merger of the law enforcement atmosphere and the teaching \ncommunity in a way that was constructive and reinforced the positive \nnature of law enforcement within the school community.\n  The second function of this language was to fund technology basically \nto allow schools to put in place technology in order to identify \nhazardous things that might come into the schools such as weapons.\n  The third was to initiate prevention programs, which schools might \ncome up with, which they felt would positively respond to the needs of \nthe school community. This program, which a fair amount of work went \ninto, was part of a larger program which our subcommittee has been \nundertaking to try to address the issue of safety and children. In \nfact, our subcommittee has been aggressively funding the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, the Innocent Image Program \nthe FBI has been running to catch child predators, Boys and Girls Clubs \nof America, Parents Anonymous, violence against women programs, safe \nschool programs, Big Brother, Big Sister.\n\n  We have been funding a large number of initiatives. Programs which we \nfound were working well we have tried to put money into, rather than \nreinventing the wheel.\n  The amendment I have offered today basically takes the ideas that we \nput into last year's appropriation bills, codifies them, authorizes \nthem, and expands them to some degree, but basically works on the same \nframework, the initiative here, the Safe Schools Initiative. The \nconcept of it is not for us at the Federal Government level to tell the \nlocal communities how they should protect their schools and how they \nshould do a better job of addressing the issue of safety in schools. \nRather, we wanted the local communities to come to us, the Federal \nGovernment, and say here is an idea we have. This is a creative, \nimaginative idea. We need some money to run it. Can you help us out \nwith it?\n  Basically, it is a philosophy of giving flexibility to the local \nschool districts in applying for these grants. We anticipated that \nthese grants will be used for a lot of different things. There will be \na lot of different ideas that come forward. We expect there will be \nproposals where money will be used to assist in training of parents, \nteachers, and law enforcement personnel in order to recognize early \nwarning signs relative to the children who may have violent \ndispositions. We expect there will be funding that will be used for the \nbasis of innovative research-based initiatives relative to delinquency \nand violence prevention in school programs. We expect there will be \nprograms to assist schools, for example, if they decide to put in a \nuniform code. That is a local school district's decision. Where this \ngrant will be of assistance is if a local school decides to go to a \nuniform code and it needs money in order to help folks in the school \nsystem who can't afford those uniforms, they can apply for these \ngrants.\n  It will also support collaborations between community-based \norganizations, including faith-based organizations, which are doing a \ngood job and have a demonstrated success rate of dealing with troubled \nyouth. This is an area where we think there is tremendous fertile \nground. We, of course, already are funding aggressively the Girls and \nBoys Clubs and Parents Anonymous and Violence Against Women and \ninitiatives such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters, but there are a lot \nof other great ideas out there. There are people in Boston who have \ngood ideas. There are people in New York who have good ideas, people \nout in California and the Midwest who have good ideas. These local \ncommunity initiatives --grants have to come in through a school \nsystem--are tied into the school systems and are going to be assisting \nthe school systems.\n  Those are proposals which we think will be very, very positive, and \nhere is a place where they can get some funding to make them \nsuccessful.\n  We actually, in this proposal, also give preference to proposals that \ncome forward that are a joint effort between the law enforcement \ncommunity in the town and the school system in the town. I think it is \nvery important when we can join those two mainstays of the community \ntogether in a joint effort to try to address the issue of violence in \nour schools and especially how we deal with troubled children. Those \ntypes of programs we would expect to be funded and, in fact, get \npreference.\n  We also would expect that you will see funding for training people, \npeople who work in the school systems, like teachers, bus drivers, \njanitors, to identify potential threats they might come across in the \nschool system. We would expect that money might be used here for the \npurposes of hiring officers who would be resource individuals, police \nofficers, resource individuals within the schools in order to help out \nand in order to bring safety into the classroom and into the hallways.\n  We also expect that money would be used for assessing security needs \nor for the cost of making improvements within school systems in order \nto address their security needs.\n  There are a lot of different initiatives which can result from this \nproposal. The point is that we already have the money in place. This is \nnot a pie-in-the-sky, theoretical proposal. This is not something that \nis going to be authorized and not be funded. We have already funded \nthis program to the tune of $210 million.\n  I regret, quite honestly, that the administration so far has not been \nable to get that money out to the communities. In fact, at last check, \nnone of the $210 million which was appropriated last year and which was \nspecifically addressed to safe school issues, such as putting police \nofficers in the classroom, getting equipment to make sure schools are \nmore secure, helping out with prevention programs, has actually been \ndistributed. This is too bad. It reflects maybe a lack of attention to \nthis issue by the administration. However, with the horrendous events \nthat occurred in Littleton, we are now seeing that a lot of \napplications are forthcoming. Maybe there will be a higher level of \nawareness of this problem.\n  Basically, this is a proposal which I think obviously makes a lot of \nsense. This Senate actually already thought it made a lot of sense, \nbecause we voted for the money to be spent on this type of proposal. \nThis authorizing language now makes the money that is already in the \npipeline more specifically directed and puts in place authorization \nwhich properly accounts for how we proceed relative to the \nappropriations process.\n  It is obviously, in my opinion, a good step, an appropriate step, and \nsomething that should not be at all controversial.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a question for my colleague. Would the Senator be \nwilling to add this Senator from California as a cosponsor of his \namendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be honored to have the Senator from California as \na cosponsor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is a good amendment, because I think it takes from \nsome wonderful ideas that a lot of us around here have. I appreciate \nthe Senator's offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is very similar to what the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and I worked on in the Appropriations Committee. This \nincorporates a number of things in an amendment I have planned for this \nbill.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much, as the \nranking member of the committee, for cosponsoring the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndebate on amendment No. 324, the Gregg amendment, that amendment be set \naside, and Senator Robb or his designee be immediately recognized to \noffer an amendment, the text of which is amendment No. 323, and that \nthere be up to 30 minutes of debate. I also ask unanimous consent that \nat the conclusion or yielding of time, the Senate resume the Hatch-\nBiden-Sessions amendment No. 322 and the time be limited to 30 minutes \nequally divided; following that debate, the Senate proceed to vote on \nor in relation to the Gregg amendment, to be followed by a vote on or \nin relation to the Robb amendment, to be followed by a vote on or in \nrelation to the Hatch amendment; and no other amendments or motions be \nin order prior to the three votes just identified.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following those votes, Senator \nDeWine be recognized for up to 20 minutes, and then Senator Leahy be \nrecognized to offer an amendment, and no amendments be in order prior \nto a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my understanding is that the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio is not seeking recognition to offer an amendment but \nsimply to speak.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That was the basis of the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is my understanding. That is right.\n  Will the Senator yield back the time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the time on this side in relation \nto the Gregg-Boxer-Leahy, et al, amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it, we will now proceed to \nthe Robb amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 325 to Amendment No. 322\n\n (Purpose: To provide resources and services to enhance school safety \n                       and reduce youth violence)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof Mr. Robb and Mr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for Mr. Robb and Mr. \n     Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 325 to amendment No. \n     322.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, what \nis the situation now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is one-half hour equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Does the distinguished Senator from Virginia wish to yield any of his \ntime at this point?\n  I yield the control of time on this side of the aisle to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I had an opportunity \nprior to the offering of this amendment to make a statement about the \namendment. I will give the other side an opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have $1.1 billion a year in this bill, \nfor law enforcement, for prevention, for safe schools, for parental \nempowerment. The distinguished Senator from Virginia wants to add each \nyear an additional $1.4 billion on top of that. This is another \nmarathon Federal bureaucratic solution to a local problem.\n  The first title creates a so-called National Resource Center for \nSchool Safety to the tune of $100 million. The director of this center \nis appointed by the head of the Department of Education, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the head of Health and Human Services. This sounds to me \nvery much like we are creating another Federal agency in a way that is \nduplicative of what is going on at the State level, something we have \nbeen trying to avoid in the whole 2 years we debated the juvenile \njustice bill.\n  For example, the funds of this center include such things as:\n  No. 1, an emergency response to do such things as helping communities \nmeet urgent needs such as long-term counseling for students, faculty, \nand family.\n  No. 2, a national anonymous hotline. Many local areas are already \nestablishing hotlines to accept calls from local students and other \nparties. Why on earth do we need a Federal hotline on top of the local \ncommunity hotlines, a Federal hotline which is supposed to then relay \nthe urgent messages to the local hotlines and officials? We are going \nto spend $100 million of taxpayer money in this bill for something \nalready taken care of. Why not help the States establish their own \nhotlines, if they even need that help? This bill does that.\n  No. 3, training and assistance. This proposal has this new $100 \nmillion Federal bureaucracy helping local agencies develop a school \nsafety plan--as if they can't do it themselves.\n\n  First, most local agencies already have school safety plans and they \nknow how to provide for school safety a lot better than the bureaucrats \nhere in Washington or, I might add, anybody standing or sitting here in \nthe Senate. Most local agencies, since they already have school safety \nplans, don't need help from us.\n  Second, if a national model is needed, the Department of Education \ncan identify a local education agency's particularly affected plan and \nsend it out to the local jurisdictions so they can carry it out. That \nway, we have 50 State laboratories or in every school district a State \nlaboratory rather than bureaucrats back in Washington telling us what \nto do. That ought to cost just a few thousand dollars compared to $100 \nmillion provided in this particular instance.\n  No. 4, the new $100 million Federal bureaucracy is supposed to act as \na clearinghouse for research and evaluation. This information is \nreadily available on the Internet. We do not need a Federal bureaucracy \nto administer this.\n  The bottom of this chart lists the number of Federal programs we \nalready have in each of these particular areas: Training and \nassistance, 62; counseling, 62; research and evaluation, 55; violence \nprevention, 53; parental and family intervention, 52; support service, \n51; substance abuse prevention, 47; planning and program development, \n47; self-sufficiency skills, 46; mentoring, 46; job training \nassistance, 45; tutoring, 35; substance abuse treatment, 26; \nclearinghouse, 19; and capital improvement, 10. There are similar \nservices in several department and agency programs funded in fiscal \nyear 1998. The source of this information is the General Accounting \nOffice as of 1999.\n  Under title 2 of this amendment, as I read this, this is a marathon \nnew grant program to the tune of $722 million for areas such as \neducational reform. As you can see, we are already doing that. ``The \nreview and updating of school policies.'' Can you imagine that? Why \nwould anybody want to do this, when the State and local school board \ndirectors know exactly what they are doing? Why would we spend $722 \nmillion more on this? I might add, ``to review for the review and \nupdating of school policies,'' whatever that means.\n  Title 3 in this bill includes alcohol and drug abuse prevention. That \nis already part of our bill. We have worked on this for 2 solid years. \nWe have made every dime count and we have added plenty of money for \nprevention. Better than half of this bill is prevention money. It makes \nyou wonder; you would never be able to outspend some of these people \naround here. It doesn't make any difference what is in the best \ninterests of taxpayers; it is what is in the best interests of the \npolitical people who push these things.\n  Mental health prevention and treatment and early childhood \ndevelopment is something they want to do. This proposal includes a \ngrant to address violence-related stress. Another element includes \ngrants to ``the development of\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\nknowledge on best practices for treating disorders associated with \npsychological trauma.''\n  Mr. President, mental health treatment is a very important area and \none in which a lot of Members, including myself, have done a lot of \nwork through the years. However, I have a concern about using this bill \non school violence for a major new Federal mental health system at a \ncost of hundreds of millions of dollars when we have better than half \nof the bill now going for prevention purposes.\n  The final title of this bill is a $600 million increase in \nafterschool programs. I am not categorically opposed to directing more \nFederal resources to promote afterschool programs. I am concerned that \nthis section is overly bureaucratic. We can better help schools by \nfreeing them up from regulatory hoops. I think that is what we ought to \ndo instead of doing this. I have been around here for 23 years. When \ncommittees work 2 solid years on this matter, the way we have, and we \nwork with a leader on crime issues such as Senator Biden and with \nothers on the committee in a bipartisan way to come up with prevention \nmoneys that actually exceed the money for law enforcement itself, and \ndo so to the tune of well over a half billion dollars a year, there is \nno need for this type of amendment which is just ``let's throw money at \nit'' and call it nice things--general things at that, if you will--even \nthough almost everything this amendment proposes to do we already do in \nour bill and we do it in a fiscally responsible way and in a fiscally \nrestrained way.\n\n  I am almost amazed that this amendment has been brought forth. At \nfirst I thought I might support it, because I thought they were talking \nabout doing these things within the framework of what we have already \ndone. But when I look at it and read it and understand it, it is just \nanother way of throwing more money and beating our breasts, saying we \nhave done something for prevention in the juvenile justice area when in \nfact we are doing plenty for prevention.\n  It needs to be known there is already $4 billion in the pipeline on \nprevention now, without the bill we have brought to the floor, the \nbipartisan bill we have brought to the floor. Now they want to add \nanother $1.4 billion for these generalized programs that, literally, \nthe States are taking care of in most instances, and if they have not, \nwe have taken care of them in the underlying bill.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote against this amendment, and at the \nappropriate time I will make a motion to table.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nsteadfast leadership, his skill, and efforts on behalf of this \nlegislation on which we have been working for 2 years. I hope now we \nare at a point where we can bring it to a conclusion. It passed last \nyear out of committee with bipartisan support, 12 to 6.\n  We continue to have problems getting the bill up. I believe we will \nthis time. There is support across the aisle. But I know there are \nthose who believe we can somehow pass out a few billion dollars and we \ncan prevent all crime in America. That is an awfully broad category, \njust to say ``prevention.'' What does that mean? How do you spend that \nmoney wisely?\n  My concept, as a prosecutor of 15 years, was to try to have the money \nwhere, first of all, our first focus would be to make sure the juvenile \njudges, who are seeing these kids come before them, have a full panoply \nof options with which to deal with them. They need to be able to drug \ntest them. They need to be able to have them get drug treatment if need \nbe. If they need to go to work camps, they ought to go to work camps or \nweekend work programs. If they need to have a boot camp, they ought to \nhave that option. If they need to have detention, they should have \nthat. Some do. I wish it were not so. So we have helped craft a bill to \nhave the judge intervene effectively in the life of those youngsters \nwhen they first start getting arrested, when they first get in trouble \nwith the law.\n  We have had a lot of talk and created this dichotomy, saying those \nkinds of programs are not prevention. I believe they are. I believe a \nprogram which has a school-based boot camp, like the one in my hometown \nof Mobile, that I have visited where kids go and have physical \nexercise, they have discipline, and they have intensive schoolwork on \ntheir level--it is working for them. They have after-care to make sure \nthey do not slide back into bad habits after they leave. So I think we \nhave a lot of good things going. I believe that is prevention.\n\n  We, in this legislation, have half the money going for what they, on \nthe other side of the aisle, would say is prevention.\n  I want to show this chart. It says some things that are important. It \nwas done by the University of Maryland at the behest of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. They did a prevention evaluation report. We have \nbillions of dollars being spent on programs for high-risk youth to try \nto keep them from heading down the road of a life of crime. A lot of \nthose programs work. A lot of them are not very effective. Our bill, \nSenator Hatch's bill, has $40 million to research programs to see if \nthey are working.\n  They have already done some research. This is the study the \nDepartment of Justice, President Clinton's Department of Justice, did. \nThey found most crime prevention funds are being spent where they are \nneeded least. Is that not a horrible thing to say? We do not have \nunlimited budgets. I have learned that here. We talk in big numbers but \nthere is a limit to how many millions of dollars we can spend on \nprojects. The conclusion of their own study was, these prevention \nmoneys are being spent where they are needed least. Second, they \nconcluded most crime prevention programs have never been evaluated. \nThird, among the evaluated programs, some of the least effective \nreceive the most money.\n  That is a real indictment of us. I hope this research and evaluation \nmoney we have put in this legislation will help confront that problem.\n  The amendment that has been offered to spend over $1 billion more on \nprevention--that effort is pretty troubling to me. There have not been \nintensive hearings on these proposals, as the Senator from Utah noted. \nWe have not evaluated them carefully. In effect, it appears to me we \nwould be throwing money at the problem. Our history tells us that is \nprecisely what we ought not to do.\n  What we have found is there are $4.4 billion now in juvenile \nprevention money from 117 different programs, according to the General \nAccounting Office study done very recently on our behalf --117 \nprograms. I used to be in the 4-H Club. Being in the 4-H Club was \nprobably a good thing for me. I got to go to Auburn one time. That was \nbig for me. I had the award for the best hog in Wilcox County. But now \nthey have 4-H Club programs in inner cities, for crime prevention. It \nmay work. But the Department of Agriculture has programs to build 4-H \nClubs in the inner cities as some sort of crime prevention program. I \nhave my doubts about whether those are the best ways to spend that \nmoney. We need to evaluate these programs.\n  What we found is that money actually dedicated to law enforcement \nprograms for juvenile justice, a juvenile justice system which is in a \nstate of collapse in America, is zero.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 extra minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is what we are doing today. The \njuvenile justice system in America really does need to be strengthened. \nWhen young people are being picked up on burglaries, small-time \noffenses, they are treated as if they are in a revolving door. The \ncourt systems are overwhelmed. There is no detention. There is no \nalternative to schools. There is no treatment for many of them. As a \nresult, we are not intervening effectively in these young peoples' \nlives. To say money spent--as we do in about half of this bill--to \nstrengthen the court system and strengthen its ability to intervene \neffectively with young people is not prevention is an error. It is \nprevention. Almost every one of these mass-murdering young people who \nhas gone into these schools--not almost, I believe every single one of \nthem, because I have watched it--has had some prior\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\ncriminal record. Had they been effectively dealt with then, maybe they \nwould not have gone on to these more serious offenses.\n  That is where we are. I wish we could afford to spend as much as the \nSenator would like to on this panoply of prevention programs. We simply \nare not able to do that. We battled for every dollar we could as the \nbill is today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this bill is designed to address problems \nthat are not being met at this particular point. The distinguished \nSenator from Utah makes the point that there are duplicative programs. \nThere are many programs in many areas of the country, some statewide, \nsome local, some in jurisdictions that can afford to provide the kind \nof services that this Senator would provide, but what this bill \nattempts to do and would do, if approved, is provide a national center \nwhich will provide the hotline services that many school districts \nsimply cannot afford.\n  Many States are indeed putting hotlines together.\n  In my State yesterday, the Governor announced the establishment of a \nhotline, but a number of States do not have them; many local \njurisdictions do not have them. This will provide for the States that \ndo not have the resources to meet these needs, not only with respect to \nthe hotline, but with respect to providing technical assistance, \nproviding any kind of help that the particular school or students who \nrecognize a need for assistance might designate.\n  It will not require anything. It will not compel any jurisdiction to \ntake on any new responsibilities, nor use any of the facilities that \nare available. But it will provide at one place the kind of technical \nresponse which can respond to these emergencies when they occur so that \nwe have the expertise immediately available in terms of emergency \nresponse, we have the type of expertise that can assist school systems \nand other districts in putting together their own plans to deal with \nproblems that fall into this particular area.\n  With respect to the other part of the bill, I yield now to the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who is the author of that \nparticular provision.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senator from Virginia has pointed \nout, this particular proposal reflects a total of less than a billion \ndollars. It will be another $722 million. It has in it the National \nResource Center for School Safety and it also has the Safe Schools and \nHealthy Students Program.\n  There are Members of this body who think the solution to the \nchallenges we are facing in our schools can be solved by putting more \nkids in prison and keeping them there. That may be the view of some \nMembers of this body, but it is not the view of those law enforcement \nofficials who are working in school districts across the country who \nare making meaningful progress.\n  We have not heard from those people in the Judiciary Committee \nbecause they have not been asked to testify. We ought to at least be \nwilling to look at the results of some of the cities and communities \nacross this country that have reduced violence, not only in schools, \nbut in the communities and ask them what has worked. That might be a \nuseful test around here for a change. That is just what Senator Robb \nand I have done. We have asked what has worked, and we have tried to \nmake a recommendation to this body about programs that work, that are \nsupported by students, supported by parents, supported by teachers, and \nsupported by law enforcement officials.\n  If this body does not want to invest in those programs, if it thinks \nthat we can just provide more cops and they are going to provide the \nanswers to the problems in our schools, vote this amendment down. But \nif you want to look at the experiences of cities and communities like \nwe have seen in our own city of Boston where there has been only one \nyouth homicide with a gun in the last 2\\1/2\\ years in 128 schools--that \nis the record--these are the programs that are working. It is very easy \nto listen to our colleagues talk about bureaucracy, saying: we don't \nwant to have programs; we don't want to deal with all these other \nissues; let's just throw them in jail and throw away the key.\n  One of the most profound comments I heard yesterday in the Jeremiah \nBerg School in Boston, MA, is one of common sense and one that \neverybody in this body understands: You either pay for it early on or \nyou pay for it later on. That is the question: Are we going to support \nthose programs that are tried and tested and are working in our schools \nand working in our communities, or are we going to say, no, we are just \ngoing to dismiss them because they deal with mental health, because \nthey deal with violence protection, because they deal with mediation, \nbecause they deal with things that are happening in schools that can \nmake a difference in reducing violence.\n  The proposal we have offered, with the Leahy proposal and the one \nthat Senator Robb has suggested, tries to combine those programs that \nare going to be effective in law enforcement, as well as those that are \ngoing to be supporting children.\n\n  I have heard a number of young people in the last several days say, \n``We are not interested in someone telling us and yelling at us. We \nwant parents and we want our teachers to talk with us, to listen to us \nand to give us an opportunity to work with counselors to provide for \nsome of the needs of people in our schools and in our communities.''\n  This particular amendment is targeted. It is based on an evaluation \nof programs that are working. The Safe Schools and Healthy Students \nProgram provides for 50 school districts. We have expanded it to 200. I \nthink we can expand it further.\n  One may say, why 200? Because that is the judgment we made based upon \nthe quality of applications we have had in the Justice Department. That \nis how we reached these figures.\n  I reject the arguments made by the Senator from Utah about this \nprogram. I reject the suggestion that we are going to solve all these \nproblems just by law enforcement alone, because that is the \nalternative. I think that is a viewpoint that has been demonstrated to \nbe a vacant attitude based upon where the progress has been made in \nrecent times in the communities that have done something about youth \nviolence.\n  I hope we will accept the Robb amendment. I withhold the time. How \nmuch time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia be given 2 extra minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield 2 minutes for a \nresponse.\n  Mr. HATCH. There were 2 extra minutes taken on our side.\n  Mr. ROBB. The Senator from Minnesota would like to respond as well.\n  I will say, again, to address the specific concern raised by the \nSenator from Utah with respect to the duplication, this is an effort to \nprovide one-shot, one-stop assistance to States, localities, \nindividuals and others who need assistance who are currently uncovered \nby any of the programs that are in effect.\n  If this program is as effective as we believe it can and will be, it \nmay be that some of the other programs will ultimately be folded into \nthis protection. We do not need 100 or several hundred different \nhotlines. They are desirable if the local jurisdiction can afford them. \nIn this case, we will have a national clearinghouse, a national \nhotline. We will have the coordination of the Department of Justice and \nthe Department of Education. That is what we are trying to accomplish \nin a single bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on this point?\n  Mr. ROBB. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me respond to my colleague from Massachusetts. Fifty-\nfive percent of the $1.1 billion that we already have in this bill--\nkeep in mind there is already $4.4 billion out there for prevention--is \nfor prevention, and one of the major uses, discretionary uses, is \nmental health. What I do not want to do is create a whole bunch of new \nbureaucracies back here that are just duplicative with what is already \ngoing on. That is where I have my difficulty with what the Senator from \nMassachusetts does.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to, but let me make one more comment. Go \nahead. I yield.\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How do you think we administer SAMHSA? We are using \nexisting programs. We are not creating new programs. This is the SAMHSA \nauthorization, SAMHSA funding.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right, and we have well over one-half billion dollars for \nthese purposes now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Under the SAMHSA program?\n  Mr. HATCH. No, discretionary use.\n  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration is to be \nreauthorized this year. As I understand it, Dr. Frist, Senator Frist \nfrom Tennessee, and Senator Mikulski----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And Senator Kennedy had reauthorized that.\n  Mr. HATCH. And I am sure Senator Kennedy will be helping, too. These \npeople have been working on a bipartisan bill----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As a proud supporter of that, this is what is going to \nwork.\n  Mr. HATCH. S. 976, the SAMHSA reauthorization, is cosponsored not \nonly by Senators Frist and Mikulski but by Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, \nDodd, DeWine and Collins.\n  Now, S. 976 is the bill to consider these changes on substance abuse \nand mental health. I do not want to see juvenile justice go down \nbecause we start tinkering around with it here, when we have mental \nhealth as one of the permissible uses of this money, by throwing \nanother $1.4 billion at it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia now controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota be given 2 minutes, and then we will move on to the next \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Two \nminutes will be added.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just very briefly, let me thank Senator \nRobb and Senator Kennedy and say to my colleague from Utah, I look \nforward to that reauthorization. My focus has been on mental health \nservices. But I tell you, for the last 8\\1/2\\ years I have been in a \nschool about every 2 weeks, and students talk all the time about the \nneed to have more support services.\n  We can no longer view mental health services as icing on the cake. It \nis part of the cake. If we are serious about juvenile justice and we \nare serious about prevention, then we need to focus on what we can do.\n  When I meet with teachers and principals and education assistants, \nthey all say to me, many children, in their very small lives, I say to \nSenator Kennedy, even by first grade have been through so much that \neven the smallest class size, best teachers, and best technology will \nnot do the job.\n  This effort, at the community level, to put a focus on mental health \nservices and to have the coordination and make sure this is part of our \napproach to juvenile justice is right on target.\n  My final point. I have said it a thousand times on the floor of the \nSenate, and I will shout it one more time from the mountaintop: You can \nbuild all the prisons you want to and physical facilities; you will \nfill them all up, and you will never stop this cycle of violence unless \nyou invest in the health and skills and intellect and character of \nchildren.\n  That is what this has to be about. That is what this amendment speaks \nto. And the vast majority of people in this country understand that \nessential truth. That is what this amendment is about. That is what \nthis vote is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is all time yielded back? Has the Senator from Virginia \nyielded back their time?\n  Mr. ROBB. How much time remains under the control of the Senator from \nVirginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 3 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ROBB. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts such time as he \nmay need of that 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I once again thank Senator Wellstone and \nothers who have spoken on this. I just want to share with the Members \nof this body what has been happening in my home community with the \nimplementation of the kinds of programs we have supported here, the \nprograms that have been recommended by the chiefs of police in my town \nand in towns across the country.\n  Here we have the firearm homicides of people under 24 years of age in \nBoston: 51 in 1990; 38 in 1991; 27 in 1992; 35 in 1993; 33 in 1994; 32 \nin 1995. Then, with the implementation of these programs in the Robb \namendment, in 1996, down to 21; 7 in 1997; 16 in 1998; and one in 1999.\n  Are we going to take what is working, what has been requested by law \nenforcement officials, what is demonstratively effective, or are we \ngoing to listen to the same old voices that say what we have to do is \nspend more time in locking up kids? That is the choice.\n  We need to say we are going to invest in and provide the kinds of \nprograms that are supported by teachers, parents, schools, and law \nenforcement officials--programs that are effective and working. That is \nwhat the Robb amendment has done, and that is what it will do. It \ndeserves the support of the Members.\n  We reserve our time.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I see the Senator from Delaware approaching. Does he desire \nto speak on this?\n  In that case, I think the differences have been explored. Once again, \nI suggest to you that this is an attempt to codify and collect in one \nplace the wisdom of those professional agencies and institutions which \nwe look to for guidance in this particular area to address the problem \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has related to us and \nwhich all of us know in terms of our personal experience is a very \nserious problem that cannot be ignored and simply cannot be solved \nsolely by locking people up, no matter how much we might think that \nactually addresses the problem.\n  So I would again observe that this is a desire to make a collective \nopportunity available for those institutions that may not have the \nresources to take advantage of the various provisions of this bill and \nto provide additional funding for a program that has been demonstrated \nto work.\n  With that, I yield back----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBB. I yield whatever time remains to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I hope the Senator from Utah will refer specifically to \nwhat provisions in his legislation refer to mental health, because we \nhave not been able to find them. If he has them there, I would like to \nhear from him on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on both sides has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 322\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 30 minutes, equally divided, \non the amendment of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there are three of us who are going to \nspeak as proponents of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment: Senator \nBiden, Senator Sessions and myself.\n  This amendment contains three major provisions and reflects a hard \nfought, bipartisan compromise among Senator Biden, Senator Sessions and \nmyself. It demonstrates that S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile \nOffender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, is a bipartisan bill in \nevery sense of the word.\n  Before I describe the amendment, I remind the Senate of other \nprovisions in S. 254 that are also the product of compromise and \nconcession.\n  For example, in title I of the bill we included the reverse waiver \nprovision in section 5032, at Senator Leahy's request. This provision \nensures that Federal district judges have the ultimate authority to \ndecide whether a juvenile is tried as an adult in Federal cases.\n  Another major compromise is the juvenile delinquency challenge grant \nin title III of the bill. This block grant provides $200 million a year \nto the States for prevention programs. This provision was included in \nS. 254 to satisfy demands from some Members for additional funds for \nprevention programs.\n  Another compromise in S. 254 concerns the juvenile felony records \nprovision. Last year's juvenile crime bill, S.\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\n10, required States to improve and share juvenile felony records in \norder to qualify for the accountability block grant. At the urging of \nSenators Biden and Leahy, we removed the recordkeeping provision as a \nrequirement for the accountability block grant. Instead, there is a \nseparate grant for juvenile criminal records for States that choose to \nupgrade and share their juvenile felony records.\n\n  The first provision of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment earmarks 25 \npercent of the accountability block grant in title III for drug \ntreatment and crime prevention programs. These drug treatment funds \nwill complement and reinforce the drug testing provisions in the \naccountability block grant.\n  In addition, this earmark provides funds for additional prevention \nprograms, such as afterschool activities and gang prevention programs. \nThis amendment, by earmarking 25 percent of the accountability block \ngrant for prevention and drug treatment, demonstrates our commitment to \nprevention funding and ensures a balanced juvenile crime bill.\n  The second provision of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment provides a \n$50 million grant to the States to hire prosecutors to prosecute \njuvenile offenders. The hiring of juvenile prosecutors was a \npermissible use of grant funds in S. 254 since the bill was introduced. \nOur amendment merely provides a guaranteed source of funds for State \nand local prosecutors to target juvenile crime.\n  The third and last provision of the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment \nextends the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund until the year 2005. By \nextending the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, we will ensure that \nthe Federal Government continues to provide valuable assistance to the \nStates in the war against crime.\n  Programs such as the truth-in-sentencing grant, the local law \nenforcement block grant, the COPS program, are funded from the Violent \nCrime Reduction Trust Fund. I am proud to propose the extension of this \ntrust fund.\n  I want to personally thank Senator Biden for the hard work he has \ndone on this bill and in working with us in a bipartisan and good way. \nI am very proud to have him on this bill, because he has been a major \nparticipant in every crime bill since I have been in the Senate, as \nhave I. I just want to make that clear on the record.\n  I also particularly express my gratitude and appreciation to Senator \nSessions, the Youth Violence Subcommittee chairman. He has done a great \njob on this bill, and I believe he has more than earned his spurs with \nregard to his work on anticrime matters.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding, on my \ntime, not on the time of the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Just so the distinguished Senator from Utah can hear this, I \nappreciate the fact that he has included many of the provisions in this \nbill I had argued for in the last Congress. I compliment him on that. I \ndid that earlier today when I spoke, referring to the Hatch-Biden-\nSessions amendment. I tell the distinguished chairman that as he and I \nare both people who believe in redemption, and I would say this is a \nlong way from redemption, going from 1997 to 1999, but hope springs \neternal, and he has included some of my provisions in this bill. I \nappreciate it.\n  I note that the original bill provided $15 million for primary \nprevention. This amendment would earmark another $112.5 million.\n  I understand the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, would like to be added as a cosponsor. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am proud to \nhave her as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think this is a positive step, by earmarking the other \n$112.5 million. I commend Senators Hatch and Sessions and Biden for \nthis. It shows that our efforts over the last 2 years really have made \na difference. Let us put this in context.\n  The rest of the bill also allocates over $330 million for law \nenforcement, $75 million for juvenile criminal history records, $20 \nmillion for gang fighting, and $50 million for prosecutors. In context, \nthat is a total of $482.5 million for law enforcement compared to \n$112.5 million for primary prevention. S. 254 also provides $400 \nmillion for intervention programs after juveniles come into contact \nwith the juvenile or criminal justice system. It is intervention money, \nnot primary prevention money. It is important money, but it is not \ndirected to primary prevention.\n  There is $50 million in the prosecutors grant fund. That is a \nproposal that was accepted in 1997 by the Judiciary Committee. My only \nconcern is the money goes only to prosecutors, not to anyone else in \nthe juvenile system. It doesn't go to counselors. It doesn't go to \npublic defenders. It doesn't go to corrections officers. It doesn't go \nto juvenile judges. We have to examine closely the effects of this new \nprosecutors grant.\n  I want to make sure it doesn't exacerbate overcrowding in the \njuvenile system and the system does not break down; I pledge to now \nwork with the Senator from Utah to see if there is a possibility of \nbalancing the system in a fair way.\n  Overall, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah, \nas I said, and the distinguished Senator from Alabama, the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware for adding the things we have \nrequested for a couple years. I did want to point out, however, as I \nsaid earlier, anybody who has ever been in law enforcement will always \ntell you, if you can prevent the crime from happening, you are a lot \nbetter off in what you do after it happens. I wish there was more money \nfor prevention. Money for law enforcement is well spent. I wish there \nwas more money for prevention.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I recall, I have 11 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate the question?\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, I have 11 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say, prior to sending my amendment to the desk, I \nhad agreed to drop some change that was of concern to the \nAppropriations Committee. The amendment at the desk does not contain \nthis technical change.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 322, As modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to amend my amendment to reflect \nthe change I promised Senator Leahy and others I would make. The \nmodification is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware and the remaining 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I apologize. I did not. Did the Senator \nyield me a specific amount of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir. He yielded you 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of revisions that have been worked \nout here in the core bill that is before us. As the ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, knows, and as the chairman knows, this began over 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. We have come a long way. We have narrowed the gap between \nthe position held by Senator Hatch and myself and by Senator Sessions \nand myself and many others. Primarily what the Hatch-Biden-Sessions \namendment does, it takes the underlying bill and it does three or four, \nI think, very important things.\n  No. 1, it adds prevention uses to permissible uses of the so-called \naccountability block grant. When I am home\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nsometimes watching this on TV, I wonder how the people understand \nanything we are saying. What is an accountability block grant? What it \nmeans is that there is $450 million in this bill that we give to given \nStates to be able to use for various purposes. One of those chunks of \nmoney, the $450 million, prior to the Hatch-Biden amendment, did not \nallow the money to be used for prevention. This allows, earmarks, \nrequires 25 percent of it to be used for prevention. You have about \n$113 million that is to be used for prevention out of that grant.\n  In addition to that, it adds other allowable uses that we hope the \nStates will do. That is, it allows them to use money for drug \ntreatment, alcohol treatment, drug and alcohol treatment, school \ncounseling, school-based prevention programs. Then, in addition, what \nit does is--in the Biden crime bill, which became the crime law of \n1994, what we didn't do was we did not put in money for prosecutors. We \nfound out, as the former Governor of Nebraska knows, what happens in a \nlot of these courts is we add more cops and they arrest a lot more \npeople. There are not enough prosecutors, there are not enough judges, \nand there are not enough facilities. So the cops do their job, but the \nprocess gets bottlenecked. So we have $50 million in here, which was \ninitially resisted, $50 million for prosecutors at a State level, State \nprosecutors, money for the States to hire prosecutors to prosecute \njuvenile justice cases and for the States to train them to in fact \nprosecute crimes in juvenile court, because that always takes the hind \nquarter of these cases. One of the things is, there is not enough \nresources devoted to pursuing these cases.\n  The prosecution of the case doesn't mean we are just putting more \nprosecutors here to send kids to jail. We are putting more prosecutors \nin here to resolve these sets of graduated sanctions the States have \nset up so there is a prosecutor following through and saying, this kid \nis going to go on a work project, this kid is going to go to the State \nreform school, this kid is going to have to pay restitution for what he \ndid, this kid is going to, in fact, follow through on the sanction that \nthe court is imposing on him. And we, the State, are going to be able \nto pursue this--we, the prosecutor in such-and-such a county or such-\nand-such a State.\n  Finally, and perhaps most important of all, I think the best thing we \ndid in the crime bill we passed in 1994, the thing that people paid the \nleast attention to but the thing I worked the hardest on was setting up \na crime trust fund, a violent crime trust fund.\n  I remind everybody that we made a commitment with this administration \nand when the crime bill passed we would reduce the workforce of Federal \nemployees. We would reduce that workforce, but instead of taking their \npaycheck and returning it to the Treasury, we were going to put it in a \ntrust fund. So we reduced the Federal workforce by 300,000 people--the \nsmallest Federal workforce since John Kennedy was President of the \nUnited States of America. We took that money and we put it in a trust \nfund that can only be used for the purposes outlined in the crime \nbill--for prevention, for enforcement, and for incarceration. It \nstopped us from bickering over how we are going to fund the programs.\n  We are not raising any new taxes to pay for this. We are not giving \nmoney back. We can. We could take this money that we are no longer \npaying the Federal employees in the Department of Education, or in the \nDepartment of Energy, or wherever--we could take their paycheck and \ngive it back in terms of a tax cut, or we could take it and put it in \nthis trust fund.\n  That is what has kept the funding of the 100,000 cops, that is what \nhas kept the funding of the prison system, and that is what has kept \nthe funding of the prevention programs. That expires in the year 2000. \nThis will extend that violent crime trust fund to the year 2005.\n  Once we cut through all the specific things we could legislatively \ndo, it is probably the single most significant thing we will do.\n  I thank my colleagues for agreeing to the compromise which includes \nextending that trust fund.\n  There are a number of pieces of this legislation that \nunderstandably--because this is a moving target--have in fact confused \npeople.\n  My friend from Nebraska asked me the question about whether or not \nthis federalizes juvenile crime, whether or not it sets a Federal aid \nlimit at which you could try a young person as an adult that preempts \nState law. No, we don't do that.\n  It does say that in a Federal court, if a Federal prosecutor brings a \ncase within Federal jurisdiction against a minor, they can in fact seek \nto try that minor as an adult under a certain set of circumstances. But \nit doesn't go in and say to the State of Nebraska or Delaware that you \nmust in your State treat minors in terms of whether or not they can be \ntried as adults the same way the Federal system treats them. Some \nStates try minors as adults at a much younger age. Some States don't \nallow minors under the age of 18 to be tried as adults unless it is \nunder the most extraordinary circumstances.\n  The original legislation in iteration of four or five bills ago \nprobably did do that. But we are not federalizing this notion of under \nwhat circumstances a person under the age of 18 can be tried as an \nadult. We are not allowing for Federal preemption where there is State \nand Federal jurisdiction. It is not an automatic preemption to the \nState by the Federal Government. We have built into this legislation a \nrational way of approaching that.\n  In the interest of time, I am not going to take the time to explain \nthat now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me sit down and thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to say that I am excited about where we are at this point with \nthis legislation. It has been a 2-year struggle. Senator Biden is a \ngreat advocate and strong believer in his views. I have some strong \nviews about it. I believe that at this point we have made a compromise, \nan agreement that both of us can live with, which will allow us to \neffectively respond at this time to assist State and local governments, \nState and local court systems and juvenile systems, and educational \nsystems to better focus and better prevent and deter crime by young \npeople.\n  I firmly believe we have seen over the last 20 years an extraordinary \nincrease in the amount of juvenile crime in America. Hopefully, it will \nplateau out a bit. But between 1993 and 1997, juvenile crime was up \nanother 14 percent and has been increasing even more rapidly than prior \nthereto. What we have is a piece of legislation which I believe will \nallow us to effectively deal with that.\n  Prevention: What is prevention?\n  A good, consistent court system that has credibility and respect \namong young people helps prevent crime. A court system that is known \nfor not being credible does not prevent crime. Police officers tell me: \nThey are laughing at us. They know we can't do anything to them. We \nhave no place to put these kids. We have no detention, no punishment \nthat we can impose. Nothing happens to them. We arrest them and they \nare let go.\n  That is what is happening too often in America. This bill will begin \nto turn the tide on that.\n  We will spend more money also on trying to prevent crime. I think we \nare making a good step forward. The House passed this bill. We passed \nit with bipartisan support last year in committee. I believe we will \nhave a strong vote this time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I again congratulate Senator Hatch for the outstanding leadership he \nhas given as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and for his efforts to \nmake this bill a reality. I thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time in the opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 38 seconds.\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Pete Levitas, \na fellow assigned to the Antitrust Subcommittee from the Justice \nDepartment, be granted the privilege of the floor during the Senate's \nconsideration of S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \nAccountability and Rehabilitation Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening in strong support of \nthe bill before us. This juvenile justice legislation is a product of \nbipartisan work and bipartisan compromise. I believe it is a very \nvaluable and long overdue measure that will tackle a major national \nproblem.\n  Last week I spoke on the Senate floor on the need to find ways to \nreach out to young people and to hopefully save young lives. I said at \nthat time that youth violence presents us with very difficult issues, \nreally, for a public official to talk about because people, once you \nstart talking about this issue, may think you, as the person who is \ntalking, believe that you have ``the'' answer. So let me say again, \nright up front, I do not claim to have the answer. Evil is a mystery \nthat exists deep in the human heart.\n  But if we do not have all the answers for the problems we see--what \nwe saw happening in Littleton, for example--that should not stop us \nfrom trying to do something. I believe the juvenile justice bill we \nhave before us, as well as many of the amendments which will be \noffered, will in fact save lives. The fact, the brutal fact of human \nexistence, that we cannot come up with the answer does not excuse us \nfrom our moral responsibilities--our moral responsibilities, as \nlegislators, as parents, as citizens. In fact, it increases our \nresponsibilities. If we do not have ``the'' answer, we have to work \nharder to find answers, things we can do to make a difference, child by \nchild by child.\n  This juvenile justice bill provides the Senate the opportunity to \nfind some of these answers. Some of the things in the bill before us \nare certainly not glamorous, but I believe they will all be helpful. I \nbelieve they will save lives. In essence, the bill before us is \ndesigned to make sure our juvenile justice system and those who make \ndecisions in that system have the tools they need to meet the challenge \nof a juvenile population that, tragically, is becoming more violent. I \nwill focus briefly on some of the provisions I have been most involved \nin in putting together this bill and highlight how I believe they will \nmake a real difference, addressing real problems facing juvenile \njustice systems across this country.\n\n  First, Senator Sessions and I have worked long and hard, along with \nthe chairman, to provide $75 million to help States upgrade their \njuvenile felony record systems. I believe this is an especially \nimportant provision. As a former county prosecuting attorney, I can \ntell you, the decisions made by judges in our juvenile courts on \njuvenile offenders are only as good as the information on which they \nare based. The same is certainly true for judges in our adult criminal \nsystem. The problem is, the information that is available is not as \ncomplete, many times, as it should be. In fact, many times the \ninformation about the offender, about what the offender has done in the \npast, is simply nonexistent.\n  What am I talking about? We have had a tradition in this country that \njuvenile courts would all operate behind closed doors and the records \nof those courts would never be available. The reason, the rationale, \nwas we wanted to protect young people; that young people could change \nand they should have a second chance, sometimes a third chance. All \nthat makes sense and there is nothing wrong, even today, 1999, with \nthat basic philosophy.\n  That philosophy, though, does not work when we are dealing with a 17-\nyear-old, who is still a juvenile, who has committed a violent crime--\nlet's say a rape--or a 16-year-old who has committed an aggravated \nrobbery. It makes no sense to say that information about that \nindividual will always be hidden.\n  Let me give Members of the Senate, my colleagues, a specific example. \nLet's say a 15-year-old in Xenia, OH, commits a serious offense. Let's \nsay it is a violent offense. That 15-year-old is dealt with by the \ncourt and later moves, at the age of 17, to Adams County, Ohio. That \njuvenile then commits another offense. Under our current system, there \nis really no effective central depository of that information. There is \none, but there is very little information in it. So the arresting \nofficials in Adams County might not know that individual, several years \nbefore, had committed a serious offense in Greene County.\n  Let's take another example. Let's say the juvenile is 16 and commits \nan offense in Cincinnati, OH; several years later moves to Indiana and, \nas an adult, commits another violent offense in Indiana. The Indiana \nauthorities may not necessarily know that juvenile--the person who was \na juvenile, who is now 18, an adult--committed a violent crime several \nyears before across the State line in bordering Ohio.\n  What this bill does is commit $75 million to local law enforcement \nagencies, to States to help them develop their criminal record system \nfor juveniles.\n  We are not, by this provision, saying what a State should do. What we \nare saying, though, is that the State, by putting that information into \na central computer system, will enable another State where that \njuvenile shows up, 2, 3, 5, or 10 years later, to be on notice as to \nwhat type individual this is, or at least they will know what crime, \nwhat serious crime, what violent crime this juvenile has committed. It \nsimply makes sense.\n  It has been my experience that when we read about what I call horror \nstories in the newspapers, where we see someone who has been picked up \nby the police, and he is let out on bond, or she is let out on bond, \nand that person commits another offense or has been charged with an \noffense and has been convicted and gets a light sentence, and they \ncommit another offense, most of those horror stories come from the fact \nthat the police or the judge or the probation officer or the parole \nofficer did not have the available information, didn't know what they \nwere dealing with, didn't know what the criminal record was of that \nindividual. Our bill goes a long way to address this problem. It gives \nlocal law enforcement the tools, it gives the judge the tools, so he or \nshe can make a rational decision about bond or a rational decision \nabout sentencing.\n  We need to make these records more accessible so law enforcement can \nkeep closer track of kids who have been convicted of violent crimes. \nThe tracking\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nprovision I wrote, along with Chairman Hatch and Senator Sessions, will \nhelp do this.\n  If a State uses Federal funds to upgrade their juvenile records under \nthis bill, all records of juvenile felonies will have to be accessible \nfrom the National Criminal Information Center. When it comes to making \nkey decisions about juvenile offenders, judges, probation officers, \npolice officers, need to make judgments based on the best possible \ninformation, and that is what this bill will give them.\n  One of my key priorities as a Senator, and as someone who started his \ncareer as a county prosecuting attorney in Greene County, Ohio, one of \nmy priorities is to make sure the Federal Government does more to help \nlaw enforcement. That is where the action is. Mr. President, 95 to 96 \npercent of all Federal prosecutions is done at the local level by \ncounties and States. They are the ones who do it--the police, the \nsheriffs' deputies, the local prosecutors. Anything we can do to help \nthem will make a difference.\n  Helping set up a good system of records, good information on juvenile \nfelons is one of the most important things we can possibly do to help \nthem do their jobs more effectively, and this bill does it.\n  Let me turn to a second provision. We need to provide incentives to \nlocal governments to coordinate the services they offer to the kids who \nare most at risk, kids who may have already gotten into a little \ntrouble, but who we believe can still be saved. This is prevention, and \nit is very, very important.\n  Here is the problem. Many times, juveniles who find themselves in \njuvenile court have multiple problems. Some of these problems may not \ncome to the attention of the juvenile court judge, or if they do come \nto his or her attention, many times that judge does not have the \nresources, does not have the ability to treat that young person.\n  For example, a child may have both a psychiatric disorder and a \nsubstance abuse problem. A child may have been sexually abused, a child \nmay have been physically abused, or any combination of four or five \nthings. Many times, juvenile courts do not have the resources to detect \nor appropriately address these types of multiple problems. As a result, \nfor too long, many children have been falling between the cracks of the \ncourt system. Many times these children are identified as the \n``juvenile court's child.'' Many times we refer to them as a ``children \nservices' child,'' or a local protection services agency child or maybe \nthe child is under the auspices of the mental health system and \nsometimes the substance abuse system.\n  What we aim to do under this provision is allow the local community \nto come together with the juvenile judge and coordinate all of these \nservices so that we can help these children. It is cost-effective and \nit is the right thing to do.\n  My proposal, which is included in this bill, will promote all across \nthis country an approach that has been very successful in Hamilton \nCounty, Ohio, near Cincinnati; an approach that gives our most \nproblematic children the multiple services they need under the overall \ncoordination of the court system. These kids should not fall victim to \nbureaucratic turf conflicts. All of these children are our children.\n  The purpose of this initiative is to leverage limited Federal, State \nand local agencies and community-based adolescent services to help fill \nthe large unmet need for adolescent mental health and substance abuse \ntreatment in the juvenile justice system.\n  One of the things I learned when I started as a county prosecutor was \nthat there is, in fact, many times a turf battle. There is a turf \nbattle that occurs between the criminal justice system, in this case \nthe juvenile justice system, the judge, his probation officer or her \nprobation officer, and the social services agency--children's service \nis what we call it in Ohio--that protects children, or maybe the local \nmental health agency or maybe the local substance abuse agency. We have \nmade progress in breaking down these walls, but what our provision in \nthis bill does is accelerates that process and that progress.\n\n  If you talk to the judges, if you talk to the substance abuse \ncounselors in most counties, they tell you there is a finite number of \nchildren who they have already identified who are the most problematic, \nwho have the most problems, who need the most resources, who, if we do \nnot deal with them now at the age of 13 or 14 or 15, are going to grow \nup and graduate into our adult system and are going to pose monumental \nproblems for society for the rest of their lives.\n  Bringing the resources of the community together in a coordinated \nfashion to address the needs of these children is the right thing to \ndo. We will not save all of them. We know that. But many of them can, \nin fact, be saved, and they can be saved if we care and if we approach \nthis issue from an intelligent point of view.\n  The juvenile judge is key because the juvenile judge has the ability \nto get the attention of that young person. The juvenile judge has the \nability to use the carrot and the stick in the sense of simply saying \nto the young person: Fine, if you don't want to go into drug treatment, \nI am going to commit you to the department of youth services for an \nindefinite period of time; I am going to put you, in essence, in \nprison. Or that judge can say to that young person: If you don't stay \nfree of drugs for the next 2 years, and we are going to monitor you \nevery 2 weeks and we are going to know whether you are on drugs or not \non drugs --that type of approach where the juvenile court works with \nthe substance abuse people, the experts in the field, or works with the \nmental health people. That coordination is absolutely essential when we \ndeal with our most problematic children.\n  The idea for this, as I indicated, came from Hamilton County, Ohio. \nThey have tried this. It works. They have identified 200, 300, 400 of \nthe most problematic children. They meet regularly to talk about these \nkids and what they can do to get services to them. There is only so \nmuch money available. There are only so many services that can be \nprovided. What we do with this provision is encourage local communities \nto get together and use that money in the most efficient and most \neffective way. It is the right thing to do. It is the most cost-\neffective thing to do.\n  In bringing this piece of legislation to the floor--and I \ncongratulate Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, Senator Sessions, Senator \nBiden, and all those who have worked on this bill--we are making an \nimportant contribution to meeting a major challenge facing our \ncommunities.\n  I have mentioned just two key initiatives that will help our \ncommunities meet these challenges. Over the last several days, I have \nbeen working with several of my colleagues, including the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Allard; the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions; the \nSenator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and others on other initiatives that \nwill help these children. These initiatives will be offered in the form \nof amendments over the next few days. These amendments will help, I \nbelieve, those people who are closest to troubled children--parents and \nteachers in particular.\n  I look forward to working on this bill and passing it and seeing it \nsigned into law. Will it solve all the problems with juveniles? Of \ncourse not. Will it prevent all the Littletons that may occur or other \ntragedies that we have seen? No, there is no guarantee of that, but we \ndo know, just to take one statistic, that the Littletons are replicated \nevery single day in this country, quietly, silently, but tragically, \nbecause on average 13 children die every day just because of contact \nwith guns. Most of them are homicides, a few of them are suicides, and \nsome are accidents. That does not include all the other children who \ndie violent deaths.\n\n  Our objective in this bill should be to try to reduce the number of \nchildren who die and who die needlessly. I believe we can do it. I \nbelieve we can make a difference.\n  We should not judge this bill, nor every amendment that is offered, \nby the test of would it have prevented one of the tragedies that is \nforemost in our minds. Some of the amendments would have, I think, but \nwe will never know.\n  A more rational approach and more logical approach is simply this: \nWill the amendment that is being debated or the provision we are \ntalking about or the bill itself save lives? I think the evidence is \nabundantly clear that this bill, as is written right now, will save \nlives. It will make a difference. I think we can improve it in the \ncourse of the next several days.\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, much of the Robb amendment (#325) to S. 254 \nis based on S. 976, the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, \nwhich I introduced this past Thursday, May 6, 1999. Furthermore, the \nRobb amendment does not include S. 976 in its entirety, but rather \nincludes portions of S. 976 along with several new provisions which I \nhave not yet had a chance to carefully consider in the context of other \nprovisions of S. 976. Therefore, I voted to table this amendment. As \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health which has jurisdiction \nover these Public Health Service programs, my intent is to allow the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions full consideration \nof S. 976.\n  I look forward to moving S. 976 through the normal legislative \nchannels to ensure that we pass a balanced, commonsense measure to \nprovide for greater flexibility in treatment services for children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5021-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5021-S5025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        STATE DMV DIRECTORS' VIEWS ON TITLE BRANDING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the American Association of Motor Vehicle \nAdministrators recently provided me with letters it has received from \nstate motor vehicle administrators across the country on title branding \nlegislation. As a collective group, DMV directors are looking to \nCongress to enact a balanced and responsible measure to combat title \nfraud. Legislation that is based on real world experience. Legislation \nthat they can implement.\n  As my colleagues know, I reintroduced the National Salvage Motor \nVehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655 back in March. This legislation \nis similar to the bipartisan title branding bill Senator Ford and I \ncoauthored during the 105th Congress. Legislation that received 57 \ncosponsors and which overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives \nwith some modifications last October.\n  S.655 is an appropriate legislative solution to a growing national \nproblem. A problem that costs millions of unsuspecting used car buyers \nbillions of dollars and places motorists in every state at risk. \nEveryday, severely damaged cars are put back together by unscrupulous \nrebuilders who sell these vehicles without disclosing their previous \ndamage history. They are able to shield the vehicle's history due to \nsignificant advances in technology and, in large part, because their is \na hodgepodge of titling rules throughout the nation. They take \nrepatched vehicles, or their titles, to states that have minimal or no \nsalvage vehicle rules and have them retitled with no indication that \nthe vehicle previously sustained significant damage.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act would help \ncurtail title washing by encouraging states to adopt a model title \nbranding program for salvage, rebuilt salvage, flood, and nonrepairable \nvehicles. The bill provides states with incentives to establish minimum \ntitling definitions and standards. This is key. It is particularly \naimed at that those states which need to bring their rules and \nprocedures to a universally accepted minimum standard.\n  In 1992, as part of the Anti-Car Theft Act, Congress mandated the \nestablishment of a Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration, and Salvage \nAdvisory Committee to devise a model salvage vehicle program. The \nSalvage Advisory Committee, led by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, issued its findings in February 1994. Its report \nrecommended specific uniform definitions and standards for severely \ndamaged passenger vehicles. It included a 75% damage threshold for \nsalvage vehicles, anti theft inspections for salvage vehicles before \nthey could be placed back on the road, and the permanent retirement of \nvehicles that are unsafe for operation and have no value except as a \nsource of scrap or parts. The report recommended the branding of titles \nas the most appropriate method for disclosing a severely damaged \nvehicle's prior history.\n  Mr. President, Senator Ford and I simply drafted legislation that \nwould largely codify the Salvage Advisory Committee's recommendations. \nRecommendations that encompassed the wisdom of all of the experts on \ntitling matters. This committee of key stakeholders, led by the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, provided real world solutions to address \ntitle fraud and automobile theft. Solutions based on state motor \nvehicle titling trends--uniform titling definitions and standards that \nstates would be willing to accept.\n  Senator Ford and I introduced a sound, reasonable, and appropriately \nbalanced measure during the 105th Congress. It did not take sides. It \ndid not codify the recommendations of one particular interest group. It \ndid not benefit one group at the expense of another. Instead, it \nreflected a balanced, bipartisan consensus. Even so, a number of \nsignificant changes were incorporated during the last Congress to \naccommodate the concerns raised by certain State Attorneys General, \nconsumer groups and others. I would like to highlight some of the \nrevisions made by me in a good faith effort to satisfy the concerns \nexpressed and to advance the bill.\n  The ``Salvage'' vehicle threshold was lowered from 80% to 75%--so \nthat if a late model vehicle has sustained damage exceeding 75 percent \nof its pre-accident value, it would be branded ``salvage. The bill also \nallowed a state to cover any vehicle regardless of its age.\n  The original bill did not allow conforming states to use synonymous \nterms. That has been stricken from the bill--so now states may use \nadditional terms to define damaged vehicles. For example, a state can \nuse the bill's ``nonrepairable\" definition and can also use another \nterm such as ``junk'' if it wants to have a different definition to \ndescribe parts only vehicles.\n  The revised bill included a new provision granting state attorney's \ngeneral the ability to sue on behalf of citizens victimized by fraud \nand to recover monetary judgements for consumers.\n  It included two new prohibited acts--failure to make a flood \ndisclosure and moving the vehicle or its title into interstate commerce \nto avoid the bill's requirements.\n  Another new provision makes it clear that the bill will not affect \nany private right of action available under state law.\n  The bill clearly established that states could provide additional \ndisclosures beyond those identified in the legislation.\n  At the request of Senator Hollings, a new provision was added \nregarding the Secretary of Transportation advising automobile dealers \nof the prohibition on selling vans as school buses.\n  Instead of penalizing states for non-participation by withholding \nNational Motor Vehicle Titling Information System (NMVTIS) funding, my \nbill now provides states with incentive grants to encourage their \nparticipation. This was a very good recommendation offered by the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation. It takes into account the fact that 20 or \nmore states will have received their NMVTIS funding by the time the \nbill becomes effective. These new grants can be used by participating \nstates to issue new titles, establish and administer theft or safety \ninspections, and enforce titling requirements.\n  This voluntary approach also gets around the very real concerns that \nstates and the Supreme Court have raised about Congress requiring \nstates to legislatively adopt federal regulations. Remember, motor \nvehicle titling has been, up to this point, almost exclusively a state \nfunction. This revised approach also overcomes the strong possibility \nthat preemptive federal titling rules and procedures would impose a \nsignificant federal unfunded mandate on states.\n\n  The revised bill also incorporates a change made by the House of \nRepresentatives last year which allows states to adopt an even lower \nsalvage threshold if it chooses. It simply does not start the threshold \nat 65% which, while advocated by some, has been expressly rejected by \nstates. I think it would be irresponsible for Congress to establish a \nminimum federal salvage threshold that is not in use anywhere and which \nstates have maintained that\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nthey do not want. S.655 provides a very reasonable compromise. Those \nwho want a lower salvage threshold than 75% are free to work with state \nlegislatures to convince them that a lower threshold in their states is \nwarranted.\n  Also, at the request of the National Association of Attorney's \nGeneral, S.655 includes provisions which require: the retail value of a \n``late model vehicle'' to be adjusted by the Secretary of \nTransportation every five years; flood vehicle inspections to be \nconducted by an independent party; and the Secretary's establishment of \na publicly accessible national record of conforming states.\n  Mr. President, I believe S.655 is the right legislative solution to \naddress title fraud. It creates a model program based on balanced \ntitling definitions and standards for salvage, rebuilt salvage, flood, \nand nonrepairable vehicles.\n  It does not violate the Supreme Court's rulings on federal versus \nstate roles and responsibilities. Instead it establishes a voluntary \ntitling framework.\n  It is not a federal unfunded mandate. Instead it provides states with \nseed money to encourage their participation.\n  It does not take away a state's NMVTIS funding or jeopardize the \nimplementation of this system. Instead, it fosters maximum state \nparticipation in this important national title information system.\n  It does not harm consumers who own low value vehicles or cause motor \nvehicles to be branded unnecessarily. Instead, it adopts the reasonable \nthresholds recommended by the Salvage Advisory Committee and it focuses \non severely damaged vehicles and pre-purchase disclosure.\n  It does not force otherwise repairable vehicles to be junked because \nof arbitrary thresholds. Instead, it subjects vehicles to a rational \nvehicle retirement standard based on a case-by-case determination. A \nstandard employed by California, Illinois, and a number of other \nstates.\n  It leaves intact state criminal penalties and causes of action \nwithout imposing significant additional burdens on the already \noverwhelmed federal court system.\n  Mr. President, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection \nAct is a sound, reasonable, and workable title branding measure. This \nis not just my opinion, but the view of state motor vehicle \nadministrators. These are the experts on the front line. The very \npeople who would be responsible for administering the provisions of the \nNational Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nseveral letters from state motor vehicle administrators on the issue of \ntitle branding legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask my colleagues to take heed of the wisdom offered by \nthe many DMV directors who submitted comments on S.655 and other title \nbranding proposals.\n  Congress needs to pass S.655, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle \nConsumer Protection Act, for America's used car buyers and motorists \nand for the people who have to administer titling rules.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                 Motor Vehicle Administrators,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 22, 1999.\n     To: Chief Motor Vehicle Administrators, Chief Law Enforcement \n         Officers\n     From: Kenneth M. Beam, President & CEO\n     Re: Introduction of Salvage Titling Legislation\n\n       I am pleased to report that Senator Trent Lott (R-MS) along \n     with 13 co-sponsors recently introduced S. 655, the National \n     Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act of 1999. This \n     bill establishes national uniform requirements regarding the \n     titling and registration of salvage, nonrepairable and \n     rebuilt vehicles. AAMVA has worked closely with Senator \n     Lott's staff to assure that the bill reflects AAMVA policy on \n     uniform salvage definitions and procedures.\n       For the most part this bill mirrors language in S. 852, \n     which was introduced by Senator Lott and supported by 57 \n     members of the Senate in the 105th Congress. However, there \n     are two major differences in S. 655 we would like to \n     highlight. First, the bill does not require that states who \n     receive federal funding from the Department of Justice for \n     the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) \n     to conform with the requirements of the bill or place a \n     notice on the certificate of title that their state is not in \n     compliance.\n       Second, the bill includes incentive grants for states that \n     do carry out its provisions. S. 655 authorizes $16 million to \n     states for fiscal year 2000. No state that is eligible for \n     the grant shall receive less than $250,000. The ratio shall \n     be apportioned in accordance with section 402, Title 23 of \n     the U.S. Code. Any state that receives a grant under this \n     section shall use the funds to carry out the provisions of \n     this bill including such performance related activities as \n     issuing titles, establishing and administering vehicle theft \n     or salvage vehicle safety inspections, enforcement and other \n     related purposes.\n       In addition, AAMVA has worked closely with other interested \n     organizations to respond to concerns raised by the National \n     Association of Attorneys General (NAAG). We are enclosing a \n     copy of our response to those concerns.\n       If you have questions or comments, please direct them to \n     either Linda Lewis, director of Public & Legislative Affairs \n     or Larry Greenberg, vice president, Vehicle Services at 703-\n     522-4200.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                 Motor Vehicle Administrators,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 31, 1999.\n     To: Chief Motor Vehicle Administrators, Chief Law Enforcement \n         Officers.\n     From: Kenneth M. Beam, President & CEO.\n     Re introduction of companion salvage titling legislation.\n\n       A copy of Senator Lott's salvage legislation, the National \n     Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655, was \n     recently forwarded to you for review and comment. AAMVA \n     strongly supports this version, which mirrors the Salvage \n     Advisory Committee's recommendations and current AAMVA \n     policy. On March 23, 1999, Senator Dianne Feinstein \n     introduced companion salvage legislation, the Salvaged and \n     Damaged Motor Vehicle Information Disclosure Act, S. 678. We \n     believe this bill will create a tremendous burden on \n     jurisdictions to implement and will increase complexity and \n     costs with regard to salvage definitions and standards \n     without any corresponding gains in uniformity. In addition, \n     many of its provisions are in conflict with AAMVA policy.\n       Many of AAMVA's concerns were addressed in the response to \n     the National Association of Attorneys General Working Group \n     (NAAG) who support similar provisions that are included in S. \n     678. Our comments to NAAG were included in the mailing dated \n     March 22, 1999. However, we feel it important to highlight a \n     few areas of major concern with S. 678. The bill: Establishes \n     a 65 threshold for salvage vehicles; establishes a 90% \n     nonrepariable threshold; establishes disclosure requirements \n     for vehicles sustaining $3,000 of damage suffered in one (1) \n     incident; requires states to comply with the legislation to \n     receive federal funding for NMVTIS; and does not include \n     incentive grants to states that implement the legislation as \n     included in S. 655.\n       AAMVA's comments to NSSG provide more detail on these and \n     other signs. Please review the companion legislation and \n     forward any comments or concerns you have with the bill to \n     Linda Lewis by April 15, 1999. Your comments will help ensure \n     that the Association accurately represents the positions of \n     state motor vehicle administrators. If you have any questions \n     about the bill, please direct them to Linda or Larry \n     Greenberg at 703-522-4200.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Maryland Motor\n\n\n                                       Vehicle Administration,\n\n                                  Glen Burnie, MD, April 12, 1999.\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Linda Lewis, AAMVA\n     From: Anne S. Ferro, Administrator\n     Re: National Salvage Act--SB 655\n\n       Attached please find Maryland's review of S. 655 as it \n     relates to salvage laws in our state. Based on the review by \n     several key program managers, we have affirmed Maryland's \n     support for this bill. Although numerous consumer advocate \n     groups and the National Association of Attorneys General \n     (NAAG) appear to oppose the bill, it is in the best interest \n     of law enforcement and consumers to have a bill that \n     establishes national uniform regulations governing salvage.\n       We oppose S. 678 introduced by Senators Feinstein and \n     Levin. As you state in your cover memo, the alternate salvage \n     bill has constraints which would be very difficult to \n     enforce.\n       Maryland also favors NMVTIS as the project will benefit law \n     enforcement and Motor Vehicle Administrations in combating \n     title fraud. Maryland is committing to re-evaluating its \n     participation in the program once the pilot program is up and \n     running. Our withdrawal from the project last year was due to \n     current costs involved and constraints relating to our title \n     and registration system as well as Y2K.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to voice our support for S. \n     655.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Thomas M. Walsh, Director, Driver and Vehicle Policies \n         and Programs\n     From: Eltra Nelson, Chuck Schaub, Victoria D. Whitlock\n     Date: April 7, 1999\n     Subj: AAMVA Legislative Alert: Introduction of S. 655: \n         National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act of \n         1999\n\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\n\n       As requested, we have reviewed the above-referenced Lott \n     Bill S. 655 and, although there are differences between \n     Maryland's laws relating to salvage vehicles and this bill, \n     we are generally in agreement with the goals of the proposed \n     legislation. As urged by Congress in the Anti Car Theft Act \n     of 1992, there needs to be more uniformity in state title \n     branding laws if we are to defer the criminal activities of \n     the fraudulent rebuilders, who are thriving under the current \n     patchwork system. We offer the following comments:\n       If Maryland intends to support this initiative, a decision \n     must be made on the best way to proceed, as Maryland's \n     current law is inconsistent with the provisions of the \n     federal bill. Guidance from the Attorney General's Office \n     would be helpful in charting our course.\n       Maryland MVA was one of the National Motor Vehicle Title \n     Information System's (NMVTIS) pilot states, but due to \n     technical problems (Y2K, plans to reengineer TARIS) we \n     temporarily discontinued participation. It is the MVA's \n     intention to resume participation once these problems are \n     resolved.\n       S. 655 definition 33301(a)(1) ``passenger motor vehicle'' \n     includes multi-purpose passenger vehicles, and certain trucks \n     including a pickup truck of not more than 10,000 pounds for \n     purposes of the salvage law. We agree with the rationale for \n     expanding the definition in the context of what constitutes a \n     ``salvage vehicle'' (see next bulleted item). MD TR law has \n     separate definitions (11-144.1, 11-136.1, 11-171, 11-176).\n       S. 655 term ``salvage vehicle'' 33301(a)(2) means any \n     ``passenger motor vehicle'' other than a flood vehicle or a \n     nonrepairable vehicle which has been wrecked, destroyed, or \n     damaged . . . Conversely, MD TR 11-152 definition of \n     ``salvage'' refers to ``any vehicle that has been damaged by \n     collision, fire, flood, accident, trespass, or other \n     occurrence.'' Flood and nonrepairable vehicles are defined \n     separately (3301(a)(6) and (12)) and do not qualify for a \n     salvage certificate. As recommended by the Federal Advisory \n     Committee, the definitions of salvage vehicles, nonrepairable \n     vehicles, and flood vehicles should be mutually exclusive to \n     promote consumer awareness and uniformity. The bill specifies \n     that once branded, a ``nonrepairable vehicle'' can never be \n     titled or registered for use on roads or highways. \n     (Comparably, Maryland vehicles branded ``Not Rebuildable, \n     Parts Only'' also cannot be converted into a title.) The bill \n     also specifies that to avoid subsequent branding as a ``flood \n     vehicle'', the owner or insurer must have the vehicle \n     inspected by an independent party.\n       S. 655 permits any individual or entity to certify the \n     amount of damage and costs of repairs to rebuild or \n     reconstruct. MD Law allows only insurance companies to make \n     this certification.\n       S. 655 ``late model vehicle'' means model year designation \n     of or later than the year in which the passenger motor \n     vehicle was wrecked, etc. or any of the six preceding years; \n     OR, has a retail value of more than $7,500. To be classified \n     as a salvage vehicle, the cost of repairs to rebuild or \n     reconstruct the vehicle must exceed 75 percent of the retail \n     value of the vehicle. Maryland brands vehicles less than 7 \n     years old when damage is greater than fair market value as \n     ``rebuilt salvage.'' Regarding the bill's 75 percent \n     threshold, we agree with AAMVA's rationale: ``. . . the rule \n     of thumb level of damage used by insurers in making a \n     determination of whether to `total' a wrecked vehicle is \n     damage that exceeds 75% of a vehicle's pre-accident value.'' \n     The bill permits states to use the term ``older model salvage \n     vehicle'' to designate a wrecked, destroyed, or damaged \n     vehicle that does not meet the definition of a ``late mode \n     vehicle.''\n       S. 655 (33302) requires states who receive funds under \n     33308 to disclose in writing on the certificate of title, \n     when ownership is transferred and when indicated by ``readily \n     accessible'' records, that the passenger motor vehicle was \n     previously issued a title that bore any word or symbol \n     signifying that the vehicle was ``salvage, older model \n     salvage, unrebuildable, parts only, scrap, junk, \n     nonrepairable, reconstructed, rebuilt, damaged by flood, and \n     the name of the State that issued that title.\n       Inspection decal--S. 655 requires the inspection official \n     to affix a permanent decal to the driver's door jam after a \n     passenger motor vehicle titled with a salvage title has \n     passed the state required inspections. According to Corporal \n     Dupczak, the Maryland State Police oppose the placement of a \n     decal, because it can be removed; however, the law specifies \n     the decal shall comply with the ``permanency requirements'' \n     established by the Secretary.\n       Disclosure and Label: S. 655 (33303) A person, prior to \n     transfer of ownership, shall give the transferee written \n     disclosure that the vehicle is a rebuilt salvage vehicle.

We agree with AAMVA's assessment that \n     this bill could be very problematic for states to implement, \n     for a variety of reasons. Michigan feels very strongly that \n     this bill should not move forward, and that any action on the \n     subject of Salvage Titling should follow the direction of the \n     AAMVA-sponsored Salvage bill (S. 655). However, given the \n     tight timeframes for response and our need to solicit input \n     from many areas of our Department, we have only had time for \n     a very cursory review of this legislation. If this bill has \n     any chance of moving forward, we would appreciate prompt \n     notification, so that we can prepare a more detailed summary \n     of our concerns and suggestions.\n       An over-riding problem with S. 678 is the lack of detail \n     regarding the specific requirements that would be imposed. In \n     its current version, S. 678 creates new terminology, \n     categories, enforcement requirements, and other \n     implementation language that seriously lacks detail with \n     regard to actual requirements. This type of approach would \n     leave definition of critical details up to the rules \n     promulgation process, which is a major timing problem in that \n     detailed concerns would not be addressed until after passage \n     of the bill.\n       The proposed changes appear to be quite complex, as well as \n     costly overall, and there is no provision for State funding. \n     In addition, many issues would require State legislation that \n     would be difficult to obtain, and difficult to implement, \n     without a corresponding need or significant improvement as \n     compared to the AAMVA-supported bill. Also, our Department is \n     unable to take on any new initiatives requiring major data \n     processing changes, due to Year 2000 and\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\n     other priorities, so these changes would frankly not be able \n     to be implemented in Michigan within any reasonable \n     timeframe.\n       Other more specific concerns include:\n       The companion bill would make substantial changes to \n     Michigan's current definitions of ``salvage'' and ``scrap'' \n     vehicles, adds requirements related to leased vehicles, and \n     includes a definition of ``flood'' vehicles different from \n     what AAMVA proposes. We see all of these issues as very \n     problematic for Michigan, requiring State legislation that \n     would prove difficult to pass, and would cause a variety of \n     problems from an implementation standpoint--including major \n     overhauls to our computer system, which is an unrealistic \n     expectation.\n       Sellers of salvage, flood, or non-repairable vehicles would \n     be required to provide written disclosure of these facts, \n     which would have to be signed by the seller and the buyer. \n     This is another issue that would require passage of State \n     legislation, and would also be very difficult from an \n     enforcement standpoint.\n       There are several potential title format issues, including \n     requirements for attachments, that we see as being unworkable \n     and quite difficult from an implementation standpoint.\n       As AAMVA has already pointed out, the new 65% threshold for \n     salvage vehicles and the disclosure requirement for damages \n     greater than $3,000 are both unworkable and unrealistic, \n     especially given current vehicle values. These portions of \n     the proposal also create problems related to those already \n     mentioned, such as title format and computer programming \n     issues, without providing a justifiable improvement to the \n     system.\n       This proposal also allows a person who rebuilds a salvage \n     or flood-damaged vehicle to certify its road-worthiness. This \n     raises conflict of interest concerns. (By comparison, \n     Michigan law requires a rebuilt salvage vehicle to be \n     inspected by a specially trained law enforcement officer.)\n       Again, Michigan feels very strongly that the Companion \n     Salvage Titling legislation introduced by Senator Feinstein \n     has serious flaws, lacks crucial detail regarding \n     implementation options, and poses nothing that would present \n     improvements to the Lott bill already introduced and \n     supported by AAMVA.\n       Please do whatever possible to ensure we are informed of \n     any positive action on this bill. If you need additional \n     details or have any questions on our position, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Judith Overbeek,\n\n                                        Deputy Secretary of State,\n     Service Delivery Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n         Office of Motor Vehicles, Department of Public Safety and \n           Corrections,\n                                     Baton Rouge, LA, May 3, 1999.\n     AAMVA, Arlington, VA.\n\n     Attention: Linda Lewis\n\n       Dear Ms. Lewis: In regard to the Salvaged and Damaged Motor \n     Vehicle Information Disclosure Act. S. 678, the State of \n     Louisiana has very serious concerns regarding many \n     provisions, as follows:\n       The 65% threshold for salvage vehicles.\n       Definitions regarding non-repairable and major damage.\n       Secure paper disclosure requirements.\n       Lack of grant funds for implementation.\n       We believe that Louisiana has a good salvage title law in \n     place. As a state that has been branding salvage and rebuilt \n     vehicles for a number of years, it is frustrating to see \n     legislation that will result in problems for our state. We've \n     come so far in this area, the thought of increasing an \n     already complex, cumbersome procedure is disturbing. This Act \n     is another attempt to ``punish the bad guys'' with something \n     that will, in reality, only ``punish the good guys.''\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond, and I know you \n     will convey our opinion that this legislation will not \n     increase uniformity among the jurisdictions. It will merely \n     place unnecessary burdens on state agencies who are already \n     force to ``do more with less'' and trying to eliminate \n     bureaucratic red tape, not create it.\n       Please keep us posted of any additional developments \n     regarding this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kay Covington,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  S. 678--Salvage and Damaged Motor Vehicle Information Disclosure Act\n\n       No grant monies include, provision that if State does not \n     comply State may not receive grant funds under 30503(c).\n       Definitions: Salvage--65% damage of retail value*; Non-\n     Repairable--90% damage of retail value; and Major Damage--\n     $3000.00 damage on one incident.\n       *Salvage can also be defined when designated by owner or \n     when vehicle is transferred to insurance carrier in \n     connection with damage.\n       Disclosure Requirement: Requires States to place a \n     disclosure on title, within one year of passage of law, \n     stating whether vehicle is salvage, flood damaged, non-\n     repairable or substained major damage.\n       Disclosure must be on secure paper and must be treated like \n     the conforming title and odometer law.\n       Dealers and lessors must retain disclosure for 5 years.\n       State must be notified of all vehicles that are \n     unrepairable.\n       Requirements for Rebuilt Vehicles: (1) Certification of \n     inspection from rebuilder stating condition of vehicle (must \n     be on secure paper), and\n       (2) decal placed on door jam stating.\n       Non-Repairable cannot go back on road.

This legislation \n     is companion legislation to the National Salvage Motor \n     Vehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655, introduced by \n     Senator Lott.\n       Referring to S. 678 introduced by Senator Feinstein, the \n     New York State Department of Motor Vehicles agrees with the \n     concerns raised by AAMVA in their response to the National \n     Association of Attorneys General Working Group (NAAG), \n     specifically: The 65% threshold for damage in order to \n     declare a vehicle a salvage vehicle; the 90% non-repairable \n     threshold; the $3,000 limit of damages attributable to one \n     (1) incident; the requirement of compliance in order to \n     receive federal funding for NMVTIS; and the lack of incentive \n     grants for states that implement the legislation.\n       The 65% threshold for damage in order to declare a vehicle \n     a salvage vehicle is much lower than the 75% that we \n     established through extensive discussions with the insurance \n     industry and others in New York. Further, it is also lower \n     than the recommendation made by the Presidential Commission \n     established in 1992 from the Anti-Car Theft Act.\n       Due to the ever-rising expense of owning a new vehicle, the \n     $3,000 limit for damages attributable to one (1) incident \n     would result in a remarkably high number of vehicles labeled \n     as salvage. With the average cost of a new vehicle \n     approximately $22,000, a $3,000 limit for damages is less \n     than 15%.\n       Lastly, Senator Feinstein's proposal requires states to \n     comply in order to receive funding for NMVTIS and does not \n     include incentive grants for states implementing the \n     legislation. The Lott proposal does not call for compliance-\n     based NMVTIS funding, and does offer incentive grants for \n     implementation.\n       In short, the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles \n     does not support the Salvaged and Damaged Motor Vehicle \n     Information Disclosure Act, S. 678 introduced by Senator \n     Dianne Feinstein, due to the concerns identified above.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Richard E. Jackson, Jr.,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                    Idaho DMV,\n\n                                                   April 15, 1999.\n     Lewis, Linda,\n     `lindal@aamva.org'.\n\n     Subject: S. 678 Diane Feinstein Proposal\n\n       Idaho's current statutes do not conform to the requirements \n     of S. 678, and it is unlikely that legislation could be \n     enacted to conform. Therefore, funding to implement NMVTIS in \n     Idaho would be jeopardized.\n       It appears that he documentation requirements of S. 678 are \n     onerous, much more all-inclusive than the implementation of \n     the secure power of attorney processes. If disclosure \n     documents are required to issue every title transfer, many \n     transactions would be delayed, customers would be turned away \n     and inconvenienced. Public perception of the DMV would \n     suffer.\n       We are also concerned about the public resistance to non-\n     registration of vehicles that have sustained damage that is \n     90% of the fair retail market value before it was damaged. \n     For many older vehicles one dent would require that the \n     vehicle go the crusher, even though it may be a fully \n     operational and safe vehicle.\n                                                 Edward R.

A late model luxury car \n     could have very minimal damage with $3,000 repair costs, \n     while an old economy car could be considered nonrepairable \n     with $3,000 damage.\n       Like the Lott bill, salvage is defined both as a percentage \n     of fair market value (65% in S. 678 and 75% in S. 655) and \n     anything an insurance company pays a claim on and acquires \n     ownership of. The Lott bill excludes theft recoveries unless \n     damaged 75%. When we worked on Wisconsin's title branding \n     law, insurance companies were very upset at salvage-branding \n     what they called ``convenience totals.'' The insurance \n     industry will probably object to that in these bills, too.\n\n\n                               disclosure\n\n       S. 678 requires: written disclosure on secure paper of \n     salvage, flood, nonrepairable or major damage (plus a \n     description of each occurrence--attached to the title. Each \n     reassignment needs its own disclosure statement. We've been \n     trying to avoid attachments to the title and make all \n     required disclosures on the title itself.\n       It looks like the disclosure statement could be made in the \n     title assignment area if the format conforms with federal \n     regulations (when they are promulgated).\n       It appears we'd need to have the attached disclosures \n     whether or not there is something to disclose, which could \n     mean lots of go-backs for incomplete applications.\n\n\n                       rebuilding and inspection\n\n       The restrictions imposed by this bill would seem to \n     significantly reduce interest in rebuilding flood or salvage \n     vehicles. The rebuilder is also the inspector in this bill \n     and he or she must: Sign and attach to the title, a secure \n     inspection certificate attesting that ``original manufacturer \n     established repair procedures or specifications'' were \n     followed in making the repairs and inspections; affix a decal \n     to the door jamb or other conspicuous place; follow \n     ``regulations promulgated'' describing qualifications and \n     equipment required to do inspection certifications; follow \n     ``regulations promulgated'' that establish minimum steps for \n     inspection; and post up to a $250,000 bond (if required) to \n     protect the public against unsafe or inadequate repairs or \n     improper inspection certification.\n       So, the person who repairs a flood or salvage vehicle also \n     inspects it for safety and quality of repair--but not anti-\n     theft. There doesn't seem to be a provision for anti-theft \n     inspection.\n\n\n                         nonrepairable vehicles\n\n       Nonrepairable vehicles can't be registered and can only be \n     transferred to an insurance company, automotive recycler or \n     dismantler--and only for the purpose of dismantling or \n     crushing.\n       So, the owner of a classic car that's damaged more than 90% \n     of its fair market value has no choice but to have it \n     dismantled or crushed--even if willing to pay whatever it \n     costs to get it back to legal operating condition.\n\n\n                               penalties\n\n       A civil penalty of up to $2,000 may be charged for ``a \n     violation''--the violation doesn't have to be ``knowingly and \n     willfully'' performed.\n       However, if it is ``knowingly and willfully'' performed, \n     the penalty is the $2,000 fine, or three years in prison, or \n     both.\n\n\n                             miscellaneous\n\n       We'd have to revise any of our laws that are inconsistent \n     with this. We would be able to keep our other brands \n     (manufacturer buyback, police, taxi, non-USA standard and \n     insurance claim--if we revised the percentage to 30-65% \n     damage).\n       Thank you for this opportunity to offer comments on the \n     ``Salvaged and Damaged Motor Vehicle Information Disclosure \n     Act.'' On behalf of the Wisconsin DMV, I hope our ideas prove \n     useful.

Below is a listing of problems observed.\n       1. The bill establishes a 65% threshold for salvage \n     vehicles. Alabama has a 75% threshold to determine when a \n     vehicle is declared salvage. In addition, the proposed \n     legislation states that ``if the full cost of the damages \n     suffered in 1 incident is attributable only to cosmetic \n     damages, those damages shall not constitute major damage.'' \n     Alabama has no such exemption for cosmetic damage when \n     determining whether a vehicle qualifies as a salvage vehicle.\n       2. The bill has a specific definition for a ``flood \n     vehicle.'' Alabama law does not distinguish between salvage \n     vehicles that have been declared salvage due to flood damage \n     and vehicles that have been declared salvage due to other \n     events. Vehicles that suffer flood damage in Alabama are \n     subject to the 75% threshold for a salvage vehicle and \n     receive a salvage title if damage to the vehicle is equal to \n     or greater than 75% of the retail value for the vehicle. \n     Alabama law does not require a vehicle to be branded as a \n     ``flood vehicle.''\n       3. The bill provides a definition for a leased vehicle that \n     differentiates the vehicle from a non-leased motor vehicle. \n     Alabama law makes no such distinction.\n       4. The written disclosure requirements mandated by the bill \n     would be difficult to comply with when transfers involves \n     repossessions, disposal of an abandoned motor vehicles, \n     situations where ownership passes as a result of the death of \n     an owner, non-voluntary transfers by operation of law and \n     other situations where the transferor may not have personal \n     knowledge of previous vehicle damage.\n       5. The bill's prescribed use of a secure power of attorney \n     could prove to be burdensome in situations where there was a \n     transfer between individuals who do not have access to the \n     secure document.\n       6. The bill would be an unfunded mandate that would require \n     a costly re-design of the Alabama certificate of title and \n     the design and implementation of a new secure power of \n     attorney document and secure inspection form. Additional \n     costs would include: training costs for designated agents and \n     reprogramming costs for county offices, automobile dealers, \n     financial institutions, and insurance companies.\n       7. The disclosure requirements in the bill do not address \n     vehicle damage that occurred prior to the proposed \n     implementation date of the legislation. Therefore, it is \n     unlikely that this information would not be readily \n     accessible to transferor of the vehicle for a subsequent \n     disclosure statement.\n       8. The bill does not clearly specify who is responsible for \n     conducting a rebuilt salvage vehicle inspection.\n       In summary, the bill would be an administrative nightmare \n     for the State of Alabama to implement. In addition, based \n     upon the past experience of implementing the federal truth in \n     mileage act, the gains in uniformity among states would be \n     minimal for a substantial period of time and the costs would \n     be both immediate and significant.

Mr. President. I am dismayed to report to the Senate \nthat the situation in East Timor continued to deteriorate over the \nweekend. The violence has become so bad that courageous human rights \nactivists, lawyers, health workers and others have been forced to go \ninto hiding. There are reports that thousands of East Timorese are \ntrapped inside what one observer has called a ``concentration camp.''\n  This situation comes on the heels of several new developments. Last \nweek, we had the unfortunate and ironic coincidence of several events \non one day, Wednesday, May 5. On that day, the governments of Portugal \nand Indonesia, under the auspices of the United Nations, signed an \nagreement regarding the modalities of the planned August 8, 1999, vote \non autonomy in East Timor. On that same day, the New York Times \npublished a very significant op-ed by a key human rights lawyer, \nAniceto Guterres Lopes, while at the same time, his house was \nsurrounded by armed militias. And, still on the same day, I and several \nother Senators introduced S. Res. 96, a resolution to push for the \nGovernment of Indonesia to make a top priority the disarming of the \nvery militias that seem to be terrorizing the region, among other \nactions.\n  Mr. President, on Sunday, May 9, 1999, the Washington Post published \nan excellent article that explains in horrifying detail just how bad \nthe situation has become in East Timor. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the article be printed in the Record, and I thank the \nChair.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 1999]\n\nA Campaign of Terror; Army-Backed Militias Use Violence to Sway Vote on \n                         E. Timor Independence\n\n                         (By Keith B. Richburg)\n\n       The Indonesian military, through armed surrogates and \n     paramilitary groups, is using intimidation, violence and the \n     forced relocation of thousands of people to ensure that \n     residents of East Timor do not vote for independence in a \n     referendum Aug. 8, according to relief workers, human rights \n     groups, Western military analysts and independent reporting \n     here.\n       The actions of the paramilitary groups stand in sharp \n     contrast to the central government's commitment in a U.N.-\n     brokered agreement last week to allow East Timor's 800,000 \n     people to choose their own future in a referendum, even if \n     they decide to sever ties with Indonesia and become the \n     world's newest independent nation. The government promised a \n     free and fair vote.\n       Hundreds of Timorese independence activists have been \n     killed or have gone into hiding after receiving death threats \n     from army-backed militias. The main independence group, the \n     National Council for Timorese Resistance has been wiped out \n     in the capital, Dili; its downtown office is shut and its \n     leaders are on the run. Militia members armed with machetes \n     and homemade rifles roam the streets, carrying what is \n     believed to be a death list with the names of prominent \n     activists, human rights lawyers and even Catholic priests.\n       And in the most ominous sign yet that the military intends \n     to engineer the outcome of the vote, 20,000 people have been \n     herded from their mountain villages and are being held in \n     this town as virtual hostages of the militia--creating a \n     captive bloc of votes in favor of Timor remaining a part of \n     Indonesia. Each day, the men are separated from the women, \n     are forced to stand and sing the Indonesian national anthem \n     and to wear red-and-white armbands and scarves, the colors of \n     the Indonesian flag.\n       The police say these people are refugees fleeing the pro-\n     independence guerrillas in the hills, who have been waging a \n     low-level insurgency against Indonesian occupation for 24 \n     years. But local relief workers in Dili--no foreign aid \n     workers are allowed here--say they have been barred from \n     traveling to Liquica to check on the condition of these \n     people, who are living in makeshift tents, under tarps or in \n     abandoned buildings. What little food they have is provided \n     by the local government, and water is scarce.\n       Last week, a small group of reporters was allowed into \n     Liquica to see the detainees and take pictures. But \n     interviews outside the presence of the police or militia were \n     forbidden, and most of the people seemed too frightened to \n     speak. A few times, someone in the crowd shouted to the \n     journalists a line not in the official script--one shouted, \n     for example, that they did not have enough to eat--but they \n     were quickly silenced by militia members who raced into the \n     crowds after them.\n       The police commander for East Timor, Col. Timbul Silaen, \n     had said in Dili earlier that reports of people being held \n     captive in Liquica were untrue. ``At most, there are 100 \n     [people being held], and they are from the pro-independence \n     faction,'' he said in an interview.\n\n\n                       Like a Concentration Camp\n\n       But when journalists arrived in Liquica, they saw what \n     appeared to be at least 20,000 people. The Liquica police \n     commander, Lt. Col. Adios Salova, put the number at 10,000, \n     but he insisted, ``They can go back to their homes if they \n     want.''\n       ``They've got Liquica like a concentration camp,'' said Dan \n     Murphy, an American physician from Iowa working at a church-\n     run clinic in Dili. ``They need help. These people are in \n     desperate shape. . . . They're just sitting out in the open. \n     It's a perfect setup for massive amounts of death'' from \n     disease, with so many people without access to clean water \n     and medical care.\n       Other Timorese relief workers said the kind of forced \n     relocation seen in Liquica is being repeated on a large scale \n     elsewhere in the territory. The goal, they said, appears to \n     be to hold the detainees captive until the referendum, to \n     create a large bloc of voters who will support a government-\n     sponsored package that would give broad autonomy to East \n     Timor, but keep it as a part of Indonesia.\n       ``Their plan is to keep the people there and make sure they \n     vote for'' autonomy, said Estanislau Martins, an official of \n     the Catholic charity Caritas.\n       East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, has been a \n     nettlesome problem for Indonesia since its troops invaded in \n     1975 on the pretext of stopping a civil war between rival \n     Timorese factions. East Timor was annexed the following year \n     as a province of Indonesia, but the United Nations never \n     recognized the annexation.\n       For much of the past 24 years, Indonesia refused to budge \n     on recognizing Timorese demands for independence. Displays of \n     defiance were crushed, including a series of army massacres \n     that are now etched in the psyche of Timorese. Human rights \n     groups and Timorese activists estimate the conflict has \n     killed as many as 200,000 Timorese. But for the most part, \n     Timor has simmered on the back burners of international \n     diplomacy.\n       All that changed this year, when President B.J. Habibie, \n     who took power last May after the fall of longtime ruler \n     Suharto, suddenly announced that Timorese could have \n     independence if they rejected one last, broadened autonomy \n     offer.\n       But while the civilian government in Jakarta was eager to \n     rid itself of the East Timor problem, the Indonesian military \n     apparently has other concerns. Senior military officers are \n     known to fear that granting the territory independence will \n     fuel separatist movements across the sprawling archipelago, \n     particularly in the mineral-rich province of Irian Jaya, and \n     in the troubled, Muslim fundamentalist-dominated province of \n     Aceh on Sumatra Island. Troops have been fighting \n     insurgencies in both those provinces, and the rebels have \n     been emboldened by the government's concessions to the \n     Timorese.\n       ``It's national unity, and fear of national \n     disintegration,'' said a Western military analyst.\n       The armed forces created the militias ostensibly to help \n     keep the peace. But Timorese activists, human rights lawyers, \n     and Western military analysts point to a more sinister \n     purpose--to use them to create the appearance of a civil war \n     in East Timor, while embarking on a campaign to terrorize and \n     intimidate enough people to ensure a vote against \n     independence.\n\n\n                           weapons of terror\n\n       In recent weeks, the militias have rampaged unchecked in \n     East Timor, killing and maiming suspected independence \n     supporters and sympathizers. ``Ever since [Secretary of \n     State] Madeleine Albright came [in March], it's been \n     terrible,'' said Murphy, the American physician. ``Since \n     then, they've decided to take a hard line, and bring out all \n     the weapons of terror and intimidation.''\n       The most brazen attack was here in Liquica on April 6, when \n     militiamen stormed a Catholic church sheltering hundreds of \n     refugees. Tear gas forced the refugees into the open, where \n     they were shot and hacked with axes and machetes; human \n     rights groups recorded 57 deaths.\n       On the weekend of April 17, militias rampaged through Dili, \n     driving out most of the independence supporters after a rally \n     at the offices of Timor's Jakarta-appointed governor. The \n     militia members burned down homes and shops in Dili's Becora \n     market area, injuring scores of people.\n       ``The militia is the military; they didn't do this on their \n     own,'' said a man named Mateus, whose house was spared but \n     who saw his neighbors' houses reduced to smoldering rubble. \n     ``We saw their cars, and behind them was the military.''\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\n       The Western military analyst agreed that the armed forces \n     control the militias, and are using them as surrogates. \n     ``There's a big disconnect between what the leadership in \n     Jakarta is saying and what's going on on the ground,'' he \n     said. ``If [Defense Minister Wiranto] was unhappy with what's \n     going on in East Timor, he would have fired some people.''\n       There are now at least 13 militia groups in East Timor, one \n     for each of the territory's 13 districts, with names like Red \n     and White Iron and Aitarak. The Western military analyst said \n     the number now could be as high as 20. The Dili police \n     commander, Col. Timbul, said each militia has about 5,000 \n     members.\n       One tactic of the militia groups is intimidation of \n     independence supporters. Militia posts have been set up just \n     yards from the homes of human rights activists and other \n     independence sympathizers.\n       Last Wednesday night, the Portuguese consul general in \n     Jakarta, Ana Gomes, telephoned journalists in Dili to tell \n     them that the Aitarak militia had surrounded the home of a \n     prominent human rights lawyer, Aniceto Gutteres Lopes, \n     director of the Legal Aid, Human Rights and Justice \n     Foundation. The journalists, arriving in taxis just before \n     midnight, found about two dozen militiamen outside Gutteres' \n     empty home.\n       Gutteres and his family were discovered hiding in his back \n     yard. He whispered to the reporters to stay and make sure he \n     was not found, and to try to persuade the militia that he was \n     not at home. He escaped, and has gone into hiding.\n       That episode was not unique; dozens of independence \n     supporters, human rights workers and others have been \n     threatened, have fled East Timor or have gone into hiding. \n     Those who remain say they sleep in different houses each \n     night.\n       Relief workers and foreign military analysts in Jakarta say \n     the militias have a death list, with the names of prominent \n     independence sympathizers to be killed between now and the \n     vote, to guarantee the result the military brass prefers.\n       Matins, of Caritas relief agency, said he knows his name is \n     on the list. ``It's all the key persons they say have to be \n     killed,'' he said, cowering in his office after receiving an \n     early morning warning of an imminent attack.\n       ``They believe if they kill them all, they can win the \n     elections.'' He said four priests are on the list, including \n     the Rev. Francisco Barreto who heads the Caritas office. A \n     man stands in front of bullet holes that riddled his home \n     during an attack by a militia group in the East Timor town of \n     Liquica. The militias, who are believed to have the support \n     of the Indonesian armed forces, also rounded up an estimated \n     20,000 villagers who are being detained in the town. Members \n     of this family are among thousands of East Timorese being \n     held in tents and abandoned buildings in Liquica. It is \n     believed that they will be pressured to vote against \n     independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5027-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAX FREEDOM DAY\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am here today because finally, Tax Freedom \nDay has arrived--the day the average American has earned enough income \nto cover his or her Federal, State and local taxes for the year. Only \ntoday--after one-third of the year has already passed--have our working \nmen and women earned enough money to pay their taxes for the year! This \nis truly amazing, and it is also truly wrong.\n  Tax Freedom Day has moved successively later into the year for the \npast 7 years, as the Federal Government seeks to claim a larger and \nlarger portion of the American family income. Since 1993, Federal tax \nrevenues have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. And \nlast year alone, Federal revenues grew 80 percent faster than personal \nincome.\n  Florida's Tax Freedom Day is even later--Floridians will not finish \nearning enough to pay their taxes for the year until Friday, May 14. \nThey also shoulder the 5th heaviest total tax burden in the country.\n  In 1999, Federal, State and local governments are projected to \ncollect an average of $10,298 in tax revenue for every person in the \ncountry. This year, the Federal Government will collect more tax \nrevenue as a share of GDP--that is 20.7 percent--than at any time since \n1944. This is the highest level in peacetime history.\n  If that isn't enough to put the high Federal tax take into \nperspective, let me share with you a few examples of just how much \ntaxes impede our freedom every day of the year.\n  I brought with me a daily tax clock to illustrate just how many \ndifferent times we are taxed in ways we may not even realize. Think \nabout the different things you do in the course of your average day. \nPlanning your family's summer vacation? Forty percent of the cost of an \nairline ticket is taxes! When you drive to and from work today, 54 \npercent of the price of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. Did you call \nyour mother on Mother's Day? Fifty percent of the cost of your phone \nbill is due to taxes.\n  Taxes infringe on our freedom--our freedom to work, our freedom to \ninvest and our freedom to provide for our families. It is more apparent \nthan ever that the mammoth Federal Government we have created will \nnever be satisfied--if there is money to be had, the Federal Government \nwill take it.\n  That is why it is more important than ever to provide tax relief to \nour families. We have a balanced budget, and soon we will be working \nwith a Federal surplus. If the Federal Government has its way, this \noverpayment of taxes by the American people will be spent in Washington \non new Federal programs.

Mr. President, twice, the Senate has failed to invoke \ncloture on the Social Security Lock Box. I am a cosponsor of this \nimportant amendment and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in \nsupport for a Social Security lock box.\n  For several years, Congress has taken all the money out of the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund and spent it on other programs. In fact, through \nthe end of last year, Congress has taken over $730 billion out of the \ntrust fund and spent it all on other programs.\n  I believe that it is wrong to spend Social Security Trust Fund money \non other programs. If a private corporation were to take money out of \nan employees' pension plan and spend it on something else, the \nexecutives of that corporation would, under Congress' own laws, be \nsubject to prosecution and imprisonment. Why do we allow Congress to \nraid Social Security, the pension fund for all Americans?\n  Each time our government takes money out of the Social Security Trust \nFunds, it incurs a debt to these funds. To date, the government has \nincurred total debts of over $730 billion to the Social Security Trust \nFunds. The debts owed to these funds are included in the calculation of \nour total national debt which now stands at roughly $5.5 trillion. This \ndebt, along with the program's massive unfunded liabilities, will \nultimately have to be paid by future taxpayers.\n  The lock box proposal would ban Congress from spending Social \nSecurity Trust Fund monies on other programs (unless there is a super-\nmajority vote to do so). Those who oppose the lockbox proposal want to \ncontinue spending Social Security Trust Funds on other new and \nunrelated programs.\n  While I believe that we need to take other steps to protect Social \nSecurity, I nevertheless believe that this lockbox provision is an \nimportant first step in ensuring the long-term fiscal health of our \nnation. By making it more difficult to spend Social Security Trust \nFunds on other programs, we will make it easier for ourselves to meet \nour obligation to Social Security in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5027-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5027-S5028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the historic \nlegislation passed in the Senate last week, S.900, Financial Services \nModernization Act. I want to again commend Chairman Phil Gramm, the \nSenator from Texas for the outstanding work that he did leading us \nthrough the process of passing that landmark piece of banking reform \nlegislation. Senator Gramm is perhaps the most knowledgeable person on \nU.S. banking law. He was diligent in seeing that the action began last \nyear in the Banking Committee came to fruition this year. He also took \nto heart the admonition we've given to the entire banking community to \nkeep things in plain English. He simplified last year's bill, reduced \nit from 308 pages to 150 pages. Before we\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nbegan the debate on the Senate floor, he even had to undergo a massive \ndemonstration at his house that was aimed not only at him, but at his \nwife. Which brings me to the subject I wanted to discuss--the Community \nReinvestment Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unamious consent that the May 11, 1999, article \nin the Wall Street Journal by former Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence \nB. Lindsey be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. Lindsey points out quite correctly that the CRA \nprovisions in S.900 are very modest. In spite of this, I continue to be \namazed that the Administration and its supporters have demonized the \nbill because of the minor changes it makes to the Community \nReinvestment Act, CRA. Yes, included in the bill are changes to the \nCRA. However, it does not dismantle, destroy or otherwise diminish the \nCRA. In fact, the amendments included in the bill should only \nstrengthen the legitimacy of CRA.\n  You wouldn't suspect this, though, from the comments of the \nAdministration. They claim that these provisions would utterly destroy \nthe CRA. Since the Administration does not support the bill's structure \nthat favors the Federal Reserve over the Treasury Department, they have \ninstead garnered opposition to the bill over the CRA issue. They have \ngotten the community development industry to oppose a bill that the \nAdministration opposes primarily because it does not expand the banking \npolicy authority of the executive branch.\n  What I have become concerned about is a government policy that \nencourages a bank, as Lawrence Lindsay stated, ``to simply pay for a \nproblem to go away.'' S.900 attempts to correct the abuse of the CRA by \ndeclaring a bank in compliance with the law if it has earned a \n``satisfactory'' rating for three consecutive years. It would require \nindividuals or groups to present some form of evidence to the contrary \nin order to prevent a merger or acquisition. This will help eliminate \nextortion, which only amounts to lining the pockets of a few select \nindividuals. It should help ensure that the CRA is preserved for \nhelping the communities instead of funding the extortionists.\n  I urge all to read the whole Wall Street Journal editorial.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mary 11, 1999]\n\n                Clinton's Cynical War on Banking Reform\n\n                        (By Lawrence B. Lindsey)\n\n       Last week the Senate passed a bill over-hauling the \n     regulation of banks, including a provision sponsored by Sen. \n     Phil Gramm (R., Texas), chairman of the Banking Committee, to \n     reform the Community Reinvestment Act. Mr. Gramm's provision \n     has stirred controversy, to say the least. Last month \n     hundreds of ``community activists'' descended on his house, \n     where they pounded on the windows, trampled the landscaping \n     and left the yard covered with garbage.\n       The 20-year-old CRA requires banks to serve their entire \n     community. Regulators take banks' CRA compliance into account \n     when deciding whether to approve applications for mergers or \n     expanded services. In the recent wave of bank consolidation, \n     banks have made billions of dollars of loan commitments and \n     signed agreements with numerous community organizations in \n     order to be seen as complying with CRA.\n\n\n                          Heavy-Handed Tactics\n\n       Sen. Gramm has complained that many of these payments \n     amount to little more than extortion sanctioned by federal \n     bank regulators, a claim bolstered by the protesters' \n     behavior at the senator's house. While the great majority of \n     CRA activity is legitimate, some banks and their executives \n     have been subjected to similar personalized and heavy-handed \n     tactics with a demand that they sign agreements that, in \n     effect, fund the protesters. Other banks find their mergers \n     held up by legalistic protests until they pay up.\n       I helped write the current CRA regulations when I was a \n     governor of the Federal Reserve, and I part company with Mr. \n     Gramm on the degree to which the CRA encourages extortion. In \n     fact, those regulations, implemented in 1996, were designed \n     to reduce the potential rewards for such behavior. Most \n     bankers and community development professionals agree that \n     the regulations have been successful in that regard. Yet I \n     think Mr. Gramm is getting a bum rap.\n       Mr. Gramm's proposed reforms are quite modest. You wouldn't \n     know it, though, from listening to the Clinton administration \n     and its supporters. President Clinton himself attacked the \n     Gramm proposal in a February meeting with the nation's \n     mayors. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the Rev. Jesse \n     Jackson and Ralph Nader all joined the chorus. The attack \n     strategy worked. Regulators with whom I spoke said they \n     believed Mr. Gramm was out to destroy CRA, although when \n     pressed, they admitted they didn't know the details of his \n     proposal.\n       When I spoke to a group of community-development \n     professionals, there was stunned silence when I described how \n     mild Mr. Gramm's proposals actually are. First, he proposes \n     that a bank that has earned ``satisfactory'' ratings from the \n     regulators for three years running be presumed in compliance \n     with the law, unless evidence is presented to the contrary.\n       Second, he proposes that small rural banks be exempt from \n     CRA. The banks that would be excluded under this plan have a \n     total of 2.8% of all U.S. bank assets; the banks with the \n     remaining 97.2% would remain subject to CRA. When we wrote \n     the current CRA regulations, we recognized the burden they \n     placed on small banks and carved out a streamlined \n     examination procedure for them. Mr. Gramm takes this \n     principle only a little further.\n       Why, then, is the administration demonizing Mr. Gramm? As \n     with similar disinformation campaigns in the past, the attack \n     is meant to draw attention away from an issue on which the \n     administration is vulnerable. What is really at stake here is \n     a separate provision of the banking-reform bill, concerning \n     the question of which agency should regulate most banks--the \n     Fed, which is independent of the administration, or the \n     comptroller of the currency, who reports to the Treasury \n     secretary. Mr. Gramm's bill, which passed on a near-party-\n     line vote, favors the Fed.\n       Such a bureaucratic turf struggle is not the stuff over \n     which nonbureaucrats go to the barricades. So the \n     administration has instead rallied the troops with a campaign \n     of exaggeration about the CRA. In short, the community-\n     development industry is being used as a pawn by the \n     administration in a power struggle with the Fed.\n       The worst part of this is that the community-development \n     industry is finally coming of age. All around the country, \n     community-development professionals are engaged in exciting \n     partnership with forprofit organizations to rebuild the \n     physical and social infrastructure of some of America's \n     blighted areas. The best of these are run in a very \n     professional and businesslike fashion; their management teams \n     could compete with any in corporate America.\n       Unfortunately, much of the industry is still quite \n     insecure, with deep memories of being caught between \n     widespread private-sector indifference and an unresponsive \n     federal bureaucracy led by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development. And some of the more flamboyant leaders in \n     community development, who cut their teeth in the radicalism \n     of the 1960s, are quick to lead protest marches and \n     demonstrate their feelings. They have been coopted as \n     unwitting foot soldiers in bigger wars, such as the \n     Comptroller-Fed battle and the feud between the mortgage-\n     insurance industry and the secondary mortgage market.\n       In the long run, there is no alternative to a zero-\n     tolerance policy with regard to extortion in CRA or the type \n     of protest that occurred at Sen. Gramm's house. Such behavior \n     poisons the well of goodwill that makes community \n     reinvestment possible. The time has come for those \n     responsible for the success of CRA to break their silence and \n     make clear whether they want community development to be a \n     business success story or just some politician's sound bite.\n       What is needed is a clear way to demarcate those who \n     deliver real community development from those who deliver a \n     mob outside a bank branch or senator's house. The best people \n     to do this are the leaders of community groups themselves. In \n     private, some of the most accomplished practitioners have \n     told me how embarrassed they are about the events at Mr. \n     Gramm's house. They have not shied away from using the term \n     ``extortion'' to describe activity that clearly fits the \n     definition. These people know that their good efforts are \n     made more difficult by the extortionists; who misuse \n     resources and give community development a bad name.\n\n\n                               pet causes\n\n       Banks themselves must also make clear that they will not \n     pay for political favors or meet extortionists' demands. The \n     intent of CRA is to ensure that an adequate number of loans \n     are made in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and that \n     those areas have access to bank branches and other banking \n     services. There is no requirement that civic or community \n     leaders must say nice things about the bank or that the bank \n     must contribute to those leaders' pet causes or even their \n     own organizations.\n       It is often too easy for bank management to simply pay for \n     a problem to go away. Regulators should make sure that this \n     doesn't happen, by insisting that CRA-type payments made by \n     bank management go for services rendered--such as loan \n     referrals--and are not de factor political contributions or \n     extortion payments. Regulators would not tolerate a bank \n     management that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act by \n     bribing foreign officials. Nor should they allow bribes to \n     community groups in the U.S. The administration, meanwhile, \n     should stop using America's developing communities as pawns \n     in its own bureaucratic battles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5028-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5028-S5029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5029-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON CERTIFICATION OF EXPORTING TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \nSATELLITE FUELS AND SEPARATION SYSTEMS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                   26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of Public Law 105-\n261, the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 1999, I hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic of \nChina of satellite fuels and separation systems for the U.S.-origin \nIridium commercial communications satellite program:\n  (1) is not detrimental to the United States space launch industry; \nand\n  (2) the material and equipment, including any indirect technical \nbenefit that could be derived from such export, will not measurably \nimprove the missile or space launch capabilities of the People's \nRepublic of China.\n                                                  William J.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 440\n\n       Whereas, federal legislation entitled the ``Conservation \n     and Reinvestment Act of 1999'' has been introduced in the \n     106th Session of Congress which would provide financial \n     assistance to meet the outdoor conservation and recreation \n     needs of the American people; and\n       Whereas, funds received pursuant to the Act may be used for \n     projects and activities related to air quality, water \n     quality, fish and wildlife, wetlands, or other coastal \n     resources, including shoreline protection and coastal \n     restoration; and\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\n       Whereas, this measure, if enacted, would divert 50 percent \n     of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act funds from the \n     federal treasury directly to states to meet their outdoor \n     conservation and recreation needs; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that Virginia's allocation, if \n     such legislation is enacted, would be $27 million;\n       Whereas, the money is to be allocated to both the \n     Commonwealth and its eligible political subdivisions; and\n       Whereas, Virginia, as evidenced by its laws and the \n     allocation of financial resources, has remained committed to \n     protecting its environment and conserving its natural \n     wildlife resources; and\n       Whereas, a partnership between the federal government and \n     the states would further enhance the various efforts that \n     states have made to protect their land, water, and wildlife \n     resources; and\n       Whereas, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 \n     embodied a visionary concept that a portion of the proceeds \n     from Outer Continental Shelf leasing revenues and the \n     depletion of nonrenewable natural resources should result in \n     a legacy of public places accessible for recreation; and\n       Whereas, the demand for recreation and conservation areas, \n     at the state and local level, remains a high priority for \n     Virginians; and\n       Whereas, compleition for limited federal moneys has \n     resulted in the states not receiving an equitable proportion \n     of funds for land acquisition; and\n       Whereas, to develop a comprehensive conservation legacy \n     that will not only protect open space but will also provide \n     funding for sustaining the wildlife that use the lands, it is \n     essential to establish a permanent funding source for state-\n     level wildlife conservation, conservation education, and \n     wildlife-related recreation programs that promote wildlife \n     diversity; and\n       Whereas, through enactment of the Federal Aid in Wildlife \n     Restoration Act and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration \n     Act, hunters and anglers have for more than 60 years \n     willingly paid user fees in the form of federal excise taxes \n     on hunting and fishing equipment to support wildlife \n     diversity and abundance; and\n       Whereas, state, programs, conducted in coordination with \n     federal, state, tribal, and private landowners and interested \n     organizations, must serve as a vital link in a nationwide \n     effort to protect and enhance wildlife diversity through \n     comprehensive wildlife-management programs that benefit both \n     game and nongame species; and\n       Whereas, the investment of these Conservation and \n     Reinvestment Act funds in wildlife-related programs would \n     support natural resources related to tourism and wildlife \n     viewing that generate millions of dollars annually to the \n     economy of Virginia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Delegates concurring), \n     That Congress be urged to enact the ``Conservation and \n     Reinvestment Act'' which will provide federal matching funds \n     for such projects; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That Congress be urged to enact the \n     proposed House of Representatives version of the Act, House \n     Resolution No. 701, that would raise the total diversion of \n     Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act revenues to 60 percent by \n     increasing the allocation of such revenues in the proposed \n     Title II provisions from 16 to 23 percent and Title III \n     provisions from 7 to 10 percent; and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, and the members of the Virginia Congressional \n     Delegation in order that they may be apprised of the sense of \n     the Virginia General Assembly in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 1616\n\n       Whereas, Economic sanctions hinder the export of \n     agricultural products, exacerbating the transportation of \n     such products and possibly lowering the price received by the \n     Kansas farmer for such agricultural products; and\n       Whereas, The export of agricultural commodities has \n     provided the United States the only positive return on its \n     balance of trade; and\n       Whereas, The only way to ensure that a positive return on \n     the balance of trade continues is to allow international \n     markets to remain open; and\n       Whereas, The use of unilateral economic sanctions rarely \n     achieves its goal, but cause substantial harm to the \n     producers of products; and\n       Whereas, Not only do the sanctions imposed by the United \n     States cause lost market opportunities for the Kansas farmer, \n     but so do the unfair trade barriers and sanctions imposed on \n     agricultural products by other countries; and\n       Whereas, The storage of grain on the ground in Kansas is \n     just one example of the adverse affects sanctions have on \n     agricultural products: Now, therefore, be it\n       Revolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas (the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein): That Congress remove or \n     restrict the use of trade sanctions as they apply to \n     agricultural products and that Congress ensure that the use \n     of trade sanctions will result in meaningful results;\n       Whereas, The export enhancement program is one tool which \n     can expand foreign market opportunities; and\n       Whereas, If the Kansas farmer is to have the opportunity to \n     prosper and grow, the agricultural products produced by the \n     farmer must be able to reach foreign markets; and\n       Whereas, The stockpiling of grain is just one example of \n     where the lack of access to foreign markets hurts not only \n     the Kansas farmer but all American farmers and the economy of \n     the United States in general: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved; That the secretary of the United States \n     department of agriculture is urged to take greater advantage \n     of the export enhancement program; and be it further\n       Resolved: That Congress work for the reduction and \n     elimination of trade barriers and sanctions imposed by other \n     countries against agricultural products; and\n       Whereas, Foreign meat and dairy products must be raised or \n     produced under the same regulatory standards to ensure \n     consumer health and safety as meat and dairy products raised \n     and produced in the United States; and\n       Whereas, Numerous cattle producers have testified before \n     the Kansas Legislature that this issue needs to be \n     investigated and decided in Congress: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved: That Congress pass laws that require country of \n     origin labeling on foreign meat and dairy products with such \n     labeling on the final consumer product; and\n       Whereas, Pork and beef associations presented resolutions \n     and testimony on the need and value of mandatory price \n     reporting; and\n       Whereas, Discriminatory pricing and retaliatory actions are \n     unacceptable in an open market system; and\n       Whereas, Pork and beef associations also support a \n     marketing system free from unnecessary government \n     regulations; and\n       Whereas, Producers should consider participating in \n     marketing alliances, cooperatives and other innovative \n     methods of marketing livestock in order to focus on changing \n     consumer demands and to regain market share; and\n       Whereas, Pork and beef associations support a system free \n     of government restrictions on livestock ownership, unless \n     such livestock ownership restricts free and competitive \n     markets or is a violation of antitrust laws; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved: That Congress continue to investigate mandatory \n     price reporting in the livestock industry and, if warranted, \n     pass appropriate legislation that will assure a free and open \n     market for our independent farmers and ranchers; and\n       Whereas, Concentration of segments of the beef and pork \n     industries is occurring; and\n       Whereas, Such concentration must not result in lower \n     commodity prices for Kansas farmers and ranchers and higher \n     food prices for American consumers; and\n       Whereas, Pending mergers of grain companies could result in \n     disproportionate control of the grain market; and\n       Whereas, Renewed investigative efforts, including \n     enforcement of the antitrust laws, must be generated by the \n     justice department and the packers and stockyards division of \n     the United States department of agriculture to ensure the \n     competitive market structure: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved: That the justice department and the packers and \n     stockyard division of the United States department of \n     agriculture enforce the antitrust laws in the livestock and \n     grain industry; and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to send \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice-President of the United States, \n     Majority Leaders and Minority Leader of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker, Majority Leader and Minority Leader of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of \n     the United States Department of Agriculture, the Attorney \n     General of the United States and to each member of the Kansas \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-88.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n       Whereas, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by the Congress \n     of the United States in 1945, established a statutory \n     framework whereby responsibility for regulating the insurance \n     industry was left largely to the states; and\n       Whereas, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     (ERISA) of 1974 significantly altered this concept by \n     creating a federal framework for regulating employer-based \n     health, pension and welfare-benefit plans; and\n       Whereas, the provisions of ERISA prevent states from \n     directly regulating most employer-based health plans that are \n     not deemed to be ``insurance'' for purposes of federal laws; \n     and\n       Whereas, available data suggests that self-funding of \n     employer-based health plans is increasing at a significant \n     rate; among both large and small businesses; and\n       Whereas, between 1989 and 1993, the General Accounting \n     Office estimates that the number of self-funded plan \n     enrollees increased by about six million; and\n       Whereas, approximately 40-50 percent of the employer-based \n     health plans are presently self-funded by employers, who \n     retain most or all of the financial risk for their respective \n     health plans; and\n       Whereas, as self-funding of health plans has grown, states \n     have lost regulatory oversight of this growing portion of the \n     health insurance market; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has been slow to enact \n     meaningful patient protections such as mechanisms for the \n     recovery of benefits due plan participants, recovery of \n     compensatory damages from the fiduciary caused by its failure \n     to pay benefits due under the plan, enforcement of the plan-\n     participant's rights under the terms of the plan, assurance \n     of timely payment, and clarification of the plan-\n     participant's right to future benefits under the terms of the \n     plan; and\n       Whereas, in the absence of federal patient protections, \n     state-level action is needed; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates (the Senate concurring), \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to either \n     enact meaningful patient protections at the federal level \n     with respect to employer self-funded plans or, in the absence \n     of such federal action, amend the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 to grant authority to all \n     individual states to monitor and regulate self-funded, \n     employer-based health plans; and be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor, the \n     Congressional Delegation of Virginia, and to the presiding \n     officer of each house of each state's legislative body so \n     that they may be apprised of the sense of the General \n     Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-94.

No. 6\n\n       Whereas, the United States is a signatory to the 1992 \n     United Nations Framework Convention on Global Climate Change \n     (FCCC); and\n       Whereas, a proposed protocol to expand the scope of the \n     FCCC was negotiated in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, \n     potentially requiring the United States to reduce emissions \n     of greenhouse gases by seven percent from 1990 levels during \n     the period from 2008 to 2012, with potentially larger \n     emission reductions thereafter; and\n       Whereas, developing nations are exempt from greenhouse gas \n     emission limitation requirements in the FCCC, and refused in \n     the Kyoto negotiations to accept any new commitments for \n     greenhouse gas emission limitation through the Kyoto \n     Protocol; and\n       Whereas, achieving the emission reductions proposed by the \n     Kyoto Protocol would require a thirty-eight per cent \n     reduction in projected United States greenhouse gas emissions \n     during the period from 2008 to 2012; and\n       Whereas, the legally binding goals to reduce emissions to \n     the levels stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol would weaken the \n     economy of the United States, impair the competitiveness of \n     its industries in the growing global market, and cause \n     economic dislocation in the United States, including job \n     loss, major\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\n     economic restructuring, and increased levels of poverty; and\n       Whereas, if the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol were \n     implemented, Americans would experience increased prices for \n     energy, emergency services, education, finished goods, and \n     transportation; and\n       Whereas, the economic consequences of complying with the \n     Kyoto Protocol merit rejection of the treaty and \n     consideration of policies that promote a more studied, \n     balanced, and constructive approach; and\n       Whereas, the results of scientific studies evaluating \n     greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on the earth's \n     environment are inconclusive; and\n       Whereas, the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol will allow \n     foreign interests to control and limit the growth of the \n     United States economy; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 123rd General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, respectively memorialize the \n     members of the United States Senate not to ratify the Kyoto \n     Protocol related to the control of greenhouse gases; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 123rd General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, strongly recommend that the \n     United Stated protect and improve the environment by adopting \n     incentives for the development, commercialization, and use of \n     technologies that promote energy efficiency and reduce \n     pollution rather than through coercive and excessive \n     government regulation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the President Pro \n     Tempore and the Secretary of the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-102. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of West Virginia; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 35\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature works tirelessly to improve the \n     quality of life for the citizens of the Mountain State; and\n       Whereas, coal mining has been, and continues to be, one of \n     the primary industries responsible for the economic success \n     of West Virginia and its citizens; and\n       Whereas, thousands of West Virginians are employed, either \n     directly or indirectly, by the coal mining industry which \n     generates payrolls totaling over $2 billion; and\n       Whereas, surface coal mining, including the practice of \n     mountaintop removal, currently represents one third of the \n     total coal production in West Virginia; and\n       Whereas, surface mining currently accounts for the payment \n     of millions of dollars in severance taxes, millions of \n     dollars in income taxes, and millions of dollars in other \n     related taxes paid to the State of West Virginia; and\n       Whereas, county governments and county school systems \n     throughout the state rely on the taxes from coal companies \n     and coal miners to fund many valuable programs, including \n     public education, ambulance services and law enforcement; and\n       Whereas, the loss of any of West Virginia's coal mines and \n     the loss of any mining-related employment ultimately results \n     in significant harm to all West Virginians; and\n       Whereas, the world marketplace for coal is severely \n     competitive and supports only mining companies that are \n     dependable, low cost sources of coal; and\n       Whereas, concerns have been raised about the method of \n     mining known as mountaintop removal and the Governor and the \n     Legislature have responded to those concerns; and\n       Whereas, by executive order, the Governor did appoint a \n     task force to explore the issue of mountaintop removal mining \n     and related practices. That task force conducted numerous \n     public meetings and collected significant amounts of \n     information prior to issuing a comprehensive report \n     containing numerous recommendations to the Governor and the \n     Legislature; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature did request a study of the issues \n     surrounding blasting to be conducted by a joint interim \n     subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Government \n     Organization and that subcommittee recommended numerous bills \n     to address the concerns of blasting; and\n       Whereas, the 1999 Legislature, through the passage of \n     Senate Bill No. 681, has considered the reports and \n     recommendations of the Governor's task force and the interim \n     subcommittee and has affirmatively responded to concerns \n     which have been raised about the issue of mountaintop removal \n     mining by doing the following:\n       Strengthening the laws and regulations which are designed \n     to control blasting by extending the pre-blast survey areas, \n     requiring site-specific blasting plans when blasting is to \n     occur near structures, imposing new penalties for blasting \n     violations causing damage to property, establishing a \n     presumption of liability where damage is done to water wells \n     within certain distances of water wells and establishing an \n     economical and efficient claims process for those aggrieved \n     by blasting operations; and\n       Establishing the office of blasting to review and regulate \n     blasting operations in surface mining;\n       Establishing the office of coalfield community development \n     to require the various stakeholders in the mining process to \n     address the issues of community development, regional \n     development, property acquisitions and other issues relevant \n     to the future of the areas of the state where coal mining \n     occurs;\n       Repealing the provisions of legislation which was enacted \n     during the 1998 session of the Legislature thereby restoring \n     the stream mitigation program to its previous status; and\n       Addressing other issues of concern in the areas of \n     mountaintop removal mining; and\n       Whereas, actions and inactions by federal regulatory \n     agencies which have had the effect of closing surface coal \n     mines are more frequent and result in the loss of hundreds of \n     mining and other jobs in West Virginia; and\n       Whereas, in an effort to address these problems and to \n     solicit cooperation with the federal agencies, the Governor, \n     the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Delegates jointly prepared and sent to Carol M. Browner, \n     Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency, a letter inquiring about mining standards and agency \n     actions. At the present time, there has been no response to \n     the letter; therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia, that\n       The Legislature hereby recognizes the importance of the \n     coal mining industry and encourages all federal and state \n     agencies regulating the coal mining industry to demonstrate \n     affirmative responsiveness by returning to fair and objective \n     behavior, particularly in the issuance of mining permits and \n     other regulation of the coal industry; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Legislature supports the \n     continued mining of coal in West Virginia, including surface \n     mining by all methods recognized by state and federal law, \n     and is prepared to cooperate with all federal agencies in an \n     effort to resolve quickly any outstanding issues which are \n     preventing the mining of coal and which are contributing to \n     the loss of jobs in West Virginia; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, that the Legislature requests West \n     Virginia's congressional delegation to join in the efforts to \n     support the coal industry in West Virginia and to make every \n     effort possible to assist in securing the needed cooperation \n     from federal agencies to allow the continuation of the mining \n     of coal and to protect the jobs of coal miners and others who \n     derive their employment from coal mining; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate is hereby \n     directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the \n     President and Vice President of the United States, the \n     Governor of West Virginia, members of West Virginia's \n     congressional delegation and the directors of each of the \n     federal and state agencies that regulate the coal mining \n     industry in West Virginia.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-103.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the United States is a signatory to the 1992 \n     United Nations Framework Convention on Global Climate Change \n     (``FCCC''); and\n       Whereas, a proposed protocol to expand the scope of the \n     FCCC was negotiated (``Kyoto Protocol'') in December, 1997, \n     in Kyoto, Japan, potentially requiring the United States to \n     reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by seven percent (7%) \n     from 1990 levels during the period of 2008 to 2012, with \n     potentially larger emission reductions thereafter; and\n       Whereas, the Kyoto Protocol would require other major \n     industrial nations to reduce emissions from 1990 levels by \n     six percent (6%) to eight percent (8%) during the period 2008 \n     to 2012, with potentially larger emission reductions \n     thereafter; and\n       Whereas, President William J. Clinton pledged on October \n     22, 1997, that the ``United States not assume binding \n     obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully \n     participate in this effort''; and\n       Whereas, Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States requires a two-thirds concurrence of the United \n     States Senate before any treaty may be ratified; and\n       Whereas, on July 25, 1997, the United States Senate adopted \n     Senate Resolution No. 98 by a vote of 95 to 0, expressing the \n     sense of the Senate that ``the United States should not be a \n     signatory to any protocol to or other agreement regarding the \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change . . . which would \n     require the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, \n     and which would mandate new commitments to mitigate \n     greenhouse gas emissions for the developed country parties \n     unless the protocol or other agreement also mandates specific \n     scheduled commitments within the same compliance period to \n     mitigate greenhouse gas emissions for developing country \n     parties''; and\n       Whereas, developing nations are exempt from greenhouse gas \n     emission limitations in the FCCC refused, in the Kyoto \n     negotiations, to accept any new commitments for greenhouse \n     gas emission limitations through the Kyoto Protocol; and\n       Whereas, manmade emissions of greenhouse gases such as \n     carbon dioxide are caused primarily by the combustion of oil, \n     coal and natural gas fuels by industries, automobiles, homes \n     and other uses of energy; and\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\n       Whereas, the United States relies on carbon-based fossil \n     fuels for more than ninety percent (90%) of its total energy \n     supply; and\n       Whereas, achieving the emission reductions proposed by the \n     Kyoto Protocol would require a thirty-eight percent (38%) \n     reduction in projected United States carbon emissions during \n     the period of 2008 to 2012; and\n       Whereas, developing countries exempt from emission \n     limitations under the Kyoto Protocol are expected to increase \n     their rates of fossil fuel use over the next two (2) decades \n     and surpass the United States and other industrialized \n     countries in total emissions of greenhouse gases; and\n       Whereas, studies prepared by the economic forecasting \n     group, WEFA, estimate that legally binding requirements for \n     the reduction of United States greenhouse bases below 1990 \n     emission levels would result in the loss of many Wyoming \n     jobs, while also experiencing higher energy, housing, medical \n     and food costs. Since Wyoming government is so highly reliant \n     on taxes and royalties from the production of fossil fuels \n     such as oil, gas and coal, the result of decreasing the \n     production of these minerals would result in economic \n     hardships; and\n       Whereas, the failure to provide for commitments by \n     developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol creates an unfair \n     competitive imbalance between industrial and developing \n     nations, potentially leading to the transfer of jobs and \n     industrial development from the United States to developing \n     countries;\n       Whereas, increased emissions of greenhouse gases by \n     developing counties would offset any environmental benefits \n     associated with emissions reductions achieved by the United \n     States and other industrial nations.\n       Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved By The Members of the \n     Legislature of the State of Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the President of the United States not \n     attempt to use federal activities to initiate strategies to \n     mitigate greenhouses gases until and unless the Kyoto \n     Protocol is amended or otherwise revised so that it is \n     consistent with United States Senate Resolution No. 98 to \n     including specific scheduled commitments for developing \n     countries to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions within the \n     same compliance period required for industrial nations.\n       Sec. 2. That the United States Senate reject any proposed \n     protocol or other amendment to the FCCC that is inconsistent \n     with this resolution or that does not comply fully with the \n     United States Senate Resolution No. 98.\n       Sec. 3. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of the resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress and to \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-106.

A bill to establish a matching grant program to help State \nand local jurisdictions purchase school safety equipment; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 STUDENTS LEARNING IN SAFE SCHOOLS ACT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Students Learning \nin Safe Schools Act of 1999.\n  This legislation would build on the successes of two bills I \nsponsored in the 105th Congress and that were signed into law, S. 2235, \nwhich established the Cops in Schools program and S. 1605, the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998.\n  Juvenile crime prevention, of course, is on all of our minds, \nparticularly since the recent tragedy in Littleton. I think all of us \nknow that violence has\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\ngone up among youngsters and it threatens a safe learning environment \nfor our students at school. As a former teacher, a deputy sheriff, and \nparent, I developed a special sensitivity long before I came to the \nSenate.\n  On April 20, in my home State, 13 innocent victims, 12 students and 1 \nvery heroic teacher, were murdered at Columbine High School. This town \nis a very nice town. Littleton is a wonderful community. The school of \nColumbine is a nice school with few problems. I guess people are prone \nto say if it could happen there, it certainly could happen anywhere.\n  Clearly, no student should have to go to school where they fear for \ntheir lives. Statistics on violence in schools are startling. In fact, \nrecent reports indicated there were 173 violent deaths in U.S. schools \nbetween 1994 and 1998 and that 31% of children know someone their age \nwho carries a gun. The National Education Association estimated that \n100,000 youngsters carry guns to school and 160,000 children miss class \nevery day because they fear physical harm.\n  We know that government cannot fix it all. We are being leaned on, of \ncourse, to pass more and more laws to correct all these problems, but \nmost of us know there has to be teamwork involving students and parents \nand families and communities and religious leaders and school \nadministrators.\n  This teamwork should also include law enforcement officers working \nclosely with schools. Teachers and principals simply do not have the \ntraining or equipment or resources to deal with the problem. And they \nshouldn't have to, they should be focusing on teaching our kids.\n  That's why I introduced S. 2235 last year, the School Resource \nOfficers Partnership Grant Act of 1998, to help stop school violence. \nS. 2235, which was signed into law last October, will create thousands \nof vital partnerships between state and local law enforcement agencies, \nand the schools, parents and children they serve and protect. Schools \nthat establish these partnerships would be eligible to receive federal \nfunding through the Justice Department to hire School Resource \nOfficers, also known as SROs. SROs are career law enforcement officers, \nwith sworn authority, within the Community Policing program, and will \nwork in and around our schools.\n  Working in cooperation with youngsters, parents, teachers and \nprincipals, these SROs would be able to keep track of potentially \ndangerous kids and effectively deal with them before things escalate, \nviolence errupts, and youngsters get hurt. These SROs would work in our \nschools, not as armed guards, but primarially as people who would help \nresolve conflicts.\n  There is $60 million in Cops in School grants which will be \ndistributed this year alone. In fact, the Justice Department has just \nannounced the first round of grants with hundreds of schools in 42 \nstates benefiting.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Students Learning in Safe \nSchools Act of 1999, would build on the Cops in Schools program to help \nimprove school safety. The Students Learning in Safe Schools Act would \nprovide federal matching grants to help schools buy metal detectors, \nmetal detecting wands, video cameras, and other equipment needed to \nhelp make our schools safer. This bill calls for a matching grant of \n$40 million for each of the 3 fiscal years from fiscal year 2000 \nthrough fiscal year 2002. The grants would be easily accessible to \nStates, local governments, and school districts with a minimum of \nredtape. This is not a mandate, however. It is an opportunity for \nschool districts to get some additional resources.\n  This legislation calls for posting this new school safety equipment \ngrant program on the Internet right next to the Cops in Schools program \nwhich can now be found on the Justice Department's web sight. This \nwould help provide one stop shopping where people can go for help in \ngetting both the safety personnel and safety equipment they need to \nhelp make their schools safer.\n  I do not expect this legislation, of course, to solve all our \nproblems but certainly it is another tool I hope will go a long way in \nreducing juvenile violence in schools.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I was happy to yield to the Senator from \nColorado. He and I have had discussions of the terrible events that \ntook place in Colorado. The distinguished Senator from Colorado and I \nwrote legislation on another area of law enforcement, relying on his \nexperience and my experience in law enforcement. That was the \nbulletproof vests legislation which is now working very, very well.\n  I mention this while the distinguished Senator from Colorado is still \non the floor because we have had many discussions about law enforcement \nmatters--most recently an event at the White House. It has been my \nexperience, time and time again, the Senator from Colorado has given \npragmatic and realistic solutions to law enforcement problems at a time \nwhen we can all get carried away by philosophical arguments. I found \nmost law enforcement people tell me to save the philosophy for them to \nread in their retirement years--give them the pragmatic solutions today \nwhen they have to uphold the law.\n  So I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 998. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to prohibit \nthe donation or service without charge of competitive foods of minimal \nnutritional value in schools participating in Federal meal service \nprograms before the end of the last lunch period of the schools; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n            better nutrition for school children act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be joined by Senators \nJeffords, Harkin, Kohl, and Feingold, and Representative Hinchey in the \nHouse of Representatives, in introducing the ``Better Nutrition for \nSchool Children Act of 1999.'' This bill seals a loophole undermining \nour children's nutritional health.\n  One of the most important lessons we can teach our children is good \nhealth. Good health includes keeping our children tobacco and drug \nfree, and includes nutrition education for healthy living.\n  Every day, more than 26 million children participate in the National \nSchool Lunch Program. One-quarter of those children--approximately \nseven million--also participate in the National School Breakfast \nProgram. According to a United States Department of Agriculture study, \nschool children may consume between one-third and one-half of their \ndaily nutrient intake at school. Knowing how important school meal \nprograms are to the nutritional health of children, I am extremely \nconcerned by reports of soft drinks being given to children before or \nduring lunch.\n  Current law prohibits the sale of soft drinks during lunch. This \nprohibition has been around for a long time. However, some schools are \nnow getting around this prohibition by giving soda to children for \nfree. This is a loophole--big enough to drive a soda truck through--\nthat hurts our children. The bill which we are introducing today would \nclose this loophole so that soft drinks cannot be distributed--for free \nor for sale--during mealtime at schools participating in the National \nSchool Lunch Program. Also, the bill would prohibit giving away sodas \nbefore lunch.\n  As a parent, I would be outraged to discover that my efforts at \nteaching my child good nutrition were being undermined by free sugar \nand caffeine laden soft drinks at school.\n  Studies based on statistics from the USDA Continuing Surveys of Food \nIntakes by Individuals have shown that heavy soft drink consumption \ncorrelates with a low intake of magnesium, calcium, ascorbic acid, \nriboflavin and vitamin A. The loss of calcium is particularly alarming \nfor teenage women, as calcium is crucial for building up bone mass to \nreduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life, and women build 92 \npercent of their bone mass by age 18.\n  Many sodas also contain caffeine, which is not only an addictive \nstimulant, but which also increases the excretion of calcium.\n  In its Food Guide Pyramid for Young Children, which recommends good \ndietary habits for children, the United States Department of \nAgriculture continues to recommend serving children fruits, vegetables, \ngrains, meat and dairy, while limiting children's intake of sweets - \nincluding soft drinks.\n  Statistics regarding children's intake of soft drinks are alarming. \nFor instance, teenage boys consume an average of 2\\1/2\\ soft drinks a \nday--which equals approximately 15 teaspoons of sugar--every day.\n  While children's consumption of soft drinks has been on the rise, \ntheir consumption of milk has been on the decline. Statistics from the \nUSDA demonstrate that whereas 20 years ago teens drank twice as much \nmilk as soda, today they drink twice as much soda as milk. Unlike milk, \nsoft drinks have minimal nutritional value and they contribute nothing \nto the health of kids. One need only compare the ingredient and \nnutrition labels on a Coke can versus a milk carton to see what a child \nloses when milk is replaced by a soft drink.\n  The consequence of replacing milk with soda is clear: the declining \nnutritional health of our children. In her book Jane Brody's \nNutritional Book, Jane Brody articulates this point in saying:\n\n       Probably the most insidious undermining of good nutrition \n     in the early years comes\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\n     from the soft drink industry. Catering to children's innate \n     preferences for a sweet taste, the industry has succeeded in \n     drawing millions of youngsters away from milk and natural \n     fruit juices and hooking them on pop and other artificially \n     flavored drinks that offer nothing of nutritional \n     significance besides calories.\n\n  The Vermont State Board of Education's School Nutrition Policy \nStatement actually touches on this very issue. Among its \nrecommendations to school districts for dietary guidelines and \nnutrition, the Board of Education advises:\n\n       Certain foods which contribute little other than calories \n     should not be sold on school campuses. These foods include \n     carbonated beverages, nonfruit soft drinks, candies in which \n     the major ingredient is sugar, frozen nonfruit ice bars, and \n     chewing gum with sugar.\n\n  It was only a few years ago that, as Chairman of the U.S. Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, that I fought the \nsoft drink behemoths--Coca-Cola and Pepsi--over vending machines in \nschools. I felt that schools should be encouraged to close down vending \nmachines before and during lunch. I was unprepared for the wealth of \nopposition which ensued.\n  However, despite the well-financed opposition by soda companies, the \nNutrition and Health for Children Act was met with bipartisan support \nin Congress. Former Senator Bob Dole noted that ``too often a student \ngives up his half dollar and his appetite en route to the cafeteria'' \nand criticized the ``so-called plate waste, where young students and \nother students decide it is better to have a candy bar and a soft drink \nrather than eat some meal that is subsidized by the Federal \nGovernment.''\n  Just as the Better Nutrition and Health for Children Act passed with \nbipartisan support in 1994, I am sure that the Better Nutrition for \nSchool Children Act of 1999 will pass with bipartisan support this \nyear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Better Nutrition for \nSchool Children Act of 1999 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 998\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Better Nutrition for School \n     Children Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to close the loophole that allows competitive foods of \n     minimum nutritional value that cannot be sold during meals in \n     schools participating in the school breakfast and lunch \n     programs to instead be donated or served without charge to \n     students during or before breakfast or lunch;\n       (2) to protect 1 of the major purposes of the Child \n     Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) and the \n     National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), which is \n     to promote better nutrition among school children \n     participating in the school breakfast and lunch programs; and\n       (3) to promote better nutritional habits among school \n     children and improve the health of school children \n     participating in the school breakfast and lunch programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON DONATION OR SERVICE WITHOUT CHARGE OF \n                   COMPETITIVE FOODS OF MINIMAL NUTRITIONAL VALUE.\n\n       Section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. \n     1779) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(b) The'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Donation or Service Without Charge of Competitive \n     Foods of Minimal Nutritional Value.--\n       ``(1) Sales.--The''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Donations or service without charge.--The regulations \n     shall prohibit the donation or service without charge of \n     competitive foods not approved by the Secretary under \n     paragraph (1) in a school participating in a meal service \n     program authorized under this Act or the National School \n     Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) before the end of the last \n     lunch period of the school.''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Leahy, \nSenator Feingold, Senator Kohl, and Senator Harkin as an original \ncosponsor of the Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999. This \nissue is so important to the health and well being of our nation's \nschool children.\n  The Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 is about good \nnutrition--and a little about milk. The Vermont and Wisconsin Senators \nat times have a hard time agreeing on federal milk policy, but we all \nagree that good nutrition plays an important role in the health and \neducation of our children.\n  As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nI recognize the importance of having a proper and nutritionally \nbalanced diet in our school lunch programs. A well nourished child is a \nchild more healthy, energized, focused and able to learn.\n  When school children receive a large amount of their daily caloric \nintake from sugary soft drinks, they are not receiving the fruits, \nvegetables, vitamins, minerals, and perhaps most importantly--calcium \nthat they need.\n  Soda and other sugary junk foods squeeze more nutritious foods out of \ntheir diet. Since many school children may consume between one-third \nand one-half of their daily intake at school, it is important that we \ndo not allow them to substitute good nutrition with empty calories.\n  Mr. President, teens, in particular, should be drinking milk instead \nof soft drinks. Twenty years ago, teens drank twice as much milk as \nsoda. Today, the average teenager drinks twice as much soda as milk.\n  The Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 helps close the \nempty calorie loophole. Soft drinks, sugar candies, cotton candy and \nthe like are already banned from being sold during lunch. This bill \nwould simply ban the free distribution of these ``competitive foods not \napproved by the Secretary'' before and during lunch at schools \nparticipating in the federal school lunch or breakfast programs.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Leahy for his continued leadership \nin improving the nutrition of America's school children and will work \nwith him and others to see that this bill becomes law.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Leahy, \nSenator Kohl, and Senator Jeffords to introduce this important \nlegislation, the Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999. The \nBetter Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 will make our kid's \nnutrition--not some economic bottom line--the priority when it comes to \nour nation's school meal program.\n  Mr. President, some schools in this country, particularly high \nschool, are providing school-aged children with free soda as part of \nthe school lunch program. This trend is troublesome for a number of \nreasons: One, it is contrary to the intent of the 1946 National School \nLunch Act; Two, numerous studies have demonstrated that teenagers, \nparticularly girls, are not consuming enough calcium to prevent \nosteoporosis in their later years; And, three, as a representative of \nWisconsin, ``America's Dairyland,'' I am concerned that the increase in \nschool time soda consumption will inevitably mean that our children \ndrink less milk at school.\n  Mr. President, in 1946, Congress first made nutrition for school aged \nchildren a priority when it passed the National School Lunch Act. This \nmeasure was designed to provide school children with high quality \nnutritious food during the school day. In 1977, because of concerns \nthat our country's nutritional habits had begun to slide, Congress \ndirected USDA to take steps to restrict school children's access to \nfoods of low nutritional value when at school.\n  The legality regulations USDA promulgates under the 1977 law, with \nregard to foods of nutritional value was challenged by the National \nSoft Drink Association. This law banned the sale of soft drink and \nother ``junk foods'' in school cafeterias during the lunch hour.\n  Congressional debates on the 1977 law ``convey an unmistakable \nconcern that `junk foods,' notably various types of candy bars, chewing \ngum and soft drinks, not be allowed to compete in participating \nschools.'' The Federal judge observed the ``logic and common sense, as \nwell as several studies in the [rulemaking] record, suggest that \nirregular eating habits combined with ready access to junk food \nadversely affect federal nutritional objectives.''\n  USDA current regulations prohibit the sale of foods of ``minimal \nnutritional value''--which include sodas, water ices, chewing gum, and \ncertain candies--in the food service area during the lunch period in \nany school. The current regulations do not mention the distribution of \nfree sodas, because, Mr. President, this idea never entered the\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\nminds of lawmakers during consideration of the measure.\n  Mr. President, we have found that in schools all over the country, \nfree sodas are being passed out as part of the school lunch program. \nThis practice evades the current Federal ban on the sale of sodas as \npart of school lunches. It's bad for kids, bad for farmers who are \nwatching milk consumption and prices decline, and bad for teachers and \nschool administrators who are left to deal with unruly and fidgety \nchildren during the day. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, giving \naway free sodas in school doesn't help anybody except soda companies.\n  Mr. President, in a report published last year by the Center for \nScience in the Public Interest (CSPI) it was documented that one \nquarter of teenage boys who drink soda consume more than two 12-ounce \ncans per day, and that five percent drink five or more cans daily. This \nreport was based on survey data from USDA and also indicated that in \naverage, girls drink about one-third less--but the risks of soda \nconsumption are potentially greater for girls. The report claims that \ndoctors say soda has been pushing milk out of teenage diets and making \ngirls more likely candidates for osteoporosis when they're older.\n  The data indicated that these doctors are right. Choosing a soft \ndrink instead of milk means that teens will have a lower level of \ncalcium in their diets. Soft drinks provide 0% of a persons recommended \ndaily allowance for calcium, while milk provides 30%. Low calcium \nintake contributes to osteoporosis, a disease leading to fragile and \nbroken bones. Currently, 10 million Americans have osteoporosis while \nanother 18 million have low bone mass and are at increased risk of \nosteoporosis. Women are more frequently affected than men. Considering \nthe low calcium intake of today's teenage girls, osteoporosis rates may \nwell rise in the near future.\n  As I understand it, the risk of osteoporosis depends in part on how \nmuch bone mass is built early on in life. The CSPI report states that \ngirls build 92 percent of their bone mass by age 18, but if they don't \nconsume enough calcium in the teenage years, they cannot ``catch up'' \nlater. This explains why experts recommend higher calcium intakes for \nyouths 9 to 18 than for adults 19 to 50. Currently, teenage girls \nconsume only 60 percent of the recommended amount; pop drinkers \nconsuming almost one-fifth less calcium than non-consumers.\n  The CSPI and a coalition of health advocates reported that 20 years \nago, teens drank almost twice as much milk as soda pop; today, they \nconsume twice as much soda as milk.\n  Since 1973, soft drink consumption has risen dramatically. Americans \nnow drink twice as much soda per person as they did 25 years ago. \nAccording to statistics from the Beverage Marketing Corp., annual soda \nconsumption was 22.4 per person in 1970; in 1998, it was 56.1 gallons \nper person. Unfortunately, milk consumption has been on a steady \ndecline. This trend is likely to continue--however, I do not feel that \nschool administrators should encourage it. This country's dairy farmers \nhave it hard enough. The recently announced Basic Formula Price (BFP) \nis lower than the cost of production in nearly every region of the \ncountry. We in dairy states are very concerned about our struggling \nproducers. How can we stand by and watch as they struggle to locate and \nenter new markets abroad, while their base market--school meal \nprograms--is being taken away?\n  And how do the parents feel? Those that limit their children's intake \nof sodas and sweets at home see their efforts undermined when the \nschool provides these items for free. This is a losing battle for them \ntoo!\n  Mr. President, I'm not here to ban soda for school-age children--only \nto support a simple, sensible idea that any parent, any nutritionist, \nand any dairy farmer would favor--and that's giving our kids milk while \nthey are in school. This bill restores common sense back to one aspect \nof our kids school nutrition programs. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999. It is supported \nby the National Education Association and the University of Wisconsin-\nMilwaukee School of Education. I ask that their letters of support be \ninserted into the Record.\n  The material follows:\n         University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, School of Education \n           Department of Curriculum and Instruction,\n                                                      May 7, 1999.\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for the ``Better Nutrition for School Children Act of \n     1999.''\n       My research shows that children are coming under increasing \n     pressure to consume large quantities of soda while in school. \n     For example, exclusive contracts between schools and bottling \n     firms are now popular. These contracts commonly contain \n     provisions that provide financial incentives to school \n     districts that reward them when consumption goals are met. In \n     other words the more of a bottling company's products are \n     purchased the more money the school gets. This places school \n     districts in the ethically dangerous position of promoting \n     the consumption of products that their own health and \n     nutrition curricula discourage students from consuming in \n     large quantities.\n       The distribution of free soda as part of a school lunch \n     program, at least in my view, violates the spirit and intent \n     of the Child Nutrition Act of 1996. Such distributions are, \n     no doubt, useful to soda bottlers as means of promoting brand \n     recognition and establishing brand loyalty. And as such they \n     are little different from any number of ``free'' promotions \n     that are a common part of product marketing campaigns. \n     However, none of this has anything to do with promoting \n     children's health.\n       I believe that schools must do their utmost to promote \n     healthful eating habits among their students. The ``Better \n     Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999'' is a useful and \n     necessary step to insure that school lunches are the \n     healthful, nutritious meals that legislators have always \n     intended that they be.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Alex Molnar, Ph.D.\n\n                                 Director, Center for the Analysis\n     of Commercialism in Education.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1999.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Feingold: On behalf of the National \n     Education Association's (NEA) 2.4 million members, we would \n     like to express our strong support for the Better Nutrition \n     for School Children Act of 1999, which would bar the \n     distribution of free soda in the School Lunch Program. NEA \n     believes that providing free soda to students contradicts the \n     nutritional goals of the School Program and can impede \n     academic success.\n       Research clearly demonstrates the link between good \n     nutrition and learning. Children who are hungry or improperly \n     nourished face cognitive limitations which may impair their \n     ability to concentrate and learn. Preserving the nutritional \n     integrity of school meals, therefore, is critical ensuring \n     student achievement. This is particularly true for poor \n     children, who often rely on school lunch for one-third to \n     one-half of their daily nutritional intake.\n       Providing free soda in the School Lunch Program is clearly \n     at odds with congressional intent to restrict access by \n     school children to foods of low nutritional integrity of the \n     School Lunch Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n                         Director of Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthe ``Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999.'' This \nlegislation will stop the practice of giving students free sodas at \nlunch--sugar and caffeine filled drinks that are replacing the healthy \nmilk and juices these kids should be drinking. A soda may keep a child \nawake through fifth period physics, but it will do nothing to fuel \ntheir growth into a healthy adult. We've been talking quite a bit \nlately about keeping our children safe during the school day. We must \nnot forget we also have an obligation to keep them healthy, growing, \nand alert--an obligation met in great part with the national school \nlunch and breakfast programs.\n  The vast majority of schools in Wisconsin and across the nation are \nour partners in ensuring that children learn to eat healthy, and they \nare proud to abide by current laws--and the spirit behind those laws-- \nprohibiting the sale of foods of minimal nutritional value in our \nschools. But while there is a ban on the sale of these sorts of foods \nduring the school lunch period, there is no ban on giving them away for \nfree. The Center for Science in the Public Interest recently cited \nseveral schools that are giving away donated sodas to students. This \ndefies common sense. Kids should be drinking milk, water, and natural \nfruit juices--not sodas and other artificial drinks--as part of the \nschool lunch program.\n  Statistics from the Department of Agriculture show that 20 years ago,\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\nteens drank twice as much milk as soft drinks; today, that trend has \nreversed. Teens are drinking 40 percent less milk than they drank 22 \nyears ago. Soft drinks contain a large amount of caffeine and sugar, \nand the American Medical Association has found that these sweetened \ndrinks squeeze healthier foods out of childrens diets.\n  The Better Nutrition for School Children Act will simply prohibit the \ndonation of competitive foods of minimal nutritional value, including \nsodas, before the end of the last lunch period of school. Let me be \nclear: we are not banning sodas in schools. Students will still be able \nto purchase sodas, or receive free ones, once the school lunch period \nis over. But this bill assures that at least during mealtimes, school \nchildren will have access to healthy foods and drinks, like milk.\n  This bill does not address the exclusive marketing contracts between \nschools and soft drink companies, but I do have concern over these as \nwell. These contracts specify that a school will sell only a certain \nbrand of sodas, and in return, the soda companies give the schools a \nshare of the proceeds. I realize that school districts' budgets are \nstretched thin, but there has to be a better way of raising funds.\n  Mr. President, the Better Nutrition for School Children Act will \nclose the current loophole that allows the donation of sodas in our \nnation's schools. It will ensure that tax dollars invested in the \nschool lunch program are spent wisely on nutritious foods and drinks \nthat children actually consume--rather than throw away to make room for \na free soda. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this simple, \nyet vitally important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 999. A bill to amend chapter 18 of title 35, United States Code, \nto improve the ability of Federal agencies to patent and license \nfederally owned inventions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                    technology transfer act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 999, the \n``Technology Transfer Act of 1999.''\n  The purpose of this bill is to help ensure that the fruits of \nfederally conducted and supported research will be translated into new \nproducts and jobs that can benefit the American public.\n  This bill is necessary in order to adopt a uniform policy across the \nfederal government concerning the circumstances in which it is \nappropriate to grant an exclusive or partially exclusive license to \nintellectual property owned by the federal government. Essentially, \nthis legislation codifies the most prudent, beneficial, and successful \nagency licensing policies that have evolved over the last few years.\n  Each year the federal government makes a substantial investment in \nresearch and development. This year the federal government will \ndedicate about $79 billion toward research and development activities. \nOf this amount, about half--or $39 billion--is devoted to non-defense \nresearch. Much of this civilian R funding--over $15 billion in FY \n1999--is carried out by universities across our country.\n  Every American citizen should take pride in this considerable \nfinancial commitment because it explains why our country is in the \nforefront in so many areas of basic science and applied technology.\n  While there is intrinsic value in research for the sake of \nadvancement of knowledge, another, more tangible, benefit occurs when \nthe mysteries of science are translated into new technologies that \nprotect and promote the public health and welfare and create jobs.\n  While Utah may be a small state in terms of population, I am proud to \nsay that our universities are carrying out a vigorous program of \nresearch. For example, the University of Utah, Brigham Young \nUniversity, and Utah State University each carry out substantial \nprograms of research and in the aggregate received over $200 million in \nfederal research support in 1998.\n  Last year the research efforts of these three schools resulted in the \nissuance of patents on 40 inventions.\n  No doubt this high level of financial support and creative activity \nare major reasons why our state has developed a thriving medical \nproducts industry over the last two decades.\n  According to a recent survey of the Utah Life Science Association \nthere are currently 116 firms--employing a total of over 11,000 \npeople--engaged in the discovery and production of biomedical products \nin the state of Utah. Together, these firms produced revenues of $1.641 \nbillion last year.\n  Not only does this economic enterprise mean jobs for Utahns but also \ninnovative new products for Americans and our neighbors around the \nworld.\n  To give just one example, researchers at the University of Utah were \nco-discoverers of the BRCA 1 gene which is implicated in certain kinds \nof breast cancer. A start-up Salt Lake City biomedical research firm, \nMyriad Genetics, was also a partner in this ground breaking research, \nas were intramural researchers at the National Institutes of Health. \nBuilding upon this basic research, academic researchers at the Huntsman \nCancer Center at the University of Utah and private sector scientists \nat Myriad are playing a lead role in developing diagnostic tests and \ntherapeutics which are aimed at combating the devastation of breast \ncancer.\n  The success we have achieved in institutions of higher learning in \nUtah is also occurring across our Nation.\n  According to the latest data available from the Association of \nUniversity Technology Managers (AUTM), in 1997, the efforts of U.S. \nuniversities, academic health centers, and certain other non-profit \nresearch entities resulted in over 11,000 invention disclosures, over \n4,200 new patent applications being filed, and over 2,600 issued \npatents.\n  Also according to AUTM, in 1997, over 3,300 new licenses were \nexecuted and total licensing income reached nearly $700 million. An \neconomic model developed by AUTM estimates that about 250,000 jobs are \nattributable to commercializing academic research.\n  Government labs have also contributed to this success story. For \nexample, in FY 1998 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) received \nnearly $40 million in royalty income. Also in 1998, NIH intramural labs \nreported 287 invention disclosures; filed 132 patent applications; were \ngranted 171 patents; and, executed 215 licenses and 149 cooperative \nresearch and development agreements.\n\n  In sharp contrast to the vibrant research and technology \ncommercialization activities that are taking place in Utah and across \nour country today, the situation twenty years ago was vastly different. \nAccording to a 1978 survey, the federal government owned 78,000 patents \nbut only 5 percent were ever licensed.\n  Research and development is expensive, but it has been estimated that \nR accounts for only about 25% of the cost of bringing a new product \nto the market. Without adequate protection of intellectual property, it \nis simply not prudent for the private sector to invest in new \ntechnologies.\n  In response to the problem of federally supported science languishing \nin the laboratory, the Congress passed a portfolio of legislation in \nthe 1980s.\n  The purpose of these measures was simple: to provide incentives in \nthe intellectual property laws to help assure that federally-conducted \nand -supported research would be commercially developed so that the \nseeds of new ideas will be translated into the fruits of new products \nthat can benefit the American public.\n  My bill, S. 999, shares this goal and builds upon the previous \nintellectual property legislation in this area.\n  The ``Patent and Trademark Act Amendments of 1980'' (Public Law 96-\n517) is commonly termed the Bayh-Dole Act out of the well-earned \nrespect for its two far-sighted cosponsors, Senator Birch Bayh and \nSenator Bob Dole.\n  The Bayh-Dole Act created a uniform patent policy among the many \nfederal agencies that fund research and increased incentives for \nuniversities to engage in government-supported research. Under the act, \nsmall businesses and nonprofit organizations, including universities, \nwere permitted to retain ownership of patents stemming from federal \nfunds. In turn, patent holders could grant licenses to companies to \nfurther develop and commercialize the patented invention.\n  In 1986, Congress enacted the ``Federal Technology Transfer Act'' \n(Public Law 99-502). This law established new patenting, licensing and \npartnering policies for government laboratories. In concert with the \nphilosophy of the\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nBayh-Dole Act, the FTTA contemplates an activist role for government \nlaboratories in assisting in the journey from the laboratory to the \nmarket place. The FTTA amended the earlier ``Stevenson-Wydler \nTechnology Innovation Act of 1980'' (Public Law 96-480), which proved \ninsufficient to meet its intended charge of making transfer of federal \ntechnology a duty of all federal laboratories. In addition to mandating \na federal role in the technology transfer arena by strengthening the \nintellectual property laws in the areas of patenting and licensing, the \nFTTA created and embraced a unique device--the Cooperative Research and \nDevelopment Agreement (CRADA)--which encourages a government/private \nsector partnership in the earliest stages of research.\n  In devising S. 999, I have worked closely with several colleagues, \nmost prominently Representative Connie Morella, Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Technology of the House Committee on Science. Chairman \nMorella, whose district is the home of the National Institutes of \nHealth, has long been a leader in the area of technology policy. \nChairman Morella and Representative George Brown, the thoughtful \nranking member of the full Committee have often worked together in a \nbipartisan manner in this area and are cosponsors of H.R. 209, the \nHouse companion to S. 999.\n  In this Chamber, Senator Rockefeller has a long and distinguished \nrecord in the area of technology policy. Together with Senator Frist, \nSenator Rockefeller introduced similar legislation last Congress and \nonce again this year.\n  I am working with all of these Members, as well as with Senator \nMcCain, Chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, and the Senate and House leadership to secure passage of \nthis important legislation. Working together, I believe that we have \nsucceeded in building upon as well as correcting some problems \nidentified with the legislative proposals made last Congress, S. 2120 \nand H.R. 2544.\n  S. 999 amends the patent code to make explicit when federal agencies \nshould, and should not, grant exclusive licenses to its patented \ninventions.\n  The bill permits an exclusive or partially exclusive license only if \nsuch a license is reasonable and necessary to attract the necessary \nprivate sector investment capital or otherwise promote the invention's \nutilization. The bill requires the agency to evaluate a potential \nlicensee's development plans and level of capacity and commitment so \nthat only the level of necessary exclusivity is granted. Once a license \nagreement is executed the bill requires a rigorous periodic evaluation \nof progress under the agreement and allows the government to terminate \na license for non-performance of the terms of the license.\n  The bill also requires that in granting patent licenses the \ngovernment take into account possible effects on competition including \nany potential antitrust concerns. In the case of licensing inventions \ncovered by foreign patents, the government is directed to consider the \npossible U.S. interest in foreign trade and commerce.\n  In addition, the bill contains a domestic manufacturing requirement \nthat is designed to keep jobs created through newly patented \ntechnologies in the United States. As well, the legislation contains a \npreference for issuing licenses to small businesses--the sector of the \neconomy where most new jobs are created.\n  Under the bill, the government would retain a nontransferable, \nirrevocable, paid-up license to practice the invention on behalf of the \nUnited States Government in the unlikely event this need should arise.\n  Before any exclusive or partially exclusive license may be granted \nunder the authority of the patent code, the agency, except in cases of \ninventions made under an existing CRADA, must give at least 15 days \npublic notice and consider any comments that are submitted.\n  The bill treats any confidential commercial information as part of an \napplication or periodic performance report under normal Freedom of \nInformation Act principles.\n  Mr. President, the ``Technology Transfer Act of 1999'' builds upon \nearlier legislation in this critical area. I am honored to be following \nin the footsteps of our former Majority Leader, Senator Dole, and the \nformer Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Birch Bayh--father of \nthe new member of the Senate from Indiana.\n  I am also pleased to follow in the footsteps of my predecessors on \nthe Judiciary Committee, which was the locus of activity for the \nseminal 1980 legislation that amended the patent code and changed our \nnation's patent licensing policies.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 999.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 999\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \ncertain dealer derivative financial instruments, hedging transactions, \nand supplies as ordinary assets; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nCOMMODITY DERIVATIVE DEALERS AND ORDINARY BUSINESS HEDGING TRANSACTIONS\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I, along with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Don Nickles, am introducing legislation today to \nclarify the tax treatment of commodity derivative dealers and of \nordinary business hedging transactions. This legislation, which was \nproposed by the Administration in its Fiscal Year 2000 budget, is \nnecessary to eliminate the existing tax uncertainties with respect to \ndealer derivative transactions and hedging transactions.\n  Specifically, Internal Revenue Code section 1221 would be amended to \ninclude business hedging transaction in the list of ordinary assets and \nclarify that activities that ``manage'' rather than only ``reduce'' \nrisk are hedging activities. In addition, derivative contracts held by \nderivative dealers would similarly be treated as ordinary assets. \nCurrent tax and business practices treat derivative contracts held by \ncommodity derivatives dealers as ordinary property. Nevertheless, such \nderivative dealers are faced with uncertainties regarding the proper \nreporting of gains and losses from their dealer activities, unlike \ndealers in other transactions. Finally, supplies used in the provision \nof services for the production of ordinary property would be added to \nthe list of ordinary assets in section 1221. Such supplies are so \nclosely related to the taxpayer's business that ordinary character \nshould apply.\n  The Treasury Department has promulgated numerous regulations that \naffect derivatives contracts and our bill merely clarifies current law \ntreatment of dealer activities. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant and much needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Bryan, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1001. A bill to establish the National Youth Violence Commission, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 NATIONAL YOUTH VIOLENCE COMMISSION ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, three weeks after the tragic shooting \nin Littleton, Colorado, we as a national community are still struggling \nto make sense of this horrific event and the other school massacres \nthat preceded it. We are still searching for reasons why some of our \nchildren are slaughtering each other, and why there is generally so \nmuch violence surrounding our young people, not just in classrooms and \nschoolyards but on streetcorners and in homes across the country.\n  In this discussion, we have heard many factors cited as possible \ncauses, but few definitive conclusions or little consensus on exactly \nwhat or who is responsible for this alarming trend. In fact, one of the \nonly things that most Americans seem to agree on is that this is an \nextremely complicated problem, and that there is not any one answer. \nThey are right.\n  The search for common ground and common solutions began in earnest \nyesterday with the summit meeting the President convened at the White \nHouse. At that meeting the President opened a much-needed dialogue with \nthe entertainment and gun industries, yielding some important \ncommitments from the gun makers, but little if anything from the \nentertainment industry. The President also laid out a promising plan \nfor translating this conversation into action, calling for a national \ncampaign to change the pervading culture of violence, to mobilize a \nsustained response to this threat from every segment of our society, \nmuch as we have done in the fight against teen pregnancy.\n  We are here today to introduce legislation that we believe can make \nan important contribution to this national campaign, something that \nwill help us better understand as we prepare to act. Our proposal would \ncreate a select national commission on youth violence, whose mandate \nwould be to deliberately and dispassionately examine the many possible \nroot causes of this crisis of youth violence, to help us understand why \nso many kids are turning into killers, and to help us reach consensus \non how to curtail this recurring nightmare.\n  This commission would be composed of a wide array of experts in the \nfields of law enforcement, school administration, teaching and \ncounseling, parenting and family studies, and child and adolescent \npsychology, as well as Cabinet members and national religious leaders, \nto thoroughly study the different dimensions of this problem. After \ndeliberating for a year, the commission would be directed to report its \nconclusions to the President and Congress and recommend a series of \ntangible steps we could take to reduce the level of youth violence and \nprevent other families and communities from feeling the searing pain \nand grief that has visited the people of Littleton for the last three \nweeks.\n  Our proposal is not intended to forestall or preempt a more immediate \nresponse to what happened in Littleton. To the contrary, we each \nbelieve there are several steps that the Congress and different groups \nand industries could and should take now that would help us reduce not \njust the risk of another school massacre, but the daily death toll of \nyouth violence across America. Several of us here, for example, have \nand will continue to push the entertainment industry to stop glorifying \nand romanticizing violence, and in particular to stop marketing murder \nand mayhem directly to kids.\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\n  But we also believe that this extraordinary problem is not something \nthat we can solve overnight, or with any single piece of legislation. A \ncommission is no guarantee that we will find all the answers and bridge \nall the divisions, but we believe it provides as good a hope as any for \nthoughtfully doing so, and for making this national campaign a success.\n  In the coming days, we will offer this proposal as an amendment to \nthe juvenile justice bill. We will also be putting forward a companion \namendment calling for a Surgeon General's report on the public health \naspects of the youth violence epidemic, with a particular focus on the \ncontributing effects of entertainment media violence on children. This \nproposal, which the President endorsed at Monday's summit, is intended \nto inform the commission's work and hopefully raise public awareness of \nthe enormous role the entertainment culture plays in shaping the world \nour sons and daughters inhabit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed into \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a prospective payment system for services furnished by \npsychiatric hospitals under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n  medicare psychiatric hospital prospective payment system act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague John \nBreaux in sponsoring the Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective \npayment System Act of 1999.\n  This legislation will ensure the continuance of available impatient \npsychiatric care by reforming how Medicare pays for services in free-\nstanding psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general \nhospitals. It will establish a prospective payment system (PPS) \nCurrently psychiatric hospitals are the only institutional providers of \ncare under Medicare not scheduled to move to a PPS system.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) made major changes in the way \npsychiatric hospitals are paid. It reduced incentive payments and \nimposed a limit on what will be paid. The result of this was that many \nof these providers were hit by a big cut in the first year with no \ntransition period to adjust to the reductions. It is important that \nthese cuts not be continued because patient care may be put at risk. A \nrecent study found that 84% of psychiatric hospitals had payment \nreductions due to BBA. The average margin went from minus 3% to \nnegative 8.7%.\n  This legislation proposes to transition psychiatric inpatient \nproviders to a PPS which will allow these institutions to be able to \nplan and adjust for the future and insure their ability to provide \nquality care. The proposal also provides a measure of financial relief \nby limiting payment reductions to no more than 5% in the next two \nyears. This relief will then be paid back in a few years under PPS. \nAfter the third year, PPS will be in effect and per diem rates can be \nadjusted downward by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay \nback savings temporarily lost through the limitation of initial payment \nreductions. The goal is for the bill to be budget neutral over five \nyears and fully comply with the BBA.\n  The most important feature of this legislation is that it moves \npsychiatric facilities out of a cost based system and into a system \nwhere they will be paid prospectively, like most other Medicare \nProviders, and can manage their finances effectively to provide high \nquality psychiatric care.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1002\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincreased tax incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel and \nelectric vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the alternative fuels promotion act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today with my \ncolleagues Senators Hatch, Crapo, and Bryan the Alternative Fuels \nPromotion Act. This is an important bipartisan piece of legislation \nproviding tax incentives to help stimulate the still fledgling \nalternative fuel vehicle industry. It creates a $0.50 per gasoline \nequivalent gallon tax credit for natural gas, methanol, propane and \nhydrogen, thus almost leveling the tax treatment for all alternative \nfuels. The bill also contains provisions for extending the electric \nvehicle tax credit and augmenting it to encourage advanced technology \nvehicles. It also expands the existing tax deduction for alternative \nfuel fueling infrastructure to include the cost of installation. \nFinally, the bill gives states the authority to allow single occupant \nalternative fueled vehicles on high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.\n  I introduce this bill today because I believe that it is time for the \nnext automobile revolution.\n  I say revolution because as Webster's tells us, the word can mean ``a \nfundamental change in the way of thinking about something.''\n  One compelling argument for pursuing fundamental change when it comes \nto automobiles is the fact that we still need to reduce this nation's \ndependence on imported oil, for obvious reasons. After all, Saddam \nHussein didn't invade Kuwait to increase his supply of sand. We are at \nan historic high in our dependence on imported oil. Currently, we \nimport approximately one half of the oil consumed in this nation. \nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, that level is \nexpected to increase to more than sixty percent within the next decade, \nunless we do something dramatic to reverse the current trend. Even more \nforeboding is the fact that most of the oil we import is from the \nMiddle East. It makes no sense for us to stand idly by as this volatile \nregion of the world increases its potential stranglehold over the \nworld's economy.\n  It is also critical that we reduce the transportation sector's \nnegative impact on air quality. We are in the midst of an alarming \nincrease in reported asthma and other respiratory diseases. This \nproblem is esepcially acute among children and senior citizens. While \nthe automobile industry has made great strides in reducing emissions \nfrom cars and trucks, the improvement has been largely offset by the \ndramatically increasing number of cars, sport utility vehicles and \ntrucks on the road and the increasing number of miles these vehicles \nare driven each year. Clearly, doing something to cut air pollution and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example, requires enormous change \nin transportation.\n  The options for bringing about change in the transportation sector \nare limited. We can pursue punitive new taxes, mandates, or \nregulations. This approach, I believe, would result in job losses and \neconomic stagnation, situations that are not acceptable to either the \nAmerican people or the Congress. I believe the best way to bring about \nthe change we need is to provide incentives--to manufacturers to \ndevelop and sell clean technology--and to consumers to buy and use that \ntechnology.\n\n  The domestic automobile manufacturers have been developing a full \nmenu of clean, efficient vehicles for the 21st century. And unlike \nbefore, these vehicles are much closer to their gasoline-powered \ncounterparts in terms of performance, safety, comfort, and cost. Just \nrecently, two of our biggest automobile manufacturers unveiled their \nlatest fuel-cell-powered vehicles--the alternative fuel vehicle \nconsidered by many to be the car of the 21st century. Much of the \ntechnology incorporated into such advanced transportation \ntechnologies--hybrids, electric vehicles with advanced batteries, fuel \ncell vehicles as well as bi-fuel and flex-fuel vehicles--are a direct \nresult of the work government and industry have done together, in full \npartnership, through programs like the United States Advanced Battery \nConsortium and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles.\n  Perhaps most exciting is that some of these ``cars of the future'' \nare available today. Electric vehicles are being sold, albeit in small \nnumbers, to fleets nationwide, and to select target markets in \nCalifornia and Arizona. Also, most major automakers have alternative \nfuel vehicles available for either fleet or private purchase.\n  And there is encouraging news on the infrastructure front as well. \nAlternative fuel providers and electric utilities throughout the \ncountry are putting the infrastructure in place to support alternative \nfuel and electric vehicles in operation. By the end of 1998, nearly 300 \npublic charging sites with more than 600 chargers, as well as hundreds \nof home chargers, and a number of fleet installations, were established \nthroughout California and Arizona. We need more of this to happen \nnationally. There are also more than 110 methanol stations nationwide \nsupporting alternative and flex fuel vehicles. Also, compressed natural \ngas and other natural gas-based fuels are developing infrastructure as \nwell. For example, in my state of West Virginia alone there are over 40 \ncompressed natural gas fueling stations.\n  I think this is all evidence that we have indeed initiated an \nautomotive revolution. Unfortunately, the market hasn't developed as \nquickly as we thought it would when we passed the Energy Policy Act of \n1992 with such high hopes. And perhaps we were too optimistic about \nwhat would be required by both government and industry to build a \nsustainable market for the technology.\n  So, what can we do to speed things up? How can we make sure there are \nmore vehicles available, get more people to buy them, and develop the \ninfrastructure to sustain them?\n  First, as I mentioned earlier, the alternative fuel and electric \nvehicle markets started more slowly than I think many of us expected. \nTherefore, we need to extend the phase-out dates of current tax \ncredits. This would continue to help us ``jumpstart'' the market for \nelectric vehicles, and lay out a longer-term incentive policy. Also, I \nfeel that hard work and progress should be encouraged. Electric \nvehicles with extended range capability are the result of additional \ninvestments in research and technology. This behavior needs to be \nrewarded.\n  Second, there needs to be more support for the development of an \neffective alternative fuel fueling infrastructure. For too long, we \nbeen caught in a `chicken and egg' cycle, with the infrastructure not \navailable to support alternative fuel vehicles, and consumers not \ninterested in the vehicles because there's not support infrastructure. \nWe need to break this cycle by creating better tax incentives to help \ndevelop alternative fuel infrastructure. The current tax deductions for \ncapitol equipment is not sufficient since a large portion of the \noverall cost may be associated with the actual cost of installation.\n\n  Finally, we must make alternative fuels, like natural gas, methanol, \npropane and hydrogen, economically attractive to producers, \ndistributors,\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\nmarketers and buyers. If consumers see affordable new fuels available \nat their local fueling stations, they will be much more likely to \nactually use an alternative fuel vehicle. Tax incentives have \ntraditionally been very effective in encouraging consumers to try new \ntechnology. While changing consumer's behavior is not easy, I am \nconfident that if people begin to see that alternative fuels are \navailable and affordable, they will soon begin to use them. Without the \neconomic drive at every link in the fuel chain any alternative fuel \neffort will not succeed.\n  This is why today I along with my colleagues are introducing the \nAlternative Fuels Promotion Act.\n  This bill contains provisions for extending the $4,000 tax credit for \nelectric vehicles until 2010. It also grants an additional $5,000 tax \ncredit for electric vehicles that meet a 100 mile range requirement. \nThese provisions will help electric vehicle commercialization and \nresearch to move forward at a faster pace, and will mean that more \npeople will be able to buy electric vehicles.\n  However, few people will buy electric vehicles and other \nalternatively fueled vehicles if there is nowhere to refuel them. I \nwant to encourage the development of these stations. Therefore, my bill \nexpands the current tax deduction for alternative fuel fueling capital \nequipment to include the cost of installation. This will allow more \ninfrastructure for electric and alternative fuel vehicles to be \ninstalled and used.\n  The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act also makes clean-burning \nalternative fuels economically attractive. The bill provides a $0.50 \nper gasoline equivalent gallon tax credit to the seller of compressed \nnatural gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol, propane or hydrogen. This \nwill allow these non-petroleum fuels to become more economically \nfavorable to the consumer through lower prices at the pump. It also \nplaces these fuels on tax parity with other alternatives. By giving the \ntax credit to the seller of the fuel, it reduces the paperwork burden \non the individual consumer, and allows for easier dispersal of the \ncredit throughout the production/delivery/marketing chain so that all \nparties are interested in increasing the consumption of alternative \nfuels.\n  Finally, the Alternative Fuel Promotion Act gives states the ability \nto decide if they want to allow single occupant alternative fuel and \nelectric vehicles in HOV lanes. This is, I feel, a strong incentive \nthat states should be allowed, but not required, to give to owners of \nthese special vehicles.\n  We know that when national policy works in support of the energies \nand potential of the private sector, far more progress can be made at a \nfar faster rate. The private sector is leading the way in developing \nalternatives fuel vehicle technology. We need to provide consumers with \na strong financial incentive to use this technology. Certainly, our \ncontinued dependence on foreign oil and the contribution of \nconventionally powered vehicles to air pollution should drive us to \ntry. In my case, I see exciting prospects for new uses of West \nVirginia's natural resources and other economic benefits for my state--\nalong with other states. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill \nand I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1)(A) Since 1994, the United States has imported over half \n     its oil.\n       (B) Without efforts to mitigate this dependence on foreign \n     oil, the percentage of oil imported is expected to grow to \n     all-time highs.\n       (C) This reliance on foreign oil presents a national \n     security risk, which Congress should address through policy \n     changes designed to increase the use of domestically-\n     available alternative transportation fuels.\n       (2)(A) The importing of a majority of the oil used in the \n     United States contributes negatively to the balance of trade \n     of the United States.\n       (B) Assuring the Nation's economic security demands the \n     development and promotion of domestically-available \n     alternative transportation fuels.\n       (3)(A) The reliance on oil as a transportation fuel has \n     numerous negative environmental consequences, including \n     increasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n       (B) Developing alternative transportation fuels will help \n     address these environmental impacts by reducing emissions.\n       (4) In order to encourage installation of alternative \n     fueling infrastructure, and make alternative fuels \n     economically favorable to the producer, distributor, \n     marketer, and consumer, tax credits provided at the point of \n     distribution into an alternative fuel vehicle are necessary.\n       (5)(A) In the short-term, United States alternative fuel \n     policy must be made fuel neutral.\n       (B) Fuel neutrality will foster private innovation and \n     commercialization using the most technologically feasible and \n     economic fuels available.\n       (C) This will allow market forces to decide the alternative \n     fuel winners and losers.\n       (6)(A) Tax credits which have been in place have led to \n     increases in the quantity and quality of alternative fuel \n     technology available today.\n       (B) Extending these credits is an efficient means of \n     promoting alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fueling \n     infrastructures.\n       (7)(A) The Federal fleet is one of the best customers for \n     alternative fuel vehicles due to its combination of large \n     purchasing power, tight record keeping, geographic diversity, \n     and high fuel usage.\n       (B) For these reasons, the National Energy Policy Act of \n     1991 required Federal fleets to purchase certain numbers of \n     alternatively-fueled vehicles.\n       (C) In most cases, these requirements have not been met.\n       (D) Efforts must be made to ensure that all Federal \n     agencies comply with Federal fleet purchase requirement laws \n     and executive orders.\n                        TITLE I--TAX INCENTIVES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Alternative Fuels Promotion Act, together with my colleagues, \nSenators Rockefeller, Crapo, and Bryan. The legislation we introduce \ntoday will help to solve one of our Nation's most expensive problems--\nair pollution.\n  As air pollution was introduced at the beginning of this century, it \nis fitting that, at century's end, we should find solutions to this \nvexing problem.\n  Automobiles are a major source of pollution in our urban areas. Past \nefforts to address this mobile-source pollution have been fraught with \npitfalls; and, as a result, the effort to control automobile emissions \nhas progressed in fits and starts. The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act \navoids past mistakes, leaving behind command-and-control mandates from \nCongress and providing market-based incentives for consumers and for \nmuch needed infrastructure development.\n  Mr. President, as we speak, my State of Utah is engaged in a mammoth \nroad construction project on Interstate 15. This freeway runs right \nthrough Salt Lake City and through three counties in Utah that have \nstruggled to meet national clean air standards.\n  It might suggest that we should not improve or repair highways. Could \nit be that the availability of convenient and efficient roadways is in \npart responsible for our emissions problem? I doubt it. While the \nEisenhower vision of a vast nation connected by interstate highways may \nhave encouraged more people to commute or vacation by car, the fact is \nthat vehicular traffic is increasing almost everywhere. One-car \nfamilies have become two-car and three-car families.\n  I do not believe that more cars crowded onto old and inefficient \nhighways is the answer. In fact, slow-moving traffic is part of the \nproblem.\n  According to a recent study by Utah's Division of Air Quality, on-\nroad vehicles account for 22 percent of coarse particulate matter in \nUtah. Particulate matter can be harmful to those already suffering from \nchronic respiratory or heart disease, influenza, or asthma. Automobiles \nalso account for 34 percent of hydrocarbon and 52 percent of nitrogen \noxide emissions in my state. These two pollutants react in sunlight to \nform ozone, which in turn reduces lung function in humans and hurts our \nresistance to colds and asthma. Ozone may also lead to premature aging \nof lung tissue. In Utah, vehicles account for a whopping 87 percent of \ncarbon monoxide emissions. Carbon monoxide can be harmful to persons \nwith heart, respiratory, or circulatory ailments.\n  Mr. President, while Utah has made important strides in improving air \nquality, more vehicular miles are driven every year. If we are to have \ncleaner air, we must encourage low emission alternative fuels or \nelectric power.\n  The need for alternative fuels will dramatically increase as the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency continues to implement its new, \nstricter clean air standards. With the tighter standards, some of \nUtah's counties will, once again, face non-attainment. Under the Clean \nAir Act, the EPA can impose sanctions on a state's highway fund if it \ndetermines a state has not adequately implemented plans to attain air \nquality standards, a sanction which, as I have suggested, may actually \nbe counterproductive.\n  Nevertheless, non-attainment can be a costly enterprise, whether due \nto the loss of federal highway money or to the expensive measures taken \nto reach attainment. And, as I have suggested, may be \ncounterproductive.\n  By the EPA's own estimates, the annual cost of achieving the new \nozone standard in 2010 will be about $9.6 billion. Additionally, the \nEPA puts the annual cost of achieving the PM 2.5 standard at $37 \nbillion, making for a combined total cost of $47 billion annually. Mr. \nPresident, our most recent census count estimated that there are 65 \nmillion families in the U.S. So, by the EPA's own account, implementing \nthe new air quality standards will cost about $723 per family every \nyear.\n  Wouldn't it be wise, Mr. President, to invest some of that money in \nthe development of alternative fuels?\n  Take natural gas as an example. Natural gas is one of the cleanest \nburning fuels available. Add to this, methanol, propane has a variety \nof options that would allow Americans to continue to drive their cars, \nwhile dramatically cutting back on air pollution.\n  Mr. President, research has brought us a number of excellent options \nto replace our dependency on traditional gasoline powered autos. It \nappears that our last obstacle remains bringing these alternatives to \nthe marketplace. Past efforts to do so have failed to produce the \nhoped-for results because they have been too heavy on mandates and too \nweak on incentives to car buyers and to improve infrastructure.\n  Clearly, if consumers are to begin buying alternative fuel vehicles, \ntwo elements must be in place: first, the price for vehicles and their \nfuel must be right; second, the consumer must feel confident that the \ninfrastructure is in place with refueling stations widely available.\n\n  This is where the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act comes into play. \nWith this legislation, we take important steps forward to meet these \ngoal without mandates. The only requirement in this bill is that \nfederal agencies submit an annual report on their use of alternative \nfuel vehicles in their fleets.\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\n  The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act encourages customers to purchase \nalternative fuels through a tax credit. Congress has already given \nethanol users a tax credit of 54 cents per gallon. When adjusted for \nits energy capacity, ethanol's gasoline-gallon equivalent credit equals \n82 cents. Our legislation levels the playing field by extending a 50-\ncent gasoline-gallon equivalent tax credit for the other alternative \nfuels, such as hydrogen, natural gas, propane, methanol, and \nelectricity.\n  There currently exists a tax credit for the purchase of electric \nvehicles. Our bill would extend the life of that credit, giving a \ncontinued incentive for companies to develop this technology. The \ncurrent tax credit equals 10 percent of the purchase price of the \nvehicle, up to $4,000. Our legislation would extend the sunset date for \nthis credit to 2010 and give an additional $5,000 credit toward any \nelectric vehicle with a range over 100 miles.\n  Mr. President, consumers will never be interested in alternative fuel \nvehicles until a strong infrastructure is developed. Under current law, \nthere is a $100,000 tax deduction for the capital costs of equipment at \nalternative fuel stations. This legislation extends that benefit to \nconstruction and installation costs at a new filling station. Often \nconstructions costs outweigh capital costs as a barrier to the \ninstallation of new alternative fuel stations.\n  These measures will jump start a movement already under way toward \nincreased use of alternative fuel vehicles. In California and Arizona \nthere are already about 300 public charging sites for electric \nvehicles. Utah has led the way in natural gas infrastructure. An owner \nof a natural gas vehicle can crisscross my state from Logan in the \nnorth to St. George in the south, and from Salt Lake to the eastern \nborder finding filling stations all along the way. This is progress, \nbut much more needs to be done.\n  Mr. President, I believe the momentum is building in this nation for \na leap forward in the use of alternative fuel vehicles. There is broad \nagreement that our approach with this legislation is the proper course \nto help promote this step. In a letter to me, Utah's Clean Cities \nCoalition signaled its support for this measure. I quote, ``We believe \nthat for the people living in urban Utah now is a good time to take \nstrong action to encourage Utahns to buy alternative, clean-burning \nvehicles. We ask that you support the 50-cent per gallon tax credit.''\n  This bill has also gained the support of the Wasatch Clean Air \nCoalition in Utah. They stated, ``We believe this tax credit would have \na strong positive impact on our local air quality by encouraging the \nuse of alternative fuels, and increasing the portion of cars on our \nroads fueled by alternative fuels.''\n  Finally, the American Lung Association has told me that, ``Motor \nvehicles are a major source of pollution along the Wasatch Front. While \nautomobiles do run cleaner these days, and while alternative forms of \ntransportation are being considered, more needs to be done to address \nthe current and future sources of emissions and poor air quality. One \nreasonable strategy to cut down on the amount of pollutants in the air \nis to increase the use of clean fuel vehicles. Vehicles that run on \nnatural gas, propane or electric simply are cleaner burning than those \nfueled by gasoline or diesel. . . . This legislation will encourage an \nincreased number of clean fuel vehicles on the road, and clean air for \nyears to come.''\n  Mr. President, I think we all know that 50 years down the road, we \nwill not still be using petroleum fueled vehicles to the same extent we \ndo today. This legislation is an attempt to bring the benefits of \ncleaner air to our citizens sooner, to free our cities from expensive \nEPA regulations, and to reduce our consumption of foreign oil. This \nlegislation enables us to tackle these problems with incentives, not \nmandates. I urge my colleagues to join us in this future-minded \napproach to cleaning our air.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Alternative Fuels \nPromotion Act, which is introduced today by Senators Rockefeller, \nHatch, Bryan, and myself.\n  There are many reasons for my support of the Alternative Fuels \nPromotion Act offered today, in the Senate. A number of those reasons \nmay not be immediately evident, given that the merits of alternative \nfuels are most often spoken in terms of environmental protection. While \nthere are significant environmental benefits that can be gained from \nthis bill, there are also benefits to be obtained in national security, \npromotion of the domestic oil industry, the encouragement of business \ndevelopment and innovation, and increased options for the consumer.\n  Over half of the oil consumed in the United States is produced \noverseas. Internal combustion vehicles, cars, and trucks, are the \nprimary market for this cheap and readily available source of energy. \nWe, as a nation, have become complacent in our assumption that this \nstream of easily obtainable fuel will flow forever. It is time for this \nassumption to be challenged. Most of us have viewed this as simply an \neconomic issue: buy what is cheapest and most available. However, this \nsource of fuel is vulnerable to interruption by foreign governments \nthrough changing attitudes toward the U.S., foreign policy or military \nconflict. The United States should take positive and sure steps toward \ndeveloping domestically available alternative sources of fuel in order \nthat our economy and accustomed way of life cannot be threatened by the \nwhims and troubles of those outside of our borders.\n  The flood of foreign oil into the U.S. has left the domestic oil \nindustry fighting for its life. Our support for alternative fueled \nvehicles should not be interpreted as a challenge or competition to the \ndomestic oil industry. In direct contrast, it recognizes the importance \nof that industry of our national security. Petroleum products and \nfuels, including gasoline, will be needed far into the future for the \ntransportation requirements of individuals, mass transportation, and \nconveyance of goods. The development of alternative fuels that are \nplentiful in this country, in conjunction with support for our domestic \noil industry, will provide us a level of economic national security \nthat we have not experienced for most of this century. By our efforts \nto revive the U.S. oil industry and the development of alternative \nfuels and vehicles, we will not be held hostage by foreign governments \nin gas lines again.\n  The number of innovative alternative fuel technologies is \nencouraging. This bill supports the further development of vehicles \nthat are powered by electricity, fuel cells, methanol, and various \nforms of natural gas. Tax incentives are already in place for other \ntechnologies such as ethanol. Support for all promising alternative \nfuels is warranted in order to give consumers options for choosing \nthose vehicles that will best serve their needs; whether a company \nrequires a fleet of natural gas powered buses to transport their \nemployees of work sites, or an individual's preference for an electric \nvehicle for in-town use to commute to work or run errands.\n  The enactment of tax incentives for emerging technologies is the \nlogical way to encourage the development of cost effective alternative \nfueled vehicles, without the federal government mandating a preference. \nLeveling the tax incentive playing field within the alternative fuel \nenergy sector will encourage partnerships between traditional providers \nof transportation and fuel products, and new companies with promising \ninnovations. Instead of fighting change, traditional industry providers \nwill participate in it and benefit from it. Increased market demand for \nalternative fuel vehicle technologies will also provide an opportunity \nand an incentive for the federal government to place greater emphasis \non research and development in this industry sector. The results of \nwhich can then be leveraged into the private market.\n  While the environmental benefits of cleaner burning fuels are often \nthe most talked about and often the most evident; we should not \ndiscount the benefits that can be gained by developing our nation's \nenergy independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 1004. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to reduce \ntelephone rates, provide advanced telecommunications services to \nschools, libraries, and certain health care facilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\n           SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES INTERNET ACCESS ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing \ntoday, along with Senator Inhofe, the Schools and Libraries Internet \nAccess Act of 1999. This bill addresses a timely and critical issue, \nthat of the implementation of the schools and libraries program. \nRecently, new charges began appearing on people's telephone bills. \nThese are the charges which providers are assessing to pay for the \nexpansion of ``universal service'' in the form of the ``schools and \nlibraries'' program. This bill is especially timely since Chairman \nKennard announced last week that he's calling for a $1 billion annual \nincrease in the e-rate program. That's an additional Billion in taxes \nthat would be enacted without any review or commentary in Congress, \nand, most importantly, without a vote by our citizens' representatives. \nCongress needs to step to the plate and provide specific funding for \nthis program that we all feel is important for rural and low-income \nregions.\n  I don't think anyone in the Senate ever thought that the limited \nlanguage which we included in the 1996 Act would be used to create a \nmassive new entitlement program through universal service. Universal \nservice has historically meant the provision of telecommunications \nservices to all Americans, regardless of geographical location. The FCC \nhas expanded the definition of universal service to include broad-\nranging social programs, which has caused the Commission's progress \ntoward maintaining universal service to be delayed. While such goals as \nproviding Internet access to schools and libraries may be laudable, \nthey were never meant to be part of universal service as it has \ntraditionally been known. Indeed, a huge additional burden has been \nplaced on rural states like Montana in meeting these newfound \ndefinitions.\n  I want to make it clear, however, that I have always supported the \ngoal of connecting all of our schools to the Internet, as well as the \nprovision of advanced telecommunications services to rural health care \ncenters. I just felt that it was wrong to fund these programs on the \nbacks of American consumers. It is with this in mind that I have \nproposed using an outdated 3 percent excise tax on telephones to fund \nthe schools and libraries and rural health care programs. Currently, \nnone of the money collected by the tax goes to fund telephone service \nfor Americans.\n  This tax was designed to fund World War I and was instituted in an \nera where telephones were a luxury. Well, World War I should be paid \nfor by now and phones are certainly no longer a luxury item. The 3 \npercent tax was kept alive to provide revenue to offset the deficit. In \ntoday's climate of budgetary surplus, this justification no longer \nmakes sense. My proposal calls for cutting the excise tax by two-thirds \nand using the remaining third to fund the schools and libraries program \nand the rural health care program.\n  This proposal is a win/win solution. It's a win for consumers, since \nit would eliminate the need for new charges on telephone service. It's \na win for taxpayers, who would see billions of dollars in current taxes \neliminated. It's a win for our schools, libraries and rural health care \ncenters, who would see their programs fully funded without threatening \nuniversal service. With the support of the other members of Congress \nand the leadership of the Senate, I believe this proposal can solve the \ncurrent crisis we face in funding the schools and libraries and rural \nhealth care programs.\n  The Schools and Libraries Internet Access Act of 1999 is an important \neffort to shape the future of online access. I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to support the passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1005. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \nnational minimum sentences for individuals convicted of operating motor \nvehicles under the influence of alcohol; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                      deadly driver reduction act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am announcing new legislation \nthat will go even further in taking drunk drivers off the road. This \nlegislation means three strikes and, then, you lose your license.\n  This would set nation-wide standards for license revocation for drunk \ndrivers. Currently, states have a patchwork of laws that range from a \nfifteen day suspension to a ten year revocation for a third offense. \nThis bill would require that all states adopt at least the following \nfor each level of conviction, otherwise they would face a 10 percent \ncut in their highway funds.\n  For the first offense, this bill calls for a six-month license \nrevocation, $500 fine, and assessment of alcohol abuse. If a person's \nblood alcohol content (BAC) is .16 or greater, his or her punishment \nincludes a ceiling of .05 BAC for the next five years, impoundment/\nimmobilization of his car for 30 days, an ignition interlock for 180 \ndays, and 10 days in jail or 60 hours of community service.\n  For the second offense, the repeat offender receives a one year \nlicense revocation, a ceiling of .05 BAC for the next five years, \nimpoundment/immobilization of his or her car for 60 days, ignition \ninterlock for a year, 10 days jail or 60 hours of community service, \nand an assessment of alcohol abuse.\n  And, finally, for the third offense, the repeat offender will lose \nhis driver's license permanently.\n  With a tough license-revocation law, we can save hundreds of lives \neach year. This is the next logical step in the fight against drunk \ndriving. It will build on what we started in 1984, when Democrats and \nRepublicans joined together to increase the drinking age to 21. Back \nthen, the liquor lobby issued all kinds of dire warnings that the \nindustry would not survive that legislation. But of course, the \nindustry did survive. And more than 10,000 drunk-driving deaths were \nprevented.\n  We need this legislation. Remember, drunk-driving deaths are not \n``accidents.'' They are the result of somebody's irresponsible and \ncriminally reckless behavior.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1005\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to end the use of conventional steel-jawed leghold \ntraps on animals in the United States; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5052-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5052-S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STEEL-JAWED LEGHOLD TRAP ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators Boxer, \nFeinstein, Kerry (Ma.), Lautenberg and I rise to introduce legislation \nto end the use of the conventional steel-jawed leghold trap. I rise to \ndraw this country's attention to the many liabilities of this outdated \ndevice and ask for my colleagues support in ending its use.\n  While this bill does not prohibit trapping, it does outlaw a \nparticularly savage method of trapping by prohibiting the import or \nexport of, and the interstate shipment of conventional steel-jawed \nleghold traps and articles of fur from animals caught in such traps.\n  The conventional steel-jawed leghold trap is a cruel and antiquated \ndevice for which many alternatives exist. The American Veterinary \nMedical Association and the American Animal Hospital Association have \ncondemned leghold traps as ``inhumane'' and the majority of Americans \noppose the use of this class of trap. California became the fourth \nstate in recent years to pass a statewide ballot initiative to ban \nsteel-jawed leghold traps--Arizona, Colorado, and Massachusetts are the \nother three states to have decided the issue by a direct vote of the \npeople. A number of other states, including Florida, New Jersey, and \nRhode Island, have legislative or administrative bans on these devices. \nIn addition, 88 nations have banned their use.\n  This important and timely issue now takes on added importance as the \nUnited States and the European Union (E.U.) recently reached an \nagreement to implement humane trapping standards. This agreement \nrequires the U.S. to phase out leghold traps. Without this agreement, \nthe E.U. would have prohibited the importation of U.S. fur from \nthirteen species commonly captured with leghold traps. Adoption of my \nlegislation will fulfill the U.S. obligation to the E.U. and reduce \ntremendous and unnecessary suffering of animals. By ending the use of \nthe conventional steel-jawed leghold trap within our borders, we will \neffectively set a humane standard for trapping, as well as protect the \nU.S. fur industry by keeping Europe's doors open to U.S. fur.\n  One quarter of all U.S. fur exports, $44 million, go to the European \nmarket. Of this $44 million, $21 million would be eliminated by the \nban. This would clearly cause considerable economic damage to the U.S. \nfur industry, an important source of employment for many Americans. \nSince many Americans rely on trapping for their livelihood, it is \nimperative to find a solution which prevents the considerable damage \nthat this ban would cause to our fur industry. It is important to note \nthat since the steel-jawed leghold trap has been banned in Europe, \nalternatives have been provided to protect and maintain the European \nfur industry.\n  Our nation would be far better served by ending the use of the \narchaic and inhumane steel-jawed leghold trap. By doing so, we are not \nonly setting a long-overdue humane standard for trapping, we are \nensuring that the European market remains open to all American fur \nexports.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1008. A bill to modify the standards for responding to import \nsurges under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, to establish \nmechanisms for import monitoring and the prevention of circumvention of \nUnited States trade laws, and to strengthen the enforcement of United \nStates trade remedy laws; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    import surge relief act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. Again, I thank my good friend from \nMinnesota, as well as the Presiding Officer from Wyoming, who was very \ngenerous in allowing us to proceed at this time.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Import Surge Relief Act \nof\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\n1999, an important measure that will provide a new and improved way to \ndeal expeditiously with import surges. A sudden increase in imports in \nany sector, especially when these imports are shipped to us at rock \nbottom prices, has done grave damage to American business and American \nagriculture. This has been true in the past. It is true today. And, \ngiven the increased volatility that we see in the global trading and \nfinancial system, import surges are likely to create even greater havoc \nin our economy in the future.\n  The steel industry and its workers have been seriously injured, and \nwe read about these stories almost daily. The agriculture industry and \nour farmers and ranchers face constant threats from surges in wheat, \nbeef, lamb, pork and more. At a time when our rural and industrial \ncommunities are facing an all-time crisis, this damage goes to the very \nheart of our economy and our society.\n  The Import Surge Relief Act makes several critical improvements in \nSection 201 of U.S. trade law. This is the so-called ``safeguard'' \nprovision that is designed to prevent serious disruption of our \ndomestic industry because of imports. The improvements I am proposing \ninclude the following:\n  Easing the standard that must be met to demonstrate that there is a \ncausal link between imports and injury to the U.S. industry, speeding \nup the process for addressing import surges, an absolutely critical \nneed to prevent an industry from being devastated before action is \ntaken, requiring that the President, in deciding whether to take \naction, focus more than he has in the past on the beneficial impact of \na remedy, rather than on the negative impact on other industries, \nmaking provisional relief available on an urgent basis, and correcting \nthe way in which imports are counted to prevent circumvention.\n  In addition, the bill provides for a system that will give us an \nearly warning about import surges. We simply cannot wait until we see \nthat an America industry is devastated. We must be able to project \nahead, understand the threats facing an industry, and then consider \nquickly what type of action to take, if any.\n\n  Finally, the bill requires that there be an investigation about \nunderlying problems in agricultural and steel trade. This investigation \nwould focus on anti-competitive practices overseas, including cartel \narrangements beyond the borders of the United States.\n  Mr. President, the United States will remain the most open market in \nthe world. I am committed to that. At the same time, we must do \neverything we can to open foreign markets that retain barriers to our \nmanufactured goods, agricultural products, and services. And, we must \nbe sure that our domestic industry is able to adjust and adapt to \nimport surges without experiencing the devastation to our businesses, \nfarms, and communities that we have seen far too often in the past.\n  Let me discuss the Import Relief Act in more detail.\n  The bill changes the causation standard that links imports and \ninjury. Instead of the requirement that imports be a ``substantial \ncause of serious injury, or threat thereof'', this bill requires only \nthat imports cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury. Imports would \nnot have to be the leading, or most important, cause of injury. This \nchange conforms to the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission practice has been to examine \ninjury over a five year period. This practice ignores the problem of \nimport surges where imports do not build up gradually over years but \ncome into this country full blast in a precipitous way. This bill \nrequires the ITC also to consider whether there has been a substantial \nincrease in imports over a short time period.\n  The President has discretion to deny relief after the ITC recommends \nsuch action, if he believes that the economic and social costs outweigh \nthe benefits. This bill requires that the President grant the relief \nrecommended by the ITC unless it would have an adverse impact on the \nUnited States substantially out of proportion to the benefits. This \nwould increase the likelihood that the President will implement the \nremedy that the ITC recommends.\n  The time period for provisional relief is reduced from ninety days to \nsixty days so that relief would come more quickly to the industry and \nworkers.\n  The bill adds to the factors that ITC must consider in determining \nwhether serious injury is occurring. These new factors are just common \nsense, such as the level of sales, the level of production, \nproductivity of the industry, capacity utilization, profit and loss, \nand employment levels. The ITC should focus on current conditions in \nthe industry, not only historical factors. In addition, the bill \nrequires the ITC to consider conditions in foreign industries that \nindicate further possible increases in exports to the U.S. in the \nfuture. Looking at factors such as foreign production capacity, \ninventories, and demand in third countries will allow ITC to understand \nthe threat to the American industry and its imminence.\n  Provisional relief is improved in several ways. The ITC must look at \nwhether there is an import surge to determine if provisional relief \nshould be provided. Also, USTR, the Senate Finance Committee, or the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee can request provisional relief when they \nhave requested initiation of a Section 201 investigation.\n  The bill applies to Section 201 those provisions already in U.S. \nantidumping and countervailing duty law that ensure that the ITC, in \nits injury analysis, not double-count production by the domestic \nindustry when upstream and/or downstream products are the subject of an \ninvestigation.\n  Domestic industries will be able to request that imports be monitored \nand data collected.\n  The bill allows the Office of Management and Budget to release \npreliminary trade data when there is an import surge. This will improve \nthe ability of the industry to detect a problem quickly.\n  A new import monitoring and enforcement support program for steel and \nagricultural products will monitor illegal transshipments and other \nattempts to circumvent U.S. trade remedy laws.\n  A suffix to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for products subject to \ntrade actions will help track imports of those products.\n  The Commerce Department will continue its current steel import \nmonitoring program.\n  The ITC will conduct an investigation of anticompetitive activities \nin international agriculture and steel trade, focusing especially on \ncartels and other anticompetitive practices. The ITC will report to the \nSenate Finance and Agriculture Committees, the House Ways and Means and \nAgriculture Committees, and USTR and must propose steps to address \nthose anticompetitive practices.\n  I again repeat my praise to the Presiding Officer who has been \nexcessively generous and gracious in the way he has conducted himself \nas the Presiding Officer allowing us to make these statements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1010. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a medical innovation tax credit for clinical testing research \nexpenses attributable to academic medical centers and other qualified \nhospital research organizations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               medical innovation tax credit legislation\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that I believe will be beneficial to the continued success \nof our nation's medical schools and teaching hospitals. The bill will \nprovide for a new tax credit, the ``Medical Innovation Tax Credit,'' \nwhich will serve as an incentive for private sector firms to invest in \nclinical research at these important institutions.\n\n  Medical schools and teaching hospitals fulfill a unique societal and \neconomic role in the United States today. They are not only the \ntraining ground for health care professionals but are also centers for \nimportant research and development activities that lead to crucial \nmedical breakthroughs. Because they link together research, medical \ntraining and patient care, these institutions are incubators of new \nlife-saving drugs, medical services and surgical techniques.\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\n  Due to the changing health care marketplace these institutions have \ncome under increasing cost pressures that threaten their future. In \nfact, a recent study by the American Association of Medical Colleges \n(AAMC) noted an alarming 22 percent decline in clinical research \nconducted at member hospitals. I believe the medical innovation tax \ncredit would help reverse this disturbing trend, and I am pleased that \nthe AAMC endorses this legislation.\n  The medical innovation tax credit is a targeted, incremental 20 \npercent credit for qualified medical innovation expenditures on \nbiopharmaceutical research activities, like clinical trials performed \nat qualified educational institutions. The tax credit would enhance the \nflow of private-sector funds into medical schools and teaching \nhospitals by providing an important incentive for companies to perform \nmore clinical trials research at these non-profit institutions. This \ncredit will encourage pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to \ndevelop research partnerships with medical schools and teaching \nhospitals. The influx of funds from this research will help counteract \nsome of the financial pressures these institutions have been \nexperiencing. To qualify for the credit, research would have to be \nperformed in the United States, so companies will not have an incentive \nto utilize lower-cost foreign facilities for research activities.\n  It is significantly more expensive for companies to perform clinical \ntrials at teaching hospitals than at commercial research organizations. \nThe medical innovation tax credit will reduce this cost differential. \nBy leveraging additional private-sector support for these institutions \nin the form of clinical trial research, this new credit will also help \nthese hospitals make the adjustment to the reduction in Medicare \npayments mandated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  This legislation is critically important to institutions like \nFletcher Allen Health Care in my home state of Vermont. Linked with the \nUniversity of Vermont's Division of Health Sciences, Fletcher Allen's \nhospitals combine teaching and research. They are vital training sites \nfor the next generation of physicians, nurses and other health \nprofessionals. In Fletcher Allen's nationally known Clinical Research \nCenter, researchers seek to solve the mysteries of cancer, heart \nattacks, Alzheimer's disease, chronic obesity, cystic fibrosis and \nother illnesses. The medical innovation tax credit would help Fletcher \nAllen and hundreds of other institutions across the United States \ncontinue in their role as incubators of vital, innovative medical \nteaching and research technologies.\n  Legislation similar to this was introduced last year; the Joint \nCommittee on taxation estimated that the bill would result in lost \nrevenues of approximately one million dollars per year over the next \nfive years. The bill I am introducing today is substantially similar to \nthe bill introduced last year, although there have been technical \nchanges to the definition of ``qualified academic institution'' to \nclarify that research expenditures at Veterans' Administration \nhospitals and certain non-profit research foundations qualify for the \ncredit. As these changes are expected to affect a relatively small \nnumber of institutions, I do not expect substantial changes in the cost \nestimate. I believe this is a small price to pay for the favorable \nimpact this credit will have on research at medical schools and \nteaching hospitals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 1011.

Mr. President, today is Tax Freedom Day--the day \nthat reflects how many days into the year a taxpayer must work in order \nto pay taxes. In 1913, when Congress first levied an income tax, Tax \nFreedom Day was January 30, and only 6 years ago, Tax Freedom Day was \nApril 30--today it is two weeks into May before the taxpayer can stop \nworking for the Federal Government and start working for him or \nherself.\n  It is thus fitting that I introduce today the Frist tax package--four \ntax bills that I believe will go a long way toward pushing Tax Freedom \nDay back toward January. This tax package is based on a set of core \nprinciples:\n  (1) Taxes are too high.\n  (2) The tax code is too complex.\n  (3) The tax code punishes taxpayers for working longer and smarter.\n  (4) The tax code does not promote savings for people of all ages and \nincomes.\n  We all know that taxes are too high. At a time when our tax burden as \na percentage of GDP is at a post-World War II high and we are working \nlonger and longer just to pay taxes, I believe that it is time for some \ntax relief for hard-working Americans. Taxes--federal, state, and local \ntaxes combined--account for nearly 40% of the typical American family's \nbudget--the single largest expense. All of this at a time when the \nfederal budget is beginning to run a surplus. What that means to me is \nthat the federal government is overcharging the taxpayer for the \nservices it is providing.\n  If the monetary cost of paying taxes isn't high enough, consider that \nit takes almost 11 hours to correctly fill out the 1040 EZ form. \nTaxpayers spend almost 5.4 billion hours filling out the forms that \nthey send to the IRS. And those are the taxpayers that do their own \ntaxes--54% of Americans pay someone else to do their taxes for them. In \nmy own State of Tennessee, ever year approximately 1.1 million \ntaxpayers utilize a professional tax preparer in order to file their \ntax returns.\n  The tax code is also too complex. Our current tax code and its \nregulations are 17,000 pages long and contain over 5 and a half million \nwords--seven times more than the Bible. Since 1981, the tax code has \nbeen changed 11,410 times. And one paragraph of law can take 250 pages \nto explain. With tax laws this complicated, it is no wonder that \nordinary Americans have a tough time figuring them out.\n  Unortunately, the trend in Congress is to add further complexity to \nthe tax code--tax credits for one worthwhile cause or tax deductions \nfor another, tax relief for certain segments for the population, but \nnot for others. Because of all of this tinkering, by 2007, 8,000,000 \nmore Americans will be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), a \nprovision that forces taxpayers to calculate their income two ways and \nthen pay the government the higher of the two amounts.\n\n  The tax code punishes taxpayers for working harder and smarter. One \nof the reasons that Congress has been able to balance the federal \nbudget is that revenues have been rising steadily--last year by 11 \npercent. Part of the reason for that rise is that our strong economy \nhas resulted in Americans making more and more money which, in turn, \nhas propelled them into higher and higher tax brackets. According to \neconomist Steve Moore at the Cato Institute, over the past five years, \nhigher incomes have pushed millions of middle-income families out of \nthe 15 percent marginal tax bracket and into the 28 percent bracket, \nand out of the 28 percent bracket and into the 31 percent bracket, and \nso on. While federal tax revenues have risen by 11 percent, income has \nonly risen by 6 percent. The reason for this real income bracket creep \nis our graduated income tax system.\n  The tax code does not promote savings for people of all ages and \nincomes. In fact, in many ways our tax code discourages people from \nsaving. America has one of the world's lowest national savings rates. \nThe personal saving rate in the United States averaged only 4.9 percent \nduring the 1990s compared to 7.4 percent in the 1960s and 8.1 percent \nin the\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\n1970s. In 1998, we actually had negative savings rates. And it is no \nwonder--as I mentioned previously, the average family pays close to 40% \nof their income in taxes. In addition to a high tax burden which often \nis applied twice to savings, the rules for opening and investing in an \nIRA account of any kind are complex and restrictive. IRAs are tax-\npreferred retirement accounts--tax-free for certain purposes like \neducation expenses, first-time home purchases, health care and \nretirement. But because a person must have earned income to open an \nIRA, children are not eligible to have them. Additionally, the maximum \ncontribution amounts have not been indexed since 1981--they are still \nat $2,000 per year. If the maximum contribution had been indexed for \ninflation it would stand at close to $5,000 today.\n  Increasing the national savings rate is even more important when \ncoupled with our impending Social Security collapse. As it currently \nexists, Social Security is not sustainable for the long term unless \ntaxes are significantly raised or the program is reformed. Even so, the \nreturn that a taxpayer gets on his or her Social Security investment \nvia the payroll tax has diminished every year since the program's \ninception. In fact, the predicted rate of return at retirement for \nthose age 24-50 is somewhere between -.34 percent and -1.7 percent. The \nrate of return on an average IRA investment is between 7 and 11 \npercent.\n  The four bills that I am introducing today--on Tax Freedom day--\ncollectively present a program that will lower taxes, simplify the tax \ncode, correct for bracket creep, and provide increased savings \nopportunities for all Americans regardless of age and income level.\n  The 10-20-30 tax plan will consolidate the five tax brackets of our \ncurrent tax code into just three--10, 20 and 30%--both lowering the tax \nburden and simplifying our tax code at the same time. The bill will \nalso increase the income threshold for the lowest tax bracket--\ncurrently just over $25,000 for individuals--to $35,000--all of which \nwill be taxed at a much lower rate--10%. In my own state of Tennessee, \nnearly 85% of individual taxpayers make $35,000 or less and will now \npay at this lower rate. For married couples, the threshold for \nthe lowest bracket is currently $42,000. Under my bill, this amount \nwould increase to $60,000 and be taxed at 10%. Instead of 15 or 28 \npercent, the majority of taxpayers would pay only 10% under my plan.\n\n  I know that this bill will not get passed this year, nor is it likely \nto get passed anytime in the near future. I introduce this bill, \nhowever, as my vision for where I think the tax code should ultimately \nend up. If we use a plan such as this as our compass and work \nincrementally to widen the brackets and reduce the tax rates whenever \npossible, we will be headed in the right direction.\n  The ``Child Savings Account Act'' would amend the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to promote lifetime savings by allowing people to \nestablish child savings accounts--or CSA's--within Roth IRAs and by \nallowing the savings to be used for education, first-time home \npurchases, and retirement. The bill will also expand the availability \nof Roth IRAs to all Americans, regardless of income, and will index \ncontribution limits to inflation.\n  For low-income taxpayers, there are two important provisions which \nwill help families with less disposable income save. First, up to $100 \nof each $500 child tax credit may be refundable to those qualifying for \nthe Earned Income Credit. This refundable credit must be deposited in a \nCSA. Second, any person may contribute to a child's CSA. This means \nthat churches and community groups could contribute to young people's \nCSA accounts as a birthday present or on a special occasion.\n  These Child Savings Accounts will arm our children for the future and \ndecrease their reliance on the federal government. As a subset of the \nRoth tax-favored IRAs, Child Savings Accounts are available to new-born \nchildren from cradle to grave. In an increasingly complex tax world, \nCSAs are a sort of ``one-stop IRA shopping'' that allow for certain \ntax-free withdrawals and tax-free accumulation of retirement income.\n  If a parent, and then the child himself, contributed the maximum \namount for his lifetime, the Child Savings Account would be worth \nnearly $5 million at age 65 and over $7 million by age 70. And that is \nusing conservative estimates of return. Even if a parent could only \ncontribute less than $10 a month for the first 18 years of a child's \nlife, and the child then gradually increased his or her contribution up \nto $2000 per year by the time he or she turned 40, the account would be \nworth $460,000 at age 65 and $672,000 at age 70. Even if the parent or \ngrandparent or church or guardian put only $100 in the account in only \none year, the account would still be worth almost $50,000 at retirement \nage. The power of compound interest is incredible. Giving more \nAmericans--and all of our children--access to this power is imperative.\n  The Bracket Creep Correction Act would index the tax brackets for \nreal income growth. Tax brackets were not indexed for inflation until \n1981 when Ronald Reagan was President. Indexing for real income growth \nis a logical and necessary next step. None other than Milton Friedman \nhas announced his support for indexing tax brackets for wage growth. In \naddition to correcting for inflation, the tax code would also adjust \nfor income growth--thus ending the squeeze that many taxpayers have \nfelt as their tax burdens have risen at a faster rate than their \nincomes.\n  A fourth bill that I will introduce will address a tax inequity that \nhas existed for some time and was made worse by the large tax increases \nof 1993. The ``Tax Fairness for Support of the Permanently Disabled \nAct'' would change the tax rates for the taxable income of a trust fund \nestablished solely for the benefit of a person who is permanently and \ntotally disabled. Instead of being taxed at the highest tax rate \n(39.6%) for amounts over $7,500, the income of this fund would be taxed \nat the tax rates that would normally apply to regular income of the \nsame amount. In essence, trust fund income would be treated as personal \nincome for a permanently disabled person.\n  Mr. Nicholas Verbin of Nashville, Tennessee called my office about \nthis problem a year or so ago. The problem was that he had established \nan irrevocable trust for his son Nicky, who is completely disabled, \nunable to work, and totally dependent on his dad to provide for him. \nMr. Verbin has spent his whole life building up this trust fund so that \nhis son can live off this lifetime of hard work after Mr. Verbin is \ngone. Mr. Verbin does not want his son to have to go on welfare or \nbecome a ward of the state. Instead, he has built up this fund so that \nhis son can be self-sufficient after he dies. Apparently, the federal \ngovernment would rather have Nicky on its welfare roles than have him \ntake care of himself.\n  Instead of taxing the interest that Nicky's trust accumulates every \nyear as simple income, which it is since Nicky has no other form of \nincome, the IRS taxes the interest at the highest rate allowable--\n39.6%. Instead of helping this sum grow into a sort of pension fund for \nNicky, the IRS has milked it for all its worth. If Nicky's trust earns \nmore than $7,500 in interest in a year, the federal government takes \n$2,125 plus 39.5% of the amount above $7,500. Meanwhile, even Bill \nGates does not pay 39.6% on the first $275,000 of his income. We are \ntaxing disabled children at a rate that we don't even tax \nmultimillionaires!\n  I believe that we should not punish Mr. Verbin for his foresight, nor \nshould we punish Nicky for his disability. While a case could be made \nthat Congress should eliminate the tax on this type of trust \naltogether, I have simply proposed that the interest income be treated \nlike normal income for those disabled boys and girls, men and women who \ncannot work for themselves and depend on this interest as their only \nsource of income.\n  Mr. President, the Budget Resolution that we recently passed calls \nfor a reconciliation bill this year of $778 over 2000-2009 (and $142 \nbillion 2000-2004) in tax relief. Even with the military operations in \nKosovo and other emergency appropriations, a tax cut is not only \npossible but necessary to keep our economy growing.\n  While many tax credits and deductions are attractive, they further \ncomplicate our already complicated tax code, subject additional tax \npayers to the alternative minimum tax, and pit one group of taxpayers \nagainst another. I believe that Congress should enact across the board \ntax relief--like what I have outlined in my 10-20-30 bill--as the on-\nbudget surplus allows. We must work toward lowering the tax rates on \nevery bracket, widening the amounts subject to each bracket and \ncorrecting for bracket creep in order to make the tax code fairer, \nflatter and less complex.\n  We must also build more wealth in this country and encourage \nAmericans to save. The Child Savings Account bill is a great savings \nvehicle for both rich and poor and has enormous potential\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\nfor increasing retirement savings. Instead of being dependent on Social \nSecurity, sock some money away in an IRA and get set for life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url":

Res. 99\n\n       Whereas the 105th Congress, in Senate Resolution 84 and \n     House Resolution 212, recognized suicide as a national \n     problem and suicide prevention as a national priority;\n       Whereas the Surgeon General has publicly recognized suicide \n     as a public health problem;\n       Whereas the resolutions of the 105th Congress called for a \n     collaboration between public and private organizations and \n     individuals concerned with suicide;\n       Whereas in the United States, more than 30,000 people take \n     their own lives each year;\n       Whereas suicide is the 8th leading cause of death in the \n     United States and the 3rd major cause of death among young \n     people aged 15 through 19;\n       Whereas the suicide rate among young people has more than \n     tripled in the last 4 decades, a fact that is a tragedy in \n     itself and a source of devastation to millions of family \n     members and loved ones;\n       Whereas every year in the United States, 200,000 people \n     become suicide survivors (people that have lost a loved one \n     to suicide), and there are approximately 8,000,000 suicide \n     survivors in the United States today;\n       Whereas society still needlessly stigmatizes both the \n     people that take their own lives and suicide survivors;\n       Whereas there is a need for greater outreach to suicide \n     survivors because, all too often, they are left alone to \n     grieve;\n       Whereas suicide survivors are often helped to rebuild their \n     lives through a network of support with fellow survivors;\n       Whereas suicide survivors play an essential role in \n     educating communities about the risks of suicide and the need \n     to develop suicide prevention strategies; and\n       Whereas suicide survivors contribute to suicide prevention \n     research by providing essential information about the \n     environmental and genetic backgrounds of the deceased: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,That the Senate--\n       (1)(A) designates November 20, 1999, as ``National \n     Survivors for Prevention of Suicide Day''; and\n       (B) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on Federal, State, and local administrators and the \n     people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities;\n       (2) encourages the involvement of suicide survivors in \n     healing activities and prevention programs;\n       (3) acknowledges that suicide survivors face distinct \n     obstacles in their grieving;\n       (4) recognizes that suicide survivors can be a source of \n     support and strength to each other;\n       (5) recognizes that suicide survivors have played a leading \n     role in organizations dedicated to reducing suicide through \n     research, education, and treatment programs; and\n       (6) acknowledges the efforts of suicide survivors in their \n     prevention, education, and advocacy activities to eliminate \n     stigma and to reduce the incidence of suicide.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution \nwhich would designate November 20, 1999 as ``National Survivors for \nPrevention of Suicide Day.'' Let me begin by defining the term \nsurvivor. This refers to anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide. As \nsuch, having lost my father to suicide in 1972, I am viewed as a \nsurvivor in the suicide prevention community. Nationally, more than \n30,000 people take their own lives each year in our nation. Suicide is \nthe eighth leading cause of death in the United States and the third \nmajor cause of death among people aged 15-19.\n  The suicide rate among young people has more than tripled in the last \nfour decades. Every year 200,000 people become survivors due to this \ntragic loss of life. We arrive at this number by concluding that for \neach suicide, seven other lives are changed forever because of the \ndeath. As you can imagine, this is a conservative estimate by all \naccounts. Today in our country, nearly 8,000,000 suicide survivors go \non with their lives, many of them grieving in a very private way. This \nis because there still remains in our nation a stigma towards those who \ntake their own life as well as those who are left behind to cope with \nthe suicide of a loved one. I can't begin to tell you how many \nsurvivors have written me expressing the shame and guilt they feel \nabout their loved ones' suicide, many of whom are still unable to deal \nhonestly with the tragic conditions which ultimately led to someone \nthey love taking their own life.\n  In the 105th Congress, both the House and Senate took very courageous \nsteps to address the public health challenge of suicide by passing \nSenate Resolution 84 and House Resolution 212. Essentially, these \nresolutions recognized suicide as a national problem warranting a \nnational solution. The resolutions also called for the development of a \nnational strategy to address and reduce the incidence of outside.\n  I am proud to have been the sponsor of Senate Resolution 84 and proud \nof my colleagues for having lent their support to ensure its passage. I \nalso commend Representative John Lewis for his leadership in the House \nand to all the members who provided their support to ensure its passage \nin the closing days of the last session. We cannot however, stop here. \nWe must continue to show our compassion and assert leadership to take \nthe necessary steps to mobilize our national response for suicide \nprevention.\n  Recently, there has been a fervor of activity and collaboration in \nboth the federal and private sectors around suicide prevention. On the \nfederal level, our Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher has included the \ntopic of suicide prevention on his public health agenda. In addition to \nDr. Satcher's efforts, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the National Institute of Mental Health and the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration have focussed increased \neffort on the issue of suicide prevention. In the private sector, \ngroups such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the \nAmerican Association of Suicidology and the Suicide Prevention Advocacy \nNetwork have worked together to increase national awareness as well. \nThere are countless others who, on a daily basis, make their commitment \nto assist in finding solutions to this national dilemma. The self-help \ngroups, clinicians, researchers, and grass roots advocates are all \nmaking a vital difference.\n\n  In the near future, I hope to see the national strategy that has been \ndeveloped by many who stepped to the plate, as called for in Senate \nResolution 84 and House Resolution 212, to chart a course for our \nnational effort. I hope to see hearings in the Senate soon on this \nissue and hope we will look at the recommendations seriously and lend \nour support to making this report one that does more than collect dust \non a shelf, but instead a report that charts the course we must pursue \nto reduce the incidence of suicide in America and to convey our \nnational resolve.\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\n  This year we will witness two events which deserve our recognition \nand support. On June 7, 1999 the White House will hold a White House \nConference on Mental Health and later this year the Surgeon General \nwill issue his report on mental health. The time has come when we must \nrecognize that mental disorders are illnesses that can be treated \neffectively. We know that 90 percent of suicide victims have suffered \nfrom a mental disorder. Therefore, we must send a clear and \nunmistakable message that those who suffer should be encouraged to seek \nassistance and restore themselves to a healthy state of being. The \nMental Health Parity legislation introduced by my good friends Senator \nPete Domenici and Senator Paul Wellstone is a step in the right \ndirection. Their leadership on this issue has my full support and \nrespect. There should be no barrier for individuals to obtaining help \nfor whatever illness, including mental illness, if there is effective \ntreatment available to assist them. We must remove the stigma and have \nthe courage to show acceptance.\n  As you can see Mr. President, there is much that has been done but \nstill much we in Congress can do to advance this agenda. Today, it is \nmy intent to recognize the 8,000,000 survivors who all are at various \nstages of healing in addressing the loss of their loved one to suicide. \nI ask you to support me in turning their grief into hope, a hope that \nwith acceptance and understanding, can lead our nation effectively \naddressing this very preventable public health challenge.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           American Foundation for\n\n\n                                           Suicide Prevention,\n\n                                                      May 5, 1999.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The American Foundation for Suicide \n     Prevention supports the proposed Senate Resolution calling \n     for a National Survivors for Prevention of Suicide Day. We \n     believe this resolution will build on the momentum started by \n     the 105th Congress in Senate Resolution 84 and House \n     Resolution 212, and will further the suicide prevention goals \n     articulated in these earlier resolutions.\n       Specifically, the proposed Survivors for Prevention \n     Resolution will be instrumental in recognizing the \n     involvement of people who have lost a loved one to suicide in \n     prevention activities. It will also encourage them to come \n     forward, break the silence and join with other survivors as a \n     way to promote their healing.\n       As you know, our Foundation is dedicated to seeing that \n     conferences for family members and friends who have lost \n     someone to suicide are held in many more communities. Working \n     together with other private organizations and public \n     agencies, we will use this resolution to help develop local \n     survivor conferences in cities across the country.\n       Please know AFSP deeply appreciates the leadership you are \n     providing in Congress on this major public health problem and \n     is grateful for your sponsorship of Senate Resolution 84 in \n     the 105th Congress. We are equally grateful for your \n     willingness to sponsor this Survivors for Prevention \n     Resolution.\n       On behalf of millions of survivors who want to prevent \n     others from experiencing a similar loss, as well as people \n     throughout our country concerned about the risk of suicide, \n     thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Robert Gebbia,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         AAS, American Association\n\n\n                                               of Suicidology,\n\n                                                      May 6, 1999.\n     Senator Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: With great enthusiasm the American \n     Association of Suicidology (AAS) supports the proposed Senate \n     Resolution designating November 20, 1999 as ``National \n     Survivors for Prevention of Suicide Day.'' We, furthermore, \n     applaud your continuing commitment to both suicide prevention \n     and the needs of survivors.\n       Your proposal extends the success initiated by you in \n     passage of Senate Resolution 84 in making suicide prevention \n     a national priority. The subsequent passage of HR 212 and the \n     Surgeon Generals' affirmation of suicide prevention as a \n     public health goal are direct sequelae of your earlier \n     efforts; and the consequence of these efforts will, \n     undoubtedly promote the welfare of all our citizens.\n       The AAS has embraced suicide prevention as part of our \n     mission and survivors as integral to accomplishing that \n     mission. Our annual Healing After Suicide Conference has \n     provided opportunities for thousands of survivors to learn \n     from and assuage each other's often unbearable pain, to \n     educate care givers to better understand the suicidal person, \n     and to create new models to help the healing process. Our \n     Directory of Survivors of Suicide Support Groups has been \n     accessed by thousands of new survivors needing to find help. \n     Our Survivor Division and newsletter Surviving Suicide \n     continue to network and service the needs of survivors.\n       With the advocacy of our survivor members and your \n     continued leadership, we are increasingly hopeful that we can \n     significantly impact the incidence of suicide in this country \n     and ensure the health of generations to come.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lanny Berman, Ph.D.,\n       Executive Director.\n     Karen Dune-Maxim, M.S., R.N.,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Suicide Prevention\n\n\n                                             Advocacy Network,\n\n                                                     May 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: SPAN supports the Senate Resolution \n     designating November 20, 1999 as ``National Survivors for \n     Prevention of Suicide Day'' that you have prepared. Further, \n     SPAN salutes you for this contribution to the well being, \n     growth and involvement of survivors of suicide in the \n     national effort to reduce the incidence of suicide!\n       It is just over two years since you introduced to the \n     Senate of the 105th Congress, Senate Resolution 84 that \n     recognized suicide as a national problem and suicide \n     prevention as a national priority. The Proposed Senate \n     Resolution is therefore particularly timely now as it brings \n     before the Senate a reminder of their past action. It \n     spotlights the need for continuing Senate support and \n     identifies a powerful and potentially huge national resource \n     for the collaborative effort to reduce the incidence of \n     suicide.\n       The last paragraph of the resolution will be most helpful \n     to all survivors of suicide. It identifies the part that each \n     individual survivor can play in the national effort to reduce \n     the incidence of suicide and confirms that, together we can \n     make a big difference.\n       Thanks Senator Reid for your ongoing national leadership \n     for efforts to develop, implement and evaluate a proven, \n     effective national suicide prevention strategy. The proposed \n     resolution is another example of your dedication to this \n     effort. Thank you!\n           Sincerely,\n     Gerald H. (Jerry) Weyrauch.  \n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NAMI,\n\n                                                     May 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the 208,000 members and \n     1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill (NAMI), I am writing to express NAMI's strong support for \n     your resolution to designate November 20, 1999 as ``National \n     Survivors for Prevention of Suicide Day'', and to thank you \n     for recognizing suicide as a national problem and suicide \n     prevention as a national priority. More than 30,000 Americans \n     commit suicide annually, and while we do not always \n     understand why some choose suicide, we do know that it is all \n     too often associated with severe mental illnesses, \n     particularly major depression. Death by suicide is \n     unfortunately one of the most dire risks of untreated mental \n     illness.\n       Sadly, more than 10 percent of individuals with \n     schizophrenia and more than 15 percent of those with major \n     mood disorders kill themselves. These are preventable and \n     senseless deaths that could have been avoided with the right \n     medical intervention and prevention programs. Your resolution \n     would recognize suicide survivors as playing a key role as \n     advocates and educators in prevention efforts, as well as \n     their place in eliminating stigma and reducing the incidence \n     of suicide.\n       NAMI commends your past and present leadership and advocacy \n     in suicide prevention and education. Your continued \n     commitment and support has been vital in bringing national \n     recognition to the high incidence of suicide in our country. \n     NAMI strongly supports your resolution to designate November \n     20, 1999 as ``National Survivors for Prevention of Suicide \n     Day'', in recognition of the contributions suicide survivors \n     can make in suicide prevention strategies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Laurie Flynn,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5058-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5058-S5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nVIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION \n                              ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BOXER AMENDMENT NO. 319\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. BOXER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her to \nthe bill (S. 254) to reduce violent juvenile crime, promote \naccountability by rehabilitation of juvenile criminals, punish and \ndeter violent gang crime, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\n          TITLE __. AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND ANTI-CRIME ACT.\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``After School Education and \n     Anti-Crime Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to improve academic and social \n     outcomes for students and reduce both juvenile crime and the \n     risk that youth will become victims of crime by providing \n     productive activities during after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today's youth face far greater social risks than did \n     their parents and grandparents.\n       (2) Students spend more of their waking hours alone, \n     without supervision, companionship, or activity, than the \n     students spend in school.\n       (3) Law enforcement statistics show that youth who are ages \n     12 through 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and \n     being victims of violent acts between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n       (4) The consequences of academic failure are more dire in \n     1999 than ever before.\n       (5) After school programs have been shown in many States to \n     help address social problems facing our Nation's youth, such \n     as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang involvement.\n       (6) Many of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the \n     number of after school programs through a Federal/State \n     partnership.\n       (7) Over 450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, \n     sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with presidents of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of \n     Police Associations, which together represent 360,000 police \n     officers, have called upon public officials to provide after \n     school programs that offer recreation, academic support, and \n     community service experience, for school-age children and \n     teens in the United States.\n       (8) One of the most important investments that we can make \n     in our children is to ensure that they have safe and positive \n     learning environments in the after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 4. GOALS.\n\n       The goals of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To increase the academic success of students.\n       (2) To promote safe and productive environments for \n     students in the after school hours.\n       (3) To provide alternatives to drug, alcohol, tobacco, and \n     gang activity.\n       (4) To reduce juvenile crime and the risk that youth will \n     become victims of crime during after school hours.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       Section 10903 of the 21st Century Community Learning \n     Centers Act (20 U.S.C. 8243) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in the subsection heading, by inserting ``to Local \n     Educational Agencies for Schools'' after ``Secretary''; and\n       (B) by striking ``rural and inner-city public'' and all \n     that follows through ``or to'' and inserting ``local \n     educational agencies for the support of public elementary \n     schools or secondary schools, including middle schools, that \n     serve communities with substantial needs for expanded \n     learning opportunities for children and youth in the \n     communities, to enable the schools to establish or''; and\n       (C) by striking ``a rural or inner-city community'' and \n     inserting ``the communities'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by striking ``States, among'' and inserting ``States \n     and among''; and\n       (B) by striking ``United States,'' and all that follows \n     through ``a State'' and inserting ``United States''; and\n       (3) in subsection (c), by striking ``3'' and inserting \n     ``5''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While our Nation's schools are still relatively safe, \n     it is imperative that schools be provided with adequate \n     resources to prevent incidents of violence.\n       (2) Approximately 10 percent of all public schools reported \n     at least 1 serious violent crime to a law enforcement agency \n     over the course of the 1996-1997 school year.\n       (3) In 1996, approximately 225,000 students between the \n     ages of 12 and 18 were victims of nonfatal violent crime in \n     schools in the United States.\n       (4) From 1992 through 1994, 76 students and 29 non-students \n     were victims of murders or suicides that were committed in \n     schools in the United States.\n       (5) The school violence incidents in several States across \n     the Nation in 1998 and 1999 caused enormous damage to \n     schools, families, and whole communities.\n       (6) The children of the United States are increasingly \n     afraid that they will be attacked or harmed at school.\n       (7) A report issued by the Department of Education in \n     August, 1998, entitled ``Early Warning, Early Response'' \n     concluded that the reduction and prevention of school \n     violence is best achieved through safety plans which involve \n     the entire community, policies which emphasize both \n     prevention and intervention, training school personnel, \n     parents, students, and community members to recognize the \n     early warning signs of potentially violent behavior and to \n     share their concerns or observations with trained personnel, \n     establishing procedures which allow rapid response and \n     intervention when early warning signs of violent behavior are \n     identified, and providing adequate support and access to \n     services for troubled students.\n\n     SEC. __03.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) While our Nation's schools are still relatively safe, \n     it is imperative that schools be provided with adequate \n     resources to prevent incidents of violence.\n       (2) Approximately 10 percent of all public schools reported \n     at least 1 serious violent crime to a law enforcement agency \n     over the course of the 1996-1997 school year.\n       (3) In 1996, approximately 225,000 students between the \n     ages of 12 and 18 were victims of nonfatal violent crime in \n     schools in the United States.\n       (4) From 1992 through 1994, 76 students and 29 non-students \n     were victims of murders or suicides that were committed in \n     schools in the United States.\n       (5) The school violence incidents in several States across \n     the Nation in 1998 and 1999 caused enormous damage to \n     schools, families, and whole communities.\n       (6) The children of the United States are increasingly \n     afraid that they will be attacked or harmed at school.\n       (7) A report issued by the Department of Education in \n     August, 1998, entitled ``Early Warning, Early Response'' \n     concluded that the reduction and prevention of school \n     violence is best achieved through safety plans which involve \n     the entire community, policies which emphasize both \n     prevention and intervention, training school personnel, \n     parents, students, and community members to recognize the \n     early warning signs of potentially violent behavior and to \n     share their concerns or observations with trained personnel, \n     establishing procedures which allow rapid response and \n     intervention when early warning signs of violent behavior are \n     identified, and providing adequate support and access to \n     services for troubled students.\n\n     SEC. __03.

CERTAIN PUNISHMENT AND GRADUATED SANCTIONS FOR \n                   YOUTH OFFENDERS.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) youth violence constitutes a growing threat to the \n     national welfare requiring immediate and comprehensive action \n     by the Federal Government to reduce and prevent youth \n     violence;\n       (B) the behavior of youth who become violent offenders \n     often follow a progression, beginning with aggressive \n     behavior in school, truancy, and vandalism, leading to \n     property crimes and then serious violent offenses;\n       (C) the juvenile justice systems in most States are ill-\n     equipped to provide meaningful sanctions to minor, nonviolent \n     offenders because most of their resources are dedicated to \n     dealing with more serious offenders;\n       (D) in most States, some youth commit multiple, nonviolent \n     offenses without facing any significant criminal sanction;\n       (E) the failure to provide meaningful criminal sanctions \n     for first time, nonviolent offenders sends the false message \n     to youth that they can engage in antisocial behavior without \n     suffering any negative consequences and that society is \n     unwilling or unable to restrain that behavior;\n       (F) studies demonstrate that interventions during the early \n     stages of a criminal career can halt the progression to more \n     serious, violent behavior; and\n       (G) juvenile courts need access to a range of sentencing \n     options so that at least some level of sanction is imposed on \n     all youth offenders, including status offenders, and the \n     severity of the sanctions increase along with the seriousness \n     of the offense.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to \n     provide--\n       (A) assistance to State and local juvenile courts to expand \n     the range of sentencing options for first time, nonviolent \n     offenders; and\n       (B) a selection of graduated sanctions for more serious \n     offenses.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) First time offender.--The term ``first time offender'' \n     means a juvenile against whom formal charges have not \n     previously been filed in any Federal or State judicial \n     proceeding.\n       (2) Nonviolent offender.--The term ``nonviolent offender'' \n     means a juvenile who is charged with an offense that does not \n     involve the use of force against the person of another.\n       (3) Status offender.--The term ``status offender'' means a \n     juvenile who is charged with an offense that would not be \n     criminal if committed by an adult (other than an offense that \n     constitutes a violation of a valid court order or a violation \n     of section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code (or similar \n     State law)).\n       (c) Grant Authorization.--The Attorney General may make \n     grants in accordance with this section to States, State \n     courts, local courts, units of local government, and Indian \n     tribes, for the purposes of--\n       (1) providing juvenile courts with a range of sentencing \n     options such that first time juvenile offenders, including \n     status offenders such as truants, vandals, and juveniles in \n     violation of State or local curfew laws, face at least some \n     level of punishment as a result of their initial contact with \n     the juvenile justice system; and\n       (2) increasing the sentencing options available to juvenile \n     court judges so that juvenile offenders receive increasingly \n     severe sanctions--\n       (A) as the seriousness of their unlawful conduct increases; \n     and\n       (B) for each additional offense.\n       (d) Applications.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--In order to be eligible to receive a \n     grant under this section, the chief executive of a State, \n     unit of local government, or Indian tribe, or the chief judge \n     of a local court, shall submit an application to the Attorney \n     General in such form and containing such information as the \n     Attorney General may reasonably require.\n       (2) Requirements.--Each application submitted in accordance \n     with paragraph (1) shall include--\n       (A) a request for a grant to be used for the purposes \n     described in this section;\n       (B) a description of the communities to be served by the \n     grant, including the extent of youth crime and violence in \n     those communities;\n       (C) written assurances that Federal funds received under \n     this subtitle will be used to supplement, not supplant, non-\n     Federal funds that would otherwise be available for \n     activities funded under this subsection;\n       (D) a comprehensive plan described in paragraph (3) (in \n     this section referred to as the ``comprehensive plan'');

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) millions of young people in America live in areas in \n     which drug use and violent and property crimes are pervasive;\n       (2) unfortunately, many of these same young people come \n     from single parent homes, or from environments in which there \n     is no responsible, caring adult supervision;\n       (3) all children and adolescents need caring adults in \n     their lives, and mentoring is an effective way to fill this \n     special need for at-risk children;\n       (4) the special bond of commitment fostered by the mutual \n     respect inherent in effective mentoring can be the tie that \n     binds a young person to a better future;\n       (5) through a mentoring relationship, adult volunteers and \n     participating youth make a significant commitment of time and \n     energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, \n     academic, or career development and social, artistic, or \n     athletic growth;\n       (6) rigorous independent studies have confirmed that \n     effective mentoring programs can significantly reduce and \n     prevent the use of alcohol and drugs by young people, improve \n     school attendance and performance, improve peer and family \n     and peer relationships, and reduce violent behavior;\n       (7) since the inception of the Federal JUMP program, dozens \n     of innovative, effective mentoring programs have received \n     funding grants;\n       (8) unfortunately, despite the recent growth in public and \n     private mentoring initiatives, it is reported that between \n     5,000,000 and 15,000,000 additional children in the United \n     States could benefit from being matched with a mentor; and\n       (9) although great strides have been made in reaching at-\n     risk youth since the inception of the JUMP program, millions \n     of vulnerable American children are not being reached, and \n     without an increased commitment to connect these young people \n     to responsible adult role models, our country risks losing an \n     entire generation to drugs, crime, and unproductive lives.\n\n     SEC. 553.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in recognizing \nSenator Biden for his 10,000th vote in the United States Senate.\n  I am proud to serve with Senator Biden on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, where he is the ranking Democrat Member. Senator Biden has \nset many records in the Senate. I would like to squelch the rumor, \nhowever, that he sets a record every time he speaks.\n  I am just in my third year as a United States Senator. Senator Biden \nis in his 27th year in the Senate. But in the time Senator Biden and I \nhave served together on the Foreign Relations Committee, I have gained \ngreat respect for his wisdom and deep understanding of international \nissues. Senator Biden understands that there is no such thing as a \nRepublican foreign policy or a Democrat foreign policy. There is only \nan American foreign policy. He has worked closely with Presidents in \nboth parties. And he reaches out across the aisle to work as well with \nour Chairman, Senator Helms, as he does with his junior colleagues.\n  Last year, Senator Biden was a leader in the historic expansion of \nNATO to include three former Warsaw Pact nations. This Congress he \njoined with Senator McCain in sponsoring a resolution authorizing the \nuse of all necessary force to win the war in Kosovo. Through his \nleadership, Senator Biden displays the kind of courage that earns him \nrespect from all of his colleagues, even when they disagree.\n  I am proud to call Joe Biden my friend and colleague. America is \nproud to call him a United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5093-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5093-S5094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO ``MANUEL'' KATSUMI OISHI\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am honored to rise in tribute to \nMr. ``Manuel'' Katsumi Oishi who has faithfully served the Territorial \nGovernment of Hawaii and the State of Hawaii, Maui County, for 37 \nyears. He unselfishly dedicated his time to improve his community. Born \nin 1926 and raised in McGerrow Camp, Puunene, Maui, Mr. Oishi is being \nrecognized today at the McGerrow Camp Reunion for the honor that he \nbrings his birthplace.\n  Mr. Oishi's career began with the Territorial government in 1949. In \n1951, he started working for Maui County as a Clerk in the Building \nDepartment. He was promoted to Clerk for the Transportation Control \nCommittee, then later served as Secretary. Transferred to the Civil \nDefense Department in 1958, he held the positions of Secretary, then \nCoordinator, and, in 1961, he became the Civil Defense Administrator. \nIn 1973, while Deputy County Clerk and later as County Clerk, Mr. Oishi \nensured that the county operated efficiently and unselfishly gave of \nhis time to assist Maui residents navigate the sometimes bureaucratic \nmaze of government.\n  Because of his love of sports and the youth of Maui, Mr. Oishi \npursued a simultaneous career as The Honolulu Advertiser's sports \nreporter for 38 years. He diligently covered all of Maui's \ninterscholastic sports in the evenings and on weekends. His positive \nstories encouraged young Maui athletes to take pride in themselves and \ntheir sports.\n  The incredibly energetic Mr. Oishi has devoted countless volunteer \nhours to make life a little easier and better for the residents he so \ndearly loves. Since graduation from Baldwin High School in 1944, Mr. \nOishi has headed the planning of every class reunion. During the last \n20 years, he has chaired all of the McGerrow Camp reunions on Maui, \nwhich have amassed an attendance of 250 to 300 people. Mr. Oishi's \nrelentless efforts have resulted in former McGerrow Camp residents \nhaving a great time and experiencing a deep feeling of friendship and \nohana (family). When the Selective Service System went though some \ntrying times, Mr. Oishi volunteered for five years to help push the \npaperwork through and to answer those pressing questions from anxious \nyoung men and their parents.\n  His commitment to the youth of Maui is also evident in his volunteer \nwork with the AJA Baseball League in which he held several positions on \nthe board. In 1991, he received the Tadaichi Fukunaga Dana Award for \nhis ``unselfish services and contributions to (his) temple and to the \ngrowth of Buddhism.'' Since 1976, he has been Editor of ``Friends of \nthe Dharma,'' the monthly newspaper for his church, Wailuku Hongwanji \nMission.\n  Although Mr. Oishi is retired from government service and The \nHonolulu Advertiser, he continues his invaluable service to his church \nand the Maui County Credit Union of which he serves as the Secretary-\nTreasurer.\n  Mr. Oishi's unfaltering commitment to government service and his \nsincere devotion to his community and its citizens bring pride and \nhonor to McGerrow Camp. He certainly has earned the love and admiration \nof the residents of McGerrow Camp, the County of Maui, and the State of \nHawaii.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in \nrecognizing ``Manuel'' Katsumi Oishi for his outstanding contributions \nto Maui County and to the State of Hawaii and send my heartiest aloha \nto those celebrating the McGerrow Camp reunion.\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5093-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5093-S5094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO ``MANUEL'' KATSUMI OISHI\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

This year's theme is ``In a child's life, everyone \nis accountable.'' The Missouri Department of Mental Health and MO-SPAN, \nthe Missouri Statewide Parent Advisory Network, teamed up to co-sponsor \nthe week.\n  Some estimates indicate that 12 percent of all children and youth in \nthe United States have an emotional, behavioral or mental disorder. \nWhile many of these children and their families need services ranging \nfrom therapeutic to educational and social services, only about one-\nthird of these children and youth receive assistance.\n  Recognizing Children's Mental Health Week is one way to bring \nattention to the seriousness of mental health disorders in our children \nand spread the message of support for them. The week's events were \nbegun with MO-SPAN's Second Annual Clayton Huey Memorial Benefit Walk-\nA-Thon and a kickoff event at the Missouri Capitol and continued \nthroughout the week.\n  It is a privilege for me to be able to recognize the diligent work of \nfamilies with children who have emotional, behavioral and mental \ndisorders. Likewise, it is also important to celebrate the workers, \nvolunteers, and organizations--like MO-SPAN--who provide vital support, \nservices, information, and advocacy for these families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5094-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A CELEBRATION OF WOMEN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

Since this beginning, the \nBoard of Directors and staff have developed the YWCA into community \nbased organization committed to the empowerment of women and girls and \nto erase racism through diverse activities and programs. The YWCA \nprovides leadership training, public advocacy, education, support \nservices, health promotions and recreation within the city of Trenton \nand the surrounding communities.\n  The awards given have become a distinguished tradition in the New \nJersey capital region since they were first introduced years ago as the \nTribute to Women in Industry, or TWIN, awards. The recipients of this \nyear's award embody the mission of the YWCA.\n  Eileen Thorton will receive the Woman of Achievement Award given to a \nwoman who has achieved distinction in her field while using her power \nto encourage opportunity. J. Dolores Baker is this year's recipient of \nthe Woman of Inspiration Award presented to a woman who has overcome \ninsurmountable odds. Molly Merlino will receive the Meta Griffith \nCommunity Service Award, named after the prominent civic leader.

Mr. President, I proudly rise today to honor and \ncelebrate my home State of Minnesota's 141st year of statehood. On this \ndate in 1858, Congress admitted Minnesota into the Union as the thirty-\nsecond State.\n  Let me begin by saying that the name ``Minnesota'' comes from two \nSioux Indian words meaning sky-tinted waters. Now Mr. President, if you \nhave ever been to Minnesota you will agree that my State was properly \nnamed. These ``sky-tinted waters'' are representative of Minnesota's \nmany lakes (in excess of 12,000) and the numerous rivers and streams \nwhich run throughout the State. In fact, Minnesota has more shoreline \nthan California, Florida and Hawaii combined!\n  Several million Minnesotans and out-of-state visitors take advantage \nof these waters every year to swim, water ski, boat, canoe, or fish. \nThis Saturday, May 15, represents one of my home State's most treasured \nyearly experiences, the fishing opener. I have always been impressed \nwith the spirit the opener brings out and the way it joins our State \nand visitors in a common interest. Out on the lake, people aren't too \nconcerned with the difficulties of everyday life. Once a fishing rod is \nnestled tightly in hand, Minnesotans tend to forget the phone, the fax, \nor the other annoyances that consume so much of our lives today. The \nexperience re-connects us to a much simpler time.\n  In addition to Minnesota's water resources, one-third of the State is \ncovered with forests. Aspen, balsam fir, pine, spruce, and white birch \ngrow in the northern part of the State, whereas groves of ash, black \nwalnut, elm, maple and oak grow in the south. These forests form the \ncenterpiece of 66 State parks, 55 State forests, one national park, and \ntwo national forests, all of which provide outdoor enthusiasts with \nscenic hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities on a year-round \nbasis.\n  Mr. President, in addition to our beautiful lakes, streams, forests, \nand parks, Minnesota has much more to offer. My State produces 75 \npercent of the nation's iron ore which covers a section of northern \nMinnesota rightly known as the ``Iron Range.'' There are also large \ndeposits of granite found near St. Cloud and along the upper \nMississippi River. I am proud to say that over 6,000 tons of Minnesota \ngranite was used to make the walls and floor for the Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt memorial here in Washington, D.C.\n  The fertile soil has been key to Minnesota's overall economy, \nproviding\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nsuitable farmland that covers a little more than half the State. \nAgriculture is Minnesota's largest industry, generating over $22 \nbillion in goods and services per year. One of every four Minnesota \njobs is tied in some way to agriculture, and 25 percent of our overall \neconomy is dependent upon farmers and agri-business. Today Minnesota \nhas approximately 87,000 family farms. Even though times are difficult \nfor many of these family farmers, Minnesota depends upon their \nsuccessful recovery.\n  Furthermore, Minnesota is home to some of the world's leading job \nproviders--including 3M, Pillsbury, Honeywell, and Cargill, to name a \nfew. Minnesota is also known for its achievements in the area of health \ncare. It is a leader in the medical device industry and home to one of \nthe world's premier health care facilities, the Mayo Clinic in \nRochester.\n  Minnesota is also the birthplace of many great innovations which have \nbecome part of our American culture, such as Cellophane Transparent \nTape, Post-it Notes, and the world's first enclosed mall located at \nSouthdale Shopping Center in Edina. Today we have the Mall of America \nin Bloomington which is one of the world's largest enclosed malls and \nmost popular tourist destinations. Among other notable Minnesota facts, \nwe are the source of the Mississippi River, home to the busiest \nfreshwater port in North America (which also happens to be the farthest \ninland ocean port in the United States), and Minnesota reaches the \nfurthest north of the 48-continental States.\n  Mr. President, I hope I have managed to convey the pride I have for \nmy state and its people, and in doing so, have perhaps encouraged \nothers to visit. As a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, I wanted to express \nthe honor I feel in representing the people of my State, which I \nbelieve is one of the premier States in the greatest country on \nEarth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5095-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO BARBARA MULLEN, RECIPIENT OF THE JEFFREY MAY MEMORIAL AWARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Barbara Mullen for being awarded the Jeffrey May Memorial \nAward from the Londonderry Business Council. It is a pleasure to \nrecognize her contributions to her community and the Granite State.\n  In 1980, Barbara established the Londonderry Dance Academy and has \nbeen teaching children to dance ever since. Her community involvement \nhas helped shape the lives of many young people in Londonderry and \nacross the state. Barbara nurtures the aspirations of the town's youth \nby sharing her love and expertise of dance.\n  As a faculty member of the Department of Dance at the University of \nNew Hampshire, Barbara also instructs dance students at the college \nlevel. In addition, during the holiday season, Barbara and her students \nperform the ``Nutcracker'' at local schools and in other communities, \nin an effort to spread a greater appreciation for the arts.\n  Barbara's dedication to dance, children and the community is \nexemplary and an example for others to follow.\n  Mr. President, I wish to commend Barbara Mullen on her achievements \nand congratulate her on receiving this prestigious award. It is an \nhonor to her in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5095-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAINE SOUTH HIGH SCHOOL AND THE ``WE THE PEOPLE'' COMPETITION\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, last week, high school students \nfrom across the United States came to Washington, D.C. to compete in \nthe national finals of the ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the \nConstitution'' program. These young scholars worked diligently to reach \nthe national finals and through their experience have gained a deep \nknowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of \nour constitutional democracy. I am proud to announce that the class \nfrom Maine South High School from Park Ridge, Illinois won the \ncompetition.\n  The ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nis designed to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill \nof Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings \nin the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of expert judges. \nThe students testify as constitutional experts before a ``congressional \ncommittee,'' that is, a panel of judges representing various regions in \nthe country and a cross-section of professional fields. The student \ntestimony is followed by a period of questioning during which the \njudges quiz students for their depth of understanding and their ability \nto apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  I congratulate all the student teams who made it to the national \nfinals. Each of those young people took the time to truly learn about \nour Constitution and Bill of Rights. In return, they got the \nopportunity to come to Washington and to meet other students from \naround the country. I applaud their efforts and initiative.\n  I am particularly proud that the winning team is from Maine South \nHigh School in Park Ridge, Illinois. Led by their teacher, Patton \nFeichter, the students won the three day competition to become national \nchampions. At a time when so much of our attention is focused on youth \nviolence, it is particularly refreshing to congratulate an outstanding \ngroup of young people who worked very hard to achieve their goals. I \ncongratulate the students, parents, and Maine South faculty members on \nall their hard work to win the competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5095-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KENNETH WINTERS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. \nKenneth Winters on the occasion of his retirement as president of \nCampbellsville University. Ken is a good personal friend and an admired \nleader in Taylor County.\n  Ken served as Campbellsville's president for the past 11 years, and \naccomplished much during his tenure. Under Ken's leadership, the school \ngained university status after having been known as Campbellsville \nCollege since its inception in 1909. The added prestige that comes with \nuniversity status, coupled with Ken's hard work to make the school an \nacademic success, helped increase Campbellsville enrollment by stunning \n150 percent. The university also has been duly recognized by \npublications such as U.S. News & World Report, Money and Newsweek for \nits outstanding academic reputation. Ken's presidency brought a strong, \nguiding presence to Campbellsville, leaving a legacy of growth and \nprogress.\n  As importantly, Ken showed unswerving commitment to the students and \nfaculty at CU, and was well-liked and respected by all. Ken's \ncolleagues describe him as a man with great strength of character--a \nman who demonstrated honesty and integrity, and who served as a campus \nrole-model.\n  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Ken Winters has left \nwill continue on, and will encourage and inspire others toward that \nsame goal. Ken, best wishes on your future endeavors, and know that \nyour efforts to better Christian higher education will be felt for \nyears to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, thank you for \nyour contribution to Taylor County, the State of Kentucky, and to our \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5095-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5095-S5096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO CONSTANCE ROSS, THE 1999 LONDONDERRY EDUCATOR OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize and congratulate Constance Ross for being named the ``1999 \nEducator of the Year'' by the Londonderry Business Council.\n  From teacher to administer, Constance has built a reputation for \nexcellence and achievement in many areas of education. In addition to \nserving the community as the Assistant Principal of South Londonderry \nSchool, she has become known throughout the State of New Hampshire for \nher tireless efforts to promote literacy among children. Constance's \nexpertise in the teaching and advocacy of reading have propelled her to \nthe position of co-chair of the ``Governor's Best Schools Initiative,'' \nas well as president of the New England Reading Association.\n  Active inside and outside of classrooms and schools, Constance has \ndemonstrated wisdom, compassion, and\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\nsensitivity with children, parents, and co-workers. These qualities are \nat the heart of what makes a good teacher special.\n  The mark of a great teacher is one who cares, unconditionally, about \nthe success and well-being of students. Mr. President, as a former \nteacher and school board member, I understand the challenges, \nresponsibilities and dedication involved with teaching. I admire and \nrespect Constance for establishing herself as a devoted teacher and \nadministrator in the Londonderry school district. Most importantly, she \nis helping to shape the lives of the young students who are the future \nof New Hampshire and the country.\n  I am proud to recognize Constance's achievements and it is an honor \nto represent her in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5096-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF MACOMB COUNTY'S TRIBUTE TO PRIVATE FIRST CLASS WALTER \n                               C. WETZEL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Macomb \nCounty, Michigan for its tribute to a brave World War II soldier, \nPrivate First Class Walter C. Wetzel. With the dedication of a bust of \nPrivate Wetzel at the new county administration building, Macomb County \nwill recognize the selfless actions of an American war hero.\n  Walter C. Wetzel entered the United States Army in Roseville, \nMichigan and served in European theater. Private Wetzel was an acting \nsquad leader with the Antitank Company of the 13th Infantry in Birken, \nGermany, during the early morning hours of April 3, 1945, when he \ndetected strong enemy forces moving in to attack. Private Wetzel \nalerted his comrades and immediately began defending their post against \nheavy automatic weapons fire. Under cover of darkness, the Germans \neventually forced their way close to the American position, hurling two \ngrenades into the room where Private Wetzel and others had taken up \nfiring positions. Shouting a warning to his fellow soldiers, Private \nWetzel threw himself on the grenades and absorbed their entire blast, \nsuffering wounds from which he died. The supreme gallantry of Private \nWetzel saved his comrades from death or serious injury and made it \npossible for them to continue the defense of their post. His \nunhesitating sacrifice of his life was in keeping with the highest \ntraditions of bravery and heroism. Because of his actions, Private \nWetzel was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  Private Wetzel and his courageous deeds have considerable meaning to \nhis family, and to the residents of Macomb County and the State of \nMichigan. Private Wetzel is the only person from Macomb County to \nreceive the Congressional Medal of Honor. His life has been honored by \nthe Michigan State Legislature and an important street in Macomb County \nwas named Pfc. Walter Wetzel Drive.\n  Mr. President, Private Wetzel is an example of the selfless and \ncourageous commitment our soldiers display every day. I know my \ncolleagues will join me in saluting Macomb County for its recognition \nof Private First Class Walter C. Wetzel and the sacrifice of the men \nand women of our Armed Services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5096-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ST.

This is National Hospital Week, when \ncommunities across the country celebrate the people that make hospitals \nthe special places they are. This year's theme sums it up nicely: \n``People Care. Miracles Happen.'' It recognizes the health care \nworkers, volunteers, and other health professionals who are there 24 \nhours a day, 365 days a year, curing and caring for their neighbors who \nneed them.\n  An example of this dedication is the Parent Help Line of St. John's \nHospital in Springfield, Illinois. The program won the American \nHospital Association's prestigious Hospital Award for Volunteer \nExcellence, which highlights special contributions of hospital \nvolunteers.\n  The Parent Help Line provides parents and agencies with easily \naccessible, low-cost parenting information and support to help \nstrengthen families and prevent child abuse. Trained volunteers give \nparenting tips, support and referrals to about 100 callers a month. \nVolunteers also visit parents of newborns and offer information about \ninfant growth and development and about the Parent Help Line services, \nand a volunteer nurse makes a follow-up call to each family one month \nafter discharge. Volunteers taking part in an intervention program \nregularly call parents identified as high risk. Parenting classes, \nprogram and support groups are made available to parents, and a \ntelevision show on parenting issues airs weekly on a local public \naccess channel. A monthly newsletter is mailed to more than 1,500 \nindividuals and agencies in central Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate St. John's Hospital for this \naward-winning program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5096-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO MAUREEN HEGG, THE 1999 LONDONDERRY CIVIC VOLUNTEER OF THE \n                                  YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

I would like to recognize one particular \nfacility in Kansas that has gone above and beyond the call of duty in \norder to meet the needs of the community--the Mount Carmel Medical \nCenter in Pittsburg, Kansas.\n  Mount Carmel Medical Center is located in the southeast corner of \nKansas. The community has 20,000 residents. About 25 percent of the \ntown's children are from families who live at or below the federal \npoverty level. More than half of the families in Pittsburg are headed \nby single parents who often work two jobs.\n  As one of the largest employers in the community, Mount Carmel \nMedical Center recognized that the entire community was suffering from \nthe lack of quality child care. Teachers noticed that children were \nunready to learn, they needed immunizations and hearing tests. After a \nconfirmation by the hospital's employee assistance program and a staff-\ninitiated community health assessment, Mount Carmel decided to take \naction. They formed a partnership with the Pittsburg schools and \nPittsburg State University to establish the Family Resource Center to \nmeet many of the community's needs. The Family Resource Center now \nprovides child care to more than 200 children and offers a wide range \nof social services. It also serves as the site of a free clinic staffed \nwith local physicians for those without health insurance coverage.\n  The Mount Carmel Medical Center has been nationally recognized for \nits achievements. The American Hospital\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nAssociation recently awarded the Mount Carmel Medical Center the 1999 \nNOVA award. NOVA awards recognize innovative community partnerships \nthat address communities' needs.\n  The collaborative outreach efforts of Mount Carmel Medical Center \ndemonstrates true dedication to the community.

Mr. President, this is National Hospital Week, and \none of Michigan's hospitals, Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids, Michigan, \nis being honored by the American Hospital Association (AHA). National \nHospital Week gives health care workers, volunteers, and other health \nprofessionals the recognition that they deserve for all the care they \nprovide.\n  Spectrum Health has been singled out by the AHA for its Universal \nInfant Hearing Screening program, located at Spectrum's Downtown Campus \nin Grand Rapids. This program is the recipient of the AHA's prestigious \nHospital Award for Volunteer Excellence, an award which highlights \nspecial contributions of hospital volunteers.\n  Spectrum's Universal Infant Hearing Screening program identifies \npotential hearing loss in all babies born at or transferred to the \nSpectrum Health Downtown Campus. It is well known that such early \nidentification and intervention can prevent a hearing problem from \nbecoming a handicap.\n  Universal Infant Hearing Screening volunteers must undergo extensive \ntraining to prepare for this program. After the volunteers administer \nthe screening, audiologists review the test results to identify infants \nwith potential problems. Those infants with abnormal results are \nreferred for re-screening or diagnostic testing. Without the work of \nthe volunteers, it would be impossible to provide this vital service to \nthe thousands of babies born at Spectrum Health every year.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Spectrum Health for its \naward winning program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5097-5", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5097-S5098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL COMMUNITY ACTION MONTH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a \ngroup of individuals and agencies whose cause represents the ideal of \npublic service--the improvement of the lives of those who are less \nfortunate. The Maryland Association of Community Action Agencies \n(MACAA), which begins its annual conference Monday in Ocean City, is a \ngroup of seventeen Community Action Agencies (CAA) which combat poverty \nin cities, towns and rural communities throughout our State, and \nprovide services to countless low-income families and individuals.\n  This year's MACAA conference is made even more significant as 1999 \nmarks the 35th anniversary of the creation of Community Action \nAgencies. CAA's were developed as part of the Economic Opportunity Act \nof 1964 which was the centerpiece of President Johnson's War on \nPoverty. This Act also began other critical social service programs \nincluding the Head Start pre-school program and the Job Corps Training \nCenter program.\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\n  Currently, the MACAA serves individuals and families in Baltimore \nCity and 23 counties throughout Maryland. Working with 1000 agencies \nnationwide, CAA's serve 98% of our Nation's cities and counties and are \na primary source of support for the more than 38 million Americans \nliving in poverty in rural and urban areas. Services provided by CAA's \nand their dedicated volunteers include employment training, adult and \nchild educational services, senior assistance, income management, \nhousing and rental assistance, emergency services and food and \nnutritional relief. Whether it is through the exchange of information \non poverty issues, the provision of services and assistance, the \ndevelopment of funding resources, or the effort to influence public \npolicy, the ultimate mission of these agencies and volunteers is to \nassist low-income citizens to achieve a higher level of self-\nsufficiency.\n  Mr. President, for more than 30 years, MACAA has sponsored this \nannual conference which brings together hundreds of individuals \ninvolved in the effort to eliminate poverty. Appropriately, this May \nhas been designated National Community Action Month, and May 4-10 has \nbeen designated National Community Action week to publicize the \nachievements of CAA's and to emphasize their continuing importance in \nour communities. This is a most fitting occasion to celebrate a \ncoalition such as MACAA, which is so integral to the health and well \nbeing of citizens throughout Maryland. I am pleased to congratulate the \nMACAA for thirty years of invaluable service, and for their efforts to, \nto borrow the CAA credo, provide a ``hand up, not a hand out.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5098-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO RITCHIE BERNARD, THE 1999 LONDONDERRY BUSINESS PERSON OF THE \n                                  YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, two American soldiers have died in \nKosovo, the first American casualties of a war to stop a genocide.\n  The contrast between what is unfolding in the Balkans, and what is \nhappening here in Congress, could not be more clear.\n  A dictatorship, like the government of Slobodan Milosevic, imposes \nits will through force.\n  A democracy expresses its will through the act of voting.\n  Every vote that we cast in this body is an affirmation of the power \nof a democracy to solve its problems peacefully.\n  Today, my colleague and good friend Joe Biden cast his 10,000 vote in \nthis body. That number reflects a record of public service matched by \nvery few even in an institution like this one, through which so many \ngreat men and women have passed.\n  As Senators, we are all Members of a very exclusive club. We have \nbeen sent here on behalf of the good people of our respective States, \nto do their business.\n  With his 10,000th vote, Joe Biden has joined an even more exclusive \nclub.\n  Over the history of this republic, thousands of men and women have \nserved as Senators. But only a very few can say that they did such a \ngood job--and kept doing a good job over such a long period of time--\nthat they lasted long enough to vote as many times, on as many \ndifferent issues, as Joe Biden.\n  But the thing that impresses me the most about Joe Biden's 27 years \nin the Senate isn't what he has done on the floor, or the number of \nvotes he has cast--although his leadership, courage and dedication are \nwell-known to those of us who are privileged to serve with him every \nday.\n  Instead, what impresses me most is his role as a husband to his wife \nJill, and father to his sons Beau and Hunter and his daughter Ashley.\n  Joe Biden still lives in Delaware with his family and commutes every \nday between Delaware and Washington on the train.\n  Those 10,000 votes represent thousands of hours spent alone on the \ntrain to Delaware so that Joe Biden could spend a few precious hours \nwith his family each night before returning to Washington on the train \nthe next morning.\n  I also want to talk about the courage that my friend Joe Biden has \nshown during his long tenure as a Senator. I want to do this so that \npeople know just what that number--10,000 votes--really means.\n  Only one month after first being elected to the Senate in 1972, Joe's \nfirst wife Neilia died tragically in an automobile accident along with \nhis one-year old daughter.\n  In 1988, Joe was almost killed by a brain aneurysm. He under went two \nrisky operations and returned to the Senate after only a few months.\n  Mr. President, I speak of these tragedies today because I know that \nit has not been easy for Joe. But he has never complained--just done \nhis work. Senator Biden is a great orator, but an even Better father, \nhusband and friend.\n  When you see what he has had to overcome, that gives a whole new \nmeaning to that number 10,000.\n  Those of us who work with Joe Biden have long known of his dedication \nto the ideals of this body, and his devotion to his family.\n  With the attention that his 10,000th vote should bring, I hope that \nmore people are able to see the qualities that we are privileged to see \nevery day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5098-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5098-S5099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING NEVADAN JERRY CRUM\n\n Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding Nevadan for his exemplary volunteer service to the disabled \ncommunity both in Northern Nevada and across the United States. Jerry \nCrum has become a recognized leader through his advocacy on behalf of \npeople afflicted with Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome, \nCFIDS. Since being diagnosed with CFIDS himself in the mid 1980's, \nJerry has worked to increase awareness of this often misunderstood \ndisease, and to improve the lives of those who suffer from it.\n  Jerry was incapacitated through much of the 1980's. After several \nyears in and out of hospitals, however, he made a strong, though not \ncomplete recovery. As his strength increased, so did his efforts to \nhelp others with this debilitating condition. At the same time, he also \nsaw that people with other disabilities and chronic illnesses had \nencountered many of the obstacles he had. He then sought to share his \nstory with others, and to teach others with disabilities how to be \neffective advocates for themselves.\n  In 1990, Jerry became a charter member of the CFIDS lobbying \norganization called CACTUS. In 1992, he helped start the CFIDS \nAssociation of America's\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\nPublic Policy Action Committee, and later founded ``Lobby Day,'' an \nopportunity for people with CFIDS to travel to Washington, DC to meet \nwith their federal representatives and advance funding and policy needs \nof CFIDS. Since then, he has testified at a Senate hearing examining \nthe affects of this illness.\n  Although Jerry has always spoken on behalf of all people with \ndisabilities, he specifically expanded his focus in 1998 to include \npeople with lymphoma when he was diagnosed with this rare form of \ncancer himself. He became active in the Carson Advocates for Cancer and \nwas the Nevada co-chair of the 1998 National Cancer March. He came to \nWashington again, and marched along-side cancer survivors such as \nNorman Schwarzkoph as they crusaded to encourage research to find a \ncure for this terrible disease.\n  Jerry has been a catalyst in bringing advocates together to achieve \nvictories for the disabled. I thank him for his service to Nevada and \nto all who suffer from chronic, disabling conditions such as CFIDS. He \nhas made Nevada proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5099-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO RE/MAX 1ST CHOICE OF LONDONDERRY, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to RE/MAX 1st Choice of Londonderry, New Hampshire, for being \nnamed ``Company of the Year'' by the Londonderry Business Council. It \nis indeed a prestigious honor.\n  RE/MAX 1st Choice is a fast growing real estate business that has \nrecently opened in Londonderry. Under the direction of Arlene Hajjar, \nRE/MAX 1st Choice has worked hard to establish itself within the real \nestate market of Londonderry.\n  RE/MAX 1st Choice has worked hard for the community. It has sponsored \na number of activities to benefit both charities and the community as a \nwhole. Admirable business practices, community involvement, and \ncharitable donations and sponsorships have made the company a rising \nforce in the Londonderry business community. Its dedication to the town \nhas been admirable and gracious.\n  Arlene has been one of the main reasons behind RE/MAX 1st Choices' \nsuccess. She is a member of the Londonderry Business Council and works \ndiligently to represent the business community. She has helped shape \nnot only her company, but also the community through her activism with \nthe town.\n  As a former real estate business owner, I understand the demands and \nthe trials associated with owning and operating a real estate business. \nI commend Arlene Hajjar and the staff of RE/MAX 1st Choice on their \nsuccess. I wish them the best of luck and congratulate them once again \nfor receiving this award.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the students and teachers from Valley High School in \nWest Des Moines, IA for achieving the top score in the 1999 National \nGRAMMY Signature School Competition.\n  It took hard work and dedication to achieve this honor, and I \ncongratulate the students, teachers, and others who make it happen. \nValley High School enrolls over 2,200 students, and fully 600 students, \nnearly a third of the student body, participates in one or more music \nprograms. On February 4, 1999 the GRAMMY Signature School designated \nValley High School the best music program among 250 public schools from \naround the country. They were judged by a panel of top musical \neducators and professionals and were selected based on their high level \nof commitment to music education.\n  In light of this announcement, U.S Secretary of Education Richard W. \nRiley, said, ``At a time when creativity and communication skills are \nat a premium, schools likes those being recognized at this program are \nusing arts for their rich potential to captivate and engage students in \nthe process of learning. The arts help children learn to solve \nproblems, think creatively, and develop mental discipline, which are \nvaluable skills for any academic endeavor.''\n  Mr. President, year after year underfunded public schools continue to \nslash funding for all forms of arts and humanities education, thereby \nweakening the strong cultural heritage the United States has always \nenjoyed. We should therefore commend the students and teachers of the \nValley High School music program for their commitment to a quality \nmusic education, and the benefits their efforts reap upon the cultural \nlandscape of the state of Iowa. It is a true honor to serve as their \nSenator, and I believe they are examples of what all Americans should \nstrive to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5099-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GIRL SCOUTS FROM KETCHIKAN\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nwork of three Girl Scouts from Ketchikan, Alaska. Angela Pfeifer, \nChelsea Pfeifer and Tennille Walker are each working towards the Girl \nScout Gold Award. As a part of their service, they are attempting to \nenhance the visibility, respect and care of the American flag in \nKetchikan.\n  The following is an excerpt from a letter in which Chelsea explains \nthe pride and respect she has for our nation's flag.\n\n       This Spring Break I went down to Florida to visit my \n     grandparents. My Grandfather served in World War II. At 87, \n     he still put up the U.S. flag every morning, and takes it \n     down every night. It makes my think of the number of people \n     who died serving this country, so that we could have the \n     freedoms that we enjoy today. The flag serves as a symbol of \n     the respect and honor that should be given to those who \n     fought. I observed that many of the retired people display \n     the Flag proudly on a daily basis outside their homes. It \n     would be my goal to see that my generation carry out this \n     tradition and be proud to be an American.\n\n  In their efforts to instill this same sense of pride and respect. \nChelsea, Angela and Tennille have conducted school assemblies at \nKetchikan area elementary schools, have placed flags in every classroom \nat Ketchikan High School and have spoken to local governments officials \nabout erecting a new flag pole in Ketchikan City Park.\n  Currently, there is no flag flying in Ketchikan City Park. Angela, \nChelsea and Tennille have addressed this with Ketchikan--Gateway \nBorough Mayor Jack Shay. As a result, the Mayor and Borough Assembly \nagreed to install a flag pole in City Park.\n  It is my honor to present these three outstanding Alaskans with an \nAmerican flag flown over the United States Capitol. The flag will be \npresented to the City of Ketchikan on June 14, 1999, Flag Day, and will \nbe the first flag to fly in City Park.\n  I commend the work of Angela, Chelsea and Tennille and the Girl \nScouts of Ketchikan.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n75th anniversary of the Vermont State Park System.\n  In 1924 Frances Humphreys donated the peak of Mt. Philo and \nsurrounding lands to the State of Vermont as the first State Park. Mt. \nPhilo was the perfect location for the first park; looking east from \nthe summit one views Lake Champlain, North America's most beautiful \nlake stretching as far as the eye can see to the north and south; \nlooking west one views the Green Mountain range rolling across Vermont \nto the Connecticut River. There are limitless recreational \nopportunities within and surrounding our first park.\n  After 75 years, Vermont now has 50 State Parks, from Alburg Dunes on \nLake Champlain, to Wilgus on the Connecticut River; from Mount \nMansfield, Vermont's highest peak to Quechee, our deepest gorge.\n  Vermont's State Parks are rich in history. Many of the nation's first \nski trails were carved out in Vermont State Parks by the Civilian \nConservation Corps, creating the New England ski industry. Under the \ndirection Perry Merrill, who oversaw the State Parks for 37 years, more \nthan 40,000 ``CCC Boys'' created a parks infrastructure that is intact, \nand unparalleled even today.\n  Recognition should also go to the many Vermonters who, over the \nyears, have followed the example of Frances\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nHumphreys in donating land to become state parks, including one of our \nnewest parks, Sentinel Rock, which was recently donated by Windsor and \nFlorence Wright.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize 75 years of \nvisionary conservation and recreation development by the State of \nVermont, and by those who have conceived and built the State Park \nSystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5100-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF PLAISTOW, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Plaistow, New Hampshire on its two hundred and \nfiftieth anniversary. The town's residents will celebrate this historic \noccasion on June 27, 1999 with a number of festivities including a \ngrand reception. I was proud to be invited to participate in this \nmeaningful event.\n  Plaistow's history first dates back to the year 1642 when families \nfirst settled in the Plaistow area. It was then that the Plaistow area \nwas purchased. In 1749, Plaistow was incorporated. At that time, it was \nseparated from Haverhill, Massachusetts. Then Governor Benning \nWentworth, along with King George II signed the town's first charter.\n  The town has had a rich and fruitful history. The First Baptist \nChurch was built in 1837, and subsequently remodeled in 1906. The first \nCatholic Church, Holy Angels, was built in 1893, then redone in 1964. \nThe first high school was built in 1966. Prior to that, the students \ntraveled outside the town for schooling.\n  Plaistow has steadily grown throughout the years. In 1854, there were \n800 people. In 1949, the town had grown to 1800 people. Today, over \n7000 people are residents of Plaistow.\n  Through the years, Plaistow residents have courageously served their \ncountry. They have served in the Colonial War, Revolutionary War, Civil \nWar, World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n  The most well known benefactor of the town was Arthur Pollard. \nPollard donated the bell for the First Baptist Church, the land for \nPollard School and the town hall, and the Civil War statue and cannons \non the town green.\n  I congratulate the town of Plaistow, and all of the dedicated and \npatriotic citizens there. I am proud to be their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5100-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING THE LIVINGSTONS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of \nAmerica. Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In \nan era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their \nunion dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and \nimportant to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death \nus do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless \nprinciples of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our \ncountry strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Robert and Nellie \nLivingston, who on June 4th, 1999, will celebrate their 50th wedding \nanniversary. Many things have changed in the 50 years they have been \nmarried, but the values, principles, and commitment this marriage \ndemonstrates are timeless. As Mr. and Mrs. Livingston celebrate their \n50th year together with family and friends, it will be apparent that \nthe lasting legacy of this marriage will be the time, energy, and \nresources invested in their children, friends, and community. My wife, \nJanet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar \nmilestone.\n  The Livingstons' commitment to the principles and values of their \nmarriage deserve to be saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5100-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE WASHINGTON REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

This award is given to acknowledge hospitals that create \nand implement new and innovative community partnerships. Only nine \nhospitals nationwide were honored by this distinction.\n  The Washington Regional Medical Center is a leader in its commitment \nto the health and well-being of Washington County's children. The \nWashington Regional Medical Center works to reverse the trend of \nchronic disease, disability, and even death through its ``Kids For \nHealth Program.'' In collaboration with the Washington County school \nsystem, more than 8,000 children have been educated about self-esteem, \ngeneral health, nutrition, fitness, hygiene, safety, and environmental \nhealth. Good health habits learned at a young age often parlay into \nbetter health in adult life. The ``Kids For Health Program'' proves \nthat communities which educate their children in healthy habits reap \nvast benefits by becoming healthier communities overall.\n  On behalf of all the children in Arkansas, I thank the Washington \nRegional Medical Center for its impressive achievement in children's \nhealth and its contribution to stronger communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5100-4", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nour nation's law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the \nline of duty. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. Res. 22, a resolution \npassed earlier this year by the Senate to commemorate and acknowledge \nthe dedication and sacrifice made by these men and women. The \nresolution declared this Saturday, May 15th, as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day.\n  Currently, there are more than 700,000 men and women who serve this \nnation as the guardians of law and order. The duties of a law \nenforcement officer are both vitally important and extremely dangerous. \nOfficers place themselves between our communities and the criminals who \nwould do us harm. Every year, approximately 1 in 9 officers is \nassaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 officers is \nkilled in the line of duty. In 1998, 156 federal, state and local law \nenforcement officers lost their lives in the line of duty.\n  My home state of Vermont is familiar with the sacrifices made by law \nenforcement officer. Since 1965, the nine Vermont law enforcement \nofficers listed below have lost their lives in the line of duty.\n  July 9, 1965, Chief Alexander Pontecha, Lyndonville Police \nDepartment.\n  December 12, 1972, Chief Dana L. Thompson, Manchester Police \nDepartment.\n  January 17, 1978, Deputy Sheriff Bernard J. Demag, Chitternden County \nSheriff's Department.\n  April 27, 1978, Game Warden Arnold J. Magoon, Vermont Fish and \nWildlife Department.\n  October 1, 1982, Deputy Sheriff George J. Bent, Chittenden County \nSheriff's Department.\n  May 13, 1983, Lieutenant Arthur L. Yeaw, Vermont Department of Public \nSafety.\n  June 14, 1987, Detective Sergeant William J. Chenard, Vermont \nDepartment of Public Safety.\n  June 25, 1989, Investigator Eugene N. Gaiotti, Vermont Department of \nLiquor Control.\n  May 12, 1992, Sergeant Gary Gaboury, Vermont Department of Pubic \nSafety.\n  It is my hope that the National Peace Officers Memorial Day will \nremind Vermonters and Americans everywhere of the sacrifices made by \nlaw enforcement officers, and of the vital duties they perform every \nday. Whether by apprehending dangerous felons, assisting stranded \nmotorists on the side of the road, or improving the lives of our young \npeople, law enforcement officers make our towns, cities, states, and \nNation safer places to live and work. We owe a tremendous debt of \ngratitude to those officers, and their families, who have given so much \nto improve all of our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5100-5", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5100-S5101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR PSALEDAS, THE 1999 LONDONDERRY CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, as we wrap up this work day here in the \nSenate, I want to take a little time to talk about a subject that is \nnear and dear to everybody's heart, and, of course, that is taxes.\n  Most Americans believe they pay too much in taxes. And you know, they \nare right.\n  One of the biggest and best indicators of how exhausting the tax \nburden has become is the annual arrival of what we call Tax Freedom \nDay, and that is the day on which Americans stop working just to pay \ntheir State, Federal, and local taxes and actually begin working and \nkeeping their earnings for themselves and their families.\n  This year, Americans had to wait until today, May 11, before Tax \nFreedom Day actually arrived. At least 132 days into the year, this is \nthe latest arrival of Tax Freedom Day ever.\n  As a sign of just how far and fast taxes have come, in 1950, \nAmericans marked Tax Freedom Day on April 3.\n  For residents in my home State of Minnesota, the situation is even \nmore troubling because this year's Tax Freedom Day has been pushed \nforward to May 21, nearly 2 weeks later than the rest of the country.\n  That ranks Minnesota third in the Nation; only in New York and \nConnecticut do taxpayers have to wait even longer to begin keeping \ntheir own money.\n  Tax Freedom Day, as calculated by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, \nreveals an ever-increasing tax burden over the past 25 years. And the \nsingle most potent explanation for America's late Tax Freedom Day is \nour seriously flawed tax system.\n  Our tax system is unfair, it is complicated, and it is designed to \nsqueeze more money out of the wallets of working Americans to expand \nGovernment.\n  Since 1993, for instance, Federal taxes have increased by 54 percent. \nCan you imagine that? Since 1993, Federal taxes have increased 54 \npercent, which for the average taxpayer translates into a $2,000 per \nyear increase in the amount of taxes they pay to the Federal \nGovernment. That is $2,000 a year more today than just 6 years ago was \npaid to the Federal Government by the average taxpayer. As a result, \nAmericans today have the largest tax burden ever in history, including \nWorld War II, and it is still growing.\n  Federal taxes now consume on average about 21 percent of our national \nincome, compared to just over 18 percent in 1992. So again, 3 percent \nmore of this country's GDP goes to taxes than it did just 6 years ago. \nOn average, every American--each and every American--is paying $10,298 \nthis year in Federal, State and local taxes. On average, each American \nis paying $10,298 this year to support Government.\n  A typical family now pays more of its income in total taxes than it \nspends on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. More \nand more middle income families are being pushed into higher tax \nbrackets every year.\n  Here is an example of the devastating ``middle class tax squeeze.'' \nThere are more than 20 million American workers today with annual \nearnings between $30,000 and $50,000. Before 1993, they paid income \ntaxes at the 15 percent tax rate. But most of them have now been pushed \ninto the 28 percent tax bracket, and that is due to inflation and \neconomic growth. Worse still, they have to pay the 28 percent federal \nincome tax rate on top of a 15.3 percent payroll tax.\n  This adds up, for average Americans making between $30,000 and \n$50,000, to a tax rate of 43 percent to the Federal Government, and \nthat is without counting State, local, and other taxes. So for many \nAmericans, making between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, they are paying \nabout 50 percent of their income to support Government. So any gains \nthe taxpayers might have made in wages have been snatched away by \nWashington in the form of a bigger tax bite. This is the most important \nreason for the late arrival of Tax Freedom Day.\n  People today work hard and then are penalized for their work. With \npunitive taxes, Washington makes the American dream of working hard for \na better life more difficult, and even for some, it makes it \nimpossible.\n  The only way we can effectively stop this and push back Tax Freedom \nDay is to terminate the Tax Code and replace it with one that promotes \nfreedom and economic opportunity. We must repeal the 16th amendment and \nabolish the IRS.\n  We must create a new tax system that is fair, simple, and friendly to \nthe taxpayers--when they no longer need to file a tax return with the \nIRS, and when their families' finances aren't revealed to Government \nbureaucrats, and when they are no longer penalized for getting or \nstaying married--or for dying, for that matter--when everyone pays the \nsame tax rate without any loopholes for any special interest groups, \nand when hidden taxes are eliminated and everyone can easily understand \nthe tax laws. And finally, there will be no more IRS audits and abuse--\nbecause, again, we need to pull out the IRS by the roots to abolish the \nIRS entirely.\n\n  Pending fundamental tax reforms, Congress must provide meaningful tax \nrelief to help alleviate the tax burden on working Americans.\n  That is why the recently-passed budget resolution reserves nearly \n$800 billion of the non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years \nearmarking it for tax relief.\n  This proves that this Congress is committed to providing meaningful \ntax relief in 1999, while protecting Social Security and Medicare, \nreducing the national debt, and funding important national priorities.\n  This year's budget also includes my amendment calling on the Congress \nto place a priority on middle income tax relief by returning tax \noverpayments to those from whom it was taken.\n  It includes options for tax relief, such as a broad-based tax cut, \nmarriage penalty relief, retirement savings incentives, death tax \nrelief, health care-related tax relief, and education-related tax \nrelief. If enacted, this will be the largest tax relief since the \nReagan tax cuts of the 1980s.\n  Americans are frustrated by the late arrival of Tax Freedom Day. They \nare worried about their future economic security. And they also want \nthe opportunity to put their dollars to work supporting their families, \nnot supporting the Government.\n  We owe it to the American taxpayer to work together to fix the system \nthrough fundamental tax reform. We can do this through turning Tax \nFreedom Day from a day of disappointment into a day finally worth \ncelebrating.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/11/senate-section/article/S5102-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
