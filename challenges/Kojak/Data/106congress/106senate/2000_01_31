Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a \nperiod of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the \nSenate will resume debate on the bankruptcy reform bill under the \nprevious order. There are a few amendments remaining, and those \nSenators who have amendments under the agreement are encouraged to work \nwith the bill managers on a time to debate their amendments. As \npreviously announced, votes ordered with respect to the bankruptcy \nlegislation will be stacked to occur on Tuesday at a time to be \ndetermined.\n  In an effort to complete the bankruptcy bill, Senators may expect \nvotes throughout the day on Tuesday and Wednesday. Following completion \nof the bankruptcy bill, the Senate is expected to begin consideration \nof the nuclear waste legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Supreme Court \nannounced recently that it will decide whether state governments are \nbound by the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  The issue in the case, Dickson v. Florida, is whether the states are \nimmune from suit under the ADA based on the Constitution's 11th \nAmendment immunity provision for states. The legal issues are quite \nsimilar to Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, in which the Supreme \nCourt held earlier this month that the states cannot be sued under the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act.\n  This case could be critical to a bill I have introduced, the State \nand Local Prison Relief Act. This legislation, S. 32, would exclude \nstate prisoners from coverage under the ADA. The Dickson case \nunderscores the need to accomplish the purpose of this bill. The \nCongress did not consider all of the potential consequences of enacting \nthe ADA, and its implications on prisons is one of the best examples.\n  The courts have always deferred to the states in the management of \nprisons. We do not need the federal courts second-guessing the states' \ndecisions on how to best manage and control the volatile prison \nenvironment. This is especially true in the face of a statute that \ncreates very specific legal rights for very broad classes of \nindividuals.\n  The Act is detrimental to the safe, orderly operation of state \nprisons. Moreover, at the very least, it gives prisoners more of an \nexcuse to challenge authority by providing them more tools to bring \nfrivolous lawsuits against state prisons.\n  Dickson is a case of great significance. It provides the Supreme \nCourt a unique opportunity to limit the reach of Federal power over \nstate prisons and continue its recent affirmation of the power of the \nstates in our constitutional scheme of government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are in a period of \nmorning business now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to be in control of the time under the control \nof the Democratic leader today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until 1 o'clock.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S122-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S122-S124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S122]]\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been interested in watching both the \nDemocratic and Republican battles in New Hampshire for the nomination \nof the respective parties. I was not able to watch personally, but I \nunderstand that yesterday Mr. McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona, \nwas interviewed on one of the national shows and talked about campaign \nfinance reform and, in effect, the difficult sledding it has been for \nhim, a Republican, to move forward on this issue.\n  Based on what the Supreme Court did just last week, I think it is \nsignificant to keep our eye on the prize, and that is to recognize that \nthe Supreme Court has now given us the latitude and leeway to be able \nto do something about campaign finance reform. Senator McCain is to be \ncongratulated for being so responsive to what I think the American \npublic is asking from us. That is to do something about lessening the \nneed for the huge amounts of money in Federal elections.\n  Senator McCain has been very lonely out there, for being a member of \nthe majority. He has not had a lot of support. I think it has taken a \nlot of courage for him to move forward with campaign finance reform. I \nbelieve if we start talking about the issue, as I have heard Governor \nBush say: Well, I can't support campaign finance reform because it will \nsimply help the Democrats----Mr. President, it would help the American \npublic if people took a more realistic view regarding this vital \nlegislation. Let's move forward with legislation that will take the \ndemand for money out of the mix.\n\n  I have said it on this floor before, but I think it is worth \nrepeating. In the small State of Nevada, with less than 2 million \npeople, $23 million was spent in my last reelection. No one outspent \nthe other. My opponent spent the same amount of money I did--a little \nover $4 million, for the individual campaigns. We each spent, through \nthe various parties, money on our behalf, basically, $6 million each. \nThat is $20 million. Plus, we don't know, but I have estimated there \nwas another $3 million on independent expenditures.\n  That is out of line. It is obnoxious, it is obscene, it is too much \nmoney. We have to arrive at a point where we have to take this soft \nmoney mix out of campaigns. We may not be able to do everything \nincluded in the McCain-Feingold bill that we need to do, but let's work \ntoward a compromise that at least takes corporate money out of \ncampaigns.\n  Earlier in this century, the decision was made by Congress that \ncorporate money should not be allowed in Federal elections. Over the \nyears, that has worked fine. But in a ruling the Supreme Court said, \nwell, you still can't use corporate money on individual campaigns, but \nState parties can use it basically any way they want. As a result of \nthat, there has been this tremendous rush by both parties for corporate \nmoney, and they spend it on behalf of individual candidates. I think \nthat is wrong. We should reverse that statutorily. As I reviewed the \nSupreme Court decision, it was clear that, in fact, was the case. \nJustice Souter did a very good job in writing that opinion. It is clear \nand concise. I think we should move forward and have campaign finance \nreform.\n  Mr. President, beginning this congressional session, the last year of \nthis Congress, it is important that we reflect on where we are and \nwhere we need to go. It seems pretty clear we have made great progress \nin getting the country's fiscal house in order. Just 7 years ago, when \nPresident Clinton came into office, the yearly budget deficit was more \nthan $300 billion, especially if you add in the Social Security \nsurplus, which was being used for years to mask the annual deficit. \nInstead of having these $300 billion-plus deficits every year, we will \nnow, for the second year in a row, have a surplus.\n  It is difficult for those of us who have served in this body for a \nfew years to understand that we are now talking about what we should do \nwith our surplus. During this period of time, we have created over 20 \nmillion new jobs. The vast majority of the jobs are high-wage jobs, \ngood jobs. We have low unemployment, low inflation, strong economic \ngrowth, and lower Government spending. We have cut the payroll of the \nFederal Government by over 300,000 individuals, excluding the cuts that \nhave been made within the military.\n  We are doing a much better job. We are at 18.7-percent Federal \nGovernment spending as a share of gross domestic product, and that is \nthe lowest since 1974. That is real progress. Real hourly wages are up. \nWe also have strong private sector growth, and as I have indicated, low \ninflation. The underlying core rate of inflation is at its lowest since \n1965. In the last four quarters, the GDP price index has risen only 1.3 \npercent, which is the lowest rate of increase since 1963.\n  We are talking about decades and decades of improvement. We have \nreduced welfare rolls. Both parties worked together to bring about less \nwelfare. That is important. Not only are we seeing people move off the \nwelfare rolls, we are putting people to work. We have high-home \nownership. We have jobs in the auto industry. People said a few years \nago that the American automobile industry was dead and that we should \nforget about again being somebody who produces most of the cars in the \nworld. That was reversed because of good decisions by management and \ntremendous production by labor.\n\n  Since 1993, we have added almost 200,000 new auto jobs. The annual \nrate of adding auto jobs is the fastest we have ever had. I think we \nare doing very well.\n  Regarding the construction industry, all we have to do is look at the \nState of Nevada which leads the Nation, and has for 14 years, as the \nfastest growing State in the Union. We have cranes--some use the old \nterm that it is the ``national bird''--all over the State of Nevada, \nwith construction going on. But Nevada is not the only place; this \ncountry is in a period of phenomenal economic growth. There are still \nsectors that need improvement, but we have done fine. We are looking \nnow to improving people's lives. We are now looking into issues that we \nnever have before.\n  I am sure that you, just as the Senator from Nevada, find all this \nInternet stuff kind of new. It is something we didn't have when we were \ngrowing up, and it has taken some training and some real education to \nbecome somewhat computer literate. It is so easy to become computer \nliterate. You can order anything you want off the Internet. You can \norder CDs, water, and many other items.\n  The other Saturday morning, I turned on my computer to find out what \nthe news was in Nevada. They have a little teaser there almost every \ntime you turn on the computer about different services rendered. One of \nthe things on my computer said, ``Do you want to sell your house?'' My \nwife and I, with our children being raised now, are considering moving \nfrom our home where the kids were raised to a smaller place. And so I \nclicked on that little thing on my computer, and within 5 minutes, on \nmy screen in McLean, VA, where we have our home locally, I found places \nwhere homes were sold in the last 2 years and for how much they were \nsold.\n  There is so much on the computer that it is difficult for me to \ncomprehend. That brings about another problem, and that is our privacy. \nIs our privacy being protected with all the things happening on the \nInternet? Some say yes, some say they are not too sure, and some say \nno. This is something at which we as a Congress need to take a look. We \nneed extensive hearings to determine how safe information is on the \nInternet.\n  Are our medical records being protected? If your wife, your father, \nyour brother, your sister goes to the hospital, are their records being \nprotected? Is your privacy being protected? Is your credit card \nprotected on the Internet? Are, in fact, these people who are getting \ninformation on the net selling this information to other people? These \nare questions raised in this new, modern society in which we live and \nat which Congress must take a look. We didn't have to look at those \nthings just a short time ago.\n  In addition to recognizing that our economy is in great shape, we \nhave things on which we have to work. We have to realize we have new \nchallenges ahead of us. Privacy is one of them.\n  I talked about campaign finance reform. That is so important to us. \nWe need to take a look at that. But also we have to take a look at what \nis happening to the health care delivery system in our country. Every \nyear, over a\n\n[[Page S123]]\n\nmillion people become uninsured. We have now well over 40 million \npeople who have no health insurance. That is not something that we can \nsay is someone else's problem. It is our problem, just as it is someone \nelse's problem.\n  Why do I say that? Because when a person who has no health insurance \nis in an automobile accident, they go to the emergency room--that is \nthe most expensive care that can be rendered. As a result of this, the \nfact that people who have no health insurance are taking care of that \nway causes my premiums to go up and yours. It causes higher taxes to be \ncharged for health care, and it, of course, causes hospital and doctor \nbills to be increased more than they should to take care of those \npeople who have no health insurance.\n  We must do something about inadequate health care. The fact is that \nin America, the most powerful nation in the world, we have over 40 \nmillion people today with no health insurance. We could add in all of \nthe little things people have talked about such as medical savings \naccounts and all other such things. If we added all of those and \naccepted them--some would say no, that is not good, and some of us \ndisagree about the way to go. But let's say we did. We would then take \ncare of only about 3.5 million people, still leaving almost 40 million \npeople with no health insurance. We have to be real and stop talking \nabout these little gimmicks and start talking about the fact that \nhealth care is something of which too many people do not have the \nbenefit. Those people who do not have health insurance are being jerked \naround.\n  The fact is that we have tried to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights \ngiving people the ability to have health insurance and not to be taken \nadvantage of by big-interest companies and HMOs. That is why we have \nworked very hard to have a real Patients' Bill of Rights passed, one \nwhere people can go to a specialist when they want to; to a health care \nplan that allows a woman to be taken care of by a gynecologist when she \nbelieves it is necessary; a provision so that when somebody does \nsomething negligent and wrong, they can be sued. People don't like \nlawyers unless they need one themselves. With health care, there are \ntimes when people do things that are wrong. Individuals need the right \nto go to court to redress wrongs.\n  We have a lot to do in this Congress. We don't need to come here and \nboast about how well we are doing with the economy. We need to do \nsomething about the campaign finance problems we have in this country, \nabout our health care delivery system.\n  It is clear, with all that is going on in our country today, that we \nneed to look at how guns are handled. I have said on this floor before \nand I say again that I was, in effect, raised with guns. As a 12-year-\nold boy, I was given a 12-gauge shotgun for my birthday. I still have \nthat gun. My parents ordered it out of the Sears & Roebuck catalog. I \nlearned how to handle weapons as a young boy. We would hunt and do the \nother things you do with guns. I have been a police officer. I \npersonally have a number of firearms in Nevada.\n  I have no problem with the fact that if I want to purchase a handgun, \nI tell people who I am and they can make a determination by checking my \nidentification and whether or not I am a felon or in fact mentally \nunstable. That is what the Brady bill is all about. Hundreds of \nthousands of people are granted weapons as a result of that. I am \nwilling to be checked each time I purchase a gun. I don't think that is \nunreasonable. But there are those who are trying to avoid that by going \nto pawnshops and purchasing pistols, and, as a result of that, checks \naren't made--or they are going to gun shows. We need to close those \nloopholes. Here on this floor last year, we did that. That was done by \nvirtue of Vice President Gore breaking the tie vote. But the problem \nis, we haven't gone to conference. We need to take that loophole out of \nthe law. The American public believe that is appropriate. We should at \nleast do that. That is the minimum we can do with guns.\n  My knowledge about weapons is, I think, average or above, and I don't \nneed an assault weapon to go hunting or to protect my family. These \nassault weapons need some restrictions placed on them. I am a believer \nin the second amendment. Nothing that I have talked about today \ndeprives anyone of their second amendment rights.\n\n  In this Congress, I hope we can work in a bipartisan fashion to solve \nsome of these problems that everyone recognizes: Campaign finance \nreform, health care, problems with guns in our society, and other \nthings on which we need to work together to come up with bipartisan \nsolutions to the problems that face this country.\n  One of the things we worked very hard on last year as a minority--we \nhope the majority will join with us this year--was to do something \nabout raising the minimum wage. Why is it important that we raise the \nminimum wage? That is all the money some people get to support their \nfamily. In fact, 60 percent of the people who draw minimum wage are \nwomen, and for 40 percent of those women who draw minimum wage, that is \nthe only money they get for themselves and their families. It is \nimportant that we increase the minimum wage. The minimum wage is \nsomething more than a bunch of kids at McDonald's flipping hamburgers; \nit is for people who need to support their families.\n  Speaking for the minority, we reach out our hands to the majority. We \nwant to work with the majority to pass meaningful legislation. But I \nalso say we want to approach legislation in the way it has been \ntraditionally handled in this body: For example, the bankruptcy bill, \nwhich at 2 o'clock this afternoon will be brought up and we will move \nforward. We have worked very hard in spite of the fact that there are \nin the minority some people who support the underlying legislation and \nsome who don't support the legislation. But we have worked to move this \nlegislation forward to have the battles here on the Senate floor. That \nis why we were disappointed at the end of the last session when the \nmajority leader filed cloture on this legislation when there were only \na few amendments left that would take up any time at all. As a result \nof that, some of us joined together during the break and said: We are \nnot going to let this legislation move forward, we are going to have 45 \nDemocrats voting against cloture, until we have the opportunity to \ndebate these measures which we believe are important.\n  What were the two things holding it up? One was legislation that said \ndo not do violence to a clinic that gives advice on birth control \nmeasures and gives counsel to people as to whether or not they should \nterminate a pregnancy. This is something that is enforced by the laws \nin this country. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that these kinds of \nclinics are legal. Whether or not you agree or disagree with abortion \nis not the issue. A person has no right to throw acid in these \nfacilities and do everything they can to stop the business from going \nforward. There have been lawsuits filed against people who do this. \nThis amendment says if you do that, you can't discharge that debt in \nbankruptcy. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  We are going to have an opportunity to vote on this in the next few \ndays. That is the way it should be.\n  The other amendment that was holding things up and caused cloture to \nbe filed was an amendment by the Senator from Michigan that says if you \nmanufacture guns and there is a lawsuit filed against you because of \nsomething you did which was wrong, you can't discharge that debt in \nbankruptcy. I am paraphrasing the amendment. Senator Levin will explain \nit in more detail.\n  But we have said, no matter how you feel on the gun issue and \nabortion, these are issues that have nothing to do directly with these \nissues; this issue deals with bankruptcy. As a result of that, the \nminority held firm.\n  I applaud the majority leader. He withdrew the motion for cloture. We \nare going to debate this and complete this legislation in the next \ncouple of days. We are willing to work with the majority if we go \nthrough the normal legislative process allowing us to bring up our \namendment. We worked hard to try to reduce the number of amendments. \nSome amendments are difficult. Some amendments we don't want to vote \non, but that is what we are elected to do--vote on tough issues. We \ncan't avoid those tough votes by filing cloture and knocking all of \nthese amendments out.\n  Again, on behalf of the minority, we look forward to a productive \nsession\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\nand we will do everything we can to make sure we not only keep the \neconomy moving but also handle some of the more difficult issues that \nface us in this society.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S124-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S124-S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR SENIOR CITIZENS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I intend to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to talk about the prescription drug issue for senior \ncitizens. As many of our colleagues know, I have made it clear that I \nam going to come to the floor repeatedly between now and the end of the \nsession in the hope we will get a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthrough this body that will meet the needs of so many vulnerable older \npeople.\n  In the past, I have come to the floor and have read two or three of \nthe cases I have been getting from seniors across the country. A lot of \nthese older people, when they are finished paying their prescription \ndrug bills, have only a few hundred dollars a month on which to live. \nPicture that: After you have paid your prescription drug bill, you pay \nfor your food, your rent and utilities, and you have virtually nothing \nleft over.\n  I think it is extremely important this Congress pass legislation to \nmeet those needs. I have teamed up for more than a year with Senator \nOlympia Snowe from Maine. We have a bill that is market oriented. It \nwould avoid some of the cost-shifting problems that we might see with \nother approaches. We want to make sure that as we help senior citizens, \nwe do not have to cost shift it over to somebody who is, say, 27 or 28 \nand just getting started with a family and having trouble with their \nown medical bills. The Snowe-Wyden legislation avoids that kind of \napproach.\n  The reason I am taking a moment to speak this afternoon is because \nthe comments made by the President last week at the State of the Union \nAddress opened up a very wide berth for the Congress to address this \nissue in a bipartisan way. Prior to the President's comments, I know \nthere was widespread concern by a variety of groups as to what he would \nsay about the issue and how he would say it.\n  What the President of the United States said in the State of the \nUnion Address on this issue of prescription drugs seems to me to \ncapture our challenge.\n  First and foremost, the President made it very clear he is aware that \nin every nook and cranny of this country there are scores of senior \ncitizens who cannot afford their medicine. They simply cannot afford \nit. His remarks spoke to the millions of older people in this country \nwho walk on an economic tightrope; every month they balance their food \nbill against their fuel bill and their fuel bill against their medical \ncosts.\n  After the President described this great need, he did not get into \nany of the particulars of writing a bill. He made it clear he wanted to \nwork with the Congress to get a bipartisan piece of legislation that \nwill meet the needs of older people.\n  Yes, he has his approach. His approach--and I am not going to get \ninto all of the fairly complicated details--involves a role for what \nare called pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation that has been proposed takes a slightly \ndifferent approach. We use private entities which, in effect, will have \nto compete for the senior citizens' business.\n  We think that makes sense as a way to hold down the costs of medicine \nfor older people because it has worked for Members of Congress. The \nSnowe-Wyden legislation is modeled after the health care system to \nwhich Members of Congress belong.\n  I have been asked again and again whether you could reconcile the \nPresident's approach, in terms of using pharmacy benefit managers, and \nthe kind of approach that is taken in the Snowe-Wyden legislation, with \nthese private entities that would have to compete for senior citizens' \nbusinesses. I think it is possible to reconcile these two approaches. I \nthink we are making a lot of headway now in terms of addressing this \nissue, in terms of the parties saying the need is urgent.\n  We have to come together, in a bipartisan way, to do it. The \nPresident opened up a real opportunity for the Congress to come \ntogether on this matter.\n  The reason it is so important, of course, is that we cannot afford, \nas a nation, not to cover prescription medicine. I repeat that. People \nask if we can afford to cover prescription drugs for older people. The \nreality is, our country cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs.\n  A lot of these drugs today are preventive in nature. They reduce \nproblems related to blood pressure and cholesterol. I have talked a \nnumber of times on the floor about the anticoagulant drugs which \nprevent strokes. Perhaps it would cost $1,000 a year to meet the needs \nof an older person's prescriptions for these anticoagulant drugs. Sure, \n$1,000 or $1,500 is a lot of money, but if you have a legislative \nopportunity to help an older person in that way, and you save $100,000, \nwhich you can do because those drugs help to prevent strokes--and \nstrokes can be very expensive, even upwards of $100,000--that is \nsomething our country should not pass up.\n  The elderly in this country get hit with a double whammy when it \ncomes to pharmaceuticals.\n  First, Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. It has been that \nway since the program began in 1965. I do not know a soul who studied \nthe Medicare program, who, if they were designing it today, would not \ncover prescription drugs simply for the reasons I have given, that they \nare preventive in nature.\n  The other part of the double whammy for older people is that the big \nbuyers--the health maintenance organizations, the health plans, a \nvariety of these big organizations--are able to get discounts; and then \nwhen an old person, a low-income older person, walks into a pharmacy, \nin effect, they have to pay a premium because the big buyers get the \ndiscounts.\n  So this is an important issue for the Congress to address.\n  As I have done in the past, I want to put into perspective exactly \nwhat so many of these vulnerable people are facing in our country.\n  I see our friend from Michigan. I want to make sure he has time as \nwell. Democrats have a few more minutes. I want to make sure my \ncolleague can be heard, as well.\n  But one of the cases I want to touch on this afternoon follows a 65-\nyear-old senior from West Linn, OR. He wrote me recently as part of the \ncampaign I have organized to have older people send in their bills. He \nwrote me that he used to have prescription drug coverage when he was \nworking. Now he has no coverage at all. He is taking medication for \nhigh blood pressure, for high cholesterol, for heart-related problems. \nHe had triple bypass surgery in 1991 and anticipates he is going to be \ntaking medications for the rest of his life.\n\n  He found that, as he tried to shop for medicines, the cost was 18 \npercent higher than when he had insurance coverage, which illustrates \nthe double whammy that I described.\n  When he was in the workforce--and the Senator from Michigan knows a \nlot about this as a result of the company-retiree packages that \nautoworkers and others have--the workers were in a position to get a \nbargain. But then that senior retired and lost the opportunity to have \nsome leverage in the marketplace. That senior in West Linn found that \nhis prescription prices were 18 percent higher.\n  This person from West Linn has written, saying he hopes the \nbipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation is successful.\n  We have received scores and scores of other letters. Because my \nfriend from Michigan is here, and I want to allow him time to talk, I \nam going to wrap up only by way of saying that the last case I was \ngoing to go into in more detail is an older woman in eastern Oregon, \njust outside Pendleton, OR, who told me during the last recess that \nwhen she is done paying her prescription drug bill, she has only $200 a \nmonth on which to live for the rest of the month.\n  Perhaps other people can figure out some sort of financial sleight of \nhand\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\nso they can get by on a couple hundred dollars a month for their food \nand utilities and housing, and the like, but that is not math that I \nthink adds up.\n  We need to address this issue in a bipartisan way. The Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation does that. I was particularly encouraged by the President's \nremarks last week on prescription drugs because I think, through the \nconciliatory approach that he took, making it clear that he wants to \nwork with all parties to get this addressed, we now have a window to \nclimb through to get the job done and provide a real lifeline to \nmillions of older people. That is some good news for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, I congratulate, again, the good Senator from Oregon \nfor his leadership in the area of prescription drugs. His effort to \nachieve a bipartisan move in this direction is very critical to the \nNation. I commend him for it.\n  I thank him for truncating his remarks a few minutes so I might have \na few minutes. I hope I can complete this in 2 or 3 minutes. But if I \ndo not, perhaps I could ask my good friend on the other side of the \naisle to be able to extend it a minute or two beyond the appointed hour \nof 1 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S125-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SECRET EVIDENCE SUSPENSION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation's commitment to due process has \nbeen placed in doubt by the use of secret evidence in immigration \nproceedings.\n  Until recently, the Department of Justice's use of secret evidence \nwas not well known to the general public. Secret evidence was known \nonly to some immigrants who have been held for months, sometimes years, \nwithout any opportunity to confront their accusers or examine the \nevidence against them.\n  As the Washington Post of October 19, 1997, put it, the process is \nauthorized by:\n\n       [A] little-known provision of immigration law in effect \n     since the 1950s allows secret evidence to be introduced in \n     certain immigration proceedings. The classified information, \n     usually from the FBI, is shared with judges, but withheld \n     from the accused and their lawyers.\n\n  The use of secret evidence in immigration proceedings threatens to \nviolate basic principles of fundamental fairness. The only three \nFederal courts to review its use in the last decade have all found it \nunconstitutional. Yet the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nINS, continues to use it and to do so virtually without any limiting \nregulations. Under current law, the INS takes the position that it can \npresent evidence in camera and ex parte whenever it is classified \nevidence relevant to an immigrant's application for admission, an \napplication for an immigration benefit, a custody determination, or a \nremoval proceeding.\n  The Attorney General herself has expressed concern over the use of \nsecret evidence--and for good reason.\n  In October 1999, a district court declared the INS' use of secret \nevidence to detain aliens unconstitutional. Five days later, the INS \ndropped its efforts to deport a man it had held for over a year and a \nhalf on the basis of secret evidence.\n  In November 1999, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that an \nEgyptian man detained on secret evidence for 3 and-a-half years should \nbe released, and the Attorney General declined to intervene to continue \nhis detention.\n  Earlier in 1999, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the BIA, granted \npermanent resident status to a Palestinian against whom the INS had \nused secret evidence and alleged national security concerns. In all of \nthese cases the government claimed that national security was at risk, \nyet in none of them were the individuals even charged with committing \nany criminal acts.\n\n  The Attorney General has promised to promulgate regulations to govern \nthe INS's use of secret evidence, but has not yet done so. In May of \n1999, the Attorney General came to my state of Michigan to meet with \nArab-American leaders and members of the Michigan Congressional \ndelegation to discuss concerns about the use of secret evidence. At \nthat meeting, she said she would implement a new policy, one in which \nthe Department would implement a higher level of review, and take extra \nprecautions before using secret evidence. She said she would have those \nregulations relative to the use of secret evidence within a reasonable \ntime.\n  In December, the Attorney General visited Michigan again. She had \nstill not promulgated the promised regulations. She told us that she \nwas dedicated to resolving this issue, and she was actively reviewing \ndraft regulations, but that she was uncomfortable issuing those \nregulations in the form they had been presented to her by her staff.\n  Mr. President, the Attorney General may eventually offer the promised \nregulations. But at the current time, she is not capable of putting a \nprocess in writing that is satisfactory even to her. It has been almost \nnine months now since the Attorney General agreed to look in to this \nmatter, and promulgate regulations that will govern the use of this \nprocess. Under these circumstances, when the Attorney General cannot \neven satisfy herself that a fair process is in place, the use of this \nsecret process should be suspended until she can, and I urge the \nAttorney General to do exactly that: suspend the use of secret evidence \nin immigration proceedings immediately until she can promulgate \nregulations relative to its use.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. What section are we in now, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take a little time to talk a bit \nabout our agenda and the things I think most of us hope we will \naccomplish during this coming legislature.\n  There are some who believe we won't accomplish much. It seems to me \nthat is not a good prognosis. The fact is, we should put some \npriorities on the many issues that are there and, indeed, make a \nspecial effort to accomplish a good deal. I think we can. Many of the \nissues have been talked about a great deal already. We know what the \nbackgrounds are.\n  I think now our commitment is to decide what the priorities are for \nthis country, what the priorities are for this Congress, and to set out \nto accomplish them.\n  We heard the President last Thursday make a very long speech, \nincluding a very long list of ideas and things he is suggesting we \nconsider. I don't believe he is suggesting certainly that they all be \ndone. He knows very well that will not be the case. I think it is up to \nus, particularly the majority party, to establish an agenda of those \nthings we believe are most important.\n  I read in the paper that some Democrats in the House are saying we \naren't going to accomplish anything unless we set the agenda, and we \nwill talk our way through that. I am very disappointed in that kind of \nan idea. Of course, it is possible to continue to raise all these \nissues that one knows are not going anywhere. I suspect that is not a \nnew idea even in this body. But we need to have a set of priorities.\n  The President had 100-plus ideas that, I suppose, were set forth to \nlay out a political agenda, maybe largely for this election. That is \nfine. It is not a brand new idea. I am surprised the agenda pointed in \na different direction than that with which the President has sought to \ncharacterize himself over the last several years. He talked about the \nleadership council and starting towards the center, saying, I think \nsome time ago, that the era of big government is over. One would not \nhave suspected that, as they listened last Thursday night to his view, \nthat the era of big government is over.\n  It was a very liberal agenda laid out, I am sure, for conduct of this \nsession of Congress. I suggest that is not the direction we ought to \ntake. Expenditures of some $400 billion in additional programs, $400 \nbillion in spending, some $4 billion a minute during that process, with \nvery little detail, of course, as to how it is done but, rather, here \nare the things we ought to do, sort of in a broad sense.\n  We need to ensure that the description of what we are going to do \ndoes not interfere with us doing something. We have an agenda. Much of \nit I am\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\nhopeful the President will agree with and the Members on the other side \nof the aisle will agree with. Certainly I am not excited about the idea \nthe minority party will set the agenda, just simply by the discussions \nthat go on endlessly. When it comes to spending, of course, there are \nmany of us in this body who were sent here by our constituents to see \nif we can't limit the growth of Government, and we have succeeded some \nin the last couple years. Even though it was a large one, the growth in \nlast year's budget was something around 3 percent, which was about the \ninflation rate, which is considerably less than it has been over the \nlast 10 years, where the rate has gone up much higher than that.\n  Did we hold down spending enough? No, I don't believe so. To do that, \nwe have to have a little different system this year. Hopefully, we will \ndo that. I think we are already beginning to deal with the budget, with \nthe appropriations, so that we don't end up at the end of the session \nwith a huge bill that many people are not even familiar with all the \ncontent. So we need to do that.\n\n  I am one who believes we ought to be setting about to hold down the \nsize of the Federal Government rather than to expand it. I am one who \nbelieves there is a limit to the kinds of things the Federal Government \nis designed to do. I think that is very clear in the Constitution. We \nhave exceeded that in many ways, but it is not too late to take a look \nat what we are doing and say, is that the appropriate thing for the \nFederal Government to do? Are these the things the Federal Government \ncan do better than any other government? I don't think so. When we talk \nabout States and the differences we have among States, certainly, I \ncome from a State that is the eighth largest State in the Union, one of \nthe smallest in population. Our needs and methods of delivery of health \ncare, the management of public lands, all those things are quite \ndifferent in Wyoming than they are in Rhode Island or Pennsylvania, and \nproperly so, which seems to me to be a good indication that we should \nnot be continuing to have the one-size-fits-all kind of Federal \npronouncements from the Congress and from the bureaucracy in \nWashington.\n  One of the things I hope we do over time is change our system to \nbiennial budgeting, where we have a budget that lasts for 2 years. It \nseems to me it is very appropriate to do that. Most States do it that \nway. For one thing, the agencies then have a longer time to know what \ntheir spending restrictions are for a period of 2 years. Maybe more \nimportantly, however, we have an opportunity to exercise the oversight \nwhich is the responsibility of Congress, which we don't do very well. \nUnfortunately, we spend so much of our time on appropriations and other \nthings that the idea of ensuring that the laws which are passed are \ncarried out consistent with the intent of the law is something we don't \nspend enough time doing.\n  I want to come back to the floor next week and talk a little bit \nabout that provision in, I think, a 1996 law which provides that \nregulations that are put together by the bureaucracies must come to the \nHouse and the Senate to be reviewed. Seldom does that ever happen. I \nthink only one or two times has there been some kind of a motion to \nchange those, and none have succeeded because the system is not \nworkable. A great idea, and we have that in most legislatures where \nthere is oversight of the legislature by the regulations that come out \nto augment the laws that have been passed. We don't do that here. So we \nought to hold down spending. We ought to have smaller Government. We \nought to seek to review the kinds of things the Federal Government has \ninvolved itself in and ensure that there are reasonable things that are \nbest done here. That doesn't mean there isn't a role for government. Of \ncourse there is. But often that role can be best implemented at the \nState and local level.\n\n  We need to talk about reducing the Federal debt in a real way. We \nhave been doing some work on that for the first time in 40 years, I \nthink. We have not spent Social Security. We balanced the budget for \nthe first time in 25 years. We are using Social Security money to pay \ndown the publicly held debt, which is a good idea. It reduces the cost \nof that debt. It takes the Social Security money out of the opportunity \nto be spent. That is good. Nevertheless, the key there is that it is \nreducing publicly held debt. We are replacing one debt with another \nkind of debt. When these young people are eligible for benefits from \nSocial Security, those dollars that have been put into a trust fund to \nreplace debt will have to be recovered from the taxpayers at that time. \nSo we need to do something more than that.\n  In my opinion, we ought to set about to figure out some kind of a \nprocess over a period of time that we commit ourselves to a payment \neach year to pay off the debt out of operating funds, that we do it \nmuch like a mortgage on your home. We can decide that we will pay off \n$15 billion, or whatever it is, each year, and do that over a period of \ntime. That would be real debt reduction. That would be reduction that \nwould help to keep the so-called surplus from being spent to increase \nthe size of Government. So we can do that and reduce our debt in a real \nway.\n  We also, hopefully, will pursue--when we have a surplus--what are \nconsidered to be the real needs of the Federal Government, and after we \nsecure Social Security and pay down some of the debt, that money will \nthen be returned to the taxpayers so it can be used to buoy the \neconomy. Otherwise, frankly, the money left floating around is going to \nbe spent. If you don't like the concept of increasingly large \nGovernment, when there is money beyond what there is a target for, then \nit ought to be sent back to the people who paid it in in the beginning.\n  What are the priorities? They are pretty clear. They have been the \nsame for several years and will continue to be. I think that is where \nwe ought to focus. Certainly, most people would consider education to \nbe the issue we are most concerned with--having an opportunity for all \nyoung people to have an education. Obviously, money is not the total \nanswer. There has to be accountability, training, and there have to be \nthings that happen within the school system in addition to money. You \ncan't do it without money, however; it is essential.\n  Health care is one issue, obviously, about which everybody is \nconcerned. We are trying to do some things about that. We need to \ncontinue to do that. I am proud of the health care system we have in \nthis country, certainly in terms of quality. On the other hand, we have \nto start to be a little careful about what that quality costs--\naffordability. But we can do some things about the health care.\n  Social Security. There is no question but that we have to change \nSocial Security if we are to have it for these young people who start \nto pay in the very moment they get a job, and most of whom now don't \nexpect to have benefits in 30, 40, 50 years. We need to change it so \nthat the benefits will be there. There are several alternatives that \ncan be used to change that. Certainly there needs to be a continued \nreduction in taxes.\n\n  In education, I am proud of what we have done so far. This GOP \nCongress provided more funding in the last year than the President \nrequested. We did get into a hassle, of course, about how the money is \nspent. You may recall the President insisted it be spent on 100,000 \nteachers. I can tell you, there are schools where I live where \nadditional teachers are not the issue; there are other things that need \nto be done. So we need to give the flexibility to the State and local \nschool boards as to how they spend the money to strengthen education. \nWe will insist on that being part of the system we produce this year. \nThe elementary and secondary education bill this year, I hope, will be \npassed for safe schools and keeping the parents involved, and \nparticularly making sure that all children have a chance for quality \neducation.\n  I am interested, of course, in access to education in rural \ncommunities. I am also particularly, for a number of reasons, and \npersonally interested in special education for special kids. My wife \nhas been a special education teacher for 25 years, and I am very proud \nof that. Education will be one issue we will continue to press on.\n  Health care, of course, we will continue to have on our agenda, and \nit will be one of the most important things we pass. We passed a number \nof things last year. In my State, for example, in small towns, we have \nhospitals that won't be able to have a full series of services and up \nuntil now could not be certified and did not receive dollars\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\nfrom HCFA. We changed that so they can be something much like a clinic \nand have emergency care, so patients can be transferred on--sort of a \nwheel-and-hub concept. We did that last year.\n  Certainly, we need to increase the funding for Medicare and hospitals \nand all kinds of service providers.\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights, we will be working to try to do something \non that. The controversy basically is how you have appeals. There have \nbeen changes, apparently, on the part of the health care providers, \nmanaged care providers, to provide more medical decisionmaking in the \nprocess, which is exactly what we need, rather than legal or nonmedical \naccounting kinds of decisions. So we need to pass that this year. I \nfeel confident we will. It will be a priority.\n  I also believe we will make some real progress--and it is time to \nmake progress--with regard to pharmaceuticals. We can do that. \nActually, health care is something of which we should be quite proud. \nWe have the greatest health care in the world. We also have great \nproblems with the rising costs of health care. There are problems with \nHMOs and access to some breakthrough drugs. We have too many uninsured. \nDespite that, we have great health care, and I think it is largely \nbecause we continue to keep it in the private sector.\n  We need to ensure that our seniors can continue to have Medicare and \nthat it covers their needs. We probably need to look at another change, \nsome structural changes, so that there are choices there, where a \nMedicare recipient can stay where they are if they like or, indeed, set \nup a little like the Federal health program, where you have some \nchoices. If you would like to add dollars to it, you can go to a \ndifferent coverage than the basic one you had. I think we can do that.\n  I mentioned the bill of rights. It looks as if we will be able to \nresolve that this time, the emphasis being on decisions being made by \nmedical providers as opposed to the economic people in the managed care \nsystem. We will be doing more research, of course, on insured, which \ncontinues to be a problem we will be able to persist with, I believe; \nand I don't think we will solve that by just putting a ton of money out \nthere without making some changes.\n  I mentioned education, of course, and we will continue to work at \nthat. I think our focus will continue to be funding with local \ndecisions being made.\n  Social Security. I think there are resolutions on Social Security. \nWhether we will get to it this year, I don't know. I hope so. I think \nwe should. Almost everyone agrees that if we continue to do what we \nhave been doing, we won't be able to pay the benefits at the end of \nthis period. Much of it is simply the change in the structure of our \nsociety. I think when we started Social Security back in the thirties, \nthere were 25 or 30 people working for every beneficiary. Now there are \nthree. We are readily on the way to having two.\n  So a change would be substantially in the nature of how we pay for \nSocial Security.\n  One of the opportunities of change, of course, would be to decrease \nbenefits. Not many people are for that. Some would say we could \nincrease taxes. The Social Security tax is the largest tax that most \npeople pay these days.\n  The third one is to increase the return we have on the money in the \ntrust fund. It seems to me to be a very logical opportunity for us to \ntake a portion of the money people pay in--I think the caveat is that \nprobably for most people over 50 or 55 it would not change; they would \ncontinue to go on as they are, but for younger people who are starting \nto pay in, part of their Social Security payment would be put into an \nindividual account that is owned by that person. It would be invested \nin their behalf by contractors and it would be invested in equities. It \ncould be in equities. It could be in bonds. It could be a combination \nof that, such as the plan for Federal employees. You could raise \nsubstantially the return on that money. Over a period of a person's \nlifetime of paying in, it would make a great deal of difference and \nprobably ensure that those benefits would be there at the end of a \nperiod of time.\n  Significant change? Sure. Difficult to make? Of course. But it can be \nmade. When you get to the options, then at least in my judgment that \ncould become the option.\n  Those are some of the things I think are most important to us. We \nfind ourselves now faced with a great opportunity to put together a \npriority agenda for this year. The majority party will be doing that \nand has done that. It will include education. It will include health \ncare. It will include Social Security. It will include paying down the \ndebt. It will include some kind of tax relief on an equitable basis.\n  It seems to me that those are the things we ought to put in as \npriorities. It is great to list the whole thing. It is great to go into \ngreat debates and filibusters almost by offering everything on the \nfloor that you know is not going to happen, but I am hopeful we do not \nfind ourselves in the position of raising issues more for the political \nbenefit they might have in the election year as opposed to finding \nresolutions to those issues. It seems to me that is the challenge that \nlies before us.\n  I am very pleased to be joined during this hour by one of the leaders \nof our party, the chairman of our Policy Committee, the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding.\n  Let me also join him in his analysis, and certainly the hope that he \nspeaks to as it relates to an agenda that the Congress might direct \nitself toward this year, away from, of course, the pitfalls of the kind \nof political rhetoric that I think we oftentimes find ourselves in \nespecially in Presidential election years.

Mr. President, I come to the floor as one who spent over \n90 minutes on the floor of the House last week listening to the \nPresident's State of the Union Message.\n  For a few moments, I would like to kind of analyze that State of the \nUnion Address as seen through the eyes of this Senator reflective of \nwhat I believe to be, shall I say, self-evident truth.\n  There is no question that our President is a gifted speaker. He waxed \neloquently while spending our children's heritage and vastly increasing \nthe size and the parental meddling of our Government by all of the new \nprograms that he has proposed to create while claiming credit for \nvirtually every good thing that has happened in the last century, \nincluding those things which were accomplished despite his opposition \nand his veto.\n  I say: Lyndon Johnson, move over; you heard a speech the other night \nthat would cause your ghost to shudder. You had the record as being the \nbiggest spending Government creator since FDR. Let me propose that this \nPresident is now vying for first place.\n  Let me start by analyzing his spending spree.\n  In his speech, President Clinton called for continued fiscal \ndiscipline while at the same time suggesting that we do a lot of other \nthings and buying down the Federal debt.\n  I say, Mr. President, what hypocrisy. Until the Republican Congress \nimposed fiscal discipline, until the American people demanded fiscal \ndiscipline, the President consistently proposed budgets with spending \nand debt and deficits as far as the average person's eye could see and \nthe greatest prognosticator of the Office of Management and Budget \ncould look in his crystal ball and predict. He didn't refuse to stray \nfrom the path of fiscal discipline. He simply did it. We forced him to \nget to that path. That election occurred in 1994. We know the rest of \nthat story. Yet what has he proposed in his last State of the Union \nMessage?\n\n  The Senate Budget Committee made a preliminary estimate of the new \nspending proposed by the President at about $343 billion. That is about \n$3.8 billion a minute for his 89-minute speech. Not bad spending, Mr. \nPresident--the most expensive speech given in the history of this \ncountry, I suggest. If the Treasury can only print about $262 billion a \nyear with the presses running nearly 24 hours a day, you even outspent, \nMr. President, the ability of the U.S. Treasury to print it.\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\n  What about the taxpayers whose earnings the President would spend so \nfreely?\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office, using its most \npessimistic estimate, announced that there would be an $838 billion \nnon-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years. That is phenomenal. \nThat is wonderful for this country. Yet the Clinton speech mentioned he \nwould give back only about $250 billion of it. That is less than 30 \npercent of the excessive income tax paid by the American people who \nthat $838 billion represents. However, even this paltry $250 billion \ntax cut wasn't real. Much of it is disguised in new spending. Even the \nWashington Post, sometimes as difficult as it finds criticizing the \nPresident, said that he has artfully couched many of these new tax cuts \nin new spending programs. Thank you, Washington Post, for pointing that \nout.\n  What is worse? This $343 billion in spending is just the tip of the \niceberg, and the American taxpayers are riding on a potential Titanic.\n  The Clinton version of government is not the end of big government as \nwe know it. That is what he said a few years ago. But then again let's \nremember the source. It is Bill Clinton.\n  More intrusive government? How about that.\n  Less personal responsibility? I think that was the message our \nPresident spoke to so clearly last week.\n  So let's talk about where he is, where I believe a Republican \nCongress is, and what I hope in the end we are able to do about it.\n  The President says he wants to make schools accountable--but to the \nFederal Government. The Republicans want to make schools accountable--\nbut to the parents and to the young people who will be educated there. \nIt takes Washington too long to realize the problems. Parents who deal \nwith their children on a day-to-day basis know what the problem is very \nquickly.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, one-third of college freshmen \ntake remedial classes because our elementary and secondary schools are \nfailing to teach them some of the basics. Those are the students lucky \nenough to go on to college. These kids don't need the Princeton Review, \nas the President suggests. They need quality teachers who are \naccountable to parents and the local school board.\n  What about health care?\n  In 1994, President Clinton tried to remake a national health care \nsystem in this country in the image of the U.S. Post Office. Thanks to \nbipartisan opposition he failed. The world recognized it, and our \npublic cheered.\n\n  In 1996, he vowed to push for Government-run health care ``a step at \na time until eventually we finish this.'' Those are his words. He would \ngo after health care ``a step at a time''--that is Government-run \nhealth care--until ``eventually we finish this.'' ``This'' meaning, of \ncourse, his U.S. Post Office-style health care system. Now the \nPresident has renewed his commitment to Government-run health care with \nlegislation that would cancel the private coverage of over 2 million \nAmericans so he can push them a step at a time into an expensive \nGovernment-run program.\n  Then there was that great but very soft and smooth Federal land grab \nstatement he made the other evening. The President said:\n\n       Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, \n     to restore wildlife, protect our coastlines, save our \n     national treasures. . . .\n\n  What he wants to do is annually take several billion dollars of oil \nand gas royalties paid to the Federal Government and buy more land and \nmake it Federal Government land. If he is successful, it means Congress \nwill have to find $2 billion elsewhere to fund programs. But more \nimportantly, the ratios of private versus public ownership would \nchange. The Government already owns 1 out of every 4 acres of the \nlandmass of this country, primarily in Western States; 63 percent of my \nState is owned by the Federal Government. Idahoans do not want Bill \nClinton buying one more acre of Idaho. Why? That is the tax base that \nfunds our local governments and funds our schools. So, Mr. President, \nwe won't give you that money. We should not give you that money. If the \nenvironment needs protection, we can find the necessary resources \nwithout giving you a blank check to buy more Federal land.\n  Mr. President, the very infrastructure of our National Park System is \nfalling apart. How about putting some money there? That is where the \nAmerican public wants to go recreate. Give our parks a chance to catch \nup with the traffic instead of shutting them down or closing people out \nof them. Let's let people into our parks. Let's invest in them. We \ndon't need to buy more property; we need to take care of that which we \nhave.\n  The President said:\n\n       The major security threat this country will face will come \n     from enemies of the nation state: the narcotraffickers and \n     the terrorists and the organized criminals.\n\n  He boasts about ``agreements to restrain nuclear programs in North \nKorea''--a program for direct U.S. subsidies for one of the most \nvicious, anti-American, terrorist-supporting, drug-trafficking regimes \nin the world, responsible for deaths of millions of its own people? Mr. \nPresident, I don't quite understand your priorities.\n  He is patting himself on the back for victory in Kosovo, a victory \nthat means planting American troops in an alliance with what is known \nto be an organization of narcotrafficking terrorists and organized \ncriminal cartels.\n  Mr. President, I am not quite sure you have made yourself quite clear \nto the American people. I think you are saying one thing when your \nactions clearly demonstrate you are doing something else.\n  The President highlights the needs for ``curbing the flow of lethal \ntechnology to Iran.'' The Republican Congress passed a bill that would \nhave done just that, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of \n1997, that is H.R. 2709. And what happened on June 23 of 1998? The \nPresident vetoed it. Remarkably, President Clinton continues to support \npaper agreements rather than U.S. actions to keep Americans secure. \nAlthough he outlined real threats from ballistic missile proliferation \nin his speech, President Clinton refuses to deploy a national ballistic \nmissile defense system to protect Americans from ballistic missile \nattacks. He even signed legislation calling for the deployment of such \na system, although, in typical Clinton fashion, he has found many \nexcuses to reinterpret the straightforward language of that \nlegislation. Instead of defending America against a clear and present \ndanger, the President hides behind outdated, ineffective, and obsolete \narms control treaties.\n\n  Because of President Clinton, Americans remain defenseless against \nballistic missile attack. It is interesting; the President is now \ncalling for ``constructive bipartisan dialog'' on a Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty when the administration turned a deaf ear to the critical \nnational security concerns being voiced by Republicans for the last \ngood many months.\n  Despite President Clinton's best efforts to underfund and overextend \nU.S. military forces, it has been a Republican Congress that has \nconsistently sent the President bills to keep our forces well trained \nand well equipped and properly paid. It was a Republican Congress that \ninitiated the bill to improve the quality of life of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and Marines, and helped retain those who were leaving \nwho had already gained the kind of special skills that are so necessary \nin our military.\n  Hyperbole? Hypocrisy? Exaggeration? Shame on me for even suggesting \nthat.\n  The President claimed credit in his speech for most of the good news \nin America for the past several decades--the healthy economy, welfare \nreform, falling crime rates, balanced budgets, a cleaner environment, \nsmaller Federal workforces, and social progress. Anybody who sits in \nthe Presidency and possesses the bully pulpit when times are good can \nmake claim and take credit, but just for a few moments let me talk \nabout how it got done.\n  Mr. President, you are entitled to take credit but you can't steal \nRepublican principles, Republican ideas, and the kind of work that went \non in the Congress to make it happen. The President claimed that he \nended welfare as we know it--after he vetoed it twice. Shame on you, \nMr. President. It was a Republican Congress but, more importantly, it \nwas Republican Governors out in the States who reformed welfare. We \ncopied them. We didn't have the genius here. We were stuck in the old \nbureaucracy. We wanted to talk about reform but we took the ideas of\n\n[[Page S129]]\n\nthe States, implemented them into the Federal program, and it worked. \nSo, yes, you can take credit for it but you didn't do it. You vetoed \nthe bills, you kept vetoing the bills, and on the very day that you \nsigned them, you said we will be back to change them because we don't \nlike this.\n  But, of course, it was an election year. You knew you had to sign it, \nand you took credit for it while at the same time you were criticizing \nit. I am sorry, Mr. President; I happen to read history and I happen to \nremember what you said. Shame on me.\n  On the environment, the President said:\n\n       . . . one of the things I am grateful for is the \n     opportunity that the Vice President and I have had to finally \n     put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy \n     and the environment at the same time.\n\n  He said:\n\n       . . . we have rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic \n     waste, ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people. \n     In the past 3 months alone, we have preserved over 40 million \n     roadless acres in the national forests. . . .''\n\n  Mr. President, here is the rest of the truth. Those 500 neighborhoods \nyou claim are a product of the Superfund laws that were passed long \nbefore you got here. Also, you are taking credit for cleaner air and \nwater. Congress passed the Clean Air Act and Congress passed the Clean \nWater Act under Republican direction, and subsequently amendments to \nchange that in a way that would make it more operative--and it has \nworked. But you are the one who ruined regulation, through ozone and \nparticulate matter rules, for example, that have tried to pull it down \nand make it less operative.\n  Mr. President, why don't we both take credit for the environment: \npast Congresses, current Congress, past administrations, current \nadministration. We have worked together and our environment is cleaner, \nand we are proud of that.\n  In 1995, President Clinton said balancing the budget was a bad idea. \nLet me repeat that. In 1995, Mr. President, you said balancing the \nbudget was a bad idea, it was bad for the economy.\n  Going into 1996 and faced with poll data that indicated the American \npeople were demanding a balanced budget, you decided to surrender on \nprinciple and argue about the details later. The size of our economic \nboom today is because Bill Clinton reluctantly went along with the core \nprinciples that swept Republicans into control of the Congress in 1994. \nThat balanced budget did not happen until there was a Republican \nCongress shaping it and, Mr. President, you know it. Social Security \ntaxes today are being locked up and protected to secure Social Security \nand, Mr. President, that was not your idea. In fact, you wanted to \nspend a big chunk of that money last year, and we simply would not let \nyou do it.\n  President Clinton's greatest success story--the continued economic \nboom--is a direct result of the Republican fiscal policies enacted over \nthe consistent objections of the President and his Democratic \ncolleagues in the Congress. No, we will stand toe to toe on that \ndebate. You cannot hide from your rhetoric and your actions of the \npast. Those were your policies before the American people said: We have \ngone too far; let's bring our Government under control.\n  President Clinton is a President who claims he wants to protect \nSocial Security, but in 8 years, he has failed to submit a serious \nSocial Security protection plan. And President Clinton is a President \nwho claims he wants to protect Medicare, and yet, last year--we all \nknow it--he whispered in the ears of those he put on that conference \nand said: Don't vote for it. That was a bipartisan proposal, and that \nis the way reform of Medicare must come.\n  Why didn't he want them to support it and to get it all wrapped up \nand finished in an election year? Because one could go out and point \nfingers and politicize Medicare and prescription drugs. Shame on you, \nMr. President. Come back and work with us on that. Let's reinstitute \nthe bipartisan agreement on which Democrats and Republicans stood. We \nwill vote for it and you ought to sign it, Mr. President. And if you \ndo, that could be your legacy. On that I would give you some credit.\n\n       We have reinvented Government, transforming it into a \n     catalyst for new ideas. . . . With the smallest Federal \n     workforce in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record \n     surpluses. . . .\n\n  I was quoting the President. Our record surpluses have little to do \nwith the size of the Federal workforce. Record surpluses were created \nby hard-working Americans earning money and paying taxes and a highly \nproductive economy. That is what has produced the surpluses, Mr. \nPresident, and it also produced record high taxes.\n  Another area on which I want to comment is foster care. It was \nfascinating to me and frustrating when the President talked about \nfoster care. I know how that happened. I know Republicans and Democrats \nhave their differences. We came together and we worked on it in \nCongress. It was not in the White House nor was it the President's \nidea. But because it was a strong bipartisan effort here, we happened \nto pass it. Democrats and Republicans at the congressional level did \nthat, and the President has ridden on it ever since. Why? Because it \nworked, because children are less in foster care today, and we are \nfinding them permanent, loving homes. No longer is the bureaucracy \nharboring them. Foster care is a good institution, but it is an \ninstitution that was reshaped.\n  Mr. President, because you signed the bill, I am willing to give you \nsome credit for it, but that is all you did and that is all you \ndeserve.\n  Then, of course, there is that issue of guns. Last June, the \nPresident said: I will not send up a licensure bill on guns because the \nCongress won't pass it.\n  Even on less controlling issues, a Democratic vote in the House \nkilled gun control ideas of this administration. So why did the \nPresident do it this time? For Bill and Al; that is Bill Bradley, of \ncourse, and Al Gore. They are out on the stump talking about it. His \nparty failed to make guns a national issue, and the reason they failed \nis because the American people know there are over 40,000 gun control \nlaws on the books today, and the American people have grown wise. If \nyou do not enforce the laws, the criminal element still runs rampant \nand commits crimes with guns.\n  The American people are not asking for more gun control laws. They \nare asking for a Justice Department that will prosecute those who \nviolate the law. Mr. President, that is the message and, of course, \nthat is what we will do as a Congress. We are not going to stack up \nmore gun laws; we are going to cause the Justice Department to enforce \nthem.\n  There are myriad other points of discussion, but I wanted the public \nand the record to show there is a very real difference between what \nthis President said in his State of the Union Address and what actually \nhappened and what is happening because we do not stand with this \nPresident on a variety of his ideas, and Congress and the public have \nlargely rejected them.\n  Republicans will not stand for a Government-run health care system. \nWe will pass a Patients' Bill of Rights this year. We will allow \ncitizens to be in control of their health care and their health care \ndelivery, and we will enhance education this year. We will send it back \nto the States and local communities to control. We will save Social \nSecurity, as the Senator from Wyoming said, and I hope we can deal with \nMedicare.\n\n  Mr. President, what is important is that if you want to work with us \nto resolve these problems in the final hours of your administration, \nthen let us sit down and begin to talk because the hour is late, and I \nbelieve you have already written your legacy. I do not think there are \nenough Federal dollars for you to buy a new one. The American people \nare going to remember Bill Clinton not for his big government ideas and \nhis big spending but for something entirely different.\n  Let us begin our work in this Congress in the last session of the \n106th Congress to balance the budget and to secure Social Security. I \nhope we can deal with a Patients' Bill of Rights. I would like to see \nus deal with pharmaceutical drugs for our elderly. I hope we can also \ndeal with our farm crisis and assure a strong military.\n  I am not going to promise we can do all that Bill wants done and give \ntax cuts and buy down the debt because we cannot do all those things. \nMost important, we should not. I hope we can give\n\n[[Page S130]]\n\na tax cut. We are buying down the debt. Most importantly, I say to the \nAmerican people: We are not going to allow Government to grow in the \nimage of Bill Clinton just for a legacy he would like to establish.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for the liberty he has allowed me \nin the use of time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Idaho. Certainly, \nwe share all those thoughts and ideas. I want to expand in the few \nminutes we have remaining in our allotment of time the public land \nissue the Senator mentioned.\n  Public lands, of course, are very important to those of us in the \nWest. As was pointed out, 1 out of every 4 acres in this country is \nowned by the public. My State of Wyoming is 50-percent owned by the \nFederal Government. Idaho is some 63-percent owned by the Federal \nGovernment. Nevada is 83-percent owned by the Federal Government. The \nmanagement of these lands then, rightfully, is a public issue and one \nwith which all of us need to be concerned.\n  It would not be a surprise to know that some of the issues with \nregard to the management of those lands are seen differently by the \npeople who live there and who have access to the lands as opposed to \nthose who equally own them and live many miles away. The fact is it is \na public issue and it deserves public input.\n  There is a system that has been set up by the Congress and happens to \nbe followed by everyone, except the administration, which allows for \npublic input. It requires that all ideas be set forth so that they can \nbe considered and there can be statements made on all these issues. \nSometimes it takes an excruciatingly long time to do it, but \nnevertheless it is a vital concept.\n  Now, of course, we have a different thing going on in the \nadministration. They call it a land legacy, an effort by the President \nin these remaining months to leave a Teddy Roosevelt land legacy for \nhimself and his administration. In so doing, he has done a number of \nthings quite different from what we have seen done before and, quite \nfrankly, has created a good deal of controversy, particularly in the \nWest.\n\n  There are different kinds of lands, of course, set out for different \npurposes. I happen to be chairman of the Parks Subcommittee, so I am \nvery interested in that. I grew up right outside of Yellowstone \nNational Park. As you know, Wyoming has several famous national parks. \nWe are very proud of them. Those lands were set aside for a particular \npurpose. They were set aside because they were unique and they were \ndifferent. They are used for a limited number of purposes.\n  We have the forest reserve which, by its nature, was set aside, was \nreserved for special uses. Although there are many, part of them are \nwilderness areas set aside by the Congress in specific acts that limit \nthe use, and properly so, in my view.\n  Then there is the Bureau of Land Management, which has a very large \nsection of lands. Those lands, rather than having been set aside for \nsome particular purpose, were generally what was left after the \nHomestead Act was completed. They were sort of residual lands that were \nmanaged, first of all, by a different agency but now by the Bureau of \nLand Management--clearly multiple use lands. They are used for many \nthings.\n  These are the kinds of things we have. We have seen suddenly a rush \nfor doing something in public lands. The system being used now by the \nadministration completely ignores the Congress, which should have a say \nin these kinds of things, and as a matter of fact generally ignores \npeople. One of them is the 40 million acres of roadless areas \nnationwide that were declared by the Forest Service.\n  Frankly, I have no particular quarrel with the idea of taking a look \nat roadless areas in the forests, but each forest has a very extensive, \nvery expensive, very important forest plan, a process that has been \ngone through that requires studies, that requires proposed regulation, \nthat requires statements, that requires hearings. That is where those \nthings ought to be done rather than having one EIS over the whole \nNation, not for the Secretary of Agriculture to just come out and \ndeclare that there are going to be 40 million acres, and not even \nknowing exactly where they are.\n  As a matter of fact, we had a hearing with the Secretary and with the \nChief of the Forest Service in which they could tell us very little \nabout it.\n  Another is the $1 billion from offshore oil royalties that the \nadministration has asked to be given to it to spend, without the \napproval of Congress, to acquire additional lands.\n  As the Senator from Idaho said, in the Western States the acquisition \nof new lands is not the issue. The care of those lands, the investment \nin parks, the investment in forests is where we ought to be, in my \nview.\n  The Antiquities Act, which is a legitimate act, has been on the books \nsince 1905. Teddy Roosevelt put it there. As a matter of fact, Devils \nTower, in my State, was put in by the Antiquities Act and was part of \nTeton National Park. But times have changed, and we understand now the \nPresident is going to have 18 different land areas changed in their \ndesignation without, really, any hearings--we had one last year in Utah \nthat the Governor and the congressional delegation did not even know \nabout until it was done. That is not the way to do these kinds of \nthings.\n\n  They have a proposal to change the way the Land and Water \nConservation Fund is allocated. It was set up by Congress to go half \nand half--State and national. Now the administration wants to spend all \nthat money for land acquisition.\n  BLM now has a nationwide roadless plan in which there is very little, \nif any, input. They have the Clean Water Action Plan, which is \nsomething done by EPA, which has to do with the control of water, which \nis really a way of controlling land.\n  Each of these things probably has some merit, but they ought to be \nexamined. They ought to go through the system. They ought to be talked \nabout. They ought to be agreed to, rather than imposed unilaterally by \nan administration.\n  We can preserve public lands, and, indeed, we should: they are a \nlegacy for us. We can have multiple use on those lands. We need them \nfor the communities. We can have public involvement. That is the way it \nought to be. We can have cooperating agency agreements in which the \nState and the local communities ought to have a real voice in doing \nthis.\n  I hope we do not politicize public lands simply because it is an \nelection year, to the distraction of public use, to the distraction of \nthe economies that surround them. The purpose of public lands is to \npreserve the resources and give a chance for the owners to enjoy it. \nThe owners, of course, are the taxpayers.\n  It is an issue on which I think we will have more and more input \nthroughout the year. I hope we do.\n  Mr. President, our time is nearly expired. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think we are in morning business, right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S130-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S130-S132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE PENTAGON'S ACTING INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment with my \ncolleagues to discuss a recent article that was in the National \nJournal. It was about the Pentagon's Acting Inspector General, Mr. \nDonald Mancuso. The article was written by Mr. George Wilson. Mr. \nWilson was a senior defense reporter at the Washington Post for many \nyears. He left the Washington Post in 1991 to write books. He is now a \ncolumnist with the National Journal.\n  Mr. Wilson is a top-notch reporter. He is respected for being very \nthorough and very fair. But, above all, he is respected for an uncanny \nability to find the nub of a complex issue and expose it to public \nscrutiny in an interesting\n\n[[Page S131]]\n\nand also informative way. He had a recent article in the National \nJournal that is no exception. It has exposed a very raw nerve. The \narticle is entitled: ``Tailhook May Soil Choice for Pentagon's Mr. \nClean.'' It appeared in the January 22, 2000, issue of the National \nJournal on pages 260 and 261.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The article I refer to raises important questions, even \nnew questions, about Mr. Mancuso's integrity and judgment. At some \npoint down the road, this body may be called upon to confirm or not \nconfirm Mr. Mancuso's nomination because it has been suggested that \nPresident Clinton is expected to nominate him to be the next Department \nof Defense Inspector General.\n  If that happens, then each Member of this body would need to weigh \nall the facts bearing on Mr. Mancuso's fitness to serve as the \nPentagon's watchdog, which is also the Pentagon's top cop.\n  In October, my staff on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts issued, for me, a report on the Defense \nCriminal Investigative Service. I am going to refer to that, as it is \nalways referred to, as the DCIS--Defense Criminal Investigative \nService.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to read this report. It substantiated \nallegations of misconduct on the part of senior DCIS management, \nincluding Mr. Mancuso, and at least one of his investigators, Mr. \nMathew Walinsky. Mr. Mancuso at that time was Director of DCIS, and he \nwas so from 1988 until 1997.\n  Since that report was issued in October, my staff has been inundated \nwith new complaints about alleged misconduct by Mr. Mancuso and \nmismanagement at DCIS while Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS. My \nstaff is now in the process of evaluating these allegations to \ndetermine if they have merit. Once that review has been conducted, I \nmay issue a second report.\n  Getting back to Mr. Wilson's article in the National Journal, by \ncomparison, instead of my report opening up a new can of worms, Mr. \nWilson's article has opened an old can of worms--in this case, Navy \nworms. It explores Mr. Mancuso's role in the investigation of \nmisconduct at the infamous Tailhook convention in September 1991. By \nreopening this very unfortunate episode in naval history, Mr. Wilson \nhas shed new light on Mr. Mancuso's fitness to move into the inspector \ngeneral's slot.\n  Mr. Wilson reports that the U.S. Court of Military Appeals condemned \nMr. Mancuso and the DCIS for, in their words, ``heavy-handed \ninvestigative tactics that trampled constitutional rights.'' According \nto Mr. Wilson, Mr. Mancuso's tactics included ``threats, intimidation, \nfalsification of interviews, and overreliance on lie detectors.''\n  In an opinion issued on January 11, 1994, on the Tailhook case, the \nU.S. Court of Military Appeals denounced Mr. Mancuso's tactics. The \ncourt compared the Tailhook case review process, which was set up by \nMr. Mancuso, to sort of an assembly line justice, where investigative \nand judicial functions were merged and blurred. ``Merged'' and \n``blurred'' are words the court used. ``Assembly line'' are words the \ncourt used. The court called Mr. Mancuso's assembly line justice \n``troublesome.''\n  Going on to quote the court:\n\n       At best, it reflects a most curiously careless and \n     amateurish approach to a very high profile case by \n     experienced military lawyers and investigators. At worst, it \n     raises the possibility of a shadiness in respecting the \n     rights of military members caught up in a criminal \n     investigation that cannot be condoned.\n\n  That is what the U.S. Court of Military Appeals had to say. That is \nthe highest military court in our land. It is often called the United \nStates Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces. So this highest court has \ncondemned Mr. Mancuso for ``shadiness.'' The court said his practices \nwere ``careless and amateurish'' and even ``troublesome.'' The court \nsaid he and his investigators failed to respect the constitutional \nrights of members of the armed services.\n  I hope the Chair will agree that these are very serious charges about \na person whom the President may nominate for our confirmation as \ninspector general of the Department of Defense. The court's criticism--\nagain referring to the Court of Military Appeals--may help to explain \nwhy the Tailhook investigation was a total failure. The entire \ninvestigation probably cost the taxpayers close to $10 million and \ninvolved several thousand interviews. Unfortunately, not one single \nnaval aviator who faced an assault charge was ever convicted by a \ncourt-martial.\n  As the Director of DCIS, Mr. Mancuso led the Tailhook investigation. \nHe is accountable for failing to conduct it as a professional. A \nlegitimate question for my colleagues and for the President: Should \nthat same man, a man who used shady investigative tactics, a man who \nfailed to respect naval judicial process in Tailhook, be confirmed as \nthe Pentagon's watchdog? It is legitimate to ask if Mr. Mancuso is the \nbest person to fill that position.\n  I leave those thoughts with my colleagues over the next several weeks \nas this nomination may come up for consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n             [From the National Journal, January 22, 2000]\n\n           Tailhook May Soil Choice for Pentagon's Mr. Clean\n\n                         (By George C. Wilson)\n\n       The man President Clinton is expected to nominate as \n     inspector general of the Defense Department--the Pentagon's \n     top cop--is coming under increased scrutiny in the Senate for \n     questionable official conduct. Questions surround his role in \n     the Tailhook sexual assault investigation of the early 1990s \n     and his handling of his own investigators, one of whom \n     pleaded guilty to stealing a 13-year-old boy's identity to \n     obtain a false passport.\n       Donald Mancuso, the Pentagon's acting inspector general and \n     probable nominee for the permanent job, formerly led the \n     Defense Criminal Investigative Service. DCIS, which conducts \n     most of the fraud and misconduct investigations at the \n     Defense Department, had taken over the Tailhook investigation \n     in 1992 after the Navy was accused of botching it.\n       During the Tailhook investigation, naval aviators accused \n     Mancuso's agents of heavy-handed tactics that trampled their \n     constitutional rights. These tactics, they maintained, \n     included threats, intimidation, falsification of interviews, \n     and overreliance on lie detectors. In the end, no aviator was \n     convicted at court-martial for misconduct at the Tailhook \n     convention, which was held in September 1991 at the Las Vegas \n     Hilton.\n       The U.S. Court of Military Appeals, in its review of the \n     Tailhook cases, criticized military lawyers and the IG's \n     investigators--who were supervised by Mancuso--for procedures \n     that were ``troublesome.'' The court faulted investigators \n     for an approach that was ``curiously careless and \n     amateurish,'' and that didn't sufficiently respect the rights \n     of suspects.\n       Several lawyers who defended Tailhook aviators told \n     National Journal that they stand ready to cite examples of \n     misconduct by DCIS agents if the Mancuso nomination moves \n     forward. Their testimony could widen and escalate a battle \n     over Mancuso that Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, began at the \n     end of the past congressional session. White House attorneys \n     had focused on Grassley's earlier objections, but they \n     apparently had not looked into Mancuso's Tailhook role when \n     they told National Journal recently that they saw no reason \n     to recommend he not be nominated.\n       Grassley up to now had focused his objections on Mancuso's \n     supposedly poor judgment while director of the Defense \n     Criminal Investigative Service from 1988-97. Grassley accused \n     Mancuso of coddling a deputy after the deputy confessed to \n     stealing a dead boy's identity in an effort to get a false \n     passport for still-mysterious reasons.\n       Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has mounted a stout \n     defense of Mancuso and has told Grassley that none of the \n     Senator's objections should bar him from advancement. \n     However, the Tailhook connection, which Grassley's \n     investigators have just begun to probe, may turn the Mancuso \n     nomination into a ``bolter''--pilot talk for an airplane that \n     misses the arresting wires stretched across an aircraft-\n     carrier deck and so fails to land. Grassley will do his best \n     to exploit the Tailhook connection in hearings and on the \n     Senate floor. Former Navy Secretary John W. Warner, R-Va., \n     chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which would \n     hold confirmation hearings on a Mancuso nomination, is likely \n     to plead with the President not to nominate anybody who would \n     pull Congress back into the Tailhook swamp.\n       The U.S. Court of Military Appeals denounced the tactics of \n     Mancuso's agents in an opinion issued on Jan. 11, 1994, on a \n     Tailhook case against Navy Lt. David Samples. The defendant \n     had been charged with participating in the ``gantlet'' in \n     which drunken pilots groped, and in some cases assaulted, \n     dozens of women who ventured down the third-floor hallway at \n     the Hilton. Samples charged that he endured his own intensive \n     gantlet of interrogations as one naval\n\n[[Page S132]]\n\n     officer after another advised him to tell what he knew and, \n     in his view, guaranteed him complete immunity if he did. \n     After undergoing the Navy interviews, he was immediately \n     interrogated by DCIS in assembly line fashion.\n       In court testimony, Special Agent Matthew A. Walinsky of \n     DCIS attributed the assembly line idea to DCIS Director \n     Mancuso: ``We felt that, or the director [of the] DCIS felt \n     that, it was one of the ways that we could have a resolution \n     in the case and be fair to everybody that was involved in \n     [the] case, so that they would have a walk-away'' from any \n     further entanglement in the Tailhook mess.\n       The U.S. Court of Military Appeals assailed the \n     arrangement: ``The assembly line technique in this case that \n     merged and blurred investigative and justice procedures is \n     troublesome. At best, it reflects a most curiously careless \n     and amateurish approach to a very high profile case by \n     experienced military lawyers and investigators. At worst, it \n     raises the possibility of a shadiness in respecting the \n     rights of military members caught up in a criminal \n     investigation that cannot be condoned.''\n       Mancuso, when asked by National Journal to respond to the \n     court's denunciation, said: ``The quote [from the decision] \n     was taken out of context and exhibits a lack of understanding \n     of the technique being discussed. . . . DCIS played a minor \n     role in the `assembly line technique' as described in the \n     opinion. The DCIS investigation of the Tailhook matter was \n     handled thoroughly and professionally.''\n       But Charles W. Gittins of Middletown, Va., a defense \n     attorney in the Tailhook case, charged in an interview with \n     National Journal that Mancuso's DCIS agents ``routinely \n     violated naval officers' rights with threats of retribution \n     for failure to cooperate,'' Gittins said that Mancuso's \n     supervision of his investigators ``left much to be desired. I \n     would have concern if Mancuso became IG about his integrity \n     and commitment to the rule of law.'' He added he would \n     welcome the chance to give such testimony to Congress.\n       Robert B. Rae of Virginia Beach, Va., another Tailhook \n     defense attorney and a former U.S. attorney, said that \n     Mancuso ``abused his position [as DCIS director] and showed a \n     general disregard for laws of military justice'' during the \n     Tailhook investigation. ``He intentionally failed to \n     comply with the judge's order to produce evidence and \n     documents on several occasions. We need somebody [as \n     inspector general] who makes the ethical decision, not the \n     politically correct one. He [Mancuso] was politically \n     motivated.''\n       Mancuso told National Journal that ``while I don't remember \n     being directly involved with either of these defense counsels \n     during the Tailhook investigation, it is not unusual for \n     defense counsels to disagree with the government's \n     investigation techniques. I categorically deny that I have \n     ever intentionally failed to comply with any judge's order.'' \n     He said that as DCIS director, he worked to ensure that both \n     sides received all requested information promptly.\n       As Pentagon inspector general, Mancuso would be responsible \n     for supervising 1,228 employees, including 323 criminal \n     investigators, and for overseeing a budget of $136.8 million \n     annually. He would be paid a salary of $118,400 a year.\n       Grassley is particularly vexed about what Mancuso did--and \n     did not do--about Larry Joe Hollingsworth, a deputy at DCIS \n     who was responsible for keeping agents in line, but who \n     committed a felony that a hearing judge termed ``bizarre.'' \n     In 1992, Hollingsworth found in the records of a Florida \n     library the obituary of Charles W. Drew, who died at age 13. \n     Hollingsworth decided to assume the boy's identity. And by \n     posing as the deceased boy's half brother, Hollingsworth \n     obtained the identification papers he needed to apply for a \n     passport in Charles' name. He appended pictures of himself to \n     the passport application and signed it in such a muddled way \n     that the State Department investigated, leading to \n     Hollingsworth's arrest, indictment, and confession to one \n     count of fraud.\n       Why would a 46-year-old, $92,926-a-year Pentagon executive \n     with more than 20 years' experience investigating other \n     people's crimes commit one himself? ``In the last few \n     years,'' Hollingsworth wrote right after his arrest, ``I have \n     seen repeated news stories about how easy it would be'' to \n     assume someone else's identity. ``I decided to see if it was \n     true. This was a Walter Mitty fantasy, however, for \n     excitement and not to hurt anyone.''\n       Special Agent Sean O'Brien of the State Department told \n     investigators with Grassley's Senate Judiciary Administrative \n     Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee that ``there were at \n     least 12 overt acts of fraud perpetrated by Mr. Hollingsworth \n     over the course of one year.'' O'Brien told the investigators \n     that ``passport fraud is always committed in furtherance of a \n     more serious crime . . .''\n       On April 29, 1996, Mancuso wrote, on assistant inspector \n     general stationery, to federal Judge T.S. Ellis III of the \n     U.S. District Court in Alexandria, VA., while the jurist was \n     weighing what penalty to impose on Hollingsworth. ``To this \n     day,'' he wrote, ``there is no evidence that Mr. \n     Hollingsworth has ever done anything improper relating to his \n     duties and responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager. . . \n     . It is our intention to consider removal action against him \n     after the conclusion of the criminal charges. . . . I would \n     ask that you also consider the severity of these \n     administrative actions as you pronounce sentencing.''\n       Grassley accused Mancuso of showing poor judgment in \n     writing what the Senator considered a plea for leniency. \n     Grassley also criticized Mancuso for letting Hollingsworth \n     retire at 50 in 1996 with full pay, 12 years ahead of \n     schedule--a decision that cost the taxpayers an extra \n     $750,000, Grassley said.\n       Mancuso denied asking for leniency. He told National \n     Journal that that ``my intent in writing the letter was to \n     advise the judge of SA [Special Agent] Hollingsworth's past \n     job performance while assigned to DCIS, not to ask for \n     leniency. In fact, nowhere in my letter is the term \n     `leniency' used.''\n       Hollingsworth, after pleading guilty, was sentenced in June \n     1996 to supervised probation for two years and was fined \n     $5,000, plus $195.30 a month to pay for the cost of \n     supervising him while on probation. He also had to serve 30 \n     days of jail time on weekends, perform 200 hours of community \n     service, and pay a $50 special assessment.\n       The majority staff of Grassley's subcommittee on Nov. 2 \n     filed a 64-page report highly critical of Mancuso's conduct. \n     Cohen responded to Grassley on Dec. 28 that his staff had \n     found nothing in the subcommittee's report to shake his \n     ``complete confidence in Mr. Mancuso's abilities and \n     integrity. Nothing I have seen has caused me to doubt Mr. \n     Mancuso's ability to ably, fairly, and honestly lead the \n     Office of the Inspector General.''\n       ``Bill,'' Grassley wrote back to Cohen on Jan. 7, ``you and \n     I have known each other for many years, I know, if given an \n     accurate report on the facts in the case, you would not \n     defend the integrity of the acting IG.''\n       Since vote-counters have apparently concluded that Grassley \n     does not have enough Senate allies to defeat the nomination, \n     the White House intends to nominate Mancuso when Congress \n     reconvenes. Will the stubborn Iowan resort to a filibuster, \n     or will he place a simple hold on the nomination, in light of \n     Tailhook and other charges? ``I don't know yet,'' Grassley \n     replied.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as if in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few moments \ntoday about the call in the State of the Union Address for a \nprescription drug benefit to be added to the Medicare program.\n  In all of the discussions about the State of the Union and what is \nhappening to the health of the American people, one of the underlying \nissues is that people are living longer and better lives. When people \nlive longer and better lives, it means we have more strain on Medicare \nand on Social Security. But, of course, all of that is born of good \nnews: People are living longer. At the start of the last century, \ncitizens of the United States were expected to live, on average, to \nabout 48 years of age. One hundred years later, in the year 2000, you \nare expected to live to be about 78 years of age--a 30-year increase in \nlife expectancy. That is really quite remarkable.\n  What are the reasons for that? There are a lot of reasons: Better \nnutrition, new medical technologies, and life-saving prescription \nmedicines that have been developed to extend life. There are a lot of \nreasons for the increased longevity.\n  In 1965, we created a Medicare program that has contributed \nsubstantially to the increase in longevity in this country. Prior to \nthat time, 50 percent of senior citizens had no health care coverage at \nall--none. Medicare provided health care coverage to all senior \ncitizens, and now 99 percent of older Americans in this country have \nbasic health care protection through Medicare. That clearly has \nextended life and has allowed people to live longer and better lives. \nBut in 1965 when Medicare was created, many of the prescription drugs \nthat now exist for extending life simply weren't available. There was \nnot, therefore, a need for a prescription drug benefit in Medicare.\n  The call now by the President and by Members of Congress, myself \nincluded,\n\n[[Page S133]]\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike, is for a prescription drug benefit for \nthe Medicare program. Why? Because senior citizens in this country \ncomprise 12 percent of our population and consume 33 percent of the \nprescription drugs in our country.\n  Let me repeat that because it is important.\n  Twelve percent of our population are senior citizens, but yet they \nconsume one-third of the prescription drugs.\n  The cost of prescription drugs last year increased nearly 16 \npercent--last year alone. Part of the reason for that increase was \nprice inflation, and part of it was a dramatic increase in utilization. \nBut we should, it seems to me, be especially concerned about senior \ncitizens having access to the prescription drugs they need to extend \nand improve their lives.\n  As chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, I have been holding \nhearings in various parts of the country on this very subject. For \ninstance, I held a hearing with Senator Schumer in Westchester, NY, and \na hearing recently with Senator Durbin in Chicago. I guess I have held \nperhaps six or eight hearings on this subject.\n  It is heartbreaking sometimes to hear the stories told at these \nhearings. An oncologist came to a hearing I held. He told of one of his \npatients who was a senior citizen, a woman who had breast cancer. And \nhe said: There is a medicine she needs to take following her surgery, \nchemotherapy, and radiation that will reduce the chances that she will \nhave a recurrence of breast cancer. When I described this medicine to \nher, she said: What does it cost? The doctor told her what it cost. And \nshe said: There isn't any way I can afford that medicine. I will just \nhave to take my chances. I will just have to take my chances of the \nbreast cancer recurring because I can't afford the medicine.\n  It breaks your heart to hear that.\n  Or to hear a senior citizen who said: When I go into the grocery \nstore where I purchase my medications, the first stop for me must be \nthe pharmacy counter because I must get my prescriptions filled, so \nthen I will know how much money I have left for food. Only then will I \nknow how much food I can buy.\n  Senior citizens will find in some circumstances that they take 4, 6, \nor 8, and in some cases 10 and 12, different kinds of medicines at the \nsame time. Some of them are horribly expensive. Yet most older \nAmericans have very little prescription drug coverage.\n  I would like to show some charts that describe these circumstances \ngraphically, especially for senior citizens.\n  This chart shows that nearly a third of senior citizens spend $1,500 \na year on prescription drugs. These are people who are living on fixed \nincomes, and 70 percent of them have incomes of $15,000 or less.\n  This chart shows that nearly 75 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nhave inadequate prescription drug coverage. In fact, 34 percent have no \ndrug coverage at all--none, zero. So they must go to the drugstore to \nbuy their prescription drugs, living on a fixed income, trying to \nbalance the need to pay heat and light and rent and food, and then try \nto figure out how to pay for increasingly expensive prescription drugs. \nMany of them find they can't do it.\n  They tell me at these hearings some of the measures they are forced \nto take: I have heart trouble, or I have diabetes, they tell me, and \nwhat I do is buy the prescription drugs that the doctor says I must \nhave, and cut the pills in half and take half the dose so it lasts \ntwice as long. And they hope somehow that they will avoid medical \nproblems by doing it. It breaks your heart to hear someone 85 years of \nage who knows he has to take medicine to deal with his heart disease \nand diabetes, but who says: I can't afford it so I don't take the \nmedicine.\n\n  As this chart shows, this is especially a problem for older women. As \nyou can see, the majority of women have no prescription drug coverage \nat all. That is a very serious problem.\n  This chart illustrates that rural beneficiaries are less likely to \nhave prescription drug coverage across all income groups. I represent a \nrural State and the many hearings I have held in North Dakota confirm \nthis fact.\n  We are going to be confronted in this Congress with the question of \nwhether we should add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram. When I was in New York with Senator Schumer, Connie Pennucci, \n77 years old, said she has no prescription drug benefits and pays $200 \na month out of pocket for the medications she needs to treat her \narthritis and osteoporosis.\n  In Illinois about 2 weeks ago, a woman named Anita Milton told \nSenator Durbin and I that she had a double lung transplant. Because of \nthe way Medicaid works, she gets help to pay for her prescription drugs \none month, but then the next month she has no drug benefits at all. I \nthink she told us that her prescription drugs to prevent the rejection \nof her new lungs cost $2,500 a month. Think of that, $2,500 a month.\n  At that same hearing, this wonderful woman who had a double lung \ntransplant was joined by two people who had heart transplants. They \ntold us the cost of their prescription drugs that are necessary to \nprevent rejection of their transplanted hearts. Is all of this miracle \nmedicine? Of course it is. But it is only miraculous if you can afford \nthe prescription drugs that must be taken on a daily basis to ward off \nthe rejection of the transplanted organ.\n  There is an urgent requirement, in my judgment, for all of us in \nCongress to join together to find a way to add a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare. We should do it in a way that is voluntary for \nsenior citizens. We should do it in a way that doesn't break the \nTreasury, and pharmaceutical prices should be affordable. But we can do \nthat. I hope Republicans and Democrats together will recognize the \nurgent need to do this.\n  I would like to address one other issue, and that is the issue of the \nprice of prescription drugs. Why do prescription drugs cost so much, \nand what can we do about it? Let me say at the outset, I want the \npharmaceutical industry to be successful. I want the drug companies to \nbe successful. I want them to be profitable. I want them to continue to \ninvest in new research and development to help discover new lifesaving \nmedicines and drugs. As you know, the federal government provides a \nsubstantial investment in pharmaceutical research and development \nthrough the National Institutes of Health and tax credits. A \nsubstantial amount of research and development for new medicines is \npublicly funded. But the pharmaceutical industry does private research \nand development.\n  I want them to be successful. But I also want them to price \npharmaceutical drugs fairly for all of the American people. In \nvirtually every other country in which you purchase a prescription drug \nmade by a pharmaceutical company in a plant inspected by the Food and \nDrug Administration, the same pill in the same bottle made by the same \ncompany costs double, sometimes triple the amount in the United States \nthan in virtually any other country in the world. I will give you some \nexamples.\n  Let me go back to some of the medications most frequently used by \nolder Americans who consume a third of the prescription drugs in our \ncountry. If they take Zocor, a cholesterol-reducing drug, the same drug \nin the same dosage and quantity costs $106 in the United States, and \nonly $43 in Canada, $47 in Mexico. These prices have been converted to \nU.S. dollars.\n  Or Prilosec, a drug for ulcers costs $105 in the U.S., $53 in Canada, \nand $29 in Mexico.\n\n  Zoloft, a drug for depression, costs $195 in America, $124 in Canada, \nand $155 in Mexico. The list goes on.\n  This chart shows it better. How much do we pay for prescription \ndrugs? For every $1 that American consumers pay for a prescription \ndrug, that same drug would cost much less in other nations. For every \ndollar Americans spend for prescription medications, Canadian consumers \npay 64 cents, the English pay 65 cents, the Swedes pay $68 cents, and \nthe Italians pay 51 cents.\n  Why do U.S. consumers pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs? The answer is because the pharmaceutical industry \ncan charge as much as they want if they choose to do so --and they do.\n  I took a small group of senior citizens to Emerson, Canada, recently. \nThey purchased prescription drugs at the pharmacy in Emerson. These are \nsenior citizens with heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, and other \nillnesses. Guess what. We went 5 miles\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\nacross the border into Canada and there they could buy the same \nprescription drugs at a small percentage of the price of the \nprescription drugs in this country. These are the same pills, made by \nthe same company, often actually made in the United States and then \nshipped 5 miles north into Canada. Yet, if U.S. consumers were to buy \nthem in the United States, they are charged much higher prices.\n  Is that fair? No. If this is truly a global economy, then it seems to \nme that pharmacists in this country ought to be able to access those \nsame drugs in any market in the world and pass the savings on to their \ncustomers. That would, in my judgment, force the pharmaceutical \nindustry to reprice their products in the United States.\n  As I said when I started, I want the pharmaceutical industry to make \nmoney. I want them to do good pharmaceutical. The Wall Street Journal \ncalls the profits of the pharmaceutical industry ``the envy of the \ncorporate world.'' Why? At least in part, it seems to me, it is because \nthe U.S. consumer is charged very, very high prices for the same drug \nthat is marketed in the rest of the world at a much lower cost. I have \nintroduced a piece of legislation, the International Prescription Drug \nParity Act, that I and a bipartisan group of cosponsors are going to \ntry to get passed in this Congress to address this problem.\n  These issues of pharmaceutical drug costs and a prescription drug \nbenefit in Medicare are very important issues. Lifesaving medicine is \nonly able to save lives if people can afford to have access to that \nmedicine. Too many Americans find these prices are out of their reach. \nToo many senior citizens living on fixed incomes are finding they are \nnot able to afford the medicines that are necessary for them to prolong \ntheir lives, to improve their lives, and to treat their diseases or \nillness. We in Congress can do something about that. But I would say \nthis. Even as we try to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, we \nmust find a way to put some downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices and provide some fairness relative to what the rest of the world \npays for the same prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Iowa for the courtesy. \nI know the bankruptcy bill is on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a \ndistinguished Pennsylvanian, the librarian from Dickinson College in \nCarlisle, PA, Mr. Yongyi Song, who was greeted tumultuously in \nPhiladelphia on Saturday afternoon when he returned from the People's \nRepublic of China after having been held in custody there since August \n7.\n  Mr. Yongyi Song came to the United States some 10 years ago and has \nbecome a world-renowned scholar on the Cultural Revolution. In addition \nto his regular duties at Dickinson College, he has published \nextensively on the Cultural Revolution.\n  Last August, he and his wife Helen made a trip to the People's \nRepublic of China so that he could continue his research. While there, \nhe was taken into custody on August 7. Thereafter, his wife was \nreleased, but on Christmas Eve he was charged with transmitting state \nsecrets.\n  A careful analysis of the case raises very severe questions as to \nwhether there was ever any substance to the charges. A campaign was \nwaged by scholars and academicians and by colleges and universities \nacross the land to obtain his release. Dickinson College retained a \nvery distinguished attorney, Jerome Cohen, an expert in Chinese \naffairs, who took up the cause.\n  A resolution was submitted last Wednesday by this Senator with quite \na number of cosponsors--Senator Biden, the ranking member on the \nForeign Relations Committee, being the principal cosponsor; in \naddition, Senator Santorum and others.\n  After consultation with Secretary of State Albright and others in the \nState Department, I sought a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador, which \nI had last Friday late in the morning.\n  Before going to the meeting, I heard rumors that Yongyi Song might be \nreleased. While I met with the Chinese Ambassador, I was delighted to \nfind that he handed me a piece of paper announcing Mr. Song's release, \nand gave me the word that Mr. Song would soon be on a Northwest \nairliner headed for Detroit, and ultimately for Philadelphia.\n  We thank the People's Republic of China and we thank the Chinese \nAmbassador for Mr. Yongyi Song's release. We regret that he ever was \ntaken into custody. But when he returned and commented to the news \nmedia, on a galaxy of cameras--both television and still cameras--and \nto many newspaper reporters, Mr. Song commented that he was not \nphysically abused. He said he was subjected to a good bit of mental \ntorture. He disputed the representations by the People's Republic of \nChina that he had confessed or implicated others. But as Shakespeare \nwould say, ``All's well that ends well.''\n  It has been reported that this is the first time there has been a \nrelease of anybody who was charged with stealing state secrets. It is \nmy hope that this is a significant step forward for the People's \nRepublic of China to recognize human rights. In an era when the \nPeople's Republic of China is seeking permanent most-favored-nation \nstatus and seeking entry into the World Trade Organization, it is my \nhope that they will accept at least minimal norms for due process, so \nthat if someone is taken into custody, that person is entitled to \nconfer with counsel, should be entitled to notice of the charges, \nshould be entitled to an open trial, and should have the requirement \nthat evidence be presented in an open forum before any determination of \nguilt.\n  The detention of Mr. Yongyi Song from August 7 until January 28, in \nmy judgment, was excessive. But we are glad to have Yongyi Song back at \nhis duties at Dickinson College and glad this has ended favorably. We \ndo hope this is a first step in a continuing recognition by the \nPeople's Republic of China to give appropriate consideration to human \nrights.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article \nentitled ``Scholar Back in U.S. After China Detention'' from The New \nYork Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 30, 2000]\n\n               Scholar Back in U.S. After China Detention\n\n                           (By Philip Shenon)\n\n       Philadelphia, Jan. 29--An American-based Chinese scholar \n     who had been jailed in China for nearly six months returned \n     to the United States today to say that he had been ``mentally \n     tortured'' by Chinese security agents who demanded that he \n     confess to espionage and implicate others.\n       ``They didn't torture me physically, but I should say that \n     they mentally tortured me,'' the scholar, Song Yongyi, a \n     research librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., \n     said after he was reunited with his wife in a tearful scene \n     at Philadelphia's international airport. ``It was very \n     ruthless.''\n       ``When I come back to the United States, I really feel at \n     home now,'' said Mr. Song, who was taken into custody by the \n     Chinese last summer, only weeks before he had been scheduled \n     to be sworn in as an American citizen. ``Even though China \n     gave me birth, the United States gave me spirit.''\n       In an airport news conference and in a separate interview, \n     the 50-year-old librarian, a specialist in the documents of \n     the murderous decade from 1966 to 1976 known as the Cultural \n     Revolution, denied a claim by the Chinese government that he \n     was freed after he confessed to spying.\n       ``I did not confess to anything,'' he said, crediting his \n     release to pressure on Beijing from members of Congress who \n     threatened to hold up vital trade legislation, and from \n     Western scholars who campaigned for his freedom.\n\n[[Page S135]]\n\n       Scholars had warned that his arrest threatened to \n     jeopardize academic exchange programs that China had \n     carefully cultivated with the United States and other Western \n     countries since the late 1970's.\n       ``I say thank you to all the American people, because \n     without them I cannot get released,'' Mr. Song said, his eyes \n     brimming with tears, which he said were among the first he \n     had shed since childhood. ``During the past 30 years, I never \n     cry, but last night I cry all night.''\n       He was met at the airport by his wife, Helen Yao, a jewelry \n     designer, and Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania \n     Republican who introduced legislation demanding Mr. Song's \n     release and granting him immediate American citizenship. He \n     also threatened to block legislation intended to make way for \n     China's entry into the World Trade Organization.\n       Mr. Song and his wife, who is also Chinese-born, were \n     detained in August in Beijing, where he had been gathering \n     yellowing Communist Party newspapers and handbills published \n     during the Cultural Revolution, about which he has written \n     two books and several articles. Ms. Yao was released in \n     November and forced to leave China without her husband.\n       Mr. Song said today that the documents he had been \n     gathering were published by the radicals known as the Red \n     Guards and that they were available at the time to virtually \n     everyone in China. He said there was nothing secret about \n     them.\n       ``You can purchase all those in public markets,'' he said. \n     ``You can purchase those in some book stores. This is not \n     national security.''\n       He said he argued the point with his guards over and over \n     again. ``I strongly argue that,'' he said in his sometimes \n     broken English. ``My question is: If you say this is a secret \n     and I'm leaking the secret, then you should first say all the \n     Chinese people are spies. Because they all touched those. \n     They all know this, not only me.''\n       The Cultural Revolution, in which millions of Chinese were \n     persecuted as Mao tried to consolidate his power and \n     ``purify'' the Communist Party, remains a subject of extreme \n     sensitivity to Beijing, which continues to restrict access to \n     official archives of the period.\n       During his early interrogations, Mr. Song said, his guards \n     tried to coerce him with lies. He said they told him that his \n     wife, who was being held in a separate detention center, was \n     gravely ill, but that she could be freed for medical \n     treatment if he confessed to spying.\n       ``That was the worst moment of all,'' he said. ``They say \n     my wife is so sick and so weak, that I should think about my \n     wife and how she could return home quickly.''\n       When that did not work, he said, the guards tried to \n     convince him that his wife had implicated him in spying and \n     other crimes against the government. ``Every time they \n     question me, they say, your wife says such-and-such, your \n     wife identifies such-and-such,'' Mr. Song said.\n       At one point, he said, security agents told him that his \n     wife had identified him as a member of Falun Gong, the \n     spiritual group that has been the subject of a vicious crack-\n     down recently, and that he had smuggled its literature into \n     China.\n       ``I know nothing about Falun Gong,'' Mr. Song said, ``I \n     say, I believe this is not true. I say, bring my wife in. But \n     then they become suddenly silent. They said, O.K., we move on \n     to the next topic.''\n       He said the experience of the last several months was far \n     worse than his experience during the Cultural Revolution, \n     when he was arrested and branded a counterrevolutionary.\n       ``In the 1970's, I was beaten, I was tortured,'' he said. \n     ``But this was worse. With physical torture, they torture \n     only you. This time, they arrest, and they try to mentally \n     torture my wife. As a man, you feel so bad.''\n       Mr. Song, who has bladder cancer that is in remission, said \n     that he had repeatedly asked to see a doctor, but that his \n     guards refused without explanation. ``My health condition is \n     not very good, and I asked them several times if I could get \n     doctors to examine me, but they wouldn't,'' he said ``As soon \n     as I get home, I should see a doctor and get a full body \n     examination.''\n       As he set off from the airport after the news conference, \n     Mr. Song was asked what he would do when he arrived home in \n     Carlisle. He did not hesitate. ``I think he will have some \n     sweet talk with my wife,'' he said, his arm tightly around \n     her shoulder.\n       He said Ms. Yao's confinement in China had changed her. \n     ``My wife became a very brave woman, so I'm very proud of \n     her,'' he said. ``Actually this is not her typical \n     characteristic. The Chinese government, the Chinese national \n     security police, they make a weak woman into a brave \n     soldier.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and my distinguished colleague from \nIowa.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I believe the pending order of business is the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to talk about the pending bankruptcy bill \nand give my full and total support to the work of Senator Grassley and \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title, since \nthese will be the first comments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 625) to amend title 11, United States Code, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Wellstone amendment No. 2537, to disallow claims of certain \n     insured depository institutions.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 2538, with respect to the \n     disallowance of certain claims and to prohibit certain \n     coercive debt collection practices.\n       Schumer/Durbin amendment No. 2762, to modify the means test \n     relating to safe harbor provisions.\n       Schumer amendment No. 2763, to ensure that debts incurred \n     as a result of clinic violence are nondischargeable.\n       Feingold modified amendment No. 2748, to provide for an \n     exception to a limitation on an automatic stay under section \n     362(b) of title 11, United States Code, relating to evictions \n     and similar proceedings to provide for the payment of rent \n     that becomes due after the petition of a debtor is filed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I give my total support to this bill, \nwhich is a needed overhaul reform update and modernization of an act \nthat is very important to America. It allows people every day--over a \nmillion a year--to totally wipe out debts that they owe, to start \nafresh and not pay people they have legally obligated themselves to \npay. It is part of our historical constitutional process. We venerate \nthat right to start anew.\n  Over the past years, we also have recognized there are a number of \nproblems with the way bankruptcy is being handled. We believe we can \nmake it better. I believe this bill does make it better. As a new \nSenator who has been here only 3 years, it has been somewhat \nfrustrating to see that we cannot quite get a final vote on the bill. \nAt one time or another, at the most inopportune moments, there has been \na group of people who have come up with objections and delays, and we \nhave now been on this for 3 years.\n  It has passed this body with over 90 votes. At one time it came out \nof the Judiciary Committee with a 16-2 vote. We have a good, broad, \nbipartisan bill that improves bankruptcy law, and it ought to be \npassed. The objections to this legislation have only been those of the \nmost complex and minute nature. The overall aspects of this bill are \nsound. It has very little opposition.\n  Let me point out a few things.\n  Bankruptcies have increased 350 percent since 1980, during a time of \ngreat economic expansion. In 1980, there were 287,000 bankruptcies \nfiled. In 1999, as this chart shows, there were 1,300,000 bankruptcies \nfiled. And 1999, as the President told us the other night, was a great \nyear for Americans economically.\n  How is this happening? Is this necessary? Are these all legitimate? \nWhat can we do about it? That is what this bill addresses.\n  I believe we do need reform because of an extraordinary increase in \nfilings.\n  Some are saying we do not need this bill. There was an ad run in a \nlocal Washington newspaper that said: We do not need the bankruptcy \nlegislation; we had a 7 percent drop last year in filings; so, \ntherefore, you should just stop all the work that you have been doing.\n  I thought that was a silly ad. After a 350 percent increase, we have \none of the best economic years ever and had a modest decline of 7 \npercent, and somehow that suggests we do not have a problem with \nfilings? We do have a problem with filings. The numbers still are well \nover 1 million filings per year.\n  There is another reason we need bankruptcy reform. I am a lawyer. I \nserved as a U.S. attorney. I am on the Judiciary Committee. I believe \nthat the rule of law ought to be consistent and fair, worthy of \nrespect. I also recognize that lawyers are strong advocates. I respect \nthat. Sometimes they get unscrupulous and abuse the system, but \ngenerally what lawyers do is\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\ntake the law we pass and use it for everything they are worth to \nbenefit their client.\n  That is what has happened with the bankruptcy system. Since 1978,--\nthe last time we had bankruptcy reform--lawyers have learned how to \nmanipulate the law. They have learned how to do things that have in \nmany ways abused the operation of the system. It leads to hard \nfeelings. It leads to a sense of unfairness and frustration when people \nfeel their just debts are unfairly, without justification, wiped out \nand not paid because of a technicality in the bankruptcy law. People \nhave to spend extraordinary sums of money to litigate an issue in \nbankruptcy court that should be decided easily by a clearly written \nstatute. So we do have abuse of the system. No matter how many filings \nthere are, we need a system that is fair for the filings that do occur. \nThat is what we have worked on in these last several years.\n  We have a number of basic principles. If a person can pay the debts \nhe or she justly obligated themselves to pay, that person should pay it \nor at least that portion of it they are able to pay. If they are unable \nto pay their debts, they ought to be able to wipe them out in \nbankruptcy.\n  What we are seeing today--and I am hearing this from people I talk to \nall over Alabama--is people who are making $80,000, $90,000, $100,000 \nand could easily pay back all or part of their debts are going into \nbankruptcy and wiping out every debt they owe. Often they are not \npaying the people they previously agreed to pay when they undertook the \ndebt and got the loan or the benefits from the gas station or the \nautomobile dealership or the furniture store. When they got those \nbenefits, they agreed to pay them. The creditors or businesses don't \nmake as much money as the debtors do, and they are able to go into \ncourt and wipe that out. If you think that is not happening, I can \nassure you that it happens every day in America. We allow that under \npresent bankruptcy law. There is a section called substantial abuse \nthat a judge can use to reduce the abuses under current law, but what \nour hearings have found is that it is totally ineffective and is almost \nnever utilized in the American bankruptcy system today.\n  What we are trying to do is legislate precisely what a substantial \nabuse of the system is. For those who can pay a part of their debts, \nthey ought to pay them. What could be more fair?\n  What we have come up with is a system called needs-based bankruptcy. \nThat is, to the extent to which you need bankruptcy relief, you get it. \nBut if you don't need it and can pay your debts, you ought to pay some \nof them or part of them. So the way the act is written, if a person can \npay 25 percent of their nonpriority unsecured claims--setting aside as \na priority child support and alimony--if you can, after paying that, \npay 25 percent of your nonpriority unsecured claims, then you ought to \npay those or $15,000, whichever is less, and we give the debtor 5 years \nin which to pay that. That is the kind of thing I think is the right \nstep.\n  To have a bright line rule and to try to make sure we are not \nclogging the court with too much work, and that we are having a fair \nsystem, we have in the act provisions that say, in effect, that if a \nperson makes above the median American income, they can't be forced to \npay back some or all of their debt. They can still file, as they always \nhave, in straight bankruptcy.\n  For example, a family of four who makes $44,000 is making the median \nincome in America. If they are making $43,000, the presumption that \nthey ought to and they can pay back some of their debt, does not apply \nto them because they will be making below the median income. So the new \nrule change only affects those who are making above the median income \nin America today. We think that is fair and reasonable. If you are \nmaking above the median income and you can pay back some of your debts, \nmany times to people who make less than you do, you ought to pay those \ndebts. I think that is a good step in the right direction.\n\n  There are a number of other abuses in the system. I mentioned child \nsupport and alimony. Under current law, half a dozen categories of debt \nare given repayment priority over child support and alimony. The \nsponsors of this bill, Senators Grassley and Hatch, made clear at the \nvery beginning we were going to move child support and alimony up to \nNo. 1--there would not be any debate about that--even higher than \nlawyers fees. Of course, the lawyers are not too happy about that, but \nthat is what we think about it: child support ought to be tops. So how \nanybody could go around and suggest, as some have, that this \nlegislation is unfair to women and children is beyond my comprehension. \nIt is baffling to me. I wonder how anyone can make that complaint and \nnot be doing it with the most deliberate intent to smear this \nlegislation. I think they need to read the bill.\n  It gives the highest, unprecedented priority to child support. If an \nindividual files bankruptcy and they owe alimony or child support, the \nmoneys they have will go first to pay alimony and child support before \nit even pays the lawyer and the bankruptcy trustees.\n  I know that Senator Grassley felt strongly about another reform in \nthis bill. Many of the people who are owed money, creditors, by people \nwho have filed bankruptcy get a legal notice that they are to appear in \ncourt. They have to go out and hire a lawyer to send them to the \ncourthouse and fight over a $2,000, $3,500 claim. Oftentimes the \nlawyer's fees cost more than the person actually collects. This \nlegislation makes clear that if you have a claim, you can go to court \nand represent yourself without having to hire a lawyer.\n  I am quite confident that in most cases for smaller claims the \nbankruptcy judges are going to give a fair hearing to those people. \nMany times they will not need to hire an attorney to represent them in \nbankruptcy court. That is going to save a lot of money, in my view, for \npeople who need it and don't need to be wasting it on unnecessary court \nhearings and fees.\n  There has been a real problem with repeat filers. People are \nrepeatedly filing in bankruptcy. That is extraordinarily frustrating to \npeople who observe the system. We have a Federal bankruptcy commission \nmade up of Federal judges and top bankruptcy experts that has expressed \nits concern about these repeat filings. We have good provisions that \nwill eliminate some of the abuses in repeat filings, something that is \nlong overdue.\n  I felt strongly about, and debated with Senator Kohl and others, the \nreform of the unlimited homestead exemption. In several States--Texas, \nFlorida, for example--no matter how much money you owe, you can keep \nyour house, no matter how valuable that house is. It is quite clever \nthat some people realize this and go out and buy multimillion-dollar \nmansions, pour all their assets into those homes and call it their \nhomestead. Then they go bankrupt and don't pay their accountant, their \ndoctor, their lawyer or anybody else, and they are sitting in a \nmultimillion-dollar home. That is not right. Why should people who are \nliving in modest houses not get paid by somebody who is living in a \nhouse worth several million dollars? We have had hearings about that. \nWe have newspaper articles that actually identify people by name who \nhave moved to Florida, moved to Texas, buy these mansions, and don't \npay the people they owe. So we have at least capped that exemption at \nthe level of $100,000. I think that is a bit high. However, the States \ncan lower it. Some States have $15,000 as all you can keep in a \nhomestead; others have $50,000. But the maximum now is $100,000, \ninstead of just allowing quite a number of States to have unlimited \nhomesteads. In fact, they will do things such as move out of a State \nwhere they owe a lot of debt, pump all their money into a homestead in \nanother State, declare bankruptcy, and pay nobody back home where they \nleft. That is an abuse we have eliminated in the legislation as it is \ntoday.\n\n  We had a common problem with landlord-tenant. If anybody has managed \nan apartment duplex, or maybe has had a garage apartment or a few \nhousing units, and rented those, you know how difficult the eviction \nprocess is. Each State in this country has a complex system of eviction \nprocedures so that tenants cannot be unfairly removed from their \npremises. Sometimes these laws are pretty complex and it takes a good \nbit of effort before somebody can be removed if they don't pay their \nrent, or if they are using drugs on the premises, or destroying the \nproperty, or disrupting the neighborhood. It is very\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\ndifficult sometimes. But there is a procedure for it, and you can go to \nState court and evict someone.\n  We are finding that lawyers are running ads in the paper such as \nthis: ``Seven months free rent. Call me if you have a problem paying \nyour rent. We guarantee you can live rent free for seven months.'' We \nhave ads on that: ``Seven months free rent, 100 percent guaranteed in \nwriting. We guarantee you can stay in your apartment or house 2 to 7 \nmonths more without paying a penny of rent.''\n  How can they do that? They are doing it because they get the person \nin and tell them to file bankruptcy, and usually they tell them to wait \nuntil the last step of the eviction process is about to be taken in \nState court, when the judge has heard the case and they are about to \nrule that you can be evicted, presumably. Then they file for \nbankruptcy.\n  What happens when you file an action in bankruptcy? It stays, or \nstops, automatically, all the proceedings in State court. So this stops \nthe eviction proceeding, no matter how close it is to finality. And \nthen the poor landlords--who opponents of the bill like to suggest are \nusually big wealthy people, but normally most of the landlords in \nAmerica have smaller units of housing and don't have legal staffs and \nan ability to respond--now they have to go to bankruptcy court. The \ncase is docketed, the judge sets a hearing, and somebody asks for a \ncontinuance, and they have to hire a lawyer. Now the tenant is fussing \nand saying he wasn't using drugs anyway and should not be kicked out. \nNow we have another trial going in Federal court over whether or not \nthis person should be evicted. We found that, in California, 3,886 \nbankruptcy cases were filed simply to stop eviction proceedings by the \nsheriff's office in Los Angeles. That is an astounding number from just \none county in America. It is this kind of ad that generates this kind \nof action.\n  I don't know for sure, but a lot of these people probably didn't need \nto file bankruptcy, but we are giving them a priority and advantages \nthat other people who don't file bankruptcy don't get. It seems to me \nthat, in effect, we are saying to a landlord: You have to be a private \ncharity. You have to let this person stay in your premises for 7 months \nwithout paying rent before we can get him out of there, and we in the \nlaw can't do anything about it. That is the way the law is written.\n  Well, it is our job as Senators and Members of Congress to fix laws \nthat have those kinds of loopholes. We are going to fix that one. We \nare not going to have that kind of abuse continuing to occur in \nAmerica. It is not right. It is our responsibility to end this abuse. \nYou can blame the lawyers all you want, but if the law allows them to \ndo it, they can do it. It is our job to make the law, not the lawyers \nwho are using it.\n\n  We have another idea that I thought about and believe in strongly. I \nhave visited, in my hometown of Mobile, AL, a credit counseling agency. \nI spent nearly a full day there. These agencies are in existence \nvirtually in every town in this country. They are very popular. People, \nmore than you know, have financial troubles. It is the leading cause of \nfamily breakup in America--financial disputes among spouses. What we \nneed more than we need bankruptcy relief in America is a system to \nencourage people to be good money managers, to recognize what their \nincome is, to set a budget, and have the whole family agree to it and \nstand by it. When that occurs, we can avoid many of the problems we now \nsee.\n  I will note that I don't dispute at all that quite a number--perhaps \nwell over half of bankruptcies that are filed--are filed because of \nthings beyond people's ability to control. Maybe it is because of an \nautomobile accident, or a serious medical bill, or a business failure, \nor maybe a mental illness or something else in the family. So there are \nreasons. But for a large number of Americans, they don't need to be \nthis bad off in this time of economic growth. A lot of it is just a \nsimple inability to understand how to manage their money.\n  A credit counseling agency will bring the entire family in, and they \nwill sit around the table and prepare a budget for the family and help \nthem agree to it and have them sign that agreement. They will help them \ndecide what debts to pay first. The credit counseling agency will call \ncreditors demanding payment and say: We are here working with this \ncouple. If you will give us 3 months to take care of some other bills, \nwe will start paying you. We will start paying you so much a month, and \nwe will pay this debt down. Give us that chance.\n  Creditors are able to do that on a regular basis. They work out \nthings for these families and help them to not only avoid bankruptcy, \nthey help them to pay off their debts and help them to generate a \nlifestyle of good money management, which will continue in the future \nand perhaps cause them to avoid filing bankruptcy again in the future. \nWe like that idea.\n  Our legislation says that before you file bankruptcy, you must at \nleast visit and talk with a credit counseling agency to see if they may \nbe able to help you with an alternative to bankruptcy. Frankly, lawyers \nare not doing that. Basically, what is happening with lawyers today is, \nthey are running ads in the paper, and people are coming in and meeting \nwith paralegals who fill out the form, and they file the bankruptcy; \nthey tell them how much the fee is going to be, and then they tell them \nhow to get the money for the fee, to use credit cards and everything \nelse, and don't pay any debts, take the money you make and give it to \nme as a lawyer fee, and I will file for you as soon as the money is \nthere. That is basically what is happening. It is not good. We need to \nbe concerned about families and try to get them on the right track of \nthinking about financial obligations and the need to repay them.\n  So there are some other matters in this bill--many more matters of \ngreat import. I am excited about it. I think it is overdue. I want to \nexpress my appreciation again for the leadership of Senator Grassley. \nHe has steadfastly, fairly, and in a bipartisan way, worked to move \nthis bill to final passage.\n  I am convinced we are on the verge of that now. I thought we were \npreviously. It slipped away from us. But we passed it twice in this \nbody I think with overwhelming votes--one time, I believe with only one \n``no'' vote.\n  We are going to pass this bill. It is a good bill. It will make our \nbankruptcy system a form of Federal court in which people who are \nunable to pay their debt can choose to go in and have those wiped out.\n  We are going to create a system that is better than the current \nsystem. The vast majority of filers will be able to wipe out all of the \ndebt like they always have. But for those who can pay, they ought to be \nmade to pay some of it and to allow the other abuses and costs that go \nwith it to be eliminated.\n  Attorney fees and litigation can be eliminated. Some people are going \nto find maybe there is an alternative through a credit counseling \nagency rather than going through the process of filing bankruptcy. I \nthink that will be a good step.\n  I am proud to have worked on this. I am proud to have worked with \nSenator Grassley, whom I admire so greatly. I look forward to final \npassage and signing by the President of this important legislation.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, in a few moments, I will ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed to the nuclear waste bill. However, I will withhold \nthat request until Senator Reid is able to reach the Chamber. I thought \nwhile we were waiting on his arrival I would go ahead and make some \nremarks about this very important legislation.\n  We will, for the information of all Senators, continue to work \ntomorrow on the bankruptcy reform package and the amendments that have \nbeen agreed to. We hope to make good progress tomorrow. We will have \nrecorded votes on Tuesday, but as to exactly when we will be able to \nfinish it will require some communication with both sides of the aisle. \nIt could be that we will not be able to finish until sometime \nWednesday. After that, of course, we hope to be on the nuclear waste \nissue.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S138-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S138]]\n                         NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to allow the body to \nmove forward with regard to the nuclear waste storage bill. More than \n15 years ago, Congress directed the Department of Energy to take \nresponsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste created by commercial \nnuclear powerplants and our Nation's defense programs. Today, there are \nmore than 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel that must be dealt with.\n  Quite some time has now passed since DOE was absolutely obligated \nunder the NWPA Act of 1982 to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from \nutility sites.\n  All across this country, we have sites where nuclear waste products \nare in open pools, cooling pools. Many of those are filling up. A \nnumber of States have a major problem.\n  In my opinion, this is one of the most important environmental issues \nwe have to face as a nation. We have to deal with this problem. There \nhave been billions of dollars spent on it. There has been time put into \nthinking about the proper way to do it. States all across this country, \nfrom Vermont to Mississippi to Minnesota to Washington, believe very \nstrongly that we need to address this issue.\n  Apparently today, DOE is no closer in coming up with a solution. This \nis totally unacceptable. This is, in fact, wrong, so say the Federal \ncourts. The law is clear, and DOE has not met its obligation, so the \nCongress must act.\n  I am encouraged that Senator Murkowski and his committee have \naddressed the issue and they have come up with a different bill than \nthe one we considered the year before last. They have made concessions, \nthey have made improvements, and I thought we had a bill that was going \nto be generally overwhelmingly accepted.\n  I do think when we get over procedural hurdles, when the final vote \nis taken on this nuclear waste disposal bill, the vote will probably be \nin the high seventies or eighties when it is actually voted on, and \nthat is an important point. The Senate will vote by overwhelming \nnumbers for this legislation, so we need to move through the process.\n  I know there is opposition from the Senators from Nevada, and they \nhave to have an opportunity to make their case and offer amendments if \nthey feel the need to do so, as well as other Senators. But I think it \nis so important that we cannot allow it to languish any longer. It is a \nbipartisan effort that came out of the committee. It is safe, \npractical, and it is a workable solution for America's spent fuel \nstorage needs.\n\n  This is the proper storage of spent fuel, and it is not being done in \na partisan way. It is dealt with as a safety issue. Where is DOE? Well, \nabout where it is always, I guess. What is their solution? If not this, \nwhat?\n  They have not given us any answers or any indications of how they \nwould like to proceed with this. All of America's experience in waste \nmanagement over the last 25 years of improving environmental protection \nhas taught Congress that safe, effective waste handling practices \nentail using centralized, permitted, and controlled facilities to \ngather and manage accumulated waste.\n  I took the time to go to Sweden and France and to meet with officials \nfrom the private sector in Britain. I looked at how they have dealt \nwith their waste problem. They have dealt with it. Sweden has; France \nhas; Britain and Japan; but not the United States. Why? We are the most \ndeveloped country in the world, yet we have not dealt with this very \nimportant issue. So after over 25 years of working with this problem, \nDOE has still not made specific plans.\n  The management of used nuclear fuel should capitalize on the \nknowledge and experience we have. Nearly 100 communities have this \nspent fuel sitting in their ``backyards,'' and it needs to be gathered, \naccumulated, and placed in a secure and safe place. This lack of a \ncentral storage capacity could very possibly cause the closing of \nseveral nuclear powerplants.\n  These affected plants produce nearly 20 percent of America's \nelectricity. Closing these plants does not make sense. But if we do not \ndo something with the waste, that could be the result.\n  Nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future and \nmust remain part of the energy mix. America needs nuclear power to \nmaintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies of electricity. \nAt the same time, nuclear power allows the Nation to directly and \neffectively address increasingly stringent air quality requirements.\n  I challenge my colleagues in the Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, \nto get this bill done. We spent a lot of time on it the year before \nlast. We ran into the blue slip problem with the House. We will not \nhave that problem with this bill.\n  The citizens in these communities are looking for us to act. The \nnuclear industry had already committed to the Federal Government about \n$15 billion toward building the facility by 1998. The industry has \ncontinued to pay between $40 and $80 billion in fees for storage of \nthis spent fuel.\n  It is time for the Federal Government to honor its commitment to the \nAmerican people and to the power community. It is time for the Federal \nGovernment to protect these 100 communities to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment meets its commitment to States and electricity consumers. \nThe 106th Congress must mandate completion of this program--a program \nthat gives the Federal Government title to waste currently stored on-\nsite at facilities across the Nation, a site for permanent disposal, \nand a transportation infrastructure to safely move the used fuel from \nplants to the storage facility.\n  Again, I have had people express concerns to me about how this can be \ndone safely. I actually took the time to look at the equipment that is \nused to move this spent fuel in other countries, particularly in \nFrance, and they have done it safely, without a single incident--no \nproblem ever. Again, they are doing it in France. Can't we do it in \nAmerica?\n  Our foot dragging is unfortunate. It is unacceptable. Clearly, we \nmust move this legislation. The only remedy to stop the delays--and it \nis a timely action--is for the Senate to consider this in the 106th \nCongress.\n  Let's move forward and get this legislation done.\n  Madam President, I see Senator Reid is here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S138-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S138-S139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1287\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the nuclear waste bill, S. 1287, following passage of the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend, the majority leader, that on the surface it does appear that \nsomething needs to be done with nuclear waste. If you get under the \nsurface, of course, there should be something done.\n  I am not going to give a long dissertation now on nuclear waste. We \nhave had that in the past. But the fact of the matter is, really what \nshould happen is, it should stay where it is. That is what the \nscientists say. It could be safely stored on site in dry cast storage \ncontainment, as is done in Calvert Cliffs, MD, for the next 100 years.\n  The nuclear power industry, which has created this fiasco, wants \nsomeone else to clean up their mess. They want it out of their hands. \nThey want their hands washed of it.\n  The fact of the matter is, we are looking at this legislation. \nSenator Murkowski is trying to come up with some alternative. I have \nbeen told by the minority on the Energy Committee that if that is the \ncase, he is going to try to change the legislation that is now before \nthis body. That is, the legislation now before this body would take the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency out of the mix; that is, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency would not be setting the standards for \nYucca Mountain, but it would be given to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, which, in fact, is the one that does licensing. That really \nis literally having the fox guard the hen house.\n\n  In this legislation, we simply want things to remain the way they \nare--have the Environmental Protection Agency set the standards. But we \nunderstand there is a lot of agitation by the very powerful nuclear \npower industry, that wants to move this forward in spite of the fact \nthat it could damage\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nthe country. We understand that. We hope good sense will prevail \nbecause the President has said he will veto this legislation. I think \nthat is the reason Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the committee, \nwants to come up with something that is going to be such that it will \nnot create a fight here on the floor.\n  As the majority leader knows, we have enough votes to sustain a \nPresidential veto. We hope we will not get to the point where that is \nnecessary.\n  Will the leader again state what the request is?\n  Mr. LOTT. The consent would be for the Senate to proceed to the \nnuclear waste bill, S. 1287, following passage of the bankruptcy bill.\n  Mr. REID. I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understood the Senator would object.\n  I think it is very important, though, that we move this legislation \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S139-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1999--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Reserving the right to object to that request of the \nleader, I am confident that request will be granted. I cannot do it \nright now, but I am sure we will be able to--my colleague from Nevada \nis on an airplane. I want to be able to confer with him.

I say about Senator \nMurkowski, we have been real adversaries on this issue, but I have to \nsay that he has been a total gentleman about everything he has done on \nthis.

Madam President, earlier today, Governor George Ryan of \nIllinois made an announcement that is absolutely unprecedented for a \nsitting governor since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty \nalmost 25 years ago. Governor Ryan plans to effectively block \nexecutions in Illinois by granting stays of all scheduled executions on \na case-by-case basis until a State panel can examine whether Illinois \nis administering the death penalty fairly and justly. Governor Ryan is \nright to take this step, because real questions are being raised about \nwhether innocent people are being condemned to die.\n  Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 Gregg decision finding the death \npenalty constitutional, Illinois has executed 12 people and and found \n13 people on death row to be innocent. This is truly extraordinary. \nAfter condemning people to death, Illinois has actually found more \ndeath row inmates innocent than it has executed! Some of the innocent \nwere exonerated based on a new DNA test of forensic evidence. Others \nsuccessfully challenged their convictions based on inadequate \nrepresentation by disbarred or suspended attorneys or a determination \nthat crucial testimony of a jailhouse informant was unreliable. \nIllinois has exonerated 13 individuals but the numbers are sure to \ngrow, as other cases continue to be investigated and appeals make their \nway through the courts.\n  What is even more troubling is that the lives of some of these 13 \ninnocent people were saved not by the diligence of defense counsel or a \njury or judge, but by a group of students taking a journalism class at \nNorthwestern University. These Northwestern University students \nuncovered evidence, which led to the exoneration of people like Anthony \nPorter, who spent 15 years on death row and came within 2 days of \nexecution. The criminal justice system failed to do its job. These \nstudents and their journalism professor--actors very much outside the \ncriminal justice system--did the footwork to uncover exculpatory \nevidence. Governor Ryan supports the death penalty as a form of \npunishment in Illinois. I do not. But he has courageously acknowledged \nwhat many lawyers, scholars, and journalists have argued for some time: \nthe criminal justice system in Illinois is broken and it must be fixed.\n  I applaud Governor Ryan for what is unfortunately unusual courage. \nMany political leaders, even those who may be personally opposed to the \ndeath penalty, nevertheless feel it is somehow ``political suicide'' to \nsupport a moratorium on executions. They fear being\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\nlabeled ``soft on crime.'' But, last year, the Nebraska legislature \npassed a moratorium initiative, unfortunately, it was only to be vetoed \nlater by the governor. But Governor Ryan--a Republican Governor and the \nIllinois chair of Republican Presidential hopeful George W. Bush's \ncampaign--has decided he will lead the people of Illinois to expecting \nmore from their criminal justice system. He has decided to hold out for \nwhat should be the minimum standard of any system of justice: that we \ndo all that we can not to execute an innocent person.\n  As a result of the Governor's action, Illinois is the first of the 38 \nStates with the death penalty to halt all executions while it reviews \nthe death penalty procedure. But the problems of inadequate \nrepresentation, lack of access to DNA testing, police misconduct, \nracial bias and even simple errors are not unique to Illinois. These \nare problems that have plagued the administration of capital punishment \naround the country since the reinstatement of capital punishment almost \na quarter century ago. I hope the Federal government and the other 37 \nStates with capital punishment follow the wisdom of Illinois and halt \nexecutions until they, too, review their administration of the death \npenalty. At the Federal level, I call on the President and the Attorney \nGeneral to suspend executions until the Federal government reviews the \nadministration of the Federal death penalty.\n  Are we certain that the Federal death penalty is being applied in a \nfair, just and unbiased manner? Are we certain that the Federal death \npenalty is sought against defendants free of even a hint of racial \nbias? Are we certain that the Federal death penalty is sought evenly \nfrom U.S. Attorney district to U.S. Attorney district across the \nNation? I don't think we have a clear answer to these questions. Yet, \nthese are questions, literally, of life or death.\n  There isn't room for even a simple mistake when it comes to the \nultimate punishment, the death penalty. For a nation that holds itself \nto principles of justice, equality and due process, the Federal \ngovernment should not be in the business of punishing by killing. As \nGovernor Ryan's spokesperson aptly noted, ``It's really not about \npolitics. How could anyone be opposed to this when the system is so \nclearly flawed?''\n  Let us not let one more innocent person be condemned to die. Let us \ndemand reform.\n  In a moment, I intend to offer an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Nothing in this section shall prohibit the \n     enforcement of any written agreement to settle by arbitration \n     a controversy arising out of a consumer credit contract, if \n     such written agreement has been entered into by the parties \n     to the consumer credit contract after the controversy has \n     arisen.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \nto the bankruptcy reform bill that will protect and preserve the \nAmerican consumers' right to take their disputes with creditors to \ncourt. There is a troubling trend among credit card companies and \nconsumer credit lenders of requiring customers to use binding \narbitration when a dispute arises. Under this system, the consumer is \nbarred from taking a dispute to court, even a small claims court.\n  While arbitration can certainly be an efficient tool to settle \nclaims, it is credible and effective only when customers and consumers \nenter into it knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Unfortunately, \nthat is not what is happening in the credit card and consumer credit \nlending business. One of the most fundamental principles of our civil \njustice system is each American's right to take a dispute to court. In \nfact, each of us has a right in civil and criminal cases to a trial by \njury. A right to a jury trial in criminal cases is contained in the \nsixth amendment to the Constitution. The right to a jury trial in a \ncivil case is contained in the seventh amendment, which provides, ``In \nsuits at common law where the value and controversy shall exceed $20, \nthe right of trial by jury shall be preserved.''\n  It has been argued that Americans are overusing the courts. Court \ndockets across the country are said to be congested with civil cases. \nIn response to these concerns, various ways to resolve disputes, other \nthan taking a dispute to court, have been developed. Alternatives to \nlitigating in a court of law are collectively known as ``alternative \ndispute resolution,'' or ADR. Alternative dispute resolution includes \nmediation and arbitration. Mediation and arbitration can resolve \ndisputes in an efficient manner because the parties can have their \ncases heard well before they would have received a trial date in a \ncourt. Mediation is conducted by a neutral third party, the mediator, \nwho meets with the opposing parties to help them find a mutually \nsatisfactory solution. Unlike a judge in a courtroom, the mediator has \nno independent power to impose a solution. No formal rules of evidence \nor procedure control mediation. The mediator and the parties mutually \nagree on how to proceed.\n  In contrast, arbitration involves one or more third parties--an \narbitrator or arbitration panel. Unlike mediation but similar to a \ncourt proceeding, the arbitrator issues a decision after reviewing the \nmerits of the case as presented by all parties. Arbitration uses rules \nof evidence and procedure, although it may use rules that are simpler \nor more flexible than the evidentiary and procedural rules that a party \nwould follow or be subjected to in a court proceeding. And arbitration \ncan be either binding or nonbinding.\n  Nonbinding arbitration means the decision issued by the arbitrator or \narbitration panel takes effect only if the parties agree to it after \nthey know what the decision is.\n  In binding arbitration, parties agree in advance to accept and abide \nby the decision, whatever it is. In addition, there is a practice of \ninserting arbitration clauses in contracts to require arbitration as \nthe forum to resolve disputes before a dispute has even arisen.\n  Now, this is called mandatory arbitration. This means that if there \nis a dispute, the complaining party cannot file suit in court, and \ninstead is required to pursue arbitration. It is binding, mandatory \narbitration, and it therefore means that under the contract the parties \nmust use arbitration\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nto resolve a future disagreement, and the decision of the arbitration \npanel is final. The parties have no ability to seek relief in court or \nthrough mediation. In fact, if they are not satisfied with the \narbitration outcome, they are probably stuck with the decision. Even if \na party believes the arbitrator did not consider all the facts or \nfollow the law, the party cannot file a lawsuit in court. A basis to \nchallenge a binding arbitration decision exists only where there is \nreason to believe the arbitrator committed actual fraud, which is a \npretty unlikely scenario.\n  In contrast, if a dispute is resolved by a court, the parties can \npotentially pursue an appeal of the lower court's decision.\n  Madam President, because binding mandatory arbitration is so \nconclusive, this form of arbitration can be a credible means of dispute \nresolution only when all parties know and understand the full \nramifications of agreeing to it. I am afraid that is not what is \nhappening in our Nation's business climate and economy in a variety of \ncontexts ranging from motor vehicle franchise agreements, to employment \nagreements, to credit card agreements. I am proud to have sponsored \nlegislation addressing employment agreements and motor vehicle \nfranchise agreements. In fact, I am the original cosponsor, with my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, the manager of the \nbankruptcy reform bill, of S. 1020, which would prohibit the unilateral \nimposition of binding, mandatory arbitration in motor vehicle \ndealership agreements with manufacturers. Many of our colleagues have \njoined us as cosponsors.\n\n  Similar to the problem in the motor vehicle dealership context, there \nis a growing, menacing trend of credit card companies and consumer \ncredit lenders inserting binding, mandatory arbitration clauses in \nagreements with consumers. Companies such as First USA Bank, American \nExpress, and Green Tree Discount Company unilaterally insert binding \nmandatory arbitration clauses in their agreements with consumers, often \nwithout the consumers' knowledge or consent.\n  The most common way the credit card companies have done so is often \nthrough the use of a ``bill stuffer.'' Bill stuffers are the \nadvertisements and other materials that credit card companies insert in \nenvelopes with the customers' monthly statements. Some credit card \nissuers such as American Express have placed fine-print, mandatory \narbitration clauses on bill stuffers. Let's take a look at what I am \ntalking about.\n  I have in my hand a monthly statement mailing from American Express. \nLet's look inside.\n  First, we have the return envelope to pay your bill. And look at what \nis on the envelope. They have attached an advertisement.\n  So before you can mail your payment, you have to tear this \nadvertisement off the back of the envelope. Otherwise you won't be able \nto seal it shut.\n  Then, if you look at what else is in the envelope, here is the \nmonthly statement. It is a multipage printed form, front and back.\n  On this occasion, even though there was very little activity on this \nparticular account--one charge and one credit--the statement is six \npages long. The first page contains information about how much you owe \nAmerican Express, charges made, payments received, finance charges \napplied, and so on. The reverse side of the first page also contains \nsome fine print information about the account.\n  Then, if you look at pages 3 and 4 they contain additional fine-print \ninformation about the account; for example, what to do if your card is \nstolen or lost, and a summary of your billing rights.\n  If you keep reading at this point, you look at pages 5 and 6. They \nare chock full of advertising material. Target stores urge you to shop \nwith them. The State of North Carolina encourages you to plan your next \nholiday in North Carolina.\n  This past spring, in addition to an American Express cardholder being \nbombarded with all of this information, American Express cardholders \nalso received this--For Your Information, ``FYI, A Summary of Changes \nto Agreements and Benefits.'' The summary is 10 pages long.\n  In addition to the multipage statement of charges, terms, and \nadvertising material, the cardholder received another multipage \ndocument with fine-print terms and conditions.\n  If my colleagues are like me and most Americans, I review the \nstatement of charges for accuracy, look at how much I owe, rip off the \nbottom portion, stick it and my check in the return envelope, and mail \nit to American Express. I don't spend a lot of time reading all of the \nfine-print information about the account or the ad. I certainly would \nnot spend time reading a 10-page summary of changes to my statement. At \nmost, I might scan these other pages and bill stuffers, but I would not \nspend time reading them in detail.\n  Let's look at the summary of changes. As I said, it is called, ``FYI, \nA Summary of Changes to Agreements and Benefits.'' When you look at \ntheir summary, there are two things that hit you: The cartoon in the \nmiddle and the big letters, ``FYI'' in the upper left side of the first \npage. FYI, for your information, to me and most Americans means that it \ncontains some information that may be of interest to me but nothing \nthat requires serious thought or action from me. In reality, however, \nthe summary of changes is a complex, fine-print document that almost \nreads like a legal document. It talks about changes to various \nprivileges of the American Express card membership, American Express \nPurchase Protection Plan, Buyer's Assurance Plan, Car Rental Loss and \nDamage Insurance Plan, and Credit Protection Plan.\n\n  In addition, the summary contains an arbitration provision on page 2. \nEven though the document contains changes to the terms of the agreement \nwith the cardholder--it actually changes the contract between the \nparties--it is simply labeled as an FYI, for your information, \ndocument. I find that troubling.\n  If we take a closer look at the arbitration provision, this \narbitration provision is in condensed, fine print, to say the least. It \nis not exactly easy to read, even though this is an enlarged version of \nthe original. The key clause in this arbitration provision is the \nfollowing:\n\n       If arbitration is chosen by any party with respect to a \n     claim, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate \n     that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim.\n\n  I will repeat that.\n  If the cardholder has a dispute with American Express, the cardholder \ncannot take the claim to court or have a jury trial on the claim. This \nprovision took effect on June 1 of last year. So if you are an American \nExpress cardholder and you have a dispute with American Express, as of \nJune 1999, you can't take your claim to court--even small claims court. \nYou are bound to use arbitration, and you are bound to live with the \nfinal arbitration decision.\n  In this case, you are also bound to use an arbitration organization \nselected by American Express, the National Arbitration Forum.\n  Unfortunately, American Express isn't the only credit card company \nimposing mandatory arbitration on its customers. First USA Bank, the \nlargest issuer of Visa cards, with 58 million customers, has been doing \nthe same thing since 1997.\n  Here is the bill stuffer distributed by First USA. This is the inside \nof a folded, one-page insert. As you can see, similar to the American \nExpress summary, this is another fine-print, condensed set of terms and \nconditions. It covers a wide variety of topics, including information \non finance charges, termination and foreign currency transactions. Here \nin the last column are the three paragraphs on the arbitration \nprovision. The language is similar to the American Express language and \nstates that the cardholders' dispute will be resolved by arbitration. \nThe cardholder will not be able to go to a court to resolve the claim. \nNo ``if's,'' ``and's,'' or ``but's'' about it. Just plain and simple. \nThe cardholder, by virtue of continuing to simply use the First USA \ncard, gives up the right to go to court, even small claims court, to \nresolve the dispute.\n  Unfortunately, this problem also extends beyond credit cards. It is \nalso a growing practice in the consumer loan industry. Consumer credit \nlenders such as Green Tree Consumer Discount\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\nCompany are inserting mandatory arbitration clauses in their loan \nagreement. The problem is these loan agreements are usually adhesion \ncontracts, which means that the consumer must either sign the agreement \nas is or forego a loan.\n  In other words, the consumer lacks the bargaining power to have the \nclause removed. More importantly, when signing on the dotted line of \nthe loan agreement, the consumer may not even understand what mandatory \narbitration means. The consumer in all likelihood does not understand \nthat he or she has written away his or her right to go to court to \nresolve a dispute with the lender.\n  Arbitration in some ways, of course, is an efficient way to settle \ndisputes. But it has to be entered into knowingly and voluntarily. That \nis not what is happening in either the consumer loan or credit card \nindustries.\n  You might say that if consumers are not pleased with being subjected \nto a mandatory arbitration clause, consumers can cancel their credit \ncard, or not execute on their loan agreement, and they can take their \nbusiness elsewhere. Unfortunately, that is easier said than done. As I \nmentioned, First USA Bank, the Nation's largest Visa card issuer, is \npart of this questionable practice. In fact, the practice is becoming \nso pervasive that consumers may soon no longer have an alternative \nunless they forego use of a credit card or a consumer loan entirely. I \nthink that is kind of a hefty price to pay to retain the longstanding \nright to go to court.\n  In my opinion, this is a decision that consumers should not be forced \nto make. Companies such as First USA, American Express, and Green Tree \nargue that they rely on mandatory arbitration to resolve disputes \nfaster and cheaper than court litigation. The claim may be resolved \nfaster, but is it really cheaper? Is it as fair as a court of law? I \ndon't think so.\n  Arbitration organizations can charge exorbitant fees to the consumer \nwho brings a dispute--often an initial filing fee plus hourly fees to \nthe arbitrator or arbitrators involved in the case. These costs to \nconsumers can be higher than bringing the matter to small claims court \nand paying a court filing fee.\n  For example, the National Arbitration Forum, the arbitration entity \nof choice for American Express and First USA, the National Arbitration \nForum charges fees that are likely greater than if the consumer brought \na dispute in small claims court. For a claim of less than $1,000, the \nNational Arbitration Forum charges the consumer a $49 filing fee. In \ncontrast, the consumer could have brought the same claim, in small \nclaims court here in the District of Columbia and would have paid a fee \nof no more than $10. In other words, the consumer pays a fee to the \nNational Arbitration Forum that is nearly five times more than the fee \nfor filing a claim with small claims court.\n\n  That is bad enough, but the National Arbitration Forum's competitors \nare even worse. The American Arbitration Association charges a $500 \nfiling fee for claims of less than $10,000, or more if the claim \nexceeds $10,000, and a minimum filing fee of $2,000 if the case \ninvolves three or more arbitrators. In addition to the filing fee, they \nalso charge a hearing fee for holding hearings other than the initial \nhearing--$150 to be paid by each party for each day of hearings before \na single arbitrator, for $250 if the hearing is held before an \narbitration panel. The International Chamber of Commerce requires a \n$2,500 administrative fee plus an arbitrator's fee of at least $2,500, \nif the claim is less than $50,000. These fees are greater if the claim \nexceeds $50,000. This $5,000 or more fee could very well be greater \nthan the consumer's entire claim. So, as you can see, the consumer's \ndispute is not resolved more efficiently with arbitration. It is \nresolved either at greater cost to the consumer or not at all, if the \nconsumer cannot afford the costs, or the costs outweigh the amount in \ndispute.\n  The unilateral imposition of mandatory arbitration also raises \nfairness concerns. As I demonstrated earlier, typical cardholders are \nnot likely to ever notice the arbitration provision. But even if they \nnotice the provision and read the fine print, consumers nevertheless \nmay not understand that their right to court has just been stripped \naway. So, what we have here is a small number of people who will \nactually read the bill stuffer and an even smaller number who will \nunderstand what it means.\n\n  Another problem with mandatory, binding arbitration is that the \nlender gets to decide in advance who the arbitrator will be. In the \ncase of American Express and First USA, they have chosen the National \nArbitration Forum. All credit card disputes with consumers involving \nAmerican Express or First USA are handled by them. What does this mean? \nIf you think about it, the arbitrator has a financial interest in \nreaching an outcome that favors the credit card company. If the \nNational Arbitration Forum develops a pattern of reaching decisions \nthat favor the cardholder, wouldn't American Express or First USA \nstrongly consider taking their arbitration business elsewhere? I think \nthere is a very good chance, I would say there is a significant chance \nthat would happen.\n  There has been one important ruling on the enforceability of \nmandatory arbitration provisions in credit card agreements. That ruling \ninvolved a mandatory arbitration provision announced in mailings to \nBank of America credit card and deposit account holders. In a 1998 \ndecision by the California Court of Appeals, which the California \nSupreme Court refused to review, the court ruled that the mandatory \narbitration clauses unilaterally imposed on the Bank's customers were \ninvalid and unenforceable. As a result of that decision, credit card \ncompanies in California cannot impose mandatory arbitration in their \ndisputes with customers. In fact, the American Express notice \nrecognizes this fact and notes here at the bottom that the provision \nwill not apply to California residents until further notice from the \ncompany. I think that was a wise, well-reasoned decision by the \nCalifornia appellate court, but Americans have no assurance that all \ncourts will reach the same fair and reasonable decision.\n  My amendment extends the wisdom of the California appellate decision \nto every credit cardholder and consumer loan borrower in the country. \nIt amends the Federal Arbitration Act to prohibit the unilateral \nimposition of mandatory, binding arbitration in consumer credit \ntransactions. Let me be clear. I believe that arbitration can be an \nefficient way to settle disputes. I agree we ought to encourage \nalternative dispute resolution. But I also believe that arbitration is \na fair way to settle disputes only when it is entered into knowingly \nand voluntarily by both parties to the dispute. My amendment does not \nprohibit arbitration of consumer credit transactions when entered into \nvoluntarily and knowingly. It merely prohibits binding, mandatory \narbitration imposed unilaterally without the consumer's knowledgeable \nand/or voluntary consent.\n\n  Credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly \nslamming the courthouse doors shut on consumers, often unbeknownst to \nthem. This is grossly unjust. Let's restore fairness to the resolution \nof consumer credit disputes.\n  At some point I hope that my colleagues will join me in keeping the \ndoors to the courthouse open to all American credit card users and \nconsumer credit borrowers. At this time, however, I will not push for a \nvote on this issue. I have agreed to withdraw this amendment with the \nunderstanding from my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, the manager \nof this bill and the chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, that the issue of mandatory \narbitration in consumer credit agreements will be part of a hearing to \nbe held in the Courts Subcommittee on March 1. That hearing will \naddress the Federal Arbitration Act and the problem of mandatory \narbitration clauses inserted in contracts unilaterally. I appreciate \nSenator Grassley's leadership and cooperation in reaching this \naccommodation. I look forward to working with him on this issue, as \nwell as the broader issue of the growing, problematic trend of the \nunilateral imposition of mandatory arbitration in a variety of \ncontracts.\n  I admire the leadership of the Senator on the overall issue in \naddition to the fact it has come up and is a serious problem in the \nconsumer credit agreement area.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\n                      Amendment No. 2747 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I withdraw the amendment and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have had a chance to discuss this \nissue with the Senator from Wisconsin over a long period of time, both \nat the subcommittee level, the committee level, and during floor action \non this bill which has been going on now since last October, with a \nlong interim for a holiday break.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Wisconsin is trying to do. We have \njoined together on a bill dealing with one aspect of this problem and \nthat happens to be a bill which deals with arbitration in the \nautomobile industry. As the lead Member of the Senate on alternative \ndispute resolution issues, I certainly do not want alternative dispute \nresolution to be used in unfair ways. So following up on the request of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin that if we could make some sort of \narrangement for his not offering his amendment at this time--and he has \nwithdrawn it--I have scheduled a hearing in my judiciary subcommittee \non our bill. I hope to air some of these other problems the Senator has \nraised.\n  I do have a great deal of sympathy for what the Senator from \nWisconsin is attempting, but I think more groundwork needs to be done \nso we all have a better understanding of these issues before moving \nahead at this time.\n  The bottom line, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin--and I hope he \nwill answer yes or no--is that I wish to make sure he is working with \nus between now and our hearing so every commitment I have made in \nregard to his offering or not offering his arbitration amendment to \nthis bill at this time is to his satisfaction.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, it is very much to my satisfaction. I \nam delighted to know we are going to look at a variety of contexts at \nthis hearing, including this one with the credit card companies but \nalso the one my colleague and I have had so much interest in regarding \nmotor vehicles and also the employment discrimination area. To me, \nalthough I would be pleased to have this amendment on this bill, I \nthink that is a good opportunity to point out the overall problem we \nhave had, what my colleague described as the possibility arbitration \nwould be used in a way that neither of us would like, that it would \nsomehow become a method of unfairness instead of what we both hope, \nwhich is a way to resolve disputes more efficiently or economically, \nsometimes, than when you go to court. I think it is an excellent idea.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman in preparation for the \nhearing. I think it is a good way to work out all these issues, and, \nagain, I thank the Senator from Iowa for being very easy to work with \non this and being very serious about getting something done.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I express my appreciation to the \nmanagers of the bankruptcy bill, Senators Leahy, Torricelli, Grassley, \nand Hatch, for accepting and including an amendment I had planned to \noffer on the floor as part of the managers' amendment to S. 625. My \namendment requires that a simple yet important disclosure be made on \ncredit card bills to help protect consumers.\n  During the bankruptcy reform debate in the last Congress, the Senate \nexamined whether the increased rate of consumer bankruptcies in the \nNation resulted solely from consumers' access to an excessively \npermissive bankruptcy process, or whether other factors also \ncontributed to this increase. Ultimately we concluded that the record \nincrease in bankruptcy filings across the nation was due not only to \nthe ease with which one can enter the bankruptcy system, but also to \nthe unparalleled levels of consumer debt--especially credit card debt--\nbeing run up across the country. As Senator Durbin noted, and as the \nCBO, FDIC, and numerous economists have found, the rate of increase in \nbankruptcy filings paralleled the rate of increase in consumer debt.\n  This is not a coincidence. Rather, increased bankruptcies proceed \ndirectly from the fact that Americans are bombarded daily by credit \ncard solicitations that promise easy access to credit without informing \ntheir targets of the implications of signing up for such credit.\n  During our debate in the last Congress, the Senate also concluded \nthat irresponsible borrowing could be reduced, and many bankruptcies \naverted, if Americans were provided with some basic information in \ntheir credit card materials regarding the consequences of assuming \ngreater debt. A consensus emerged that credit card companies have some \naffirmative obligation to provide such information to consumers in \ntheir solicitations, monthly statements, and purchasing materials, in \nlight of their aggressive pursuit of less and less knowledgeable \nborrowers.\n  As a result of this consensus, the Senate's bankruptcy bill in the \nlast Congress--S. 1301--contained several provisions in the managers' \namendment addressing credit card debt, and requiring specific \ndisclosures by credit card companies in their payment and solicitation \nmaterials. These provisions, which I sponsored along with Senators Dodd \nand Durbin, were vital to the Senate's success in adopting balanced \nbankruptcy reform legislation by the overwhelming margin of 97-1.\n  Unfortunately, the House-Senate conference committee struck these \ndisclosure provisions from its final conference report, leaving the \nbankruptcy bill again a one-sided document that failed to account for \nthe role credit card companies play in the accumulation of credit card \ndebt and in increased consumer bankruptcy rates. As a result of the \nconference committee's actions, the conference report died in the \nwaning days of the 105th Congress.\n  As we again debate bankruptcy legislation, it remains my firm belief \nthat Congress must address both sides of the consumer bankruptcy \nequation--both the flaws in the bankruptcy system that make it easy for \npeople to declare bankruptcy even if they have the ability to pay their \ndebts, and the lending practices that encourage people with limited \nfinancial resources to accumulate debts that are beyond their ability \nto repay.\n  Last year, the Senate adopted an amendment to S. 625 that requires \ncredit card issuers to give customers on their billing statements three \ndisclosures: (1) warning that paying just the minimum monthly amount \nwill increase the interest they pay and the time it takes to repay \ntheir balances; (2) a generic example; and (3) a toll-free number a \ncustomer can call for an estimate of how long he or she has to pay the \nminimum payment and the total payment to pay off his balance. However, \nthe amendment contained an exception for certain credit card issuers \nthat provide actual, instead of estimated, payment information. Such a \ncredit card issuer would not have to disclose the warning, an example, \nor even the telephone number. This situation subverted the purpose of \nthis section and distorted the balance contained in the original \namendment.\n  My amendment would restore this balance by requiring some disclosures \nto be given by certain credit card issuers that have a toll-free number \nfor informing customers of the actual number of months it takes to \nrepay outstanding balances using minimum monthly payments requirement. \nIt requires such credit card issuers to make two disclosures: (1) the \ntelephone number and (2) a warning. My amendment requires the credit \ncard bill to contain the statement, ``Minimum Payment Warning: Making \nonly the minimum payment will increase the interest you pay and the \ntime it takes to repay your balance. For more information, call this \ntoll-free number: __________.''\n  If we are going to make it harder for individuals to file for \nbankruptcy, we need to make certain that they are informed about their \ncredit decisions. The minimal warning contained in my amendment helps \ncredit card customers who pay the minimum monthly amount on their \ncredit card bills better understand how long it will take and how much \nthey will pay to work off the balance. The Financial Literacy Center \nhas calculated that a consumer who, for example, has a $5,000 loan \nbalance outstanding on which 17% interest is charged and who is paying \n2% of the balance each month, will take 50 years to pay off the entire \nloan and end up paying $33,447. That is a very long time and a \nsignificant burden that, with the disclosures in my amendment, debtors \nwill be able to better appreciate.\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\n  My amendment helps consumers get important information that will \nenable them to analyze how to manage their credit card borrowing more \neffectively.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S144-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Madam President, as we come to the end of the first month \nof the new millennium, I want to make a few remarks about the great \npromise of biotechnology in benefitting the American public. In fact, \nJanuary 2000 has been very appropriately designated as Biotechnology \nMonth.\n  In my view, this first century of the new millennium will be \nremembered by historians for revolutionary advances in biomedical \nresearch. It is fitting that in the next few months scientists will \ncomplete the mapping of the human genome--the basic blueprint of the \nstructure of human beings. This event ranks very high in the \ntechnological achievements of mankind.\n  It is also noteworthy that this task required the confluence of some \nof the best minds in the medical sciences and computer technology. \nFrankly, the mapping of the human genome simply would not have been \npossible at this time absent the development of the low-cost, high-\nspeed computers that have been available to scientists in recent years. \nOver the next few decades perhaps no more valuable cargo will travel \ndown the information highway of the Internet than the gene maps.\n  This new knowledge will not sit idly in digital databases. For once \nthe detailed genetic structure is known and accessible, researchers \nwill be better able to understand the function of individual genes and \ncomplex interactions among collections of genes. Once both structure \nand function are ascertained, diagnostic tools, therapeutic agents and \npreventives such as vaccines can be more easily developed. It is the \nAmerican public who stands to benefit most from this new knowledge and \nproducts.\n  It would be difficult to underestimate the effect that biotechnology \nwill have on health care delivery and, more to the point, on the health \nstatus of the American public and our neighbors throughout the world. \nIn the area of cancer, for example, we are positioned to make \nsubstantial gains in knowledge that will make traditional treatments \nobsolete. I am pleased that the University of Utah and Myriad Genetics, \na small Salt Lake City biotech firm, are at the forefront of the battle \nagainst breast cancer. Their work on the BRCA-I gene has contributed \nsubstantially to our understanding of how this terrible disease is \ntriggered genetically. All of us wish success to these Utah scientists \nand their colleagues throughout the world in their efforts to curtail \nbreast cancer.\n  Advances in biotechnology will also emanate from the medical device \nindustry. For example, Paradigm Medical Industries, another Salt Lake \nCity firm, is refining existing laser technology in order to develop a \nnew ``cold'' laser that promises to reduce the adverse reactions rate \nassociated with cataract surgery. While I may not be expert in all the \nscientific underpinnings of this new photon phacoemulsification system, \nI can say that since over 3 million cataract procedures are performed \nannually it is in the interest of the public to cut down on the current \ncorneal burn rate of about 1,000 per day.\n  As a representative of the people of Utah, I am proud to report that \nmy state is home to over 120 companies in the biosciences. These firms \nemploy over 11,000 Utahns and an additional 2,500 individuals outside \nof Utah. Total annual revenues of these Utah bioscience firms is in \nexcess of $1.6 billion. The aggregate estimated market value of these \nfirms exceeds $8 billion.\n  The success of Utah in the exciting arena of biotechnology has been \nfacilitated by the efforts the Utah Life Science Association--ULSA--and \nthe State of Utah's Division of Business and Economic Development. I \nmust commend the leadership of Governor Leavitt and Brian Moss of ULSA \nfor their tireless efforts to promote the expansion of Utah's \nbiotechnology sector.\n  Utah is certainly not alone in its activity in biotechnology. \nNationally, there are over 1300 biotech companies. Collectively, these \nfirms employ over 150,000 people. The biotechnology industry accounts \nfor over $10 billion in research and discovery activities annually and \nrevenues of over $18 billion.\n  Frankly, despite this impressive record of success, we have only \nscratched the surface of the future promise of this industry. About 90 \nbiotechnology products have been approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. More telling of the growing strength of this industry \nis the fact that over 350 biotechnology products are in late stage \nclinical trials. As these products move to the FDA approval stage, it \nseems foreseeable that in the next few years this research intensive \nsector, which recorded a net loss of $5 billion in 1998, will move into \nand stay in the black.\n  As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and as a Senator with a long \ntime interest in health care, I can assure my colleagues that I will do \nall in my power to ensure that our intellectual property laws are \nstructured in a way to help assure that the promising work in \nbiotechnology laboratories can be delivered to the bedside of American \npatients in a fair and expeditious manner. To meet the goal of \ndelivering new therapies to the patients, we must also work to ensure \nthat the FDA regulatory system promptly and consistently renders \njudgments based on science and that the laws affecting international \ntrade do not result in unnecessary barriers to delivering these new \nbreakthroughs worldwide.\n  In closing, I think it only fitting that the Senate has taken special \nnote of the almost limitless frontier of biotechnology at the dawn of a \nnew century and new millennium.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today in commemoration of \nJanuary 2000, as National Biotechnology Month. In November, the Senate \npassed a resolution designating January 2000 as National Biotechnology \nMonth.\n  Biotechnology is changing the face of medicine. The United States \nleads the world in biotechnology innovation. Approximately 1,300 \nbiotech companies in this country employ more than 150,000 people. \nBiotech companies are on the cutting edge--working to develop \ninnovative life-saving drugs and vaccines. The industry spent nearly \n$10 billion on research and development in 1998 while revenues totaled \n$18.4 billion. Product sales topped $13 billion. The industry recorded \na net loss of $5 billion.\n  I'm proud that Maryland is home to over 200 biotechnology companies. \nCompanies in Maryland are working to map the human genome and develop \ndrugs to treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Disease, and diabetes. \nBiotechnology has grown in Maryland, in part because Maryland is a \nplace for great medical innovations. Maryland is home to the ``golden \ntriangle''--private sector biotech companies, federal research \nlaboratories, and universities. Maryland houses the National Institutes \nof Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), other federal \nlabs, outstanding academic research institutions such as Johns Hopkins \nUniversity and the University of Maryland, and a growing number of \nbiotech companies. The combination of these public and private sector \nentities creates a unique environment for research and new ideas to \nflourish.\n  Biotech companies will likely have an increasingly important role in \nproviding medicines in the 21st century. The number of biotechnology \ndrug approvals is increasing. More than 350 biotechnology medicines are \nalready in late-stage clinical trials for heart ailments, cancer, and \nneurological diseases and infections. Some of these drugs will likely \nlead the way to improved health and well-being for millions of \nAmericans. I salute the biotechnology companies in Maryland and across \nthe country as they work to improve the lives of patients everywhere.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague Senator Harry Reid, and Senators Ashcroft, Bennett, Breaux, \nCrapo, Grassley, Murray, Roberts, Robb, and Sarbanes to recognize \nJanuary 2000 as National Biotechnology Month.\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\n  It is fitting that in the first month of this new year, at the start \nof a new century, we look to biotechnology as our greatest hope for the \nfuture.\n  Mapping the human genome, for example, is ahead of schedule and \nnearly complete. That achievement, begun 10 years ago, will rank as one \nof the most significant advances in health care by accelerating the \nbiotechnology industry's discovery of new therapies and cures for our \nmost life-threatening diseases.\n  Biotechnology not only is using genetic research to create new \nmedicines, but also to improve agriculture, industrial manufacturing \nand environmental management.\n  The United States leads the world in biotechnology innovation. There \nare approximately 1,300 biotech companies in the United States, \nemploying more than 150,000 people. The industry spent nearly $10 \nbillion on research and development in 1998. Although revenues totaled \n$18.4 billion, the industry recorded a net loss of $5 billion because \nof the expensive nature of drug development.\n  In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved more \nthan 20 biotechnology drugs, vaccines and new indications for existing \nmedicines, pushing the number of marketed biotech drugs and vaccines to \nmore than 90. Total FDA biotech approvals from 1982 through 1999 reach \nmore than 140 when adding clearances for new indications of existing \nmedicines. The vast majority of new biotech drugs were approved in the \nsecond half of the 1990s, demonstrating the biotechnology industry's \nsurging proficiency at finding new medicines to treat our most life-\nthreatening illnesses.\n  Biotechnology is revolutionizing every facet of medicine from \ndiagnosis to treatment of all diseases. It is detailing life at the \nmolecular level and someday will take much of the guesswork out of \ndisease management and treatment. The implications for health care are \nas great as any milestone in medical history. We expect to see great \nstrides early in this century.\n  A devastating disease that has stolen many of our loved ones, \nneighbors and friends is cancer. Biotechnology already has made \nsignificant strides in battling certain cancers. This is only the \nbeginning.\n  The first biotechnology cancer medicines have been used with surgery, \nchemotherapy and radiation to enhance their effectiveness, lessen \nadverse effects and reduce chances of cancer recurrence.\n  Newer biotech cancer drugs target the underlying molecular causes of \nthe disease. Biotech cancer treatments under development, such as \nvaccines that prevent abnormal cell growth, may make traditional \ntreatments obsolete. In addition, gene therapy is being studied as a \nway to battle cancer by starving tumor cells to death.\n  Many biotech drugs are designed to treat our most devastating and \nintractable illnesses. In many cases these medicines are the first ever \ntherapies for those diseases. For example, advancements in research \nhave yielded first-of-a-kind drugs to treat multiple sclerosis and \nrheumatoid arthritis as well as cancer.\n  Other medicines in clinical trials block the start of the molecular \ncascade that triggers inflammation's tissue damaging effects in \nnumerous disease states. In diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's \nand Huntington's, clinical trials are under way to test a variety of \ncell therapies that generate healthy neurons to replace deteriorated \nones. Recent breakthroughs in stem cell research have prompted experts \nto predict cures within 10 years for some diseases, such as Type I \n(Juvenile) Diabetes and Parkinson's.\n  With more than 350 biotechnology medicines in late-stage clinical \ntrials for illnesses, such as heart ailments, cancer, neurological \ndiseases and infections, biotechnology innovation will be the \nfoundation not only for improving our health and quality of life, but \nalso lowering health care costs.\n  In the past 2 years Congress has increased funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health's basic research programs by 15 percent per year. \nWe are 40 percent of the way toward doubling the NIH budget. Health-\ncare research, however, is not one-sided. The public funds we provide \nare for basic research. The private sector takes this basic science and \nthen spends many times more than what the government has contributed to \ncreate new drugs and get them to patients. In today's world, \nbiotechnology companies are among the greatest innovators and risk \ntakers.\n  Biotechnology also is being used to improve agriculture, industrial \nmanufacturing and environmental management. In manufacturing, the \nemphasis has shifted from the removal of toxic chemicals in production \nwaste streams to replacement of those pollutants with biological \nprocesses that prevent the environment from being fouled. And because \nthese biological processes are derived from renewable sources they also \nconserve a traditional energy resource. Industrial biotechnology \ncompanies are the innovators commercializing clean technologies and \ntheir progress is accelerating at an astonishing rate.\n  In agricultural biotechnology, crops on the market have been modified \nto protect them from insect damage thus reducing pesticide use. Biotech \ncrops that are herbicide tolerant enable farmers to control weeds \nwithout damaging the crops. This allows farmers flexibility in weed \nmanagement and promotes conservation tillage. Other biotech crops are \nprotected against viral disease with the plant equivalent of a vaccine.\n  The number of acres worldwide planted with biotech crops soared from \n4.3 million in 1996 to 100 million in 1999, of which 81 million acres \nwere planted in the United States and Canada. Acceptance of these crops \nby farmers is one indication of the benefits they have for reducing \nfarming costs and use of pesticides while increasing crop yields.\n  Biotech crops in development include foods that will offer increased \nlevels of nutrients and vitamins. Benefits range from helping \ndeveloping nations meet basic dietary requirements to creating disease-\nfighting and health-promoting foods.\n  Biotechnology is improving the lives of those in the U.S. and abroad. \nThe designation of January 2000 as National Biotechnology Month is an \nindication to our constituents and their children that Congress \nrecognizes the value and the promise of this technology. Biotechnology \nis a big word that means hope.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my Senate \ncolleagues in recognizing January as National Biotechnology Month. At \nthe dawn of this new century, it is fitting for us to recognize the \npromise and potential of biotechnology.\n  With the mapping of the human genome, we are on the brink of critical \nadvances in health care and medical discovery. These advances can \nbecome new cures and new treatments, new industrial products, and \nimproved agricultural products. Biotechnology is changing medical \npractice from the way diseases are diagnosed to the way they are \ntreated. By helping us to understand life at the molecular level, \nbiotechnology can help eliminate the guesswork of disease management \nand treatment.\n  Biotechnology researchers have already made dramatic strides in \nconfronting some of our most devastating and tragic diseases, from \ncancer to multiple sclerosis to Alzheimers. Recent breakthroughs in \nhuman embryonic stem cell research have given us cause to predict cures \nfor diseases such as Parkinsons, juvenile diabetes and spinal cord \ninjury.\n  As Ranking Member of the Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations subcommittee, I have been a long-time advocate \nfor health research. Last year, Arlen Specter and I took the lead in \nproviding the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a $2.3 billion \nincrease, the largest in NIH history, bringing the agency's overall \nbudget to $17.9 billion. This year, we plan to introduce a resolution \ncalling for a $2.7 billion increase--keeping our commitment to double \nNIH funding over five years.\n  NIH provides funding for the basic science that underpins the \nimportant research and development done by the biotechnology industry. \nThis strong public-private partnership has made our country the world \nleader in the area of biotechnology innovation. There are approximately \n1300 biotech companies in the United States, employing more than \n150,000 people. In my own state of Iowa, we have approximately 180 \ncompanies, with more than\n\n[[Page S146]]\n\n10,000 employees. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved 22 \nbiotechnology drugs, vaccines and new indications for existing \nmedicines. We currently have more than 90 biotech drugs and vaccines on \nthe U.S. market. And I know this is only the beginning.\n  In addition to its medical applications, biotechnology offers many \nexciting possibilities in the field of agriculture as well. Through \nbiotechnology scientists are already developing new varieties and \nstrains of plants and animals that will help to solve myriad problems \nand challenges relating to agriculture. The results of advances in \nagricultural biotechnology, impressive as they already are, represent \nmerely the infancy of this promising scientific field.\n  The fact that over 800 million of our fellow citizens on this planet \nsuffer from hunger or undernourishment points to the tremendous \nchallenge we face to produce enough food for an ever growing \npopulation. As it has in the past, biotechnology will contribute \ntremendously to meeting that challenge, through increased yields and \nproduction, improved productive efficiency and enhanced suitability for \ndifficult environments. Developing new plant varieties that are more \ntolerant of drought or soil salinity would help to increase food \nproduction in areas of the world where people are now going hungry.\n  Biotechnology also promises to help solve environmental challenges in \nagriculture. For example, plants that are inherently resistant to \ndiseases or insects reduce the amount of pesticides that would \notherwise be applied and enter the environment. Biotechnology can also \nhelp to reduce the amount of tillage that is needed, thereby reducing \nenergy consumption and soil erosion.\n  Thus far biotechnology has been applied for the most part at the \nlevel of the farm, and has not been perceived by consumers as directly \nbenefitting them to a significant degree. That is about to change. We \nare already seeing the development of new strains of plants that have \nspecific traits to improve the nutritional quality of foods derived \nfrom them. Work at Iowa State University, for example, has developed \nsoybeans that produce a soybean oil with lower saturated fat than \nconventional soybeans. We are not far from having rice that contains \nVitamin A, which would alleviate a great deal of human suffering in \ndeveloping countries.\n  Perhaps the most fascinating area of biotechnology involves the \npotential for developing new crops and livestock designed to produce a \nvariety of raw materials and substances, likely to be of high value, \nfor use in very specific applications, including medicine. We can \nproduce from plants everything we now rely on petroleum to produce: \nenergy and industrial raw materials for a wide range of products. I \nbelieve there will be real economic opportunities for farmers in \nproducing these higher value crops and animals, and for rural \ncommunities in processing them.\n  To be sure, if agricultural biotechnology is to meet its potential, \nwe must ensure that all questions about its safety for consumers and \nfor the environment are fully answered. I believe that those questions \ncan and will be answered satisfactorily, using the best sound science \navailable.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as January 2000, National \nBiotechnology Month, comes to a close, I want to recognize the \nimportance of the biotechnology to the nation and to commend this \nindustry for its innovations in disease diagnosis, treatment, and \nprevention.\n  The United States is the leader in the biotechnology industry, and I \nam proud to say that California has the nation's largest concentration \nof health care technology companies. California, alone, is home to over \n2,500 biomedical companies and employs over 241,000 people in health \ncare technology and biomedical and clinical research fields. \nCalifornia's health care technology companies are producing leading \nedge products, for example, the first new therapy for cystic fibrosis \nin 30 years, Genetech; technology that enables doctors to do heart \nsurgery without opening the chest cavity, Heartport; a cancer drug that \nis genetically engineered and stimulates the bone marrow to produce \nimportant white blood cells, Amgen; linear accelerators for treating \ncancer, Varian; and intraocular eye lenses, Allergan.\n  Biotechnology has enabled us to reduce hospital stays, to detect \ncancer and other life-threatening illnesses earlier in order to begin \ntreatments earlier; to attack diseases cell by cell to eliminate \nunnecessary side effects, and to use vaccines to prevent abnormal cell \ngrowth. This is a critical time in biotechnology, as scientists \ncontinue to make strides in cellular and genetic research, and I am \nhopeful that this work will improve our health and well-being. I am \nconfident that as this industry continues to grow, we will see \ntreatments to greatly improve the lives of millions of Americans, and \nwe will see cures to illnesses that we did not think were possible.\n  I commend the more than 150,000 employees of the biotech industry \nnationwide and join them in observing January as National Biotechnology \nMonth.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of National \nBiotechnology Month. Biotechnology has produced drugs that hold the \npromise for many to live healthier lives. Biotechnology also holds \nenormous promise to make even more profound contributions to public \nhealth in the future.\n  For example, biotechnology strategies include the development of \ncancer vaccines as well as drugs that target specific cancer antigens \nto stimulate a patient's own immune system to kill tumor cells. There \nare so many other diseases that devastate families, like Alzheimers and \nheart disease, which biotechnology could be applied to successfully.\n  The Federal government has increased funding for basic scientific \nresearch. Private sector investments and small business development \nshould also be encouraged. As remarkable as some of its achievement so \nfar, biotechnology is only beginning. It is appropriate to begin the \n21st Century with National Biotechnology Month because biotechnology \nholds so much promise for medicine and improving the quality of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S146-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S146-S147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SUPER BOWL CHAMPION, ST. LOUIS RAMS\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, it is with great pride that I rise \ntoday with my distinguished colleagues to express my sincere \ncongratulations to the Super Bowl XXXIV Champion St. Louis Rams. In the \naftermath of a heart-stopping NFC division victory over the Tampa Bay \nBuccaneers and an outstanding regular season record of 13 wins and 3 \nlosses, the St. Louis Rams increased their intensity to win Super Bowl \nXXXIV, bringing home the most prized possession in the National \nFootball League, the Lombardi Trophy. In an extraordinary effort and \nshow of heart, the Rams countered the incredible second-half push by \nthe Tennessee Titans in a game that more than lived up to its billing \nof ``Super'' and made history on Sunday, January 30, 2000, by pulling \nout a thrilling victory by the score of 23-16, becoming the Super Bowl \nXXXIV Champions.\n  This was Coach Dick Vermeil's third year as head coach of the Rams. \nCoach Vermeil previously led the Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl \nin 1980, but had been away from coaching for almost 15 years. The \npassionate 63 year old coach showed he still had the stuff it takes to \nlead this team of stars to the championship. The fans of professional \nfootball have appropriately awarded Coach Vermeil by voting him the \nStaples Coach of the Year, the only NFL honor determined solely by a \nvote of the fans.\n  The three-year path to glory began slowly, with 9 wins and 23 losses \nover the previous two seasons, including just 4 victories last season, \nbut the team turned it around this year. While the Rams were truly a \nteam that played well together all year, this triumphant season can be \nattributed to the performance of several key players, including six \nplayers that were chosen to start in the Pro Bowl.\n  Kurt Warner, stepping in as the starter after Trent Green was injured \nin an early preseason game, enjoyed one of the best years ever for an \nNFL quarterback, throwing for 4,353 yards, 41 touchdowns and only 13 \ninterceptions, a performance worthy of being awarded the NFL's Most \nValuable Player and the Pro Bowl starting quarterback. This remarkable \nindividual, in just his second season in the NFL, was\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\nbagging groceries in Waterloo, Iowa, just five years ago. While setting \npassing and scoring records in the Arena Football League for 3 seasons \nand one season in the NFL Europe, he never gave up his dream of playing \nin the NFL. Last night, he helped to bring the dream of a Super Bowl \nchampionship home to St. Louis.\n  Marshall Faulk, one of the league's premier running backs, set an NFL \nrecord this season for combined rushing and receiving yards from the \nline of scrimmage in a single season with 2,429, in addition to scoring \n12 touchdowns. He was also chosen to start in the Pro Bowl.\n  All season long, the team benefitted from a stellar group of talented \nreceivers, led by Isaac Bruce, who will join his teammates in the Pro \nBowl; Torry Holt; Az-zahir Hakim; and Ricky Proehl. Proehl, you may \nremember, caught a clutch game-winning touchdown in the closing minutes \nof the Rams' win last week over the Tampa Bay Buccanneers, while Bruce \nmade a truly spectacular play in the fourth-quarter of the Super Bowl \nby catching a 73 yard touchdown pass that sealed the championship. \nThese stars helped the Rams to establish early on that they were an \noffensive-minded team, scoring a total of 526 points this season, the \nthird-most in NFL history.\n  But as the saying goes, ``Defense wins championships,'' and the Rams \nproved this adage, by leading the NFL in rushing defense, and ranking \nsixth in the league in overall defense. This season, the Rams' \ndefensive end, Kevin Carter, led the league with 17 quarterback sacks \nand earned his first start in the Pro Bowl. After only 5 years in the \nleague, this outstanding defender has developed a well-documented work \nethic that has helped him achieve more sacks over the past two seasons \nthan anyone else in the league.\n  We all know that to be champions requires a strong commitment to work \nharder and be more disciplined than the rest. The Rams' Super Bowl win \nis a credit to the extraordinary efforts by the entire Rams' \norganization. After moving to St. Louis in 1995, the management went to \nwork in hiring excellent personnel and a committed coaching staff. This \nseason, the organization's slogan was aptly and accurately versed: \n``Gotta go to work!'' With the whole organization working as one \ncohesive unit and regularly working well beyond the hours of 9 to 5, \nthey showed us just how much can be accomplished when everyone works \ntogether for a common goal and is committed to doing more than his or \nher fair share.\n  We would be remiss if we overlooked another admirable quality of this \nfine organization, and that is the commitment to the community. When \nthe Rams relocated to St. Louis in 1995, the team identified community \ninvolvement as one of the top priorities. Since that time, many \ncharitable organizations have benefitted from the time and resources of \nthese big-hearted athletes, as various Rams players have \ndedicated dollars for every touchdown, interception, field goal, sack \nand more. Some examples of how these stars contribute to the community \ninclude:\n\n  1. The defensive line--donating $500 for every quarterback sack to a \nlocal homeless shelter.\n  2. Wide receiver Isaac Bruce--donating $500 for every touchdown to \nEdgewood's Childhaven, an educational center for children with learning \ndisabilities.\n  3. Running back Marshall Faulk--continuing the ``Marshall Plan'' that \nbegan in Indianapolis by donating $2,000 for every touchdown that he \nscores to the Marshall Faulk Foundation.\n  4. Quarterback Trent Green--donating $300 for every Rams passing \ntouchdown to the Trent Green Family Foundation.\n  5. Safety Keith Lyle--donating $500 for every interception to local \nliteracy programs.\n  6. Kicker Jeff Wilkins--donating $50 for every field goal to Cardinal \nGlennon Children's Hospital.\n  7. Tight end Roland Williams--donating $86 for every catch to the \nRoland Williams Youth Life Line Foundation which supports children in \nRoland's hometown.\n  Most of these players have also been successful in receiving matching \ncommitments from local businesses and individuals, helping to foster a \ntrue sense of community. In addition, each year, players make countless \nappearances at local schools, hospitals and youth centers to use their \ninfluence with children to stress the importance of education and \nmaking proper choices in life.\n  The hard work and dedication of the Rams to their team and the people \nof the St. Louis metropolitan area deserves our highest commendations. \nSo, on behalf of myself and the good people of my state of Illinois, I \ncongratulate Coach Dick Vermeil, Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Kurt \nWarner, Marshall Faulk, Issac Bruce, and the entire St. Louis Rams team \non an outstanding performance.\n  Coach Vermeil, players, and fans: congratulations on a great season \nand an outstanding victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S147-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPEAL OF THE EFFECTIVE CAPITAL GAINS TAX INCREASE IN THE TAX RELIEF \n                         EXTENSION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of S. \n2005 which would repeal the effective capital gains tax increase \ncontained in the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999. This legislation \nwould protect small business owners from paying taxes on money not \nactually received.\n  Overlooked in last year's legislation was a provision that repealed \nthe installment method for accrual method taxpayers when assets or \nentire businesses are sold. Under this new method, the seller of an \nasset or business is required to pay taxes on total gains in the first \nyear of the sale, no matter when the actual proceeds are received. S. \n2005 would revert this practice to its previous method in which the \nseller of an asset only paid taxes on the profits from the installment \nreceived in that year if he or she should receive payments in \nincrements.\n  While this tax measure provides for only modest tax revenue, the \nnegative impact on small business owners that this measure affects is \nquite significant. In effect, this tax increase cripples seller \nfinancing of small businesses and prevents thousands of men and women \nfrom purchasing small businesses. By potentially reducing the sale \nprice of small businesses by up to 20 percent or more, small business \nowners will be much less likely to sell their businesses. Larger \npublicly traded corporations are not impacted as they tend to use other \nfinancing methods involving cash or stock transactions. So, this tax \nincrease unfairly targets small business owners already overwhelmed \nwith federal taxes and regulations.\n  Madam President, it makes common sense that taxes should only be paid \nwhen profits are realized--and not on money that will not be collected \nfor years to come. Small businesses are an important provider of new \njobs and a driving force in this nation's economy. We must not penalize \nor restrict such a vibrant source of innovation, invention and \ncreativity that has enabled the United States to realize previously \nunimaginable prosperity.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this \nlegislation so essential in the success of this great nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S147-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDING\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S147-3", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S147-S148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STRATEGIC CONCEPT OF NATO--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 79\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United \nStates,\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\nincluding by section 1221(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65), I hereby determine and \ncertify that the new NATO Strategic Concept imposes no new commitment \nor obligation on the United States.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nresearch with respect to human embryonic stem cells; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                     STEM CELL RESEARCH ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to send to the \ndesk, on behalf of Senator Harkin and myself, a bill captioned the \n``Stem Cell Research Act of 2000.'' It is being introduced after a \nseries of four hearings, which have been conducted in the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, and \nEducation, which I chair and on which Senator Harkin is the ranking \nDemocrat.\n  The subject has been a very important one because approximately 15 \nmonths ago, there were disclosures about stem cell research which \nprovided an opportunity for a veritable fountain of youth. The \nscientific discoveries have found that from the stem cells, new cells \nmay be created which have the potential to cure a great many severe \nmaladies. For example, on Parkinson's disease, stem cells are \nenormously helpful. There is potential for cures on Alzheimer's, on \nheart ailments, and really on the whole range of human ailments, \nillnesses, and diseases.\n  There has been a limiting factor on the use of stem cells because of \na provision, which was inserted many years ago into the appropriations \nbill for our subcommittee, which limits Federal funding on research \nrelating to stem cells.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has handed down a ruling \nwhich would permit federal scientists to conduct research on stem cells \nthat have been derived by private sources.\n  The concern has been that the human embryo, subjected to scientific \nresearch, would potentially destroy life. The fact is that the only \nhuman embryos which are used as a basis for stem cell research are \nhuman embryos from discarded in vitro fertilization clinics. It is not \na matter of using a human embryo which has the potentiality for life to \nextract the stem cells because these are embryos which have been \ndiscarded.\n  Notwithstanding the legal opinion handed down by the general counsel \nof the Department of Health and Human Services, it is our view that \nthere are still undue restrictions on scientific research from existing \nlaw. That is why this legislation has been introduced. It will \neliminate the ban on the use of Federal funding for the research on \nstem cells.\n  There are a number of very important restrictions.\n  First, the research would not apply to the creation of human embryos \nfor research purposes.\n  Second, the research would not result in the cloning of a human \nbeing.\n  Third, it would be unlawful for any person receiving Federal funds to \nknowingly acquire, receive, or transfer any human embryos for valuable \nconsideration, even if the transfer affected interstate commerce.\n  These limitations have been engrafted into the legislation to be sure \nthis kind of inappropriate conduct is being prohibited.\n  The legal opinion issued by the Department of Health and Human \nServices covers the statutory prohibition on the use of funds, stating \nthat human embryo research would not apply to research utilizing human \npluripotent stem cells because such stem cells do not constitute a \nhuman embryo. However, applying the Federal funding solely to \npluripotent stem cells is not sufficient because there ought to be an \nopportunity for broader research, as I have suggested.\n  The controversy on stem cell research is very similar to the \ncontroversy which had existed on prohibiting research on fetal tissue \nwhen many people advanced the argument that it would induce abortions \nto secure fetal tissue. It soon became readily apparent that the \nresearch on fetal tissue was from discarded fetal tissue and that, in \nfact, there would not be an inducement of abortions to produce fetal \ntissue for research purposes. That is very similar, almost identical, \nexcept for what is involved with the issue of human embryos. Human \nembryos which will not be used for research for stem cells where there \nis any possibility that they might produce life and may be used only \nfrom discarded embryos, similarly to the discarded fetal tissue.\n  When the appropriations bill was considered last fall, a provision \nwas inserted into the committee report which would eliminate the \nprohibition of use of funds for research on stem cells. When it became \napparent that this provision would likely stall the progress of the \nappropriations bill, an agreement was reached to remove that provision \nin committee before the bill got to the floor under an arrangement with \nour distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, who agreed to bring up \nthe legislation as a freestanding bill. That is the legislation Senator \nHarkin and I are introducing today.\n  We intend to have an additional hearing within the next several weeks \nso that the stage will be set by late February or early March to \nproceed with the schedule of this bill as a freestanding measure and so \nthat the Senate may vote up or down and the House of Representatives \nmay ultimately have an opportunity to vote as well.\n  Over the past 14 months, the Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Subcommittee which I chair, held four hearings, the latest on \nNovember 4, 1999, to discuss the advances in stem cell research made by \ntwo research teams. One team, led by Dr. James Thompson at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, and the other headed by Dr. John Gearhart at \nJohns Hopkins University. Stem cell research is one area that holds \nparticular promise for the development of future medical treatment and \ncures. Stem cells originating in an embryo have the unique ability, for \na very limited period of time, to become any cell type of the body. \nThis power, if harnessed by science, could lead to replacement \ntherapies for failing cells, for example, or lead to organ tissues that \ncould be implanted into a patient. Scientists are just beginning \npreliminary research into the potential practical applications of this \nline of work. At a Senate hearing convened by my subcommittee on \nDecember 2, 1998, Dr. Gearhart testified that he has been able to \ninduce some stem cells to grow into nerve cells. Other scientists also \nstated that cures for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, \ndiabetes, and other diseases and illnesses that plague mankind could be \ngreatly accelerated by stem cell research. Some scientists, for \nexample, believe that stem cell research could lead to tangible \nbenefits to Parkinson's Disease patients in as soon as 7 to 10 years.\n  What has been delaying the advancement of this new line of research \nis a provision in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill that prohibits \nresearch on human embryos. On January 15, 1999, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services issued a legal opinion finding that the \nstatutory prohibition of the use of funds appropriated to HHS for human \nembryo research would not apply to research utilizing human pluripotent \nstem cells because such cells do not constitute a human embryo. But \neven this limited use of stem cells may be blocked by those who \nmisunderstand its purpose. According to Dr. Harold Varmus, the former \nhead of the National Institutes of Health, research on stem cells is \nnot the same as research on human embryos. Stem cells do not have the \ncapacity to develop into a human being.\n  While I applaud the HHS ruling, I do not believe that it goes far \nenough. To achieve the greatest and swiftest benefits, Federal \nresearchers need their own supply of stem cells. Therefore, I am \nproposing this legislation to enable Federally-funded researchers to \nderive their own stem cells from spare embryos obtained from in vitro \nfertilization clinics. Allowing scientists to conduct human stem cell \nresearch would greatly accelerate advances in many avenues of study \nand, in collaboration with private industry, expedite the production \nand availability of new drugs and treatments. Enacting such legislation \nwould clarify the boundaries governing Federally-funded researchers and \nmake clear the commitment of this Congress to biomedical research.\n  Let me review the key provisions of this bill:\n  It would amend the Public Health Service Act and give permanent \nauthority to the Secretary of Health and\n\n[[Page S151]]\n\nHuman Services to conduct, support, or fund research on human embryos \nonly for the purpose of generating stem cells. Human embryonic stem \ncells may be derived and used in research only from embryos that would \notherwise be discarded and donated by in vitro fertilization clinics \nand only with the written informed consent of the donors.\n  The Secretary shall issue guidelines governing human stem cell \nresearch, including definitions and terms used in such research.\n  All Federal research protocols and consent forms involving human \npluripotent stem cell research shall be reviewed and approved by an \ninstitutional review board.\n  The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a report \ndescribing the activities carried out under this section during the \npreceding fiscal year, including whether and to what extent research \nhas been conducted in accordance with this purpose.\n  The following restrictions would apply:\n  (A) The research shall not result in the creation of human embryos \nfor research purposes.\n  (B) The research shall not result in the cloning of a human being.\n  (C) It shall be unlawful for any person receiving Federal funds to \nknowingly acquire, receive, or transfer any human embryos for valuable \nconsideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.\n  We have heard very compelling testimony from many individuals who are \nhoping for treatments and cures from stem cell research. One \nindividual, Mr. Richard Pikunis of Malvern, New Jersey, a 27 year-old \nstricken with Parkinson's Disease, told the Subcommittee how the \ndisease has affected every facet of his young life--from law school \ngraduation to the birth of his son. Dr. Douglas Melton, a prominent \nprofessor at Harvard, told of the struggles of his son afflicted with \njuvenile diabetes. We also heard from Michael J. Fox, who implored us \nto do more for people with Parkinson's disease. Mr. Fox told of his \ndaily medication routine and progressing physical and mental \nexhaustion. He asked for the Subcommittee's help to eradicate the \ndisease so that he could dance at his children's weddings. Mr. Fox has \njust recently announced that he is leaving his popular television \nseries to devote more time to his family and to advocate for more \nresearch on finding a cure for Parkinson's disease.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the voices pleading with us to \nallow this research to move ahead. While stem cell research does not \nguarantee that a cure will be found, without it the opportunity to halt \ntheir suffering may be denied then. The enactment of this legislation \nas soon as possible could give thousands of individuals a chance to see \na cure within their lifetime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stem Cell Research Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESEARCH ON HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS.\n\n       Part G of the Title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 288 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section \n     498B the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 498C.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Specter, in the introduction of the ``Stem Cell \nResearch Act of 2000.'' I want to commend Senator Specter for having \nthe leadership and foresight to introduce legislation which will \nbroaden federally-funded scientists to pursue stem cell research, under \ncertain, limited conditions.\n  From enabling the development of cell and tissue transplantation, to \nimproving and accelerating pharmaceutical research and development, to \nincreasing our understanding of human development and cancer biology, \nthe potential benefits of stem cell research are truly awe-inspiring.\n  Stem cells hold hope for countless patients through potentially \nlifesaving therapies for Parkinson's, Alzheimers, stroke, heart disease \nand diabetes. Also exciting is the possibility that researchers may be \nable to alter stem cells genetically so they would avoid attack by the \npatient's immune system.\n  But all of these potential benefits could be delayed or even denied \nto patients without a healthy partnership between the private sector \nand the federal government.\n  While market interest in stem cell technology is strong, and private \ncompanies will continue to fund this research, the government has an \nimportant role to play in supporting the basic and applied science that \nunderpins these technologies. The problem is that early, basic science \nis always going to be underfunded by the private sector because this \ntype of research does not get products onto the market quickly enough. \nThe only way to ensure that this research is conducted is to allow the \nNIH to support it.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services ruled last year that \nunder the current ban on human embryo research, federally-funded \nscientists can conduct stem cell research if they use cell lines \nderived from private sources. This is a positive step forward, but it \ncontinues to handicap our researchers in the pursuit of cures and \ntherapies that will help our citizens,\n  Last fall, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) released \nits final report, ``Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research.'' The \nCommission concluded that stem cell research should be allowed to go \nforward with federal support, as long as researchers were limited to \nonly two sources of stem cells: fetal tissue and embryos resulting from \ninfertility treatments. And they recommended that federal support be \ncontingent on an open system of oversight and review.\n  NBAC also arrived at the important conclusion that it is ethically \nacceptable for the federal government to finance research that both \nderives cell lines from embryos and that uses those cell lines. Their \nreport states, ``Relying on cell lines that might be derived \nexclusively by a subset of privately funded researchers who are \ninterested in\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\nthis area could severely limit scientific and clinical progress.''\n  The Commission goes on to say that ``scientists who conduct basic \nresearch and are interested in fundamental cellular processes are \nlikely to make elemental discoveries about the nature of ES [embryonic \nstem] cells as they derive them in the laboratory.''\n  NBAC's report presents reasonable guidelines for federal policy. Our \nbill bans human embryo research, but allows federally-funded scientists \nto derive human pluripotent stem cells from human embryos if those \nembryos are obtained from IVF clinics, if the donor has provided \ninformed consent and the embryo was no longer needed for fertility \ntreatments. The American Society of Cell Biology estimates that 100,000 \nhuman embryos are currently frozen in IVF clinics, in excess of their \nclinical need.\n  In addition, our language requires HHS and NIH to develop procedural \nand ethical guidelines to make sure that stem cell research is \nconducted in an ethical, sound manner. As it stands today, stem cell \nresearch in the private sector is not subject to federal monitoring or \nethical requirements.\n  Stem cell research holds such hope, such potential for millions of \nAmericans who are sick and in pain, it is morally wrong for us to \nprevent or delay our world-class scientists from building on the \nprogress that has been made.\n  As long as this research is conducted in an ethically validated \nmanner, it should be allowed to go forward, and it should receive \nfederal support. That is why Senator Specter and I have joined together \non legislation that will allow our nation's top scientists to pursue \ncritical cures and therapies for the diseases and chronic conditions \nwhich strike too many Americans. I urge my Senate colleagues to join us \nin supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2016. A bill to authorize appropriations for, and to improve the \noperation of, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\nthe nuclear regulatory commission authorization and improvements act of \n                                  2000\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nimportant to the energy security of our country. This legislation \nentitled the ``Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorization and \nImprovements Act of 2000'' not only includes provisions authorizing the \nannual funding for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but makes \nessential amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today will assist the \nNRC in its efforts to achieve greater efficiencies and eliminate \noutdated restrictions within our nuclear energy sector. As mentioned, \nthis legislation includes several amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, \nincluding the following:\n  Eliminating provisions in current law that preclude any foreign \nownership of power and research reactors located in the United States. \nThese outdated provisions are a significant obstacle to foreign \ninvestment or participation in the U.S. nuclear power industry and its \nrestructuring. No valid reasons exist to prohibit investors from \ncountries such as the United Kingdom from participating in the \nownership of nuclear plants in this country. The provisions in current \nlaw that protect U.S. security interests are unchanged by my \nlegislation.\n  Eliminationg the current statutory requirement that the NRC conduct \nan antitrust review in connection with licensing actions. Other federal \nagencies already have comprehensive responsibility to enforce antitrust \nlaws affecting electric utilities. Requiring the NRC to do independent \nantitrust evaluations for licensing actions is redundant, time-\nconsuming and unnecessary.\n  Simplifying the hearing requirements in a proceeding involving an \namendment to an existing operating license, or the transfer of an \nexisting operating license. The amendment provides that the Commission \nshould not use formal adjudicatory procedures in such cases, but rather \nshould comply with the informal rulemaking requirements contained in \nthe Administrative Procedure Act.\n  Giving the NRC the authority to establish such requirements it deems \nnecessary to ensure that non-licenses fully comply with their \nobligations to provide funding for nuclear plant decommissioning. This \nincludes jurisdiction over non-licensees, i.e., those who have \ntransferred their license but retain responsibility for \ndecommissioning.\n  The proposed package also includes legislative provisions sought by \nthe NRC. The foreign ownership and anti-trust review changes just \nmentioned were included in the NRC's legislative proposals last year. \nOther provisions requested by the NRC should serve to enhance nuclear \nsafety and physical security, increase efficiency, and enhance the \neconomic use of Commission resources.\n  These changes are necessary to ensure that nuclear energy remains \npart of our nation's energy portfolio. Nuclear energy is a vital \ningredient for providing U.S. base load capacity based on economic, \nenvironmental and electricity needs.\n  Mr. President, I am sure everyone is aware of my strong commitment to \nnuclear energy. This conviction is well-founded. One need only consider \na few simple facts to find justification for my position.\n  Ensuring diversity and reliability in our nation's future energy \nportfolio is a critical national security concern. As just one example, \nour increasing dependence on imported fossil fuel is a cause for \nconcern. Last year oil imports accounted for 54% of U.S. oil \nconsumption. This dependence could create a national security crisis. \nThis dependence may also contribute to an environmental crisis.\n  Similarly, although we continue to invest in renewable energy \nresources, the hard facts demonstrate that renewables alone cannot \nobtain sufficient energy generation to meet future needs.\n  An article by Richard Rhodes and Denis Beller in the most recent \nedition of Foreign Affairs argues the case for nuclear energy in \ndetail. Mr. President, allow me briefly to review some facts found in \nthis article that address some very important questions. These repeat \nthe same points I made in a speech at Harvard in October of 1997 and \nhave made many times since.\n  First, what estimated energy demands will the world face?\n  A 1999 report by the British Royal Society and Royal Academy of \nEngineering estimates that the consumption of energy will at least \ndouble in the next 50 years and grow by a factor of up to five in the \nnext century.\n  The OECD projects 65% growth in world energy demand by 2020.\n  How can nuclear energy play a role in meeting future energy needs?\n  The anti-nuclear groups are dead wrong. Nuclear power is neither dead \nnor dying. France generates 79 percent of its electricity with nuclear \npower; Belgium, 60 percent; Sweden, 42 percent; Japan 34 percent; and \nthe United States, 20 percent. The United States remains the largest \nproducer of nuclear energy in the world, and the U.S. nuclear industry \ngenerated nine percent more nuclear electricity in 1999 than 1998. In \norder to sustain economic growth, China has plans for as many as 100 \nnuclear power plants, and South Korea will more than double its \ncapacity by building 16 new plants.\n  Nuclear power's advantage is the ability to generate a vast amount of \nenergy from a minute quantity of fuel. For example, whereas one \nkilogram of firewood can produce one kilowatt-hour of electricity and \nthe ratio for oil is one-to-four, one kilogram of uranium fuel in a \nmodern light-water reactor generates 400,000 kilowatts of electricity, \neven without recycling.\n  Nuclear safety and efficiency have improved dramatically in the last \ndecade. For example, the average U.S. capacity factor in 1998 was 80 \npercent, compared to 58 percent in 1980 and 66 percent in 1990. The \naverage production costs for nuclear energy are now at just under two \ncents per kilowatt-hour, while electricity produced from gas costs \nalmost three and a half cents per kilowatt-hour. Most importantly, \nradiation exposure to workers and waste produced per unit of energy \nhave hit new lows.\n  What about the risks from radioactivity?\n  Good evidence exists that exposure to low doses of radioactivity \nactually improves health and lengthens life\n\n[[Page S153]]\n\nthrough stimulation of the immune system. Unfortunately, U.S. \nstandards, in particular those established by the Environmental \nProtection Agency, rely on a theory--the ``linear no-threshold'' theory \n(LNT)--that predicts exposure to trivial levels of radiation increases \nthe risk of cancer. One should keep in mind that the levels argued to \nincrease risk of cancer by this model are considerably less than \npreexisting natural levels of background radiation. Furthermore, this \ntheory is by no means accepted by the entire scientific community.\n  According to recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health, a \n1,000 megawatt coal-fired power plant releases about 100 times as much \nradioactivity into the environment as a comparable nuclear plant. \nHowever, the same standards for radioactive releases do not apply to \ncoal and nuclear plants. And, experts on coal geology and engineering \nhave concluded that ``radioactive elements in coal and fly ash should \nnot be sources of alarm.''\n  Can we not place more reliance on renewables?\n  Even if robustly subsidized, renewables will only move from their \npresent 0.5 percent share to claim no more than five to eight percent \nby 2020.\n  The U.S. leads in renewable energy generation, but such production \ndeclined by 9.4 percent from 1997 to 1998: hydro by 9.2%, geothermal by \n5.4%, wind by 50.5%, and solar by 27.7%.\n  Are we making smart investments for U.S. energy security?\n  Federal R investment per thousand kilowatt was only five cents for \nnuclear and coal, 58 cents for oil, and 41 cents for gas; however, it \nwas $4,769 for wind and $17,006 for photovoltaics.\n  In brief, we need nuclear. Our economic growth and security depend on \nit. The benefits of nuclear outweigh the risks. Renewables cannot fill \nthe gap--either between today's demands and future needs or today with \nnuclear and today without. Not only are coal, gas and oil finite \nresources, but their use is harmful to human health and the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, we must not fail to ensure that nuclear is part of our \nenergy mix. Our nation's energy future must include nuclear in order to \nbe sufficiently diverse, reliable and adequate to meet future energy \nneeds.\n  The legislation I am offering today will help ensure that nuclear \nremains part of our energy mix.\n  Deregulation of the electric utility industry increases the need to \nkeep operating costs low enough to be competitive. For this reason, \nnuclear energy's future rides on decreasing costs of regulation, \nespecially that of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  With gentle prodding and some more overt tactics from the Congress, \npositive changes at the NRC have been forthcoming.\n  While holding fast to its primary health and safety mission, the NRC \nneeded to move from a traditional deterministic approach to a more \nrisk-informed and performance-based approach to regulation. In brief, \nthe NRC needed to achieve a rapid transition to an entirely different \nregulatory framework, streamline its processes, and offer clear \ndefinitions, standards, and requirements.\n  Let me briefly highlight two of the milestones of the past year:\n  Reactor Oversight.--The NRC commenced with a pilot program for the \nnew reactor licensee oversight process. This process will replace the \ncurrent inspections, assessment and enforcement processes.\n  Plants will be evaluated in three key areas: reactor safety, \nradiation safety and security safeguards. Twenty ``performance \nindicators'' will assess overall performance in each area. Most \nstakeholders view this as a big step toward more consistent and \nobjective assessments.\n  The NRC plans full implementation of this inspection regime for all \nnuclear plants this year.\n  Licensing Actions.--The NRC continued completion of licensing actions \nat a rate greater than NRC Performance Plan output measures and \ncontinued to reduce the licensing action inventory.\n  For instance, one indicator of greater efficiency in licensing \nactions is the age of the inventory. 1999 showed consistent \nimprovements in turnaround time. For fiscal year 1998, the NRC \nlicensing action inventory included 65.6% of licensing actions that \nwere less than 1 year old; 86% that were less than 2 years old; and \n95.4% that were less than 3 years old. By October 1999, 95% of the \nlicensing action inventory was less than 1 year old; and 100% was less \nthan two years old.\n  These are just two examples. With Congress and industry demanding \nregulatory change, the agency is responding. All elements of change, \nespecially the overall shift from a deterministic to a risk-informed \nparadigm, remain work-in-progress. I believe, however, the general \nconsensus is that the last couple years have been very positive.\n  At the same time, the NRC needs our assistance in removing outdated \nand unnecessary statutory provisions. This legislation will achieve \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I close with the same thoughts as Richard Rhodes and \nDenis Beller: ``Nuclear power is environmentally safe, practical, and \naffordable. It is not the problem--it is one of the best solutions.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nand the Foreign Affairs article entitled ``The Need for Nuclear Power'' \nby Dr. Rhodes and Dr. Beller be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Energy multiplies human labor, \n     increasing productivity. It builds and lights schools, \n     purifies water, powers farm machinery, drives sewing machines \n     and robot assemblers, stores and moves information. World \n     population is steadily increasing, having passed six billion \n     in 1999. Yet one-third of that number--two billion people--\n     lack access to electricity. Development depends on energy, \n     and the alternative to development is suffering: poverty, \n     disease, and death. Such conditions create instability and \n     the potential for widespread violence. National security \n     therefore requires developed nations to help increase energy \n     production in their more populous developing counterparts. \n     For the sake of safety as well as security, that increased \n     energy supply should come from diverse sources.\n       ``At a global level,'' the British Royal Society and Royal \n     Academy of Engineering estimate in a 1999 report on nuclear \n     energy an climate change, ``we can expect our consumption of \n     energy at least to double in the next 50 years and to grow by \n     a factor of up to five in the next 100 years as the world \n     population increases and as people seek to improve their \n     standards of living.'' Even with vigorous conservation, would \n     energy production would have to triple by 2050 to support \n     consumption at a mere one-third of today's U.S. per capita \n     rate. The International Energy Agency (IEA) of the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \n     projects 65 percent growth in world energy demand by 2020, \n     two-thirds of that coming from developing countries. ``Given \n     the levels of consumption likely in the future,'' the Royal \n     Society and Royal Academy caution, ``it will be an immense \n     challenge to meet the global demand for energy without \n     unsustainable long-term damage to the environment.'' That \n     damage includes surface and air pollution and global warming.\n       Most of the world's energy today comes from petroleum (39.5 \n     percent), coal (24.2 percent), natural gas (22.1 percent), \n     hydroelectric power (6.9 percent), and nuclear power (6.3 \n     percent). Although oil and coal still dominate, their market \n     fraction began declining decades ago. Meanwhile, natural gas \n     and nuclear power have steadily increased their share and \n     should continue to do so. Contrary to the assertions of \n     antinuclear organizations, nuclear power is neither dead nor \n     dying. France generates 79 percent of its electricity with \n     nuclear power; Belgium, 60 percent; Sweden, 42 percent; \n     Switzerland, 39 percent; Spain, 37 percent; Japan, 34 \n     percent; the United Kingdom, 21 percent; and the United \n     States (the largest producer of nuclear energy in the \n     world), 20 percent. South Korea and China have announced \n     ambitious plans to expand their nuclear-power \n     capabilities--in the case of South Korea, by building 16 \n     new plants, increasing capacity by more than 100 percent. \n     With 434 operating reactors worldwide, nuclear power is \n     meeting the annual electrical needs of more than a billion \n     people.\n       In America and around the globe, nuclear safety and \n     efficiency have improved significantly since 1990. In 1998, \n     unit capacity factor (the fraction of a power plant's \n     capacity that it actually generates) for operating reactors \n     reached record levels. The average U.S. capacity factor in \n     1998 was 80 percent for about 100 reactors, compared to 58 \n     percent in 1980 and 66 percent in 1990. Despite a reduction \n     in the number of power plants, the U.S. nuclear industry \n     generated nine percent more nuclear electricity in 1999 than \n     in 1998. Average production costs for nuclear energy are now \n     just 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), while electricity \n     produced from gas costs 3.4 cents per kWh. Meanwhile, \n     radiation exposure to workers and waste produced per unit of \n     energy have hit new lows.\n       Because major, complex technologies take more than half a \n     century to spread around the world, natural gas will share \n     the lead in power generation with nuclear power over the next \n     hundred years. Which of the two will command the greater \n     share remains to be determined. But both are cleaner and more \n     secure than the fuels they have begun to replace, and their \n     ascendance should be endorsed. Even environmentalists should \n     welcome the transition and reconsider their infatuation with \n     renewable energy sources.\n\n\n                             carbon nations\n\n       Among sources of electric-power generation, coal is the \n     worst environmental offender. (Petroleum, today's dominant \n     source of energy, sustains transportation, putting it in a \n     separate category.) Recent studies by the Harvard School of \n     Public Health indicate that pollutants from coal-burning \n     cause about 15,000 premature deaths annually in the United \n     States alone. Used to generate about a quarter of the world's \n     primary energy, coal-burning releases amounts of toxic waste \n     too immense to contain safely. Such waste is either dispersed \n     directly into the air or is solidified and dumped. Some is \n     even mixed into construction materials. Besides emitting \n     noxious chemicals in the form of gases or toxic particles--\n     sulfur and nitrogen oxides (components of acid rain and \n     smog), arsenic, mercury, cadmium, selenium, lead, boron, \n     chromium, copper, fluorine, molybdenum, nickel, vanadium, \n     zinc, carbon monoxide and dioxide, and other greenhouse \n     gases--coal-fired power plants are also the world's major \n     source of radioactive releases into the environment. Uranium \n     and thorium, mildly radioactive elements ubiquitous in the \n     earth's crust, are both released when coal is burned. \n     Radioactive radon gas, produced when uranium in the \n     Earth's crust decays and normally confined underground, is\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\n     released when coal is mined. A 1,000-megawatt-electric \n     (MWe) coal-fired power plant releases about 100 times as \n     much radioactivity into the environment as a comparable \n     nuclear plant. Worldwide releases of uranium and thorium \n     from coal-burning total about 37,300 tonnes (metric tons) \n     annually, with about 7,300 tonnes coming from the United \n     States. Since uranium and thorium are potent nuclear \n     fuels, burning coal also wastes more potential energy than \n     it produces.\n       Nuclear proliferation is another overlooked potential \n     consequence of coal-burning. The uranium released by a single \n     1,000-MWe coal plant in a year includes about 74 pounds of \n     uranium-235--enough for at least two atomic bombs. This \n     uranium would have to be enriched before it could be used, \n     which would be complicated and expensive. But plutonium could \n     also be bred from coal-derived uranium. Moreover, ``because \n     electric utilities are not high-profile facilities,'' writes \n     physicist Alex Gabbard of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, \n     ``collection and processing of coal ash for recovery of \n     minerals . . . can proceed without attracting outside \n     attention, concern or intervention. Any country with coal-\n     fired plants could collect combustion by products and amass \n     sufficient nuclear weapons materials to build up a very \n     powerful arsenal.'' In the early 1950s, when richer ores were \n     believed to be in short supply, the U.S. Atomic Energy \n     Commission actually investigated using coal as a source of \n     uranium production for nuclear weapons; burning the coal, the \n     AEC concluded, would concentrate the mineral, which could \n     then be extracted from the ash.\n       Such a scenario may seem far-fetched. But it emphasizes the \n     political disadvantages under which nuclear power labors. \n     Current laws force nuclear utilities, unlike coal plants, to \n     invest in expensive systems that limit the release of \n     radioactivity. Nuclear fuel is not efficiently recycled in \n     the United States because of proliferation fears. These \n     factors have warped the economics of nuclear power \n     development and created a politically difficult waste-\n     disposal problem. If coal utilities were forced to assume \n     similar costs, coal electricity would no longer be cheaper \n     than nuclear.\n\n\n                   decline and fall of the renewables\n\n       Renewable sources of energy--hydroelectric, solar, wind, \n     geothermal, and biomass--have high capital-investment costs \n     and significant, if usually unacknowledged, environmental \n     consequences. Hydropower is not even a true renewable, since \n     dams eventually silt in. Most renewables collect extremely \n     diluted energy, requiring large areas of land and masses of \n     collectors to concentrate. Manufacturing solar collectors, \n     pouring concrete for fields of windmills, and downing many \n     square miles of land behind dams cause damage and pollution.\n       Photovoltaic cells used for solar collection are large \n     semiconductors; their manufacture produces highly toxic waste \n     metals and solvents that require special technology for \n     disposal. A 1,000-MWe solar electric plant would generate \n     6,850 tonnes of hazardous waste from metals-processing \n     alone over a 30-year lifetime. A comparable solar thermal \n     plant (using mirrors focused on a central tower) would \n     require metals for construction that would generate \n     435,000 tonnes of manufacturing waste, of which 16,300 \n     tonnes would be contaminated with lead and chromium and be \n     considered hazardous.\n       A global solar-energy system would consume at least 20 \n     percent of the world's known iron resources. It would require \n     a century to build and a substantial fraction of annual world \n     iron production to maintain. The energy necessary to \n     manufacture sufficient solar collectors to cover a half-\n     million square miles of the Earth's surface and to deliver \n     the electricity through long-distance transmission systems \n     would itself add grievously to the global burden of pollution \n     and greenhouse gas. A global solar-energy system without \n     fossil or nuclear backup would also be dangerously vulnerable \n     to drops in solar radiation from volcanic events such as the \n     1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which caused widespread crop \n     failure during the ``year without a summer'' that followed.\n       Wind farms, besides requiring millions of pounds of \n     concrete and steel to build (and thus creating huge amounts \n     of waste materials), are inefficient, with low (because \n     intermittent) capacity. They also cause visual and noise \n     pollution and are mighty slayers of birds. Several hundred \n     birds of prey, including dozens of golden eagles, are killed \n     every year by a single California wind farm; more eagles have \n     been killed by wind turbines than were lost in the disastrous \n     Exxon Valdez oil spill. The National Audubon Society has \n     launched a campaign to save the California condor from a \n     proposed wind farm to be built north of Los Angeles. A wind \n     farm equivalent in output and capacity to a 1,000-MWe fossil-\n     fuel or nuclear plant would occupy 2,000 square miles of land \n     and, even with substantial subsidies and ignoring hidden \n     pollution costs, would produce electricity at double or \n     triple the cost of fossil fuels.\n       Although at least one-quarter of the world's potential for \n     hydropower has already been developed, hydroelectric power--\n     produced by dams that submerge large areas of land, displace \n     rural populations, change river ecology, kill fish, and risk \n     catastrophic collapse--has understandably lost the backing of \n     environmentalists in recent years. The U.S. Export-Import \n     Bank was responding in part to environmental lobbying when it \n     denied funding to China's 18,000-MWe Three Gorges project.\n       Meanwhile, geothermal sources--which exploit the internal \n     heat of the earth emerging in geyser areas or under \n     volcanoes--are inherently limited and often coincide with \n     scenic sites (such as Yellowstone National Park) that \n     conservationists understandably want to preserve.\n       Because of these and other disadvantages, organizations \n     such as World Energy Council and the IEA predict that \n     hydroelectric generation will continue to account for no more \n     than its present 6.9 percent share of the world's primary \n     energy supply, while all other renewables, even though \n     robustly subsidized, will move from their present 0.5 \n     percent share to claim no more than 5 to 8 percent by \n     2020. In the United States, which leads the world in \n     renewable energy generation, such production actually \n     declined by 9.4 percent from 1997 to 1998: hydro by 9.2 \n     percent, geothermal by 5.4 percent, wind by 50.5 percent, \n     and solar by 27.7 percent.\n       Like the dream of controlled thermonuclear fusion, then, \n     the realty of a world run on pristine energy generated from \n     renewables continues to recede, despite expensive, highly \n     subsidized research and development. the 1997 U.S. federal \n     R investment per thousand kWh was only 5 cents for nuclear \n     and coal, 58 cents for oil, and 41 cents for gas, but was \n     $4,769 for wind and $17,006 for photovoltaics. This massive \n     public investment in renewables would have been better spent \n     making coal plants and automobiles cleaner. According to \n     Robert Bradley of Houston's Institute for Energy Research, \n     U.S. conservation efforts and nonhydroelectric renewables \n     have benefited from a cumulative 20-year taxpayer investment \n     of some $30-$40 billion--``the largest governmental peacetime \n     energy expenditure in U.S. history.'' And Bradley estimates \n     that ``the $5.8 billion spent by the Department of Energy on \n     wind and solar subsidies'' alone could have paid for \n     ``replacing between 5,000 and 10,000 MWe of the nation's \n     dirtiest coal capacity with gas-fired combined-cycle units, \n     which would have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by between \n     one-third and two-thirds.'' Replacing coal with nuclear \n     generation would have reduced overall emissions even more.\n       Despite the massive investment, conservation and nonhydro \n     renewables remain stubbornly uncompetitive and contribute \n     only marginally to U.S. energy supplies. If the most \n     prosperous nation in the world cannot afford them, who can? \n     Not China, evidently, which expects to generate less than one \n     percent of its commercial energy from nonhydro renewables in \n     2025. Coal and oil will still account for the bulk of China's \n     energy supply in that year unless developed countries offer \n     incentives to convince the world's most populous nation to \n     change its plan.\n\n\n                          TURN DOWN THE VOLUME\n\n       Natural gas has many virtues as a fuel compared to coal or \n     oil, and its share of the world's energy will assuredly grow \n     in the first half of the 21st century. But its supply is \n     limited and unevenly distributed, it is expensive as a power \n     source compared to coal or uranium, and it pollutes the air. \n     A 1,000-MWe natural gas plant releases 5.5 tonnes of sulfur \n     oxides per day, 21 tonnes of nitrogen oxides, 1.6 tonnes of \n     carbon monoxide, and 0.9 tonnes of partculates. In the United \n     States, energy production from natural gas released about 5.5 \n     billion tonnes of waste in 1994. Natural gas fires and \n     explosions are also significant risks. A single mile of gas \n     pipeline three feet in diameter at a pressure of 1,000 pounds \n     per square inch (psi) contains the equivalent of two-thirds \n     of a kiloton of explosive energy; a million miles of such \n     large pipelines lace the earth.\n       The great advantage of nuclear power is its ability to \n     wrest enormous energy from a small volume of fuel. Nuclear \n     fission, transforming matter directly into energy, is several \n     million times as energetic as chemical burning, which merely \n     breaks chemical bonds. One tonne of nuclear fuel produces \n     energy equivalent to 2 to 3 million tonnes of fossil fuel. \n     Burning 1 kilogram of firewood can generate 1 kilowatt-hour \n     of electricity; 1 kg of coal, 3 kWh; 1 kg of oil, 4 kWh. But \n     1 kg of uranium fuel in a modern light-water reactor \n     generates 400,000 kWh of electricity, and if that uranium is \n     recycled, 1 kg can generate more than 7,000,000 kWh. These \n     spectacular differences in volume help explain the vast \n     difference in the environmental impacts of nuclear versus \n     fossil fuels. Running a 1,000-MWe power plant for a year \n     requires, 2,000 train cars of coal or 10 supertankers of oil \n     but only 12 cubic meters of natural uranium. Out the other \n     end of fossil-fuel plants, even those with pollution-control \n     systems, come thousands of tonnes of noxious gases, \n     particulates, and heavy-metal-bearing (and radioactive) ash, \n     plus solid hazardous waste--up to 500,000 tonnes of sulfur \n     from coal, more than 300,000 tonnes from oil, and 200,000 \n     tonnes from natural gas. In contrast, a 1,000-MWe nuclear \n     plant releases no noxious gases or other pollutants n1 and \n     much less radioactivity per capita than is encountered from \n     airline travel, a home smoke detector, or a television set. \n     It produces about 30 tonnes of high-level waste (spent fuel) \n     and 800 tonnes of low- and intermediate-level waste--about 20 \n     cubic meters in all when compacted (roughly, the volume of \n     two automobiles). All the operating nuclear plants in the \n     world produce some 3,000 cubic meters of waste annually. By \n     comparison, U.S. industry generates annually about 50,000,000 \n     cubic meters of solid toxic waste.\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\n       n1 Uranium is refined and processed into fuel assemblies \n     today using coal energy, which does of course release \n     pollutants. If nuclear power were made available for process \n     heat or if fuel assemblies were recycled, this source of \n     manufacturing pollution would be eliminated or greatly \n     reduced.\n       The high-level waste is intensely radioactive, of course \n     (the low-level waste can be less radioactive than coal ash, \n     which is used to make concrete and gypsum--both of which are \n     incorporated into building materials). But thanks to its \n     small volume and the fact that it is not released into the \n     environment, this high-level waste can be meticulously \n     sequestered behind multiple barriers. Waste from coal, \n     dispersed across the landscape in smoke or buried near the \n     surface, remains toxic forever. Radioactive nuclear waste \n     decays steadily, losing 99 percent of its toxicity after 600 \n     years--well within the range of human experience with custody \n     and maintenance, as evidence by structures such as the Roman \n     Pantheon and Notre Dame Cathedral. Nuclear waste disposal is \n     a political problem in the United States because of wide-\n     spread fear disproportionate to the reality of risk. But it \n     is not an engineering problem, as advanced projects in \n     France, Sweden, and Japan demonstrate. The World Health \n     Organization has estimated that indoor and outdoor air \n     pollution cause some three million deaths per year. \n     Substituting small, properly contained volumes of nuclear \n     waste for vast, dispersed amounts of toxic wastes from \n     fossil fuels would produce so obvious an improvement in \n     public health that it is astonishing that physicians have \n     not already demanded such a conversion.\n       The production cost of nuclear electricity generated from \n     existing U.S. plants is already fully competitive with \n     electricity from fossil fuels, although new nuclear power is \n     somewhat more expensive. But this higher price tag is \n     deceptive. Large nuclear power plants require larger capital \n     investments than comparable coal or gas plants only because \n     nuclear utilities are required to build and maintain costly \n     systems to keep their radioactivity from the environment. If \n     fossil-fuel plants were similarly required to sequester the \n     pollutants they generate, they would cost significantly more \n     than nuclear power plants do. The European Union and the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have determined \n     that ``for equivalent amounts of energy generation, coal and \n     oil plants, . . . owing to their large emissions and huge \n     fuel and transport requirements, have the highest externality \n     costs as well as equivalent lives lost. The external costs \n     are some ten times higher than for a nuclear power plant and \n     can be a significant fraction of generation costs.'' In \n     equivalent lives lost per gigawatt generated (that is, loss \n     of life expectancy from exposure to pollutants), coal kills \n     37 people annually; oil, 32; gas, 2; nuclear, 1. Compared to \n     nuclear power, in other words, fossil fuels (and renewables) \n     have enjoyed a free ride with respect to protection of the \n     environment and public health and safety.\n       Even the estimate of one life lost to nuclear power is \n     questionable. Such an estimate depends on whether or not, as \n     the long-standing ``linear no-threshold'' theory (LNT) \n     maintains, exposure to amounts of radiation considerably less \n     than preexisting natural levels increases the risk of cancer. \n     Although LNT dictates elaborate and expensive confinement \n     regimes for nuclear power operations and waste disposal, \n     there is no evidence that low-level radiation exposure \n     increases cancer risk. In fact, there is good evidence that \n     it does not. There is even good evidence that exposure to low \n     doses of radioactivity improves health and lengthens life, \n     probably by stimulating the immune system much as vaccines do \n     (the best study, of background radon levels in hundreds of \n     thousands of homes in more than 90 percent of U.S. counties, \n     found lung cancer rates decreasing significantly with \n     increasing radon levels among both smokers and nonsmokers). \n     So low-level radioactivity from nuclear power generation \n     presents at worst a negligible risk. Authorities on coal \n     geology and engineering make the same argument about low-\n     level radioactivity from coal-burning; a U.S. Geological \n     Survey fact sheet, for example, concludes that ``radioactive \n     elements in coal and fly ash should not be sources of \n     alarm.'' Yet nuclear power development has been hobbled, and \n     nuclear waste disposal unnecessarily delayed, by limits not \n     visited upon the coal industry.\n       No technology system is immune to accident. Recent dam \n     overflows and failures in Italy and India each resulted in \n     several thousand fatalities. Coal-mine accidents, oil- and \n     gas-plant fires, and pipeline explosions typically kill \n     hundreds per incident. The 1984 Bhopal chemical plant \n     disaster caused some 3,000 immediate deaths and poisoned \n     several hundred thousand people. According to the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency, between 1987 and 1997 \n     more than 600,000 accidental releases of toxic chemicals \n     in the United States killed a total of 2,565 people and \n     injured 22,949.\n       By comparison, nuclear accidents have been few and minimal. \n     The recent, much-reported accident in Japan occurred not at a \n     power plant but at a facility processing fuel for a research \n     reactor. It caused no deaths or injuries to the public. As \n     for the Chernobyl explosion, it resulted from human error in \n     operating a fundamentally faulty reactor design that could \n     not have been licensed in the West. It caused severe human \n     and environmental damage locally, including 31 deaths, most \n     from radiation exposure. Thyroid cancer, which could have \n     been prevented with prompt iodine prophylaxis, has increased \n     in Ukrainian children exposed to fallout. More than 800 cases \n     have been diagnosed and several thousand more are projected; \n     although the disease is treatable, three children have died. \n     LNT-based calculations project 3,420 cancer deaths in \n     Chernobyl-area residents and cleanup crews. The Chernobyl \n     reactor lacked a containment structure, a fundamental safety \n     system that is required on Western reactors. Postaccident \n     calculations indicate that such a structure would have \n     confined the explosion and thus the radioactivity, in which \n     case no injuries or deaths would have occurred.\n       These numbers, for the worst ever nuclear power accident, \n     are remarkably low compared to major accidents in other \n     industries. More than 40 years of commercial nuclear power \n     operations demonstrate that nuclear power is much safer than \n     fossil-fuel systems in terms of industrial accidents, \n     environmental damage, health effects, and long-term risk.\n\n\n                         ghosts in the machine\n\n       Most of the uranium used in nuclear reactors is inert, a \n     nonfissile product unavailable for use in weapons. Operating \n     reactors, however, breed fissile plutonium that could be used \n     in bombs, and therefore the commercialization of nuclear \n     power has raised concerns about the spread of weapons. In \n     1977, President Carter deferred indefinitely the recycling of \n     ``spent'' nuclear fuel, citing proliferation risks. This \n     decision effectively ended nuclear recycling in the United \n     States, even though such recycling reduces the volume and \n     radiotoxicity of nuclear waste and could extend nuclear fuel \n     supplies for thousands of years. Other nations assessed the \n     risks differently and the majority did not follow the U.S. \n     example. France and the United Kingdom currently reprocess \n     spent fuel; Russia is stockpiling fuel and separated \n     plutonium for jump-starting future fast-reactor fuel cycles; \n     Japan has begun using recycled uranium and plutonium mixed-\n     oxide (MOX) fuel in its reactors and recently approved the \n     construction of a new nuclear power plant to use 100-percent \n     MOX fuel by 2007.\n       Although power-reactor plutonium theoretically can be used \n     to make nuclear explosives, spent fuel is refractory, highly \n     radioactive, and beyond the capacity of terrorists to \n     process. Weapons made from reactor-grade plutonium would \n     be hot, unstable, and of uncertain yield. India has \n     extracted weapons plutonium from a Canadian heavy-water \n     reactor and bars inspection of some dual-purpose reactors \n     it has built. But no plutonium has ever been diverted from \n     British or French reprocessing facilities or fuel \n     shipments for weapons production; IAEA inspections are \n     effective in preventing such diversions. The risk of \n     proliferation, the IAEA has concluded, ``is not zero and \n     would not become zero even if nuclear power ceased to \n     exist. It is a continually strengthened nonproliferation \n     regime that will remain the cornerstone of efforts to \n     prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.''\n       Ironically, burying spend fuel without extracting its \n     plutonium through reprocessing would actually increase the \n     long-term risk of nuclear proliferation, since the decay of \n     less-fissile and more-radioactive isotopes in spend fuel \n     after one to three centuries improves the explosive qualities \n     of the plutonium it contains, making it more attractive for \n     weapons use. Besides extending the world's uranium resources \n     almost indefinitely, recycling would make it possible to \n     convert plutonium to useful energy while breaking it down \n     into shorter-lived, nonfissionable, nonthreatening nuclear \n     waste.\n       Hundreds of tons of weapons-grade plutonium, which cost the \n     nuclear superpowers billions of dollars to produce, have \n     become military surplus in the past decade. Rather than \n     burying some of this strategically worrisome but \n     energetically valuable material--as Washington has proposed--\n     it should be recycled into nuclear fuel. An international \n     system to recycle and manage such fuel would prevent covert \n     proliferation. As envisioned by Edward Arthur, Paul \n     Cunningham, and Richard Wagner of the Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory, such a system would combine internationally \n     monitored retrievable storage, the processing of all \n     separated plutonium into MOX fuel for power reactors, and, in \n     the longer term, advanced integrated materials-processing \n     reactors that would receive, control, and process all fuel \n     discharged from reactors throughout the world, generating \n     electricity and reducing spend fuel to short-lived nuclear \n     waste ready for permanent geological storage.\n\n\n                           the new new thing\n\n       The New generation of small, modular power plants--\n     competitive with natural gas and designed for safety, \n     proliferation resistance, and ease of operation--will be \n     necessary to extend the benefits of nuclear power to smaller \n     developing countries that lack a nuclear infrastructure. The \n     Department of Energy has awarded funding to three designs for \n     such ``fourth-generation'' plants. A South African utility, \n     Eskom, has announced plans to market an modular gas-cooled \n     pebble-bed reactor that does not require emergency core-\n     cooling systems and physically cannot ``melt down.'' Eskom \n     estimates that the reactor will produce electricity at around \n     1.5 cents per kWh, which is cheaper than electricity from a \n     combined-cycle gas plant. The Massachusetts Institute of \n     Technology and the Idaho National Engineering and \n     Environmental Laboratory are\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\n     developing a similar design to supply high-temperature \n     heat for industrial processes such as hydrogen generation \n     and desalinization.\n       Petroleum is used today primarily for transportation, but \n     the internal combustion engine has been refined to its limit. \n     Further reductions in transportation pollution can come only \n     from abandoning petroleum and developing nonpolluting power \n     systems for cars and trucks. Recharging batteries for \n     electric cars will simply transfer pollution from mobile to \n     centralized sources unless the centralized source of \n     electricity is nuclear. Fuel cells, which are now approaching \n     commercialization, may be a better solution. Because fuel \n     cells generate electricity directly from gaseous or liquid \n     fuels, they can be refueled along the way, much as present \n     internal combustion engines are. When operated on pure \n     hydrogen, fuel cells produce only water as a waste product. \n     Since hydrogen can be generated from water using heat or \n     electricity, one can envisage a minimally polluting energy \n     infrastructure, using hydrogen generated by nuclear power for \n     transportation, nuclear electricity and process heat for most \n     other applications, and natural gas and renewable systems as \n     backups. Such a major commitment to nuclear power could not \n     only halt but eventually even reverse the continuing buildup \n     of carbon in the atmosphere. In the meantime, fuel cells \n     using natural gas could significantly reduce air pollution.\n\n\n                          powering the future\n\n       To meet the world's growing need for energy, the Royal \n     Society and Royal Academy report proposes ``the formation of \n     an international body for energy research and development, \n     funded by contributions from individual nations on the basis \n     of GDP or total national energy consumption.'' The body would \n     be ``a funding agency supporting research, development and \n     demonstrators elsewhere, not a research center itself.'' Its \n     budget might build to an annual level of some $25 billion, \n     ``roughly one percent of the total global energy budget.'' If \n     it truly wants to develop efficient and responsible energy \n     supplies, such a body should focus on the nuclear option, on \n     establishing a secure international nuclear-fuel storage and \n     reprocessing system, and on providing expertise for siting, \n     financing, and licensing modular nuclear power systems to \n     developing nations.\n       According to Arnulf Grubler, Nebojsa Nakicenovic, and David \n     Victor, who study the synamics of energy technologies, ``the \n     share of energy supplied by electricity is growing rapidly in \n     most countries and worldwide.'' Throughout history, humankind \n     has gradually decarbonized its dominant fuels, moving \n     steadily away from the more polluting, carbon-rich sources. \n     Thus the world has gone from coal (which has one hydrogen \n     atom per carbon atom and was dominant from 1880 to 1950) to \n     oil (with two hydrogens per carbon, dominant from 1950 to \n     today). Natural gas (four hydrogens per carbon) is steadily \n     increasing its market share. But nuclear fission produces no \n     carbon at all.\n       Physical reality--not arguments about corporate greed, \n     hypothetical risks, radiation exposure, or waste disposal--\n     ought to inform decisions vital to the future of the world. \n     Because diversity and redundancy are important for safety and \n     security, renewable energy source ought to retain a place in \n     the energy economy of the century to come. But nuclear power \n     should be central. Despite its outstanding record, it has \n     instead been relegated by its opponents to the same twilight \n     zone of contentions ideological conflict as abortion and \n     evolution. It deserves better. Nuclear power is \n     environmentally safe, practical, and affordable. It is not \n     the problem--it is one of the best solutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S158-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S158-S160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 148\n\n  At the request of Mr. L.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to \nrecognize the Weyerhaeuser Company's 100th anniversary on Tuesday, \nJanuary 18, 2000.\n  In 1990, a group of investors led by Frederick Weyerhaeuser \nincorporated the Weyerhaeuser Company. With three employees in Tacoma, \nWashington, Weyerhaeuser began one hundred years of expansion and \ngrowth across our State, Nation and international borders. Today, \nWeyerhaeuser is the world's largest owner of softwood timber, and the \nlargest producer and distributor of engineered wood products.\n  An economic pillar in the Northwest and throughout the nation, \nWeyerhaeuser employs over 45,000 people. The company's current success \nis directly related to its commitment to sustainable forestry and \ncommunity involvement. Frederick Weyerhaeuser's founding vision is \ncaptured in his statement ``this is not for us, it is for our \nchildren.'' Steven R. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's current chairman, CEO, and \npresident has committed the company to ``safety and to being a good \ncorporate citizen. Weyerhaeuser continues to manage woodlands to \nsustain the supply of wood and protect the ecosystem.'' Through product \nresearch, Weyerhaeuser has successfully developed new products and \nservices to meet changing customer demands.\n  Dedicated to the communities which support it, Weyerhaeuser has \ndistributed over $127 million to communities for educational, \nenvironmental and other programs. Through the years, Weyerhaeuser has \nsupported recycling programs becoming the third largest recycler in the \nNation. The company's 24 recycling facilities collect nearly four \nmillion tons of paper each year. In 1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washington \nstate erupted, destroying thousands of acres of forest. Weyerhaeuser \nsalvaged timber and replanted 18 million seedlings in the volcanic \narea. The company joined the Department of Transportation to create the \nvisitor center at Mt. St. Helens which educates people about the \nenvironment.\n  Over the years, Weyerhaeuser has become an international trade leader \nand an engine adding to the economic success of Washington state and \nthe entire nation. I would like to congratulate the Weyerhaeuser Team \non its past 100 years of business success. I know their innovation will \ncarry them through the next century, and I look forward to the benefits \nWeyerhaeuser will continue to bring to the people of Washington \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S161-4", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S161-S162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WINI YUNKER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na fine Kentuckian, Wini Yunker, as she prepares to serve the Peace \nCorps in the Ukraine.\n  Choosing to serve in the Peace Corps is an admirable decision for \nanyone to make but, especially for Ms. Yunker, who is making this \ndecision later in life. At a time in her life when most people are \nbeginning to think of retirement and slowing the pace of their lives, \nMs. Yunker is instead boldly venturing out on a new journey. She is \nreaching high for a new goal that will not only make a lasting impact \non her own life, but also on the lives of those she leaves the country \nto help.\n  Ms. Yunker enters the Peace Corps with the benefit of a lifetime of \nlearning and preparation, making her an ideal candidate for service. \nShe completed the necessary academic requirements by earning a college \ndegree, and further earned a master's degree from the Patterson School \nof Diplomacy and International Commerce at the University of Kentucky.\n  The Peace Corps was created in 1961, by President John F. Kennedy, \nand is an international service organization dedicated to helping \ndeveloping countries. My wife, Elaine L. Chao, headed the Peace Corps \nfrom 1991 to 1992, and it was under her tenure that service programs in \nthe newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, including \nUkraine, began. We take great personal pleasure that Ms. Yunker, a \nfellow Kentuckian, will be working in a service program Elaine helped \ncreate. Elaine's leadership of the Peace Corps made us both acutely \naware of the kind of committed, hands-on approach to service that \nparticipation in the Corps entails. We applaud you, Ms. Yunker, for \naccepting the challenges the Peace Corps will surely present you over \nthe next two years. The commitment you have made is admirable and your \npassion to serve others is an example to us all.\n  Congratulations, Ms. Yunker, on your acceptance into the Peace Corps, \nand thank you for your enthusiastic willingness to serve. On behalf of \nmyself, my wife, and my colleagues in the United States Senate, I wish \nyou the all the best.\n  Madam President, I ask that a Louisville Courier-Journal article from \nJanuary 18, 2000, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Jan. 18, 2000]\n\n              Woman Rejected in '61 Gets Into Peace Corps\n\n                           (By Chris Poynter)\n\n       Nicholasville, KY.--Thirty-nine years ago, the Peace Corps \n     told Wini Yunker no.\n       She didn't have enough education, the Peace Corps said.\n       But it has now learned that you don't tell Wini Yunker no.\n       She graduated from college at age 58. She learned to ski a \n     year later.\n       At 60, she earned a master's degree from the Patterson \n     School of Diplomacy and International Commerce at the \n     University of Kentucky.\n       Now, at 65, she's set to leave her home in Nicholasville to \n     finally join the Peace Corps.\n       At the end of the month, she'll join 30 other Peace Corps \n     volunteers who are teaching Ukrainians how to run a business \n     in a free-market democracy, rather than under communism; the \n     country was a republic of the former Soviet Union until 1991.\n       Yunker, born and raised in Nicholasville, just south of \n     Lexington, said she's joining the Peace Corps because she \n     wants a challenge, enjoys teaching and will feel good about \n     helping a country become more democratic.\n       ``I'm ready for a new phase in my life,'' she said.\n       The response is typical Yunker, who zigs when others zag. \n     She's never been one to sit around and wait for life to come \n     to her.\n       Some of her relatives think she's insane for leaving the \n     comfort of her home and family to spend two years in an \n     emerging democracy, where the winters are brutally cold.\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\n       Her brother-in-law tried to discourage her, sending her \n     this rhyme: ``If you have any sense in your brain, you will \n     stay away from the Ukraine.''\n       Yunker is one of a number of senior citizens who are \n     joining the Peace Corps, which since its inception in 1961 \n     has been populated mainly by freshly minted college \n     graduates. The volunteers dedicate two years of their lives \n     to working in developing countries.\n       When the Peace Corps was created by President John F. \n     Kennedy, few members were senior citizens. This year, 7 \n     percent--476--of the volunteers are over 50. Brendan Daly, a \n     spokesman for the agency, said that figure has hovered \n     between 6 percent and 8 percent in the 1990s, in part because \n     seniors are more active and more educated than ever and are \n     looking for something unusual to do.\n       In some respects, senior volunteers are better prepared \n     than younger people. They have a wealth of life experiences \n     to share and are enthusiastic about becoming part of a new \n     culture, Daly said.\n       ``They may not be the youngest in years, but they are the \n     youngest in heart,'' he said.\n       Yunker definitely fits that description. Three years ago, \n     she and her only child, 22-year-old Joe, rappelled off the \n     scenic cliffs of Red River Gorge in Eastern Kentucky.\n       A colleague at work nicknamed her ``Flash'' because she's \n     always darting around the factory at Sargent & Greenleaf in \n     Nicholasville, which makes high-security locks for banks, \n     vaults and safes.\n       Yunker will officially retire on Friday, after nearly 17 \n     years with the company. But last Friday, the 160 employees \n     came together to honor Yunker, a silver-haired woman who \n     always wears a cheerful smile and is known for her long, \n     dangling earrings.\n       Yunker is the administrative assistant to company President \n     Jerry Morgan. Morgan told the employees Yunker will be \n     missed. And he noted the she had raised her son in a single-\n     parent home but still found time to earn two degrees, \n     volunteer for the United Way and teach in a literacy program, \n     Operation Read.\n       He presented her with a gold watch before she took the \n     microphone. She cried at times as she read from a prepared \n     speech, and some co-workers dabbed tears from their eyes.\n       Yunker preached about the importance of education and \n     encouraged the company's employees to take advantage of its \n     program that pays for college tuition if they maintain a B \n     average.\n       That's how Yunker earned her marketing degree from Spalding \n     University. Every third weekend for four years, she would \n     drive about 70 miles to downtown Louisville, where she stayed \n     in a dormitory and studied as part of Spalding's weekend \n     program.\n       The entire Sargent & Greenleaf factory helped her earn her \n     degree, she said. Workers in the manufacturing, sales and \n     engineering departments aided her with homework, and Patsy \n     Gray, the woman who hired her, proofread and edited her term \n     papers and essays.\n       While she was a student at Spalding, Yunker remembered that \n     day in 1961 when she was living in Washington and went to \n     Peace Corps headquarters to inquire about joining. The Peace \n     Corps was the idea of President Kennedy who, while \n     campaigning in October 1960, proposed an international \n     volunteer organization. Since then, more than 155,000 \n     Americans, including 1,079 Kentuckians, have traveled across \n     the globe, helping people in villages, towns, and cities with \n     education, health, transportation, business and other needs.\n       Yunker remembers being disappointed when she was turned \n     away in 1961 because she didn't have a college degree. So, \n     after graduating from Spalding, she called to see if the \n     Peace Corps still existed. When she learned it did, she began \n     planning to join in seven years, when she would retire and \n     her son would be old enough to live alone. A Peace Corps \n     official suggested she earn a master's degree in the \n     meantime. She did.\n       In 1998, she applied to the Peace Corps and had her \n     employers and others write letters of recommendation. Last \n     October, she learned that she had been accepted, but with \n     some conditions.\n       For health reasons, she had to have three of her teeth, \n     which had been capped, either replaced or removed. She chose \n     removal to save money. She also had to have a bunion removed \n     from one foot.\n       About the same time, Yunker decided to stop coloring her \n     gray hair black. ``I just decided I can't continue to be that \n     vain if I'm going to be in a foreign country,'' she said.\n       On Jan. 31, she'll fly to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, and \n     take a bus to Cherkassy, a city of about 300,000 where she'll \n     live with a family for four months while studying the \n     language and culture eight hours a day. Then, she'll go to a \n     university--she doesn't know which one or where--to teach \n     business.\n       Her biggest concern is learning the language. She's not \n     worried about the teaching. For six years, she had \n     volunteered for Operation Read, and she recently taught \n     English to a Korean immigrant who lives in Nicholasville.\n       ``When we started in June, she couldn't speak English at \n     all. And of course, I don't speak Korean,'' Yunker said. \n     ``And now, we can talk about even personal things and have \n     conversations on the phone.''\n       Velma J. Miller is among Yunker's co-workers concerned \n     about her living in Ukraine.\n       Miller said Yunker, a longtime friend, is the kind of \n     person who brought fresh flowers, food and cards when Miller \n     was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer in 1998.\n       When Miller learned that Yunker had to have three teeth \n     removed, she pulled her aside in the restroom and asked, \n     ``Wini, do you reckon that God's trying to tell you not to \n     go?''\n       Yunker said her only worry is her five siblings, all of \n     whom are older. She made each promise not to get sick while \n     she was away.\n       Likewise, Yunker's son is worried, but also excited for his \n     mother. Joe Yunker, an emergency medical technician in \n     Jessamine County, said he knows that being a Peace Corps \n     volunteer is one of his mother's life dreams. He's heard \n     about it since he was 11.\n       ``My mom can do anything,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S162-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S162-S163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ``SAINT'' RITA\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this month, the Burlington \nFree Press chose for its 1999 Vermonter of the Year, a woman who is \nwidely recognized as the guardian angel of the homeless in Vermont, \nRita Markley. For as long as I have known her, Rita has been a \npassionate, articulate, and very vocal advocate for our most needy \nresidents. She has raised awareness that even in Vermont, there are \npeople without a roof over their heads, and most importantly, that \nthese people have names, and faces, and that many of them are children. \nThey could not have a better defender. I would like to have printed in \nthe Record the text of the Burlington Free Press article announcing the \nselection of Rita as Vermonter of the Year, and offer my \ncongratulations and sincere thanks to our very own ``Saint'' Rita \nMarkley. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article reads as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 1, 2000]\n\n               COTS Director Is Our Vermonter of the Year\n\n                          (By Stephen Kieman)\n\n       They are the problem the world's richest country pretends \n     it doesn't have. Curled up in doorways, or killing time on \n     street corners, they are the vision more fortunate Vermonters \n     have learned to look past.\n       In a booming economy, they are the bust. Amid records on \n     Wall Street, they sleep on Main Street.\n       They are the homeless. And Rita Markley does not look past \n     them. She does not pretend they do not exist. Most of all, \n     she does not stop believing in them.\n       As director of the Committee on Temporary Shelter, the \n     largest program for helping homeless people in Vermont, \n     Markley provides them with shelter, and then a way up.\n       For her exemplary advocacy on behalf of homeless people, \n     for her unstinting attention to an urgent social issue, and \n     for her success in building a more aware and compassionate \n     community, Rita Markley is The Burlington Free Press \n     Editorial Board's choice for Vermonter of the Year.\n\n\n                             a new problem\n\n       COTS began providing shelter on Christmas Eve, 1982. \n     Homelessness in Vermont is that recent a phenomenon. Last \n     year more than 4,000 Vermonters lacked housing at some point. \n     Most of them turned to COTS.\n       In 1999, COTS provided 10,723 bed nights to people who \n     otherwise would have slept in a car or on the street. COTS \n     also gave shelter to nearly 300 families--including 534 \n     children.\n       Indeed one of Markley's achievements has been educating \n     Vermonters about who homeless people are. Granted, some are \n     the bothersome substance abusers who elicit little sympathy, \n     but that is a shrinking proportion.\n       Many homeless people are veterans. Many are victims of the \n     national trend to close mental hospitals and other \n     institutions, who have not subsequently received sufficient \n     community services.\n       Mostly, the homeless are people that Vermonters in good \n     homes interact with all the time--at restaurants, at cash \n     registers, in hotels. Though this work formerly paid enough \n     to support people, today a full-time job is no guarantee of a \n     place to live.\n       Of the families who needed COTS last year, half had at \n     least one person working. Yet wages at entry level jobs have \n     fallen so far behind the cost of living in Vermont, the \n     number of homeless families has quadrupled in only four \n     years.\n       Meanwhile the federal government, which used to build \n     affordable housing units by the tens of thousands, has \n     stopped. Urban renewal programs have demolished low-income \n     housing, worsening the supply shortage.\n       Housing development has focused on higher priced homes; the \n     state's median house selling price rose 20 percent this \n     decade, placing a solution farther out of reach.\n       The Clinton administration has responded by expanding \n     rental assistance money. But in Vermont, roughly 1,000 people \n     eligible for these funds face a major obstacle: no eligible \n     apartments available. Burlington has it worst, with a vacancy \n     rate near zero.\n\n\n                           More than shelter\n\n       Markley came to COTS as a part-timer who wanted to write \n     fiction. Now she is a full-time champion of people who \n     otherwise would not have a voice--or a place to go.\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\n       COTS offers much more than a meal and a bed, though. It \n     provides a continuum of services: health care, child care, \n     job training, coaching for interviews, help with school, \n     summer programs for children, mental health counseling, and \n     on and on. For those who strive, these programs are a strong \n     ladder into good housing and greater opportunities.\n       Most importantly, COTS offers its clients hope--that they \n     can escape dependency and attain self-sufficiency. ``Rita \n     believes in the resourcefulness of the human spirit,'' said \n     United Way executive director Gretchen Morse. ``She never \n     falters on that.''\n       It works. Seventy percent of the people who complete COTS' \n     training programs have a job and stable housing a year later. \n     A new effort to link apartment hunters with landlords who \n     accept federal subsidies has found 40 individuals and 60 \n     families a place to live--even in this no-vacancy market.\n       COTS has therefore earned the national accolades that have \n     poured in from advocacy groups and the U.S. Department of \n     Housing.\n\n\n                          compassion, ability\n\n       With so serious a problem affecting so vital a need of a \n     population growing so quickly, you might expect their \n     strongest advocate to be strident or self-righteous. In \n     Markley's case, a better description would be jokester \n     chocaholic.\n       Yes, she is capable of speaking with passion at COTS' \n     annual candlelight vigil. Yes, she is articulate in the \n     Statehouse and before community leaders. And yes, sometimes \n     she is angry about Washington's indifference to the people \n     who are not sharing in the nation's prosperity.\n       But Markley uses irreverent humor to protect her from the \n     sometimes grimness of her task, and to thwart burnout. She is \n     quick to praise others, and effusive in her thanks.\n       As a result she has made homelessness something Vermonters \n     cannot ignore. Some 180 businesses support COTS financially \n     or with in-kind services. Some 1,500 Vermonters walk for COTS \n     each May. That means Markley is helping cultivate compassion \n     across the community, a good deed that extends far beyond the \n     mission of COTS.\n       It also means COTS has steadily diminished its reliance on \n     government's help, now receiving two-thirds of it's funding \n     from other sources. Services are not tailored to the \n     eligibility requirements of some grant, but to what a \n     homeless person actually needs.\n       Markley draws on a wealth of skills in her work. Sometimes \n     she is the passionate advocate. Sometimes she is the skilled \n     policy wonk. Sometimes she is the light-hearted comic who \n     brings chocolate to a potentially controversial meeting.\n       Sister Lucille Bonvouloir, a founder of COTS, tells a story \n     that reveals a seemingly bottomless reservoir of compassion \n     and ability. A woman came into COTS in the 1980's and no one \n     could communicate with her. Everyone wondered why the woman \n     would not speak. Then Markley entered the room, and in a \n     matter of minutes they had struck up a lively conversation.\n       In Russian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S163-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE EMPLOYEES OF CATERPILLAR\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, every once in awhile, we are \nreminded that all the important issues we are working on pale in \ncomparison to the countless acts of charity and compassion that occur \nall across America on a daily basis. I want to recount for my \ncolleagues one such act, which occurred in my home state of Georgia, \nappropriately enough, during the holiday season--an act that puts a \nhuman face on the compassion that is innate in the American people.\n  A.J. Bentley III, 3\\1/2\\ years old, is a constituent of mine who is \ndying of brain cancer. While A.J.'s prognosis looks bleak, the disease \nhas not taken away his passion and fascination with tractors, farm and \nearth moving equipment--the kind which Georgia is blessed to have \nplenty. Upon learning of A.J.'s terminal illness, our office contacted \nthe good people at Caterpillar to see what they could do to lift the \nspirits of a dying boy and his family. Caterpillar reacted without \nhesitation and pulled out all of the stops. First, Caterpillar offered \nto have A.J. tour their plant in Peoria, Illinois so he could see first \nhand how all the equipment was built and how it worked. Unfortunately, \nA.J.'s medical condition prevented him from being able to fly to \nIllinois. Plan ``B'' was to have A.J. visit the Forest Products \nDivision of Caterpillar in LaGrange, Georgia. On the day his dream \nwould be fulfilled, A.J. was not feeling well and unable to make the 1 \nhour drive to LaGrange. Undeterred, the people of Caterpillar would not \nlet A.J.'s illness keep them from fulfilling his dream. Because \neveryone at the LaGrange plant wanted a chance to help, there was a \nlottery that day in LaGrange. The grand prize was the chance to drive \nto A.J.'s hometown of Thomaston, Georgia and make his dream come true \nin person. The lucky few saw first-hand the joy of a young boy, decked \nout in his Caterpillar hat and playing on his new Caterpillar equipment \nthat he loves so much. As the group was leaving to return to LaGrange, \nA.J. waved good-bye, then with a burst of energy proclaimed ``this is \nthe best day of my life''. All who helped make this possible, I know, \nfeel their own happiness that words could never adequately express.\n  There are days when all we seem to hear about is how people have \nbecome so self-absorbed in their own lives. I offer this example as a \ncase in point of the compassion and good will that exists in LaGrange, \nin Georgia, and all across this Nation--people who are making a \ndifference on a daily basis--one child, one American at a time. I \nsalute the people of Caterpillar and I am humbled by their act of \nkindness. I know I speak for all of us when I say, A.J. has touched all \nof our hearts and he and his family will always be in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S163-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S163-S164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. M. GAZI YASARGIL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe achievements of a distinguished member of the Arkansas medical \ncommunity. Dr. M. Gazi Yasargil is recognized worldwide for his work in \nthe field of Neurosurgery and we in Arkansas are fortunate to benefit \nfrom his talents. Dr. Yasargil's contributions to his field were \nrecently acclaimed when Neurosurgery, the official journal of the \nCongress of Neurological Surgeons, recognized him as ``The Man of the \nCentury.'' This honor acknowledges Dr. Yasargil's significant impact on \nthe field of neurosurgery in the second half of the 20th century.\n  Professor Yasargil received his medical degree from the University of \nBasel, Switzerland, in 1950. Following his residency in neuroanatomy, \npsychiatry and neurology, internal medicine and general surgery, he \nbegan his training in neurosurgery in 1953 with Professor H. Krayenbuhl \nat the University Hospital, Zurich.\n  During the first decade of his career Professor Yasargil was involved \nwith the development of cerebral angiography, publishing two monographs \nwith his teacher, Professor H. Krayenbuhl. He introduced stereotactic \nsurgery and high-frequency coagulation technique into Switzerland and \noperated on 800 patients for movement disorders. Additionally, Yasargil \nroutinely performed all types of conventional neurosurgical procedures \non both children and adults. Professor Yasargil spent 14 months in \n1965-66 with Professor RMP Donaghy, in the Neurosurgical Department, \nUniversity of Burlington, Vermont, where he learned microsurgical \ntechniques in the animal laboratory, and developed microvascular \nsurgery of brain arteries in animals. Upon his return to Zurich he \nbegan to apply the microtechnique to the entire field of neurosurgery. \nHe developed the counter balanced operating microscope and numerous \nmicrosurgical instruments and vascular clips; he pioneered \nmicrosurgical approaches and treatments for occluded brain arteries, \nintracranial aneurysms, AVMs, caveronmas, and extrinsic and intrinsic \ntumors of the brain and spinal cord, in 7000 adults and 400 children. \nHis surgical experiences have been published in 330 papers. The six \nvolume publication Microneurosurgery is the comprehensive review of his \nbroad experiences.\n  In 1973, Professor Yasargil became Chairman and Director of the \nDepartment of Neurosurgery, University Hospital, Zurich, until his \nretirement in 1993. He was President of the Neurosurgical Society of \nSwitzerland 1973-75. Professor Yasargil has been awarded with honorary \nmedical degrees by the Universities of Ankara and Istanbul in Turkey, \nalso with honorary citizenship of Austin, Texas, and Urgup, Turkey, and \nhonorary membership in 15 international medical societies. Professor \nYasargil has received major awards and prizes including the highly \nregarded Marcel Benoit Prize from the Swiss Federal Government in 1975, \nMedal of Honor of the University of Naples, Italy, in 1988, Gold Medal \nof the World Federation of Neurological Societies in 1997, and he was \nhonored as ``Neurosurgeon of the Century'' by the Brazilian \nNeurosurgical Society in 1998.\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\n  In 1994 Professor Yasargil accepted an appointment as Professor of \nNeurosurgery at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) \nin Little Rock where today he is active in the practice of \nmicroneurosurgery, research, and teaching. At UAMS, Dr. Yasargil has \nconsistently provided superior treatment and care, attracting patients \nfrom all over the world. At the same time, he has continued to guide \nground-breaking research initiatives and develop innovative surgical \nprocedures.\n  Madam President, I take great pride in recognizing Dr. Yasargil's \ncontributions to the quality of the lives of so many people in my home \nstate and others around the world. I am equally proud of the quality \ncare and cutting edge medical service the people at the University of \nArkansas Medical Sciences provide so that Dr. Yasargil can share his \ntalents. UAMS has been the state's primary source for healthcare \neducation, biomedical and biotechnology research and clinical care for \nmore than 100 years. The quality work and service that UAMS and Dr. \nYasargil continue to provide should be a great source of pride for \nArkansans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S164-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO C.M. NEWTON\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy friend and fellow Kentuckian C.M. Newton on the occasion of his \nretirement as Athletics Director at the University of Kentucky.\n  C.M. Newton has made contributions to the University that are as \ngreat in number as they are significant in accomplishment in his 11 \nyears as Wildcats Athletics Director. The positive changes and \nimprovements he implemented over the years culminate into an unmatched \nlegacy of excellence for C.M. and for the entire University of Kentucky \ncommunity.\n  C.M.'s involvement with the Wildcats began long before his tenure as \nAthletics Director. He attended U.K. and received a bachelor's degree \nin 1952, and earned a masters degree in 1957. During his undergraduate \nyears, C.M. played on the Wildcats basketball team and lettered on \ntheir 1951 NCAA championship team. He also pitched for the U.K. \nbaseball team, and played quarterback for a Wildcats intramural \nfootball team.\n  In the years between his graduation from the University of Kentucky \nand his return in 1989, C.M. began his professional career in \nathletics. While serving in the Air Force in 1953, C.M. held his first \nofficial leadership position in athletics as the athletic officer for \nAndrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. He served as head basketball \ncoach with Transylvania University, the University of Alabama, and \nVanderbilt University, with a lifetime coaching record of 509 wins and \n375 losses. He also served as Assistant Commissioner for the \nSoutheastern Conference (SEC). C.M. approached these positions of \nleadership with a vigor, integrity, and enthusiasm that the world of \nsports took notice of by naming him Associated Press Southeastern \nConference Coach of the Year in 1972, 1976, 1988 and 1989 and United \nPress International SEC Coach of the Year in 1972, 1978, and 1988.\n  C.M. also achieved a number of other honors, including membership on \nthe Board of Directors of the National Association of Basketball \nCoaches, Chairman of the NCAA Basketball Rules Committee, Vice \nPresident and President of USA Basketball, Chairman of the USA \nBasketball Games Committee, membership in the NCAA Division I \nBasketball Committee, Chairman of the NCAA Basketball Officiating \nCommittee, and membership on the FIBA Central Board.\n  It was with this vast list of accomplishments and honors that C.M. \nchose to return to the University of Kentucky on April 1, 1989. C.M. \nhit the ground running as Athletics Director and with his already well-\nestablished reputation for excellence and integrity, brought winning \ncoaches and players to the Wildcats athletics programs. During C.M.'s \nleadership at U.K., the basketball and football teams soared, the men's \nand women's soccer teams received national attention, and the program \ngrew to include 22 varsity sports--more than any other school in the \nSEC. The Wildcats athletic budget has more than tripled under C.M.'s \ntenure, allowing the school to expand and renovate several of the \ncampus athletic facilities.\n  More than anything, though, C.M. Newton rejuvenated an excitement \nabout athletics at the University of Kentucky. He led the Wildcats in a \nway that commanded respect--he led with dignity and embodied integrity.\n  Thank you, C.M., for your 11 years of dedicated service to the \nUniversity of Kentucky, which resulted in winning teams, winning kids, \nand a top-quality program. Your spirit and legacy will continue to \ndrive the Wildcats to victory for years to come. Best wishes in your \nretirement and may God bless you, Evelyn, and your family in this next \nphase of your life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S164-2", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HAZEL WOLF\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is with great respect and \nadmiration that I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Hazel Wolf, of \nSeattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 101 on Wednesday, \nJanuary 19, 2000. A tireless advocate for conservation and social \njustice, Ms. Wolf was an outstanding example for all Americans. She \ncombined humor with persistence as she set about combating injustice. \nShe will continue to live in the hearts and minds of the many who knew \nher. And there are many, for Hazel had the remarkable ability to engage \njust about anyone, from Senator to second grader.\n  Hazel Wolf was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on March 10, 1898. \nIn 1923, she moved to the United States with her daughter, Nydia. She \nwas a union organizer for the Works Progress Administration and avidly \nfollowed politics, eventually becoming a Democrat. Until 1965, she \nworked as a legal secretary for the Seattle civil rights lawyer John \nCaughlan. It wasn't until her retirement that she became such an \ninvolved environmental activist and leader.\n  Ms. Wolf began working with the Audubon Society in the early-1960s \nand helped start 21 of the 26 Audubon Society chapters in Washington \nState. In 1979, she worked to organize the first statewide conference \nto bring together environmentalists and Native American tribes, the \nIndian Conservationist Conference. She served as Secretary of the \nSeattle Audubon Society chapter for three decades, and for 17 years she \nedited an environmental newsletter, `Outdoors West'. In 1990, her \ndiscussions with a Soviet delegation led to the creation of the \nLeningrad Audubon Society in Russia. Ms. Wolf was also a founder of \nSeattle's Community Coalition for Environmental Justice, which works to \nimprove environmental safety in poor city neighborhoods. She also \nbelonged to the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Earth Island Institute. \nMs. Wolf was a frequent and favorite speaker at schools and \nenvironmental conferences throughout the Northwest.\n  In 1997, the National Audubon Society awarded her the prestigious \nAudubon Medal, for Excellence in Environmental Achievement. She \nreceived numerous other awards, including the State of Washington \nEnvironmental Excellence Award, the National Audubon Society's \nConservationist of the Year Award and the Washington State Legislature \nAward for environmental work. To celebrate her 100th birthday in 1998, \nthe Seattle Audubon chapter created the Hazel Wolf ``Kids for the \nEnvironment'' endowment, which will fund programs to provide urban \nchildren from lower-income communities with opportunities to experience \nthe natural world. In Issaquah, Washington, there is a 116-acre wetland \nnamed after her. On the other side of the Cascade Mountains near \nYakima, a bird sanctuary bears her name.\n  Hazel Wolf served as the environmental conscience of the Northwest, \nwith her dedication to protecting forests, saving salmon, educating \nyoung people and preserving the outdoors for future generations to \nenjoy. The most significant and important tribute we can give to Hazel \nWolf is to continue the work which she pursued with such vision and \npassion. We will miss you Hazel, but rest assured, we will continue the \nwork you started.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/01/31/senate-section/article/S165-1", "month": "01", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S165]]\n             AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
