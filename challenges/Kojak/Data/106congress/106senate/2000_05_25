Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about an issue \nthat is going to consume, over the next couple years, a fair amount of \nthis body's time. If there were a contest to name a foreign policy \nissue that just won't go away, national missile defense would surely be \na top contender.\n  The United States has been researching, developing, and sometimes \ndeploying ballistic missile defense systems for almost 40 years now. \nThroughout this period, the issues of whether to deploy such a system \nand what system to deploy have prompted intense and often partisan \ndebate. That debate continues today.\n  Two events this week argue strongly, however, for a pause in the \npartisan wrangling that so often accompanies this debate. The first \nevent was Gov. George W. Bush's call on Tuesday for the President of \nthe United States ``not to make a hasty decision, on a political \ntimetable'' regarding amendments to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \nand deployment of a national missile defense.\n  Anyone on this floor knows that we voted in the last year, assuming \nthat funds are provided and consistent with a policy of continued \nstrategic arms reductions, to deploy a limited national missile defense \nsystem ``as soon as technologically feasible,'' and the majority of the \nSenate voted for that. There has been a bit of a rush, to use the \nexpression we use on the floor, to take steps by the end of this year \nto ``pour concrete in Alaska.'' That is a euphemism for saying we have \nto put certain radars up in Alaska in order to meet the timetable to \nerect by 2005 a limited national missile defense that will defend \nagainst, theoretically at least, weapons that may or are likely to be \ndeployed by the North Koreans.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the American people don't even know what we \nare talking about because we have not yet debated it, and it is going \nto cost $30 billion at the low end, probably a lot more. They have not \nheard that number before. What has happened is that we have been in a \nheadlong rush to be in a position to be able to deploy that system in \ntime to meet the looming threat from North Korea.\n  Now Governor Bush comes along, the putative candidate for President \nof the\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nUnited States in the Republican Party, and says: Don't make a hasty \ndecision, Mr. President, on a political timetable.\n  Well, really, we are on a political timetable. What is moving this \nnational missile defense proposal forward as rapidly as it has are the \nlikely events in North Korea over the next 5 to 7 years and a political \ntimetable on the part of some of my Republican friends. Fortunately, \nGovernor Bush has stepped in and said: Let's slow all this down; let's \nthink about this. I think we should listen to him.\n  A second event is Secretary of State Albright's journey to Florence, \nItaly, where she is making the case for national missile defense to our \nincreasingly nervous allies, who oppose this notion of a limited \nnational missile defense.\n  What shall we make of Governor Bush's stance on national missile \ndefense? He proposes a missile defense to defend not only the United \nStates but also our allies. That is a different proposal from that \nwhich we have been legislating on for the past 2 years. He also \nproposes not only to defend against missiles from so-called rogue \nstates, such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq--which has been the \nrationale offered as to why we have to move so rapidly toward a \nnational missile defense--but also to protect against accidental \nlaunches from anywhere in the world.\n  If we are to defend our allies as well as ourselves, then we are \ngoing to have to build a much larger missile defense system than the \none being proposed by the Pentagon and the one we have been debating in \nthe Congress for the past year and a half. If we are to defend against \naccidental launches from any country rather than only attacks from a \nspecific state, then we cannot rely upon the sort of land-based or sea-\nbased boost-phase system that I and others have been supporting as a \nmeans of reconciling defense with deterrence, which is different from \nthe system proposed by the Pentagon.\n  Governor Bush stated properly that ``deterrence remains the first \nline of defense against nuclear attack.'' I assume that means he \nbelieves the ABM Treaty is essential, as it is a vital building block \nin that first line of defense against nuclear attack.\n  Governor Bush promised, properly, that if he were elected President, \nhe would consult with our allies as he developed specific missile \ndefense plans. I, too, have been suggesting, to my Senate colleagues \nand in high-level meetings, that we had better darn well understand \nwhat our allies think about this.\n  My good friend, Senator Kyl, who is one of the brighter fellows here \nand who strongly supports national missile defense, said we should not \nlet what our allies have to say affect what we do. I don't think it is \nthat simple. Governor Bush now comes along and says he wants to make \nsure we consult with our allies. That is what he would do first after \nbecoming President. This is clearly something we would want to have \nalready done that before we decided to deploy any such system.\n  The push to deploy a system, without working out something with our \nallies, has not come to fruition yet. But Governor Bush points out \nanother flaw in the argument for proceeding rapidly. He also \nacknowledges the need to convince Russia that the United States' \nmissile defenses would not be aimed at Russia.\n  Governor Bush indicated a willingness to lower U.S. force levels--\nalthough he confuses me. He says ``lower U.S. force levels below the \nSTART II levels.'' We have already basically agreed to that in the \nSTART III framework that was set in 1997. Is he talking about lowering \nU.S. nuclear force levels below the 2,000-to-2,500 figure proposed at \nHelsinki? Or is the suggestion that we lower them only to that level? \nHe was a little unclear in how he stated that, and he leaves me a \nlittle unclear--indeed, totally unclear--as to what he means.\n  Governor Bush also suggests that there is a need to move nuclear \nforces off the hair-trigger alert they are on. I agree. I think he is \nabsolutely right about that. Indeed, Governor Bush stated that ``the \nUnited States should be willing to lead by example'' in this area.\n  At the same time, however, Governor Bush spoke approvingly of ``laser \ntechnology'' and of ``a space-based system.'' Now, this will surely \nstrike others as it did me--as an allusion to Reagan's support for the \n``Star Wars'' system of the 1980s, a notion that has been pretty \nsoundly rejected up until now. It will raise legitimate fears, it seems \nto me, that a missile defense system deployed by the United States, \nwhatever its size at first, would be enlarged to threaten the deterrent \ncapacity of China, and eventually that of Russia.\n  Would Governor Bush withdraw from the ABM Treaty in order to ``fully \nexplore these options?'' To fully explore the options of laser systems, \nof space-based systems--does that mean he is going to withdraw from the \ntreaty he seems to imply is the building block upon which our \ndeterrence rests? Or would he defer any decision on deployment until we \nwere certain that the proposed system would successfully meet all of \nhis criteria? His decision in that regard could determine whether his \nproposal prompted allied support or made them conclude that the United \nStates was choosing missile defense foolishly or recklessly.\n  Admittedly, this was just a press conference, and Governor Bush has \nnot had a chance to flesh this out. But the bottom line is that he is \nsaying: Whoa, slow up, there are a lot of things we haven't answered. \nWe should not keep this on a political timetable.\n  I wonder whether Governor Bush thought through all the implications \nof his missile defense proposals. How would he assure Russia that the \nUnited States would not seek to substitute defense for deterrence--an \nassurance he says is necessary? How would he avoid an arms race between \nChinese missiles and American defenses? Or between China and India? Or \nthen between India and Pakistan?\n  My own view is that the risk of a nuclear arms race in Asia would be \nthe most dangerous consequence of deploying a national missile defense \nthat was not limited to defending against the missiles of specific \ntarget states. I fear that such an arms race would be terribly costly \nand would destabilize China's relations with its neighbors, and that \nthe resulting instability would lead to Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea \nbuilding nuclear weapons. They have the capacity to do that, and I \ntruly believe they might, if an Asian arms race were to occur as a \nresult of our missile defense deployment.\n\n  Last week, the Los Angeles Times reported that a U.S. intelligence \nofficial warned ``that construction of a national missile defense could \ntrigger a wave of destabilizing events around the world and possibly \nendanger relations with European allies.''\n  Possible consequences reportedly include China fielding hundreds more \nmissiles, putting MIRVed warheads on its missiles--which it does not \nhave now--and adding countermeasures. We all know that they are \nmeasures added to a ballistic missile in order to fool any defensive \nsystem. The missile puts out a lot of little things--anything from \nballoons to what most people would think would be just like little \npieces of metal. It is a lot more complicated than that, but the effect \nis to fool the defensive system as to which object has the nuclear \nwarhead. That is what we mean by countermeasures. They are not hard to \nfield. They haven't yet been fielded by China to any significant \ndegree, to the best of our knowledge. But a U.S. intelligence official \nforesees China adding countermeasures to frustrate U.S. defenses and, \nin the words of that intelligence official, ``selling countermeasures \nfor sure'' to countries such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq.\n  This is precisely the sort of concern I have been raising for the \nlast several months. I went to a defense conference in Germany with \nmany of the people in the Senate, in the House, and in the Defense \nDepartment, as well as the defense establishments from all our allied \nnations--even some who are not members of NATO. I raised that very \nquestion there.\n  No one had an answer, I might add, when I raised the question among \nall the defense experts. Everybody is prepared to give an estimate of \nwhat the North Koreans are likely to do in terms of building not only \nnuclear capability, but also the capability to have a missile with a \nthird stage that could reach the continental United States, that could \nnot only carry a nuclear warhead, but also be used in chemical or \nbiological warfare.\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\n  I asked: Can anybody give an estimate to the President as to what the \nChinese would likely do if we deployed a national missile defense \nsystem? They now have fewer than two dozen intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles. That seems to be a pretty good thing to me. I would not like \nto see China go to 200, or 400, or 800, or 1,000, which is fully within \ntheir capacity. I would not like them to do what the L.A. Times reports \nthat a U.S. intelligence official raises as a possibility. I would not \nlike to see them MIRV their warheads. I would not like to see them have \nmore sophisticated nuclear weapons. I kind of like it where they are.\n  Now, I also raised the question, Has anybody calculated or laid out \nfor the President of the United States what the likely scenario is if \nChina were to significantly increase their arsenal? What would happen \nin India? What would happen in Pakistan? Has anybody raised this \npossibility of that being of concern to the Japanese? Well, the truth \nis, no one had an answer.\n  I even went to a high-level meeting in the Defense Department a \ncouple of months ago, with the Secretary of Defense, other high \nofficials, and those in charge of developing this system. I raised the \nsame question again before the Foreign Relations Committee, on which \nthe occupant of the Chair sits. I asked specifically--and he may have \nbeen there--the Director of the CIA if they had done such a study. \nApparently, one is underway. Apparently, people are beginning to focus \non the other side of this equation.\n  The fundamental rationale for our strategic doctrine is to guard \nAmericans from harm, as best we can, to guarantee the security of those \nyoung Senate pages sitting up there and their children and \ngrandchildren. Are we better off with a missile defense system as \ncontemplated and an arms race in Asia, if that were to occur?\n  Or are we better off with the risk that might come from North Korea, \nif they developed a third stage that could reach the United States and \nwe relied instead upon deterrence? I have not made that final judgment \nin my own mind. But I know one thing. We don't have enough information \nnow to make a final judgment.\n  All this leads me to conclude that the risks inherent in doing \nwithout a national missile defense at this moment might be less than \nthe risk we would accept in building either the Pentagon's proposed \nmissile defense or the sort of defenses that Gov. George Bush has \nproposed.\n  Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Adviser in the Ford and \nBush administrations, is also allegedly concerned. The Los Angeles \nTimes reported that he called the scenario of an Asian nuclear arms \nrace ``plausible'' and warned: ``We ought to think whether we want the \nChinese to change their very minimalist strategy.''\n  I know I don't want China to change their minimalist strategy. I \nbelieve anybody who thinks we can affect that outcome would not want \nChina to change its minimalist strategy. I say this--speaking for \nmyself, and clearly not for Brent Scowcroft--not merely because of the \nadded threat that it would pose to the United States of America, but \nalso because of what that would most assuredly cause to happen in \nIndia, and what that almost assuredly would cause to happen in \nPakistan, and elsewhere.\n  Can anyone in this Chamber suggest to me that if China were to change \nin a robust fashion their nuclear strategy, that officials are going to \nsit in Tokyo, and say: You know, let's not worry about this; this is \nnot a problem; we have the American nuclear umbrella? As much as I love \nour Japanese friends and allies, the last thing I want to see come out \nof this debate that we are going to have in the next weeks and months, \nand hopefully next year or so, is a nuclear Japan.\n  I hope General Scowcroft, who is a senior adviser to Governor Bush, \nwill encourage his very important pupil to think carefully about this.\n  Just as I have concerns regarding Gov. Bush's position on national \nmissile defense, so do I have concerns regarding the Pentagon's \nproposed system and the hurried pace at which a deployment decision is \nbeing forced upon the President.\n  Some of my concerns are those of a supporter of arms control, but \nothers relate to the apparent shortcomings of the system the Pentagon \nproposes.\n  Renowned scientists and former defense officials have said that a \nland-based missile defense aimed at incoming warheads cannot do the \njob.\n  The current National Intelligence Estimate on the foreign missile \nthreat to the United States warns:\n\n       We assess that countries developing ballistic missiles \n     would also develop various responses to US theater and \n     national defenses. Russia and China each have developed \n     numerous countermeasures and probably are willing to sell the \n     requisite technologies.\n       Many countries, such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq \n     probably would rely initially on readily available \n     technology--including separating RVs, spin-stabilized RVs, RV \n     reorientation, radar absorbing material . . ., booster \n     fragmentation, low-power jammers, chaff, and simple (balloon) \n     decoys--to develop penetration aids and countermeasures. \n     These countries could develop countermeasures based on these \n     technologies by the time they flight test their missiles.\n\n  Decades ago, when missile defense research began during the Cold War, \nthe goal was not a perfect defense.\n  Rather, the idea was that by limiting our casualties--both in human \nlives and in retaliatory forces--a missile defense would buttress our \nability to fight and win a nuclear war.\n  Missile defense supporters saw such an imperfect national missile \ndefense as a contributor to deterrence, even though the Nixon \nadministration eventually concluded that it was better to bar such \ndefenses than to engage in an arms race involving both offensive and \ndefensive weapons.\n  Modern proposals for a limited national missile defense are very \ndifferent, however. They are aimed at deterring countries that would \nhave no hope of defeating the United States in a nuclear war, but would \nseek to deter or to punish us by building a capability to destroy one \nor more American cities.\n  To defend against those threats, one's defense must be perfect. \nMerely limiting the destruction will not suffice.\n  I wonder whether the operational effectiveness of the Pentagon's \nproposed missile defense will really be sufficient.\n  If a system can kill each warhead 95 percent of the time, then the \nodds are 1 in 3 that an 8-warhead attack will get at least one warhead \nthrough and destroy a U.S. city. If the system can kill each warhead 98 \npercent of the time, there will still be a 1-in-3 chance that an attack \nwith 21 warheads will get at least one bomb through.\n  In the days when the Presiding Officer and I were younger men, there \nused to be a bumper sticker that people would put on their car: ``One \nnuclear bomb can ruin your day''--one warhead getting through. If the \nobjective is to deter against any of these rogue states, a missile \ndefense must be perfect.\n  Missile defense supporters cite the need to avoid being blackmailed \nby North Korea or Iraq. But I find it hard to see how a national \nmissile defense will give us freedom of action in Korea or the Middle \nEast, if there is still one chance in 3, or even one chance in 5, that \na modest attack will wipe out a whole American city.\n  In light of that reality, it is equally hard to understand the \nPentagon's commitment to the proposed system, except as the product of \nbureaucratic inertia and political pressure to deploy the first system \nit could find.\n  When the Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on missile defense \nlast year, I asked all our witnesses--both supporters and opponents of \nnational missile defense--whether they would support a system limited \nto that which the Pentagon proposes. Not one of them, proponent or \nopponent, was prepared to do so.\n  Two commissions chaired by Gen. Larry Welch, former Chief of Staff of \nthe Air Force, have criticized the testing program for the Pentagon's \nnational missile defense system. The term ``rush to failure'' has \nbecome part of our everyday vocabulary. We should be equally attentive \nto Gen. Welch's warning that we are unprepared to determine the \n``deployment readiness'' of national missile defense, despite the name \nof the Defense Department's forthcoming review.\n  The Pentagon's director of operational test and evaluation has voiced \nsimilar concerns regarding the limits of our national missile defense \ntesting program.\n  His concerns were seconded last month by the American Physical \nSociety, which warned:\n\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\n\n       A decision on whether or not to deploy the NMD is scheduled \n     for the next few months. The tests that have been conducted \n     or are planned for the period fall far short of those \n     required to provide confidence in the ``technical \n     feasibility'' called for in last year's NMD deployment \n     legislation.\n\nThe American Physical Society is the premier professional group for \nphysicists in this country. They take no stand on national missile \ndefense itself. They deserve our bi-partisan attention.\n  In recent weeks, former senior officials have counseled delay. Listen \nto President Reagan's former National Security Advisor, Robert \nMcFarlane: ``Still more work is needed before a decision on deployment \nis made.''\n  Listen to President Carter's former National Security Advisor, \nZbigniew Brzezinski:\n\n       The bottom line is that at this stage there is no urgent \n     strategic need for a largely domestically driven decision \n     regarding the deployment of the national missile defense.\n       The issue should be left to the next president--to be \n     resolved after consensus is reached with our allies both in \n     Europe and in the Far East, after more credible evidence \n     becomes available regarding the technical feasibility and \n     probable costs of the national missile defense, and after \n     compelling intelligence estimates are aired regarding the \n     origin, scale and timing of likely new threats to the United \n     States and its allies.\n\n  In a forthcoming article, former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown \nwrites: ``deployment of the present NMD system should be deferred.'' He \nis joined in that recommendation by two former Deputy Secretaries of \nDefense, John Deutch and John White.\n  Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger says: ``In the light of \nrecent ambiguous test results and imminent electoral preoccupations, it \nwould be desirable to delay a final technical judgment until a new \nadministration is in place.''\n  As we all know, the motivations behind these bi-partisan \nrecommendations are often very divergent.\n  Many Republicans fear that President Clinton will purposely strike a \ndeal with Russia to limit U.S. missile defenses to an ineffective \nsystem, hoping that such a deal will make it politically untenable for \na Republican president, were one to be elected, to go beyond it.\n  I do not share those fears. The Administration has made clear to \nRussians and Republicans alike that its proposed ABM Treaty protocol \nwould be only a first step.\n  My fear is rather that the President will be sandwiched: between \nRussia, which doubts both our intent to deploy a missile defense system \nand our willingness to limit it; and Republicans, who have tried to \nmake this a partisan campaign issue and have even urged Russian \nofficials not to negotiate with the President of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  My fear is that the President--in order to show Russia that he is \nserious, and under pressure from Republicans accusing the \nAdministration of being ``soft'' on the issue--will order the Defense \nDepartment to proceed with the deployment of a system that all of us \nknow is the wrong one to build.\n  The time has come to set our fears aside. The fact is that, whatever \nour views on the wisdom of putting our trust in a national missile \ndefense, many of us oppose the system proposed by the Pentagon.\n  Whatever our views on the larger issues, many of us would be content \nif the President were to defer both a deployment decision and the \nchoice of a missile defense architecture, and let his successor grapple \nwith those issues.\n  It is also a fact, however, that the President has been under \npolitical pressure to proceed with deployment, despite the technical \nand strategic concerns that many of us share.\n  If missile defense supporters maintain that pressure, they increase \nthe risk that a poor system will be deployed, rather than one that \nmeets our country's needs by any rational measure.\n  I therefore call on the two major presidential campaigns--that of \nGov. Bush and that of Vice President Gore--to agree not to seek \npartisan advantage if the President defers a missile defense deployment \ndecision.\n  I call on all of us in the Congress to give the President the freedom \nof action to make his decision without political sniping.\n  I also call on both campaigns to agree that negotiations for a path-\nbreaking START III agreement should continue. Gov. Bush stated that he \nwould:\n\n       . . . ask the Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment \n     of our nuclear force posture and determine how best to meet \n     our security needs . . . [and] pursue the lowest possible \n     number consistent with our national security.\n\n  He added that ``the United States should remove as many weapons as \npossible from high alert, high-trigger status, another unnecessary \nvestige of Cold War confrontation.''\n  There is no reason to defer these two ideas until next year.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff has said that it cannot go below the \nHelsinki target of 2,000 to 2,500 warheads for a START III agreement \nunless the President changes the nuclear targeting guidance.\n  Gov. Bush has implied that he would seek the Pentagon's advice on \nalternatives to that guidance, however, and President Clinton should do \nthe same.\n  In summary, the longest-lasting foreign policy debate is not likely \nto be settled any time soon. There is widespread agreement, however, \nthat we should not let this debate lead us into unwise decisions.\n  With goodwill on both sides, we have an opportunity to suspend the \npartisan wrangling and let our current and future leaders make their \ndecisions in a rational way. Let us all work together to achieve that \nshared objective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4402-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4402-S4405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to talk a little bit about the \nthings we have accomplished in this last session of the Congress, the \nfirst year, which is over. We are into the second year of this 106th \nCongress.\n  We are having a little problem moving along, of course, and we are \ntrying to find a way to avoid holding up progress after the filing of \nunrelated amendments that have turned out to be filibusters. I hope we \ncan get around that and move forward with the 13 appropriations bills \nwe have.\n  We ought to recognize this has been a productive session. We have \ndone a great deal. But there are a number of things I think are of \nparticular importance to the American people. One, obviously, is to do \nsomething with the Social Security retirement system. We have done a \ngreat deal with that over the last year. Although there still needs to \nbe some systematic changes made to the program, we can ensure that the \nprogram will be there over time.\n  We have made a very significant movement by providing that the 12\\1/\n2\\ percent of our earnings paid into Social Security by everyone who \nworks in this country is, in fact, used for Social Security. \nHistorically, over a very long time, those dollars have been used for \nmany non-Social Security programs. Because of this Republican Congress, \nbecause of the lockbox idea, we have put that money aside. It is not \nbeing spent for other items. That is very significant.\n  I hope we can proceed and look at alternatives to ensure that the \nyoung people who are now just beginning to pay into the program will \nhave a program of benefits when the time comes for them to be eligible \nfor the benefits. Frankly, the program has changed in terms of the \nprofile of people. When we began, there were some 20 people working for \nevery one drawing benefits. Now it is less than 3 and will be down to \n2.\n  Obviously, things have to be changed. There are some options: We can \nraise taxes. I don't know of anyone excited about that. We can reduce \nbenefits. The same is true with that. Or, indeed, we can take a portion \nof those dollars and make them individual accounts for each person--2 \npercent out of the 12 percent is what we are talking about--and let \nthat money be invested in their behalf, invested in equities, let it be \ninvested in bonds, let it be invested in a combination of their choice, \nfor their retirement, or as part of their estate if they are not \nfortunate enough to live.\n  The issue most talked about is education. Only about 7 percent of the \nfinances of education in this country, elementary and secondary, are \nprovided by the Federal Government. There is a great deal of discussion \nabout how that is allocated and how it is made available. The big \ndebate, and the reason we haven't gone further with elementary and \nsecondary reauthorization, is there is a difference of view.\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle believe if the Federal \nGovernment is providing the money, it ought to also provide the rules \nas to how it is used. We think that is not the most effective way to \nuse the money.\n  I come from Wyoming. We have some very small towns in our relatively \nsmall State. In Chugwater, WY, where I attended a graduation ceremony \nthis week, with 12 graduates from high school, they have different \nneeds than Pittsburgh, PA.\n  We need to have the flexibility. We say let's help make education \nstronger, but let the local people decide how that is done. We have \nbeen working on that.\n  Another area is economic opportunities for all Americans. We have \ndone that in terms of tax relief. Unfortunately, the bill that was \npassed in this Congress was vetoed by the President, denying relief for \nhard-working Americans. However, we were successful in passing a \nRepublican bill that eliminated the penalty on earnings in excess of \nSocial Security income. Instead of having to pay taxes on $1 out of $3, \nwe have removed that, to encourage people to continue to work and earn \nmoney.\n\n  Another is national security. I suspect there is nothing more \nimportant. There is no more logical role for the Federal Government \nthan defense. No one else can do that. Over the last several years, \nthis administration has not adequately funded defense. Now we have to \ndo that, particularly since we have a volunteer service. There has to \nbe some attraction to that. There has to be an attraction to get men \nand women to go into the service and, maybe even more difficult, once \nthey are trained to doing things, to work as pilots or mechanics or \nwhatever, to keep them there. That is very difficult. So we have made \nsome progress in that area.\n  I think there are a lot of things that have been done. I mentioned \nSocial Security and taking care of the surplus. I think that is a real \nplus for this Congress, that we have a budget surplus. For the first \ntime in probably 40 years, we have a budget surplus. We are not \nspending Social Security money. Indeed, this time there will be, \nhopefully, more money than is necessary to conduct the business of the \nFederal Government.\n  Of course, several things can happen with that money. One, we can \nmake sure we start to pay down the debt. I mean pay down the debt with \nreal dollars, not simply putting in Social Security dollars there as \nwell. We stopped the raid on the Social Security fund and began to make \nsome reduction in the debt that we have. The interest on that debt has \nbeen almost the second largest item in the Federal budget for a very \nlong time. We can change that. Of course, if that is done, and done \nproperly, we can move on to some tax relief, which I think is something \nwe ought to do.\n  I mentioned our efforts on elementary and secondary education. We \nalso were able to take the first step in passing the Ed-Flex program \nwhich, again, provides more opportunities for local people to use those \nFederal dollars as they need them. Some schools need capital \nconstruction, some need computers, some need more teachers or smaller \nclassrooms, but each school district has a little different need. We \nwant to make sure they have an opportunity to make that decision. We \nalso need to ensure the money is not spent by the bureaucracy in \nWashington but in fact finds its way to the schools on the local level.\n  Overall tax relief is still something we need to do. We have done a \ngreat deal on that so far and can do substantially more.\n  I mentioned what we did on Social Security, and we need to go \nfurther.\n  On national defense, the Senator just before me was talking about \nmissile defense. Certainly, we need to continue to explore that. We \nneed to continue to have a strong military. In my view, that is our \nbest chance for peace in the world--to continue to have a strong \nmilitary.\n  I had the good fortune a couple of weeks ago to visit the Space \nCommand in Colorado Springs. I am impressed with what they are doing to \nfind a way to have a missile defense program that will allow us a \ndeterrent so we can move forward with other kinds of things. We were \nsuccessful, and I believe we acted properly, not ratifying the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty so we could continue to test our weapons \nand make sure they are as they should be.\n\n  We have made some real progress in trade. The African trade bill is \nout there. It was signed into law in May. We can do something with \nthat. Yesterday, the Permanent Normal Trade Relations for China was \npassed by the House and will be over here now. I happen to be the \nchairman of the subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific rim. I do believe \ncertainly we have to verify the things happening in that area of the \nworld, but there is good evidence we can make more progress bringing \nabout change by being involved as opposed to isolating and seeking to \nstay away from that. So certainly there is a great deal to be gained \nthere.\n  We have made some progress in high tech. The Y2K bill was an \nimportant piece of legislation, and the Satellite Television \nImprovement Act, particularly for rural States where people do not have \naccess to cable. It has not yet been completed, but we have made some \nreal movement on that. We hope to have that completed so people all \nacross the country can have the same opportunities, both in satellites \nand TV, and also, of course, in infrastructure for high-tech broadband \ncoverage. We are moving forward on the opportunity to do that. We must \nmove in that direction.\n  Health care is an area on which we have to move forward. This Senate \nhas passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that would provide for patients \nin HMOs to have some immediate referral, so if there is a question \nabout the procedures, rather than having to go to court or having \nsomeone in an office far away decide what you can do, you have an \nappeal to a physician as to what that ought to be. Unfortunately, that \nbill is still in conference, but we think it will be out very soon.\n  One of the things we have done in this Congress that was particularly \nimportant was the Welfare Reform Act--of 1996, actually. This \nRepublican Congress passed that. We have helped people find jobs, \nhelped people move into opportunity instead of dependency. That is \nsomething I think has been very useful to all Americans.\n  We have a ways to go, of course. We constantly have things to do \nhere, as we should. On the other hand, we have also moved forward and \nmade a good deal of progress in this Congress. We have an opportunity \nto do more. As I mentioned, unfortunately, we have come to kind of a \nslowdown here, using the techniques, using the process to force issues. \nWhat it really does is slow down everything we do.\n  There is clearly an opportunity for differences of view; that is what \nthis place is for, to talk about differences, to disagree, if you \nplease, as to the role of Government and what ought to be done. But the \nidea of using irrelevant issues to hold up progress on the things we \nall know we have to do--and I am particularly talking about the \nappropriations bills that obviously have to be passed. Frankly, we are \nanxious to get them done early so we do not run into the same problems \nwe had several years ago where we could not get it done and had to put \nit all in one package at the end. The President then used that as \nleverage on the Congress. He threatened and, indeed, did shut down the \nGovernment to be able to force things through this Congress that the \nCongress did not want to do. We should not let ourselves get into that \nposition again, certainly not this year.\n  Mr. President, I am expecting other Senators to come for this time \nperiod. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to follow my colleague's remarks with \nsome thoughts of my own concerning the appearance that the Senate is \nnot getting anything done these days, and talk a little bit about the \nreasons why. Anybody watching the Senate proceedings over the course of \nthe last couple of weeks would probably wonder what we were \naccomplishing and would have some reason to criticize the Senate for \nnot getting a lot of business done.\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\n  What is the reason for that? I think it is very important, and that \nis why I wanted to come to the Senate floor to talk about it because I \nam becoming very frustrated at the tactics of many people on the other \nside of the aisle, the Democratic minority, in attempting to preclude \nthe Senate from doing its business, the people's business.\n  We have important legislative initiatives that the majority leader \nhas tried to bring before the Senate repeatedly, and repeatedly he has \nbeen thwarted by the minority which seems intent on bringing the Senate \nto an absolute stop, to a standstill, to prevent it from doing any \nbusiness unless the majority accedes to the minority's request that \nthey be permitted to offer amendments which are nongermane, irrelevant, \nto the subject matter of the Senate.\n  When people reflect on the organizations to which they belong and \ntheir understanding of things as basic as Robert's Rules of Order, they \nappreciate that almost any organization has to have certain rules under \nwhich to live.\n  In the House of Representatives, as the Presiding Officer is well \naware, both of us having come from the House of Representatives, there \nare pretty strict sets of rules to apply. There are 435 people in the \nHouse, and if they all did what they wanted to do, they would never get \nanything done. We pretty much have to talk about things that are \ngermane and relevant to the pending business, and if we do not, someone \ncan make an objection that this is out of order, and everybody knows \nunder Robert's Rules, one can say: Mr. Chairman, that's out of order; \nthat's not relevant to the subject we are supposed to be discussing.\n  In the Senate, the rules are much more liberal. Members generally \nwork together on things and do not enforce the rules as strictly as \nthey are enforced in the House. Nevertheless, the Senate has \nessentially always had rules respecting germaneness and relevancy, and \nuntil very recently, we could make an objection that a proposed \namendment, for example, on an appropriations bill was not germane or \nwas irrelevant, and in order to continue to debate that amendment, the \nproponent would have to get 60 Senators to agree to do that, to \noverrule the ruling of the Chair that the amendment is not germane or \nirrelevant.\n  I know this is all somewhat procedure and it may make some eyes glaze \nover, but it is an important foundation for my point. We decided if we \nwere going to do the business of the people, we had to ensure we could \nget on with it and not have a lot of riders on these appropriations \nbills and, therefore, we would begin enforcing rule XVI, which says if \na Senator is going to debate something, it needs to be relevant or \ngermane to these bills. That is the basic issue that has members of the \nminority upset.\n  How dare you gag us, they say. Gag them? Nobody is being gagged. We \nare simply going to enforce the rules that say if you are going to \npropose an amendment, it needs to be relevant or germane. Everybody in \nthe country understands that--the organizations to which they belong. \nWhy wouldn't the minority want that? Because they want to accomplish \ntwo objectives apparently: One is to prevent the majority from \naccomplishing anything this year so they can call us a do-nothing \nCongress; in other words, create a self-fulfilling prophecy. By \npreventing us from doing anything, they will criticize the majority \nleader for not doing anything.\n\n  The other objective apparently is to be able to debate their agenda, \nthings such as gun control and the minimum wage, maybe prescription \ndrugs, and so on, on their timetable. So whatever bill we bring up, \nthey try to attach to it an irrelevant or nongermane amendment \nrelating, for example, to gun control.\n  We have had lots of gun control debates. I remember 2 weeks last year \nwhen the majority leader finally said: OK, we will have the debate; it \nwill be on the juvenile justice bill. We voted on lots of amendments, \nincluding some the minority really liked. We had that debate; we had \nthose votes; but that was not enough. It appears we have to talk about \nthese things all of the time because that is what is going to be \npolitically popular in this fall's elections.\n  That is wrong. To tie up the people's business, to tie up the Senate \nfor political gain is wrong. If any of the members of the minority are \nengaging in this procedure for that purpose, they clearly ought not to.\n  We have accomplished a lot this year, notwithstanding these tactics. \nI note things such as repeal of the Social Security earnings test, \nsomething Republicans wanted to do for a long time, and the Presiding \nOfficer and I have been working on for a long time; the budget \nresolution, which maintains a balanced budget--we got that done; bills \nsuch as the African-Caribbean free trade bill; financial services \nmodernization; the FAA reauthorization--a lot of different pieces of \nlegislation that are good, that help maintain a part of our economy or \nensure we are going to have a balanced budget, for example.\n  There are many other pieces of legislation we want to pass. We want \nto pass the marriage tax penalty relief bill to do away with the \nmarriage penalty in the IRS Code. The minority will not let us bring it \nfor a vote. They say they are for it, but they are not going to let us \nvote on it.\n  It is the same thing with the reauthorization of the education bill. \nThis is a bill that needs to be reauthorized because it deals with all \nof the rules under which the Federal money goes to the States to \nsupport primary and secondary education. The minority will not let us \nvote on it.\n  Appropriations bills: We have to pass 13 appropriations bills to keep \nthe Government running. People get mighty upset when the Government \ncannot continue to operate. Who is stopping us from acting on these \nappropriations bills? The Democrats in the Senate will not let the \nmajority bring these appropriations bills up, except one. We can bring \nup the legislative branch appropriations bill, the bill that provides \nthe money to run the Congress. They will let us bring that one up but \nnone of the others.\n  We have a very important agricultural supplemental appropriations \nbill to help out farmers in this country. Democrats will not let us \nbring it up. When I say they will not let us bring it up, people say \nhow can they stop you? Under the rules of the Senate, one Member can \nobject to any piece of legislation being brought up for its \nconsideration or being voted on, and in order to override that person's \nobjection, you have to get 60 Members of this body to agree to override \nthat and proceed to a vote or proceed to consideration of a bill. That \nis called invoking cloture.\n\n  There are 55 Republicans and there are 45 Democrats. On these \nprocedural matters, the Democratic Members tend to vote in a block, the \nnet result of which is we can never get 60 votes to proceed with \nbusiness. Because of the party loyalty and the partisanship that has \ngotten involved in our legislative agenda, we are not able to move \nmatters forward because there is an objection to proceeding. That is \nwhy I say members of the minority preclude us from moving forward and \ndoing the people's business.\n  We wanted to pass a very important amendment to me, and I note to the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, who is on the floor now--the \ncrime victims' rights constitutional amendment. Frankly, parliamentary \ntactics were used and threatened to make it clear that we would be \ndebating that bill for weeks, something that obviously we did not have \ntime to do if we were going to do the other important business of the \nSenate. Senator Feinstein and I had to pull that bill down.\n  Since I am being critical of members of the Democratic minority, let \nme say that there have been some Members, such as Senator Feinstein, \nwho have worked very closely with me and others to try to move some of \nthese important bills forward.\n  We all get caught up in our own partisan battles here. That is to be \nexpected. It is a political year, after all. It seems to me we can and \nought to agree there are some things so important that we ought to get \ntogether as Democrats and Republicans and move the legislation forward.\n  One of them clearly is the education bill. Another is the repeal of \nthe marriage tax penalty. Another is the appropriations bills. For the \nlife of me, I do not see why there have to be objections to bringing \nforward appropriations bills, and I do not subscribe to the notion that \nit is wrong for us to\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nbring those bills forward if members of the minority cannot seek \namendments which are nongermane or irrelevant.\n  We all know what Robert's Rules provide. Those are not the rules of \nthe Senate, but we all understand why we have to have rules such as \nthat, and that is to keep the process moving along so that we can do \nthe important business we have to do.\n  I am very frustrated today, Mr. President. It is obvious because I do \nnot ordinarily come to the floor, and I do not like to criticize in a \npartisan way. But people have to understand today or tomorrow we are \nprobably going to begin the Memorial Day recess, which means there will \nbe another 12 or 13 days of nonaction in the Senate, the net result of \nwhich will be we are way behind getting our business done, especially \nthe appropriations bills to run the Government.\n  The danger is that there are not very many opportunities for us to \nget these bills done before the Senate has to adjourn for an election \nthis year, and we will end up, instead of focusing on each of the \nappropriations bills, in turn having to put it all into one giant \nappropriations bill.\n  What happens when we do that? Every Member comes back to the Senate \nmonths later and says: I didn't know they put that in the bill. Nobody \nhas a chance to read these giant omnibus bills. So we vote on bills we \nhaven't even had an opportunity to read. Staff gets all kinds of things \ninserted. People on the inside get all kinds of things inserted in the \nlegislation. We find out weeks later about the mistakes we have made. \nIt is impossible to have a good, informed vote on a bill.\n  The other danger, of course, is that it is easier; that instead of \nresolving disputes and prioritizing spending, by offsetting this \nspending with this savings--for example, in those last days to put \ntogether these giant omnibus appropriations bill--you don't make those \nhard decisions; you just add more money. So you resolve the dispute by \nsaying: we are taking care of you, and we are taking care of you. And \npretty soon we have busted the budget. Most importantly, we may make \nthe mistake of spending Social Security surplus money.\n  This past year, we did not spend a dime of Social Security surplus \nmoney. The previous year, we saved most of that Social Security surplus \nfrom being spent. Republicans, this year, are committed not to spending \nany of the Social Security surplus. But, unfortunately, I will make \nthis prediction: If we get into this giant omnibus appropriations \nprocess at the end because we could not do our business during the \nweeks we have now to do that business, we are going to end up spending \nSocial Security surplus money. I will never vote for such a bill. I \nthink, therefore, we ought to be very careful about getting ourselves \ninto that box.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue. I \nhope people with goodwill can work it out, so when we come back from \nour recess, we can begin to get the people's business done and get it \ndone on time. It is important for the future of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4405-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2603) making appropriations for the legislative \n     branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Mikulski Amendment No. 3166, to express the sense of the \n     Senate commending the United States Capitol Police.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3166\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes available for debate on \nthe pending amendment.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, yesterday I offered an amendment to the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill commending the Capitol Police, \nand all the employees of the legislative branch, and recommending that \nwe keep the Senate funding levels in conference.\n  I also complimented the outstanding leadership provided by Senator \nBennett, the Chair of the legislative appropriations subcommittee, as \nwell as Senator Feinstein, the ranking member of the subcommittee, who \nreally moved this legislation in a way that I think meets the \nresponsibilities we have to the American people.\n  The best way we can show our responsibility to the American people is \nto really let them know that the men and women who work at the U.S. \nCapitol are needed and valued.\n  My amendment is not about money, it is about morale. We want to say \nto the men and women who work at the U.S. Capitol that we know who you \nare and we value what you do. You are the men and women who work in \nthis building for the American people. You serve the Nation.\n  The Capitol Police protect this building, which is a symbol of \nfreedom and democracy the world over. The Capitol Police ensure that \neveryone who comes to the U.S. Capitol is safe and secure, including \nMembers of Congress and staff.\n  The Capitol Police are brave. They are resourceful. They are tough. \nThey are gallant. They protect you whether you are a foreign dignitary, \nsuch as Nelson Mandela, or a member of a Girl Scout troop from \nMaryland.\n  We need to make sure they have their jobs, they have their pay, they \nhave their pension, and they have our respect. That is what my \namendment is all about: To support the Capitol Police and the other \nemployees of the legislative branch.\n  I was deeply disturbed at the House bill which cut over 1,700 \nemployees of the legislative branch. This isn't about bureaucracy. The \npeople we are talking about are the 117 people from the Congressional \nResearch Service. That is the body that is absolutely dedicated to \ngiving us unbiased, unpolitical, accurate information so we can make \nthe best decisions in our approach to forming public policy. We turn to \nthem for models for the Older Americans Act and for ideas on new \ntechnology breakthroughs to be pursued. We have to make sure we have \nthe Congressional Research Service and that they have the staff they \nneed to do their job.\n  Also under the House bill, 700 jobs would be cut from GAO. Every \nMember of the Senate who is fiscally prudent knows we need the GAO. It \nis not about keeping the books, but it is about keeping the books \nstraight. We continually turn to the GAO to do investigations of waste \nand abuse, to give us insights on how to better manage and be better \nstewards of the taxpayers' funds. People with those kinds of skills \ncould leave us in a nanosecond and move to the private sector. They \ncould be ``dot.comers'' with no hesitation.\n  If we are going to be on the broadband of the future, we need to make \nsure we have the skills to run a contemporary Congress. We need to make \nsure they have security in their jobs and security in health benefits \nand in their pensions. We need to be sure we let those workers know we \nare on their side.\n  In addition to that, we want to make sure we acknowledge the role our \nown staffs play in constituent service and in helping us craft \nlegislation.\n  Two years ago, we all endured a very melancholy event here in the \nCongress. Two very brave and gallant police officers literally put \nthemselves in the line of fire to protect us. Their names were Officer \nChestnut, from Maryland--his wife still lives over there at Fort \nWashington--and Detective Gibson, of Virginia, father of three--\nteenagers, college students. We mourn them. We consoled their families \nand said a grateful Congress will never forget.\n  We should not forget the men and women who work here, but the way we \nremember is with the right pay, the right benefits, and the right \nrespect.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will just take about 2 minutes in \nsupport of the Mikulski amendment to say how proud I am to be an \noriginal cosponsor. I have probably given 15 or 20 speeches about this, \nso I do not want to take any time except to emphasize two points.\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\n  First of all, I thank the Senator for mentioning Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson. It has really been almost 2 years ago that we lost \nthose two fine officers. I do think the best way we honor them is by \nsupporting the police.\n  I think what happened on the House side was really unconscionable \nbecause whereas we really need to do even better by way of making sure \nwe get two police officers at each post, making sure we have the \nsecurity for them, much less the security for the public and ourselves, \ninstead, what we saw was actually a slashing of the budgets, which \nmeans hundreds of officers losing their jobs and not really having \npolice officers working under the right conditions for themselves, \ntheir families, for the public, and for us.\n  We really have done well on the Senate side. I thank Senators \nBennett, Feinstein, Mikulski, and others for their commitment. I hope \nevery single Senator will support this amendment. Like other Senators, \nI am not always wild about sense-of-the-Senate amendments--I offer a \nfair number of them myself--but sometimes they are really important. \nSometimes they are, while symbolic, really powerful and really \nimportant.\n  I do think we need to convey the message, in light of what happened \non the House side, in light of how demoralized and how angry and \nindignant some police officers are, that we fully support them.\n  This amendment is a very important one. I hope it will have the full \nsupport of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized and controls the rest of the \ntime.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield a portion of my time to Senator Feinstein. I do \nwish a couple minutes before we come to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to, from the Democratic side, \nmore or less conclude the debate on the legislative branch \nappropriations bill.\n  We believe it is a good bill. We are very supportive--both Senator \nBennett and I--of Senator Mikulski's amendment. I am delighted she \noffered it.\n  The men and women of the Capitol Police perform a vitally important \njob. Unfortunately, sometimes we hardly notice them. This is an \nopportunity to give them notice, respect, commendation, and say we are \nproud of you.\n  The legislative branch appropriations bill restores the damaging cuts \ncontained in the House bill and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring \nsecurity in the Capitol and of the Capitol Police.\n  I reiterate what a delight it has been to work with our chairman, \nSenator Bennett. My tenure as ranking member on this subcommittee has \nbeen marked by a sense of comity and equity which has really made this \nwork a great pleasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein. I commend \nSenators Bennett and Feinstein for managing this bill. It is a \nsignificant bill.\n  With regard to the police, this bill increases support for our \nCapitol Police by 26 percent. In fact, in addition to that, we have in \nthe Agriculture bill, awaiting Senate action, $2.3 million in overtime \ncosts to implement the two-men-per-door policy and $10 million to \nprovide additional facilities to support police functions. The 2001 \nappropriations bill provides $5.2 million in overtime to continue the \ntwo-men-at-each-door policy.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski for her amendment. I deem it as a \nremembrance sense of the Senate, and we should remember these men who \nlost their lives in guarding this building and the functions of the \nCongress.\n  I hope we will have the support of all Members for the basic bill. We \nsupport Senator Mikulski's amendment, as a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment, that recognizes what is in the bill, that is, increasing \nsupport for the security functions for the Capitol and those who work \nin it.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have scheduled the time to commence the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled for 10:45.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are three votes in succession?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Two votes. Very well.\n  Does Senator Feinstein wish any more time? Senator Mikulski?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment in no way is a criticism of \nSenators Bennett and Feinstein. They did a fantastic job, not only in \nmoving the bill but the way they have conducted the hearings and worked \nwith Members on very sensitive issues. I commend them. Had the House \ndone what Senators Bennett and Feinstein did, my amendment would not \nhave been necessary.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  If it is in order, I yield back the remainder of the time and ask for \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3166.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding to me.\n  I come to the floor for a brief moment to pay tribute to the victims \nof gun violence who were killed one year ago today.\n  We are all familiar with the incidents of gun violence in our \nschools; from Columbine to Springfield, OR, to Paducah, KY, and \nunfortunately to so many other schools and communities.\n  Gun violence is particularly disturbing when it happens in a school.\n  But gun violence happens everywhere.

Her son was simply stopping at a convenience store \nwhen he was robbed and killed.\n  How many families have to suffer unnecessarily before this Congress \npasses commonsense gun control legislation?\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors has maintained a list of the thousands \nof Americans have been killed by gunfire since the Columbine tragedy.\n  Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of \nthose who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year.\n  We will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session \nuntil this Republican Congress acts on sensible gun control \nlegislation.\n  Here are the names of a few Americans who died due to gun violence \none year ago today:\n  Antwan Brooks, 26, Pittsburgh, PA;\n  James A Brown, 22, Chicago, IL;\n  Kenneth Cork, 46, Houston, TX;\n  Marsha Cress, 32, Fort Worth, TX;\n  Kenneth L.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from Georgia, Senator \nCleland, for his role in our ongoing, bipartisan foreign policy dialog. \nAs we approach Memorial Day, I also thank him for his personal \nsacrifice and example for our great country.\n  This is our fourth foreign policy dialog. It is called the employment \nof U.S. military forces or what could be better described as the use of \nforce. It couldn't come at a better time, the week prior to the \nMemorial Day celebration, a day of solemn celebration and reflection, a \nday to remember our fallen family members, our friends, and our fellow \nAmericans, a day that always makes me very proud of our country and \nhumbled by the self-sacrifice of our men and women who paid the \nultimate price so that we may live free.\n  As my good friend from Georgia has seen with his own eyes, it is not \nthe U.S. Constitution that really keeps us free, for it is merely a \npiece of paper. The marble headstones at Arlington National Cemetery \nand cemeteries all across America and throughout the world mark what \ntruly has kept us free. And our freedoms will continue to be secured by \nthe brave men and women of our Armed Forces.\n  Samuel P. Huntington, the renowned author and historian in the 1950s, \narticulated in his book ``The Soldier and the State'' two important \nmilitary characteristics. The first is expertise to prevail at the art \nof war; the second is the responsibility for protecting our freedoms, \nsimilar to the responsibility that lawyers have to protect American \njustice and the rule of law and that doctors have to save lives and \nprotect the health of their patients. Quite simply: The role of our \nArmed Forces is to fight and to win the Nation's wars.\n  Eleven times in our history the United States has formally declared \nwar against foreign adversaries. There have been hundreds of instances, \nhowever, in which the United States has utilized military forces abroad \nin situations of military conflict or potential conflict to protect our \nU.S. citizens or to promote our U.S. interests. Of those hundreds of \nuses of military force where the U.S. did not declare war, some have \nobviously been successful and some obviously have not.\n  Today, I am not going to discuss the use of military force for the \npurpose of protecting our vital national interests. Those uses of force \nin our history have occurred rarely and usually without much opposition \ndue to the future of the Nation. Our forces are equipped and train \nevery day to carry out this task. Those types of conflicts of national \nsurvival have easily been defined in terms of the political objectives, \nclear military strategies to achieve those objectives, and the \ndefinition of victory or success is the capitulation of the enemy.\n  The U.S. Armed Forces are no stranger to limited contingency \noperations, military operations other than war, but the changes in \npolitical context of the commitments pose new problems of legitimacy, \nmission creep, operational tempo, and multilateral cooperation. \nAlthough limited contingency operations may produce short-term \nbenefits, history has shown the lasting results of long-term \ncommitments are very limited at best.\n  The ideas developed by Carl von Clausewitz, famous military theorist \nof the early 19th century, are profoundly relevant today. The criteria \nof appropriateness and proportionality are crucial concerns in any \nmilitary operation other than war.\n  Clausewitz identified any protracted operation that involves \nenlargement or lengthening of troop commitment is likely to cause \nmultiple rationales for the intervention. When a marine landing party \nwent ashore at Port-au-Prince in Haiti in 1915, neither the Wilson \nadministration nor the Marine Corps nor the Congress would have \npredicted that they began an operation to protect the foreign lives and \nproperty and to stop a civil war that would end 30 years later with an \nadmission of failure in reforming the public institutions of Haiti.\n\n  Does this sound familiar? Currently, the United States has troops in \n141 nations and at sea; 55 percent of the nations of the world have \nU.S. troops stationed within their borders. From 1956--that is the \nsecond term of President Eisenhower--to 1992, the United States used \nmilitary forces abroad 51 times. Since 1992, the U.S. has used military \nforce 51 times.\n  During that same timeframe of roughly a 400-percent increase in the \nuse of the military as an instrument of power, the military has been \nforced to downsize and decrease force structure by 40 percent. That \ntype of planning and management of the military reflects poorly on the \ncivilian leadership. All of our services are at the breaking point. I \nfear there is no more give or elasticity in the force structure of our \nmost valued treasure, the men and women who serve.\n  The can-do, never-say-die attitude of the military and its leadership \nand the very competence that the U.S. military has displayed in \nsuccessfully responding to a wide variety of contingencies seems to \nhave encouraged its further use by this administration, acquiesced to \nby this Congress.\n  A recent study from the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies of\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nmilitary culture identifies seven areas of concern within our military \ntoday. Service members expressed a commitment to values related to \neffectiveness and sacrifice and discipline, but they had deep concerns \nabout the imbalance between the missions and the resources to perform \nthose missions to a high standard. They felt the Pentagon was out of \ntouch. Quite frankly, they questioned the command support in the face \nof social concerns. They had concerns about the sense of dwindling \nunderstanding of the military so rampant today in our society. They \nindicated a lot of disgust with civilian leadership behavior not \ntolerated in their units in the military.\n  Thomas Jefferson said: Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. Our \nmilitary has always exemplified that statement.\n  However, I am concerned that the current use of military force is \nundermining the trust of leadership at all levels. We cannot continue \nto accept the status quo. We cannot continue to appropriate the \ncontingency funds for emergency deployments with no end in sight or no \nplanned exit strategy.\n  General Zinni, who is the CINC of the Central Command, expressed \nconcern about the pace of these operations and what it is doing to our \nservice members. He said:\n\n       We don't have the resources to meet the strategy. It's \n     plain and simple. We don't have enough people, we don't have \n     enough force structure, we don't have the right kinds of \n     things we need to meet the strategy.\n\n  Since 1991, we have spent over $25 billion on peacekeeping \noperations. The impact on the war-fighting capability of each of the \nservices, including the time to recover war-fighting skills after \npeacekeeping operations, is reflected in the current readiness concerns \nexpressed by the Joint Chiefs.\n  As an example, the United States continues to dedicate three \ndivisions in the Balkans rotation: One division training to deploy for \npeacekeeping operations, one division in the area of responsibility, \nand one division retraining after deployment--three divisions not ready \nto execute their primary tasks.\n  Here is an account from a commander in Kosovo, a peacekeeping \noperation, which is very troubling to me. This is a quote, an e-mail \nthat went from one commander to another. He was reflecting to his \nfriend, who was going to take over his command, what went on in terms \nof his daily operation:\n\n       After getting hit in the head by a large rock and getting \n     smashed across the back with a tree limb, I gave the order \n     for the soldiers to open fire with nonlethal munitions. This \n     worked pretty well clearing the crowd back initially. As we \n     continued to fight and move with the people on the hill, I \n     looked over to the landing zone and saw a mob swarming toward \n     the subject and five soldiers. The soldiers started to move \n     out of the landing zone, but they had people around them \n     throwing everything. I grabbed 10 guys and went to help get \n     the five soldiers. When we were 15 meters away, I saw a \n     soldier get smashed over the head with a huge tree limb. He \n     was fine. Thank God for Kevlar. At this point, I took out my \n     9mm with the intent to shoot. However, I fired several \n     warning shots. The crowd cleared out, and we walked everyone \n     out, including the injured.\n\n  I want to ask a question. What if those rocks and tree limbs would \nhave been AK-47s and RPGs? I think the debate about a week ago \nregarding Kosovo and our involvement there would have dramatically \nchanged had that been the case.\n  We continue to maintain multiple wings of aircraft in southwest Asia, \nand we continue to place American aviators in harm's way every day in \nIraq. What most Americans don't know is that although airpower seems \nsterile, clean, and bloodless on CNN that is not the case--that is not \nthe case. The mission tapes of the men and women flying missions over \nIraq reflect the risk. A war America thought we won 10 years ago slowly \nrages on.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of our military today joined after 1989. \nThey have known nothing but turmoil in terms of their missions. They \nhave been deployed away from their families for 6-month rotations and, \nin some cases, three, four, and five times. Their war-fighting \ncapabilities and readiness to execute military operations is not as \nsharp as it should be. Their morale is low because they are leaving \ntheir families. Seventy percent of the force today is married, and they \nare leaving them for very questionable missions. No wonder sailors and \nairmen and soldiers are leaving the force and voting with their feet. \nOnly the Marine Corps has maintained their recruiting and retention \ngoals, and they have had a very difficult time achieving that goal.\n  The current military is stressed, it is strained, and it is hollow. \nAs our armed services activity levels have increased and force \nstructure has decreased time for realistic combat training is lost, \nsupply stocks are diminished, and personnel are displaced. Military \nleadership at all levels suffers from the current strain; leadership \ncrucial in regard to the goal of winning wars.\n\n  The key to leadership is trust: Trust from the civilian leadership \nand the public that the military will put together the proper plan to \nwin, trust from the military that the civilian leadership--those of us \nin the Congress and in the administration--will provide the proper \ntools to win, and trust to use force judiciously and to gain the \npolitical and public support.\n  Congress must trust the President, and the President must trust the \nCongress to ensure the use of force is necessary, after all other \ninstruments of power and diplomacy have failed. And our national \ninterests dictate that the political objectives still must be achieved.\n  I commend our military leaders for weathering the current storm. I \nalso commend the men and women of the Armed Forces. Whenever I visit a \nbase in Kansas, or overseas, I am always impressed with our citizens in \nuniform. Their service, integrity, self-discipline, respect for \nauthority, honor, and sacrifice is inspirational; it is a battery \ncharger. I know we have honest disagreements and differences of \nopinions, and that is good for the system. Debate will continue to \noccur. Even General Washington had severe disagreements with the \nCongress about allowing him to perform summary punishments. However, we \nmust mend, heal, and restore harmony to the system by rebuilding the \nrespect, trust, and understanding in the civilian-military relations.\n  In the post-cold-war era, limited contingency operations have become \nour predominant military endeavor. There are no easy answers to the \nproblems of limited contingency operations. Deciding to intervene and \nuse our military force is a very difficult problem; it is very \nperplexing.\n  The distinguished Senator from Georgia and I have had long talks \nabout this, trying to set up some kind of a criterion, set up some kind \nof a list that would make sense, outlining the various reasons for \nintervention abroad. Listing all of the questions the President ought \nto ask before the Marines are sent in can best be characterized now as \nan ``it depends'' doctrine.\n  I acknowledge that the post-cold-war recommendations and the public \ndebate between the foreign policy elite, the Congress, the Secretary of \nState and Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff cannot agree upon and do not provide a clear set \nof tests that should be applied before deciding to commit troops to \ncombat in support of less than vital national interests. I wish there \nwere a test or a criterion.\n  That is really the reason Senator Cleland and I entered into the \nforeign policy dialog. We always seem to be stuck with foregone \nconclusions in terms of foreign policy and sending our men and women in \nuniform in harms way.\n  The former Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, identified six \ntests that he said should be applied when weighing the use of U.S. \ncombat forces abroad. Three of the tests--number one, when vital \ninterests are at stake; number five, with public support; and number \nsix, as a last resort--concern the foreign policy and the political \ncircumstances in regard to the use of force. Tests number two, three, \nand four concern the relationship between the military means and the \npolitical ends.\n  Former Secretary of State, George Shultz on the ``vital interests'' \ntest argued that a wide range of international challenges justify U.S. \nuse of force. And, the last two administrations have uniformly rejected \nthe first vital interest test.\n  Former Secretary of Defense William Perry argued that the use of \nforce might be necessary to support coercive diplomacy when national \ninterests that\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\ndo not rise to the level of vital are at stake.\n  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has asserted that decisions can \nonly be made on a case by case basis, and it would be counterproductive \nto define rigidly in advance the conditions in which a decision to use \nforce would be made.\n  But if vital interests need not be at stake, the question remains \nwhat degree of U.S. interests justify the use of force, at what level, \nand with what risks.\n  Mr. President, I would contend that the use of force for other than \nvital or extremely important national interests, as defined in our \nsecond dialogue, has not worked in the post-cold-war period. The role \nof the military is not to act as the cop on the beat for the whole \nworld. The non-prudent use of force in support of less than vital \ninterests is not worth the current costs to our readiness and military \nmorale.\n  C. Mark Brinkley in the Marine Corps Times said it best when he \nidentified with no other form of government to turn to, Serbs and \nethnic Albanians alike turned to the Marines for help. In addition, to \nmore traditional roles of securing the area and suppressing civil \nunrest, the unit recreated basic elements of daily life: restoring law \nand order and reopening schools and hospitals, garbage collection, and \ncounselling. The Marines also evolved into a police force for the \nAmerican sector, patrolling the night and responding to emergencies.\n  However, these operations require significantly different skills than \nwhat the armed forces are currently trained to execute. If we are \ntraining our peacekeepers to be more like MP's than combat troops, \ndon't we run the risk that the skills needed by a policeman may get \nthem killed when there is combat?\n  Two schools of thought on the use of force have developed, the \nnational interests school which argues that military force should be \nused only when there is clear cut political and military objectives and \nin an overwhelming fashion.\n  The other school, the limited objectives school, which would use \nmilitary force even in ambiguous situations as a means of enforcing \ninternational decisions or quelling ethnic conflict.\n  General Colin Powell contended in 1993, the key to using military \nforce is to first match political expectations to military means in a \nwholly realistic way, and, second to attain decisive results. A \ndecision to use force must be made with a clear purpose in mind, and \nthen adding that if it is too murky, as is often the case, know that \nleaders will eventually have to find clarity.\n  We are having a hard time doing that in the Balkans today.\n  The decision to use force must also be supported by the public. \nPresidential leadership requires working with Congress and the American \npeople requires Congress to work with the President to provide \nessential domestic groundwork if U.S. military commitments are to be \nsustainable. General Powell asserted the troops must go into battle \nwith the support or understanding of the American people.\n  Mr. President, the pendulum's path has definitely displaced toward \nthe limited objectives school. President Clinton's doctrine of ``global \nvigilance'' and ``aggressive multilaterialism'' is the current example \nand policy.\n  Mr. President, the current precision strike and technological \nadvantage that we enjoy today has led to its increased use due to the \nperceived minimal risk to American aviators. A few cruise missiles or \nlaser guided bombs may fix a short term problem but do not address the \nunderlying long term problems. I would contend that if the intervention \nis not worth the cost of one American service member then we ought to \nbe thinking about the worth of using military force in the first place.\n  If the U.S. decides to use military force and unleash our military \nmight then the cause had better be commensurate with American national \ninterests and analogous to the risk to American service members.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry Shelton \npronounced the ``Dover Test'' must be used when deciding to send troops \nin harms way, and, if the use of force is not worth the consequences of \nAmerican service members making the ultimate sacrifice arriving at \nDover Air Force Base then the military should not be used.\n  If the cause is not worth the risk of one American life then the \nresults and handcuffs placed on the military rules of engagement in an \neffort to curtail risk actually increase the risk. The situation over \ntime, and the situation we are now faced with in the Balkans and in \nIraq.\n  Mr. President, I believe the pendulum of the use of force doctrine \nneeds to swing towards the national interest school of thought. \nHumanitarian military intervention, in violation of the U.N. charter \nfrom attacking other states to remedy violations of human rights, will \nnot rectify the underlying human rights problems. When there is no \npeace to keep then American service members become targets, not \npeacekeepers.\n  Our challenge is to understand the need for prudent, limited, \nproportionate use of military force as an instrument of national power.\n  I now want to offer a very strong and very thought provoking words \nfrom the book ``Fighting for the Future,'' by Ralph Peters, former Army \nlieutenant colonel. It is controversial. I offer it as food for \nthought.\n  Colonel Peters said:\n\n       We face opponents, from warlords to druglords, who operate \n     in environments of tremendous moral freedom, unconstrained by \n     laws, internationally recognized treaties, and civilized \n     customs, or by the approved behaviors of the international \n     military brotherhood. These men beat us. Terrorists who \n     rejected our worldview defeated us in Lebanon. ``General'' \n     Aideed, defeated us in Somalia. And Saddam, careless of his \n     own people, denied us the fruits of our battlefield victory. \n     In the Balkans and on its borders, intransigents continue to \n     hold our troops hostage to a meandering policy. Our enemies \n     play the long game, while we play jailbird chess--never \n     thinking more than one move ahead. Until we change the rules, \n     until we stop attacking foreign masses to punish by proxy \n     protected-status murderers, we will continue to lose. And \n     even as we lose, our cherished ethics do not stand up to \n     hardheaded examination. We have become not only losers but \n     random murderers, willing to kill several hundred Somalis in \n     a single day but unwilling to kill the chief assassin, \n     willing to uproot the coca fields of struggling peasants but \n     without the stomach to retaliate meaningfully against the \n     druglords who savage our children and our society.\n\n  He went on to say,\n\n       Tomorrow's enemies will be of two kinds--those who have \n     seen their hopes disappointed, and those who have no hope. Do \n     not worry about a successful China, worry about a failing \n     China.\n\n  Those are words to think about.\n  Limited contingency operations consisting of crisis management, power \nprojection, peacekeeping, localized military action, support for \nallies, or responding to terrorism require well-defined objectives, \nconsistent strategies to achieve objectives, and a clear, concise exit \nstrategy once those objectives are attained. Otherwise, our country \nwill get involved in operations like those in the Balkans with no end \nin sight and no peace to keep.\n  Mr. President, in closing, our service members are, in fact, America, \nthey reflect our diverse origins and they are the embodiment of the \nAmerican spirit of courage and dedication. Their forebears went by the \nnames of doughboys, Yanks, buffalo soldiers, Johnny Reb, Rough Riders, \nand GI's. For over 200 years they have answered our Nation's call to \nfight. Our citizen soldiers today continue to carry America's value \nsystem and commitment to freedom and democracy.\n  The world we face is still full of uncertainty and threats. It is not \na safe world. However, all Americans sleep soundly at night because of \nthe young men and women standing ready to fight and die, if necessary, \nfor our freedoms. It is our duty in this body to ensure they are used \nappropriately. We have an obligation to do just that in the future, for \nour sake and theirs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I wish every American could have heard \nthat distinguished lecture, dialog, and discussion of what I think is \nthe most important action this Government can ever take, and that is \nthe question of committing young Americans in harm's way. It is the \nmost serious decision that I as a Member of the Senate can take. It is \none of the reasons that brings me here to share the podium and\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nthe floor in the Senate with the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Pat \nRoberts, my colleague, my friend. We work together so well on the Armed \nServices Committee on behalf of young Americans in the military and \nretired military and Guard and Reservists, we thought we would bring \nour thoughts, our concerns, to the floor of this body and stand \nshoulder to shoulder as we are today discussing at the question of \nAmerican intervention abroad.\n  I will recap a couple of items that Senator Roberts, in his eloquence \nand in his great research, has pulled together for Members to consider \nas we look at the question of America's intervention abroad today. He \nmentioned that we were involved militarily in 141 places around the \nglobe. I deal with these issues most every day. That is even a shocking \nstatistic to me. Additionally, we were involved militarily in more than \n55 percent of all the nations on the globe. One wonders if we are not \nbecoming the new Rome. My greatest fear is we will become part of a Pax \nAmericana, or as 2,000 years ago, Pax Romana, where Rome kept the peace \nin the known world. Is that our role today? Is that our mission? Are we \ncalled upon to be the new Rome or is that part of our intervention \nstrategy?\n  I thought it was fascinating that Senator Roberts pointed out since \nEisenhower we have intervened in the world some 51 times; just since \n1992 we have had 51 interventions. We have had an increase in American \nmilitary commitments in the last 10 to 15 years of some 400 percent, \nbut we have downsized the American military's ability to meet those \ncommitments by some 40 percent. A classic case is the Balkans. I just \ngot back from Macedonia, Kosovo, and visited the airbase where we \nlaunched the attacks into Kosovo and Serbia at Aviano, Italy. We have \nthree U.S. Army divisions, as the distinguished Senator from Kansas has \npointed out, in effect, bogged down in the Balkans. That is almost a \nthird of our entire U.S. Army. They are bogged down in the Balkans with \nno end in sight. As the distinguished Senator has pointed out, it is \nhard to keep the peace when there is no peace to keep.\n\n  I think also fascinating is his point that some 75 percent of our \nyoung Americans in active duty military service joined the service \nsince 1989. All they have known is turmoil, deployments, commitments, \ntime away from their family. I think that is a powerful point and one \nof the things that stresses and strains our American military today.\n  That brings us to the floor today on this key question of trust, \ntrust in the leadership, especially the civilian leadership of this \nGovernment, and trying to increase that trust among our young men and \nwomen deployed all over the world. His point is certainly well taken \ntoday, that if we don't judiciously use the American military, then we \nwill see it attrited over time to where we cannot use it. So that \nelement of trust is a key element that I keep close to my heart. I \nappreciate the Senator mentioning it.\n  The distinguished Senator mentioned that next Monday is Memorial Day, \nMay 29. Pursuant to a joint resolution approved by the Congress in \n1950, the President of the United States will issue a proclamation \ncalling upon the people of the United States to observe a day of prayer \nfor permanent peace in remembrance of all those brave Americans who \nhave died in our Nation's service. That is what Memorial Day is \nsupposed to be all about--a day of remembrance. As someone who almost \nwound up on the Vietnam veteran wall, I can say that Memorial Day \nhonoring those who never made it back from our wars is something \nspecial to me.\n  With this, our fourth discussion on the role of the United States in \ntoday's world, Senator Roberts and I come to what is probably the core \nissue motivating us to take on this entire project. The key question \nis, Under what circumstances should the Government of the United States \nemploy military force as an instrument of national policy? I can think \nof no more fitting subject for the Congress to contemplate as we \nprepare for the Memorial Day recess.\n  We have quoted Clausewitz, the great German theoretician on war, \nnumerous times, but this is a quote that I think is appropriate as we \napproach Memorial Day. Clausewitz said of war,\n\n       Kind-hearted people might of course think there was some \n     ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much \n     bloodshed, and might imagine this is the true goal of the art \n     of war. Pleasant as it sounds, it is a fallacy that must be \n     exposed: war is such a dangerous business that the mistakes \n     which come from kindness are the very worst . . . It would be \n     futile--even wrong--to try to shut one's eyes to what war \n     really is from sheer distress of its brutality.\n\n  General Sherman said it best: War is hell. For those who participate \nthey understand it must only be undertaken under the most serious \ncircumstances. My partner in these dialogues, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas, Senator Roberts, has often cited the following quotation \nfrom one of my personal heroes, Senator Richard B. Russell, from thirty \nyears ago, during the war in Vietnam. At that time I was serving in \nthat war. Senator Russell said:\n\n       While it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we \n     should not expose our men to unnecessary hazards to life and \n     limb in pursuing them. As for me, my fellow Americans, I \n     shall never knowingly support a policy of sending even a \n     single American boy overseas to risk his life in combat \n     unless the entire civilian population and wealth of our \n     country--all that we have and all that we are--is to bear a \n     commensurate responsibility in giving him the fullest support \n     and protection of which we are capable.\n\n  That was Senator Russell 30 years ago. As Senator Roberts has \nobserved, ``That is a most powerful statement of truth that has direct \napplications to the challenges we face today . . . The only thing that \nhas changed is that today we refer to American men and women.''\n  I share Senator Roberts' sentiment completely.\n  Richard Haass, a former official in the Bush administration and now \ndirector of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, and \nalso someone whom both Senator Roberts and I have frequently cited \nduring these discussions, has written a wonderful primer called \n``Intervention, The Use of American Military Force in the Post-Cold War \nWorld.'' In it Mr. Haass provides an overview of the evolution of \nAmerican thinking about intervention, followed by an analysis of \ncurrent policies on the subject and a set of pragmatic guidelines which \nMr. Haass proposes to improve the conduct of future American \ninterventions. It is well worth the attention of every Member of this \ndistinguished body.\n  Mr. Haass writes:\n\n       The changes intrinsic to the post-Cold War world have \n     created new, intense conflicts that complicate any \n     prospective use of force by the United States. On the other \n     hand, a number of political and technological developments \n     enhance opportunities for the United States to use its \n     military might effectively. . . . But if there are new \n     reasons as well as new opportunities for the United States to \n     use force, there are no longer any clear guidelines for when \n     and how to do it. . . . Intervening too often poses an \n     obvious danger. Any government indulging in what might be \n     described as wanton uses of force would be guilty of acting \n     irresponsibly, particularly toward those in uniform. . . . At \n     the same time, setting too high a bar against intervention \n     has costs as well. Defining interests too narrowly or \n     prerequisites for employing force too broadly would be \n     tantamount to adopting a policy of isolationism.\n\n  In my view, this is a very lucid discussion of where we are and of \nthe difficult choices we face when--and unfortunately I must add if--\nthe Congress of the United States is included in these deliberations on \nintervention. We saw these issues largely recapitulated here on the \nSenate floor as recently as last week with our belated but still \nilluminating debate on the ongoing Kosovo intervention.\n  I wish my distinguished friend from Kansas and I could have had that \nkind of debate before we engaged in the first military strike in \nKosovo. I still remember well, as the Senator from Kansas has \nindicated, virtually by the time we got the ball here in the Senate, \nthe prestige of the United States and NATO was already at stake. The \nhorse was already out of the barn. We debated military intervention \ninto Kosovo, an offensive strike by NATO, which is a basically \ndefensive military organization--we debated it here only a couple of \ndays. We had a very fine debate, pro and con, about the future of that \nmilitary engagement in Kosovo in the last few days. Those debates will \ncontinue as long as that force is there, and properly so. But our point \nhere is let's make those debates on the floor of the Senate before we \ncommit military force, and not after.\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n  As I mentioned before, the Haass book also offers a useful \npresentation on the evolution of American thinking on intervention, \nstarting with our heritage under what he calls Christian ``just wars,'' \nor the ``just war'' theory as enunciated by such luminaries as St. \nAugustine, Thomas Aquinas, and others. As defined by Haass, under this \napproach, ``wars are considered to be just if they are fought for a \nworthy cause, likely to achieve it, sponsored by legitimate authority, \nundertaken as a last resort, and conducted in a way that uses no more \nforce than necessary or proportionate and that respects the welfare of \nnoncombatants.''\n\n  While the ``just war'' theory has never been the sole criterion by \nwhich America or other western nations have waged war, it is \nnonetheless still a standard moral benchmark, if you will, which we can \nand should apply to individual proposed interventions. It is something \nwe ought to keep in mind.\n  As we have discussed before in this series, the end of World War II \nand the onset of the cold war produced great tension, the threat of a \nglobal nuclear Armageddon, and a vast expenditure of resources. But it \nalso created a very clear standard of military interventionism for the \nUnited States; namely, the containment of the Soviet Union and its \nallies. It was under this overall framework that the two largest post-\nWorld War II American interventions took place, in Korea and Vietnam.\n  The eminent military historian of the war in Vietnam, Colonel Harry \nG. Summers, Jr., discussed the failure--on many different levels--of \nthat American intervention in his book ``On Strategy: The Vietnam War \nin Context.''\n  I have read this book thoroughly. I just wish I had read it before I \nwent to Vietnam and not after.\n  It is not my purpose today to revisit that conflict in detail, but \nfor purposes of today's discussion on the general subject of American \nintervention abroad, let me quote briefly from Summers' work. He says:\n\n       By our own definition, we failed to properly employ our \n     Armed Forces so as to secure U.S. national objectives in \n     Vietnam. Our strategy failed the ultimate test, for, as \n     Clausewitz said, the ends of strategy, in the final analysis \n     ``are those objectives that will finally lead to peace.''\n\n  Given the magnitude of our defeat in Vietnam, and attendant human, \nfinancial, and political costs, there was a very understandable \nrecoiling from military interventionism in the public and Congress, \namong various Presidential administrations and among the American \nmilitary itself. Nearly a decade passed from the end of U.S. combat \nparticipation in Vietnam in 1973 until the deployment of the U.S. \nMarines as part of the Multinational Force in Lebanon in August of \n1982. However, this was also a period when many of the post-cold-war \nconditions described by Haass as facilitating U.S. interventions were \nfirst taking hold, including the diminution of the Soviet/Warsaw Pact \nthreat, the development of greater U.S. capacity to sustain long-\ndistance military operations, and the resurgence of national and ethnic \ntensions around the globe.\n  A little less than a decade after the Lebanon debacle, in the \naftermath of other interventions in Grenada in 1983, Libya in 1986, \nPanama in 1989-1990, and in the 1990-1991 timeframe in the gulf war, \nand after the final end of the cold war, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, who had lived through this entire era, \npropounded a list of six questions which must be addressed before we \ncommit to a military intervention.\n  I submit General Powell's summation here is a summation based on his \nown experience and his own history in looking at this turbulent time.\n  No. 1, is the political objective important, clearly defined, and \nwell understood?\n  No. 2, have all nonviolent means been tried and failed?\n  No. 3, will military force achieve the objective?\n  No. 4, what will be the cost?\n  Next, Have the gains and risks been thoroughly analyzed?\n  Next, After the intervention, how will the situation likely evolve \nand what will the consequences be?\n  That is, I guess, my biggest problem with some of our interventions. \nWe have not thought through the end game, sometimes called the exit \nstrategy. But what would be the result of failure? What will be the \nresult of success? I am not sure we are thinking through our \ninterventions.\n  In a similar vein, falling on the side of what I would call restraint \nwith respect to U.S. military interventions, in 1993, then-Secretary of \nState Warren Christopher outlined four prerequisites for the use of \nforce by the United States:\n  No. 1, the presence of clearly articulated objectives;\n  No. 2, a high probability of success;\n  No. 3, the likelihood of congressional and public support; and No. 4, \nthe inclusion of a clear exit strategy.\n  Not bad advice. However, even before the start of the Clinton \nadministration, developments in Africa and in the Balkans were leading \nto a reassessment of the limits on U.S. military interventions. At the \nsame time his administration was deciding in favor of intervention in \nSomalia but against military involvement in Bosnia, President Bush \narticulated a somewhat lower bar for U.S. military intervention. As \ndescribed by Haass:\n\n       Bush argued for a case-by-case approach in deciding when \n     and where to use force. He argued against using interests as \n     an absolute guide, noting that ``military force may not be \n     the best way of safeguarding something vital, while using \n     force might be the best way to protect an interest that \n     qualifies as important but less than vital.''\n\n  That is Haass.\n\n       Instead, Bush set out five requirements for military \n     intervention to make sense: force should only be used, he \n     said, where the stakes warrant it, where and when it can be \n     effective, where the application can be limited in scope and \n     time, and where the benefits justify the potential costs and \n     sacrifice. Multilateral support is desirable but not \n     essential. What is essential in every case is a clear and \n     achievable mission, a realistic plan for accomplishing the \n     mission, and realistic criteria for withdrawing U.S. forces \n     once the mission is complete.\n\n  That is a pretty thorough analysis of the thought process that must \nbe undergone if we are to be successful in our interventions.\n  During the Clinton administration, there have been military \ninterventions in Iraq on several occasions, and continuing to this day: \nIn Somalia from 1992 to 1995, in Bosnia and Macedonia since 1993, in \nHaiti from 1993 to 1996, in Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, and of \ncourse in Kosovo beginning last year.\n  There has been an accompanying evolution away from the more \nrestrictive view of interventions expressed by Secretary Christopher \nand toward the less restrictive stance perhaps expressed most clearly \nrecently by British Prime Minister Blair in an April speech last year \nin Chicago.\n  Prime Minister Blair said:\n\n       The principle of non-interference must be qualified in \n     important respects. Acts of genocide can never be a purely \n     internal matter. When oppression produces massive flows of \n     refugees which unsettle neighboring countries then they can \n     probably be described as ``threats to international peace and \n     security. . . .'' So how do we decide when and whether to \n     intervene. I think we need to bear in mind five major \n     considerations. First, are we sure of our case? War is an \n     imperfect instrument for righting humanitarian distress, but \n     armed force is sometimes the only means of dealing with \n     dictators. Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? \n     Third, on the basis of a practical assessment of the \n     situation, are there military operations we can sensibly and \n     prudently undertake? Fourth, are we prepared for the long \n     term? In the past, we talked too much about exit strategies. \n     But having made a commitment we cannot simply walk away once \n     the fight is over, better to stay with moderate numbers of \n     troops--\n\n  Does that sound familiar?\n\n     than return for repeat performances with large numbers. And \n     finally, do we have national interests involved? The mass \n     expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo demanded the notice \n     of the rest of the world. But it does make a difference that \n     this is taking place in such a combustible part of Europe.\n\n  That is the end of Blair's statement. Interesting.\n  Clearly, we have come a long way from Vietnam, and today's world is \nquite different than the world of the sixties and seventies. Questions \nabout the use of force are, by their very nature, difficult ones. There \nare no easy answers and no easy choices for any President, and \ncertainly not us in the Congress. Part of this is a product of the \ndisorderly post-cold-war order, or a new world disorder. Every American \nand every inhabitant of this planet is certainly better off than we \nwere in the cold war which threatened the very survival of global \ncivilization. That\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\nended, but the termination of that phase of international politics has \nmade the world actually more complex for foreign policymakers.\n  In the cold war, the superpower rivalry and its mutually assured \ndestruction doctrine, in terms of nuclear war, imposed strong \nconstraints on interventions by either superpower. Korea, Vietnam, and \nAfghanistan were notable exceptions.\n  In the pre-cold-war history of the United States, the question of \nU.S. intervention outside of the Western Hemisphere rarely arose, short \nof a Pearl Harbor or a Lusitania incident that began the First World \nWar. In the new post-cold-war disorder, we largely face only self-\nimposed constraints to our actions abroad. Thus, we now need answer \nonly whether we should undertake such an action, not whether we can do \nso.\n  That is a clear distinction. In the cold war, we had a line that we \nknew we could not cross or should not cross. Now there are no lines. If \nmy colleagues read Tom Friedman in the book ``Lexus and the Olive \nTree,'' barriers of all kinds, not only the Berlin Wall, are coming \ndown all over the world. So the question more and more on American \nintervention is, Should we do it? What Senator Roberts and I are trying \nto say is that it is not only a Presidential decision, it is a decision \nin which all of us have to participate and, hopefully, one that we can \narrive at a consensus on before we send young Americans into harm's \nway. That is why we are here. That is why we are taking the Senate's \ntime today.\n  The two administrations which have confronted the post-Soviet Union \nworld have grappled mightily with the complexities in places such as \nIraq, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Haiti, and now Kosovo. And \nalmost every step in these areas have been subjected to questioning and \ncontroversy before, during, and after the operation in question. \nOpposition to the Presidential policies has not offered a clear-cut \nalternative, with some opponents calling for greater and some for \nlesser exertions of American power. As I have said before on several \noccasions, I approach the debate on intervention with the greatest \nrespect for the difficulties which the current or, indeed, any other \npost-cold-war administration and Congress must face when deciding \nAmericans should go to war.\n  However, I must say that I believe any departure from the principle \nof using our military intervention solely in defense of vital national \ninterests is a slippery slope. Let me say that again. I have to say \nthat I personally believe that any departure from the principle of \nusing American military intervention solely in defense of vital \nnational interests is a slippery slope. Let's recall from our previous \ndiscussions the very small ``A'' list of truly vital interests. As \narticulated by the 1996 Commission on America's National Interests--and \nSenator Roberts and I are engaging ourselves with that commission that \nis cranking up again and we hope to have some input--the Commission on \nAmerica's National Interests articulated that those interests are \n``strictly necessary to safeguard and enhance the well-being of \nAmericans in a free and secure Nation,'' and include only the \nfollowing: Prevent, deter, and reduce the threat of nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons attacks on the United States. That is \nsimple. That is clear.\n  Two, prevent the emergence of a hostile hegemon in Europe or Asia. As \nSenator Roberts the other day said, hegemon means the big bully, the \nlead dog, the big dog.\n  Three, prevent the emergence of a hostile major power on U.S. borders \nor in control of the seas.\n  Four, prevent the catastrophic collapse of major global systems such \nas trade, financial markets, supplies of energy, and so forth.\n  Five, ensure the survival of U.S. allies.\n  In pursuit of these objectives, the ``United States should be \nprepared to commit itself to fight,'' the commission says, ``even if it \nhas to do so unilaterally and without the assistance of allies.'' I \nunderstand my friend and colleague, Senator Roberts, says this list \nmight be slightly modified and updated by a new commission, but the \ncontent will basically be similar.\n  In short, I believe we can and must be prepared to commit all \navailable American resources--including military forces--in the defense \nof truly vital national interests. In such cases, I believe Presidents \nshould seek congressional approval, and I cannot imagine a Congress not \ngranting such authority in these cases. But in all other cases, I \nbelieve we have to impose a much higher bar before we put American \nservice men and women into harm's way--a much higher bar and a much \nhigher standard than we have used in the last 10 or 15 years.\n  General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put it \nbeautifully in an address to the Kennedy School at Harvard recently:\n\n       In every case when we contemplate the use of force, \n     we should consider a number of important questions. These \n     are not new questions, as most are articulated formally in \n     the National Security Strategy. They are:\n       Is there a clearly defined mission?\n       Is the mission achievable, and are we applying the \n     necessary means to decisively achieve it?\n       Do we have milestones against which we can measure or judge \n     our effectiveness?\n       Is there an exit strategy? Or, put another way, a strategy \n     for success within a reasonable period?\n       Do we have an alternate course of action should the \n     military action fail or take too long?\n       Are we willing to resource for the long haul?\n       If our military efforts are successful, are the appropriate \n     national and international agencies prepared to take \n     advantage of the success of the intervention?\n\n  We see that in the Balkans right now.\n\n       Have we conducted the up-front coordination with our \n     allies, friends, and international institutions to ensure our \n     response elicits the necessary regional support to ensure \n     long-term success?\n\n  These are powerful questions, as articulated by the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The military is the hammer in America's foreign policy \n     toolbox . . . and it is a very powerful hammer. But not every \n     problem we face is a nail.\n\n  That is critical.\n\n       We may find that sorting out the good guys from the bad is \n     not as easy as it seems. We also may find that getting in is \n     much easier than getting out.\n\n  Boy, is that true.\n\n       These are the issues we need to confront when we make the \n     decision to commit our military forces. And that is as it \n     should be because, when we use our military forces, we lay \n     our prestige, our word, our leadership and--most \n     importantly--the lives of our young Americans on the line.\n\n  As we approach Memorial Day, where we pay tribute and honor to those \nyoung Americans who have given their lives in the past, we must think \ncarefully and judiciously how we commit young Americans in the future \nin terms of American military intervention in the world.\n  Americans who serve today on the front lines in the service of this \ngreat Nation in Korea, Kosovo, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere \naround the globe, are very special Americans. They have volunteered to \ndo this duty for the rest of us.\n  When we return from the Memorial Day break, Senator Roberts and I \nwill resume these dialogs with a discussion of Clausewitz's trinity of \nwarmaking. He said, successfully war is prosecuted if you have three \nthings together: the people, the government, and the military. Marching \nforward arm in arm is what we are all about. That will be the subject \nof our next discussion.\n\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas, my partner, my dear \nfriend, Mr. Pat Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, today, May 25, in the year of our Lord 2000, \nmarks the 213th anniversary of a monumental event, the most monumental \nevent that ever occurred in American history. It was on May 25, 1787, \nthat a sufficient number of State delegations convened in Philadelphia \nto begin their deliberations ``to form a more perfect Union.'' Fifty-\nfive delegates labored through that long, hot summer in Independence \nHall in the very room where the Declaration of Independence had been \nsigned 11 years earlier. By September 17 of that year, when they \nadjourned sine die, they had produced a remarkable document, the most \nremarkable document of its kind that was ever written, the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  I place only the King James version of the Holy Bible above this \ndocument, the Constitution of the United States. That is the remarkable \ndocument that established our Federal Government, that provided for a \nU.S. Senate, that provided for the equality of the small States with \nthe large States. That is the document that made it possible for tiny, \nmountainous West Virginia to have two votes, to be equal to the great \nState of New York, to be equal to the great States of California, \nFlorida, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana in the Senate. If it were not for this \ndocument which I hold in my hand, the Constitution of the United \nStates, we wouldn't be here today. I wouldn't be here. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer who comes from the State of Illinois \nwould not be here. He would not be presiding in that chair. These would \nnot be the United States of America. In all likelihood, they would be \nthe ``Balkanized States of America.''\n  This remarkable document has established our Federal Government. It \nis fitting, therefore, that we pause today, and I thought it fitting \nthat someone take the floor to remark about the importance of this day \nin history and the importance of this document. It is fitting that we \npause to reflect on what those men who met at the Constitutional \nConvention hoped to accomplish and to remark on what they achieved.\n  The fledgling United States was in dire straits in 1787. There were \nno automobiles. There were no airplanes, no diesel motor trains, no \nelectric lights, no sulfa drugs, no antibiotics in 1787. It had become \npainfully apparent that the first National Government under the \nArticles of Confederation was not working.\n  Having thrown off the yoke of royal rule during the Revolution, \nAmericans at first had been reluctant to establish another strong \ncentral government. Not many people, I wager, in this country remember \nmuch, if anything, about the Articles of Confederation, our first \nConstitution, but our forebears had created a Government under the \nArticles of Confederation that represented little more than a loose \nassociation of 13 States, with the States retaining the real power. \nThose States were the former Colonies.\n  The National Government consisted of a single legislative body. Most \nof the governments in the world today consist of unicameral legislative \nbodies, one legislative body. But there are 61 governments in the world \ntoday that have bicameral legislatures. Most of the larger countries \nhave bicameral legislative bodies. There are 61 of them. And in only \ntwo, the United States and Italy, are the upper chambers not \nsubordinate to the lower chambers.\n  Each State, under the Articles of Confederation, regardless of size--\nwhether it was Pennsylvania, New York, tiny Delaware, Rhode Island, or \nGeorgia--each State, regardless of size, had a single vote in the \nCongress, in that one body. Under the Articles of Confederation, \nCongress could raise money only by asking the States for it. Congress \nhad no power to force a State to pay its share. At times, Congress \nlacked the funds to pay its soldiers' salaries and faced the threat of \nmutiny. General George Washington faced that threat of mutiny. The \nNation's international credit remained weak because of its war debts, \nwhich went unpaid due to wrangling between and among the States.\n  This discouraged foreign investments--as one could imagine--and \nfurther complicated the efforts to fund the Government operations.\n  As economic conditions worsened, a band of farmers in western \nMassachusetts, led by the Revolutionary War veteran, Daniel Shays, shut \ndown the State courts to stop their creditors from foreclosing on their \nlands. I wonder what Senator Ted Kennedy would think of that today. How \nwould Senator John Kerry feel about that--Shays' Rebellion? And not \nonly did they close down the courts to stop their creditors from \nforeclosing on their lands, but they also attacked the Federal arsenal \nat Springfield. When Massachusetts appealed for assistance, Congress \nhad neither an adequate army nor adequate funds to suppress Shays' \nRebellion.\n  George Washington, who had retired to his estate at Mount Vernon \nafter commanding American forces during the Revolutionary War, feared \nfor the survival of his country and predicted ``the worst consequences \nfrom a half-starved, limping Government, always moving upon crutches \nand tottering at every step.'' That was George Washington, the first \nPresident and the greatest President ever of the United States.\n  In 1785, a dispute over navigation rights on the Potomac River \nprompted the States of Virginia and Maryland to set up a meeting to \nsettle their differences. Maryland's delegation went to Alexandria, VA, \nonly to find that Virginia's delegates had not yet arrived. They had no \ninterstate highways. They had no great bridges that spanned the river. \nThey had no airplanes. There was no airport over at National in those \ndays. There were only horses and buggies.\n  As I say, Maryland's delegation went to Alexandria, VA, only to find \nthat Virginia's delegates had not yet arrived. Anxious for the \nconference not to fail, George Washington graciously invited the \ndelegates to Mount Vernon. There the two delegations discussed tolls \nand fishing rights on the Potomac. Where does the Potomac rise? It \nrises in my State, in West Virginia. Of course, there was no West \nVirginia in those days, but there was Virginia. And other questions \nwere raised that went beyond their immediate disputes. When the \nVirginia delegates submitted their report to the Virginia Assembly, it \nwent to a committee chaired by James Madison, Jr.\n  Convinced that larger issues remained, Madison persuaded the assembly \nto pass a resolution calling for a convention in the States to deal \nwith interstate commerce. In the fall of 1786, that convention met in \nAnnapolis, MD. You see, if it were today, Senators Barbara Mikulski and \nPaul Sarbanes would be there. But it was long before their time. That \nconvention could do nothing, since only 6 of the 13 States sent \nrepresentatives. Spurred by Madison of Virginia and Alexander Hamilton \nof New York, the Annapolis convention called for another convention the \nfollowing year in Philadelphia to go beyond commercial disputes and \nconsider creating a Federal Government strong enough to meet the needs \nof the new Nation.\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n  On May 14, 1787, the date set for that convention to open, a quorum \ncould not be attained. Not until May 25--213 years ago today--did \ndelegates from a majority of the States arrive. That was an important \nday--the day that a quorum of delegates arrived. Eventually, all but \nRhode Island would send delegates.\n  With a quorum established, they got down to business by unanimously \nelecting George Washington as their Presiding Officer. Talk about a \ngreat President, one that all the subsequent Presidents--I am sure most \nof them--have tried to emulate, there was the greatest President of \nall, George Washington, first in the hearts of his countrymen. His \ngreat prestige, the delegates knew, would help to quiet public \nsuspicion of the convention's intent. That convention closed its doors. \nThey didn't open the doors to the public. They locked the doors and \nestablished sentries at the doors and conducted its proceedings in \nsecret. That was a good thing.\n\n  According to James Madison's notes from May 25, Washington, ``in a \nvery emphatic manner . . . thanked the convention for the honor they \nhad conferred on him, reminded them of the novelty of the scene of \nbusiness in which he was to act, lamented his want of better \nqualifications, and claimed the indulgence of the House toward the \ninvoluntary errors which his inexperience might occasion.'' The \nconvention then elected a secretary and appointed a committee to \nprepare its standing rules. The convention knew the importance of \nstanding rules. The convention had learned that from the colonial \nlegislatures, the State legislatures, and from Parliament in the \nmotherland. Several of those forebears came from England, Scotland, and \nIreland; they were all subjects of Great Britain, of course. They knew \nabout Parliament. So, they prepared standing rules.\n  Over the next 3 months, the delegates crafted an entirely new Federal \nGovernment for the United States. Ever fearful of tyranny, they solved \nthe problem of concentration of power by dividing responsibilities \namong three equal branches of Government. O, that more of our people \ntoday would study American history! I am not talking about social \nstudies; I am talking about history--American history. O, that more of \nour Members would refresh their memories concerning American history! \nHow many times have I reminded ourselves of the importance of the \nchecks and balances, the separation of powers, the fact that there are \nthree equal and coordinate branches of Government?\n  As pragmatists who doubted the perfectibility of human beings, they \nassumed--those delegates at the convention--that strong individuals and \ngroups would always grasp for more power--and they were right--which \nwould be dangerous, even if meant for good purposes. They, the \ndelegates, believed that government evolved from the people and, \nindeed, they began their document with the words: ``We the \nPeople.'' But they also anticipated that public opinion would swing \nwildly--swing like a pendulum--wildly at times, and that public \npassions could get swept away in the frenzies of the moment. Some \npeople glibly refer to our form of government as a democracy. When you \nhear someone say that form of government is a democracy, mark that \nperson as not knowing what he is talking about. That person does not \nknow what he is talking about when he says that this Government is a \ndemocracy. It is not. Rather than a democracy, the Framers created a \nrepresentative government, a republic, with elaborate checks and \nbalances.\n\n  If we want to understand the difference between a democracy and a \nrepublic, let James Madison explain the difference in Federalist No. 10 \nand Federalist No. 14.\n  As James Madison later explained in the Federalist: ``If men were \nangels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, \nneither external nor internal controls on government would be \nnecessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men \nover men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the \ngovernment to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to \ncontrol itself.''\n  Mr. President, because the U.S. Constitution still functions \nessentially the way its authors intended, and because it has been \namended only 27 times in the past two centuries, that Constitutional \nconvention has sometimes been celebrated as the ``Miracle at \nPhiladelphia,'' and the delegates praised by none less than Thomas \nJefferson as ``demigods,'' suggesting that their work was divinely \ninspired. In point of fact, the convention was a long, hard, bitterly-\ndebated ordeal that on several occasions came close to collapse. They \ndid not have air-conditioning in those days. Those summers were just as \nhot as they are now, I suppose. The delegates needed to reach several \ncrucial compromises before enough of them would agree to the new \nconstitution. One of these compromises--known as the Great Compromise--\ncreated the U.S. Senate as a means of satisfying the smaller states' \ndemands for equality, while the House of Representatives would grant \nmore votes to the larger states by apportioning on the basis of \npopulation. Another pivotal compromise--the Three-Fifths Compromise--\naddressed the emotional issue of human slavery, by permitting slaves to \nbe counted as three-fifths of a person for purposes of taxation and \nrepresentation. Without the agreement, the Southern states would not \nhave ratified the new constitution. Yet, it left in place the peculiar \ninstitution of slavery that eventually would tear the nation apart in \ncivil war.\n  In other words, Mr. President, as remarkable as was the Constitution \nthat emerged from Philadelphia in 1787, and as much as it solved the \nproblems that had festered under the Articles of Confederation, it was \nnot a finished document. Despite the towering presence of George \nWashington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Madison, Mason, and \nother wise and trusted leaders at the Constitutional convention, there \nremained deep public suspicion over this new government, which after \nall had been debated entirely in secret session. Some delegates refused \nto sign the Constitution because it lacked protection of individual \nrights. This omission proved a major obstacle to the ratification of \nthe Constitution, leading Madison to pledge his support for a series of \namendments while the ink on the Constitution was still wet. During the \nFirst Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives, Madison \nproposed the first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, and two \nother amendments not ratified at the time (one of which more recently \nresurfaced as the 27th amendment) and which we remember in our own time \nhere in the Senate.\n  The late Justice Thurgood Marshall once commented that he could not \nadmire the framers' decision to compromise with slavery, and that, \ntherefore, he preferred to celebrate the Constitution as ``a living \ndocument, including the Bill of Rights and other amendments protecting \nindividual freedoms and human rights.'' Several amendments to the \nConstitution were more administrative in scope, designed to fix flaws \nin the Electoral College, change the calendar for congressional \nsessions and presidential inaugurations, and permit the levying of a \nfederal income tax. But most of the amendments dealt with expanding \ndemocratic rights and freedoms, from the abolition of slavery to the \nextension of the right to vote to blacks, women, and 18-year-olds, and \neven for the right of the people to directly elect their United States \nsenators. These few amendments have improved the original document. \nYet, in so many respects the Constitution remains unchanged. Today, \neach branch of the government retains essentially the same powers it \nwas given in 1787--albeit magnified to meet the challenges of \nsubsequent centuries. Ours, as Justice Thurgood Marshall reminded us, \nis a living Constitution.\n  If the Holy Bible were small enough, I would carry that with me, too. \nThis is the Constitution of the United States. Fortunately, it is a \nsmall document. It is a compact document that fits comfortably inside \nmy shirt pocket, and several Senators in this body carry the \nConstitution in their pockets. It is far shorter than most State \nconstitutions, including my own West Virginia Constitution. It does not \ntake long to read. But each time one reads it, one will find something \nnew in that Constitution--some thought that did not occur to that \nindividual before.\n  It does not take long to read, and yet opinion polls show that many \nAmericans have either never read it or have\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nforgotten most of what they learned about it in school. That may also \ngo for a good many of the Members of this body, and the other body. It \nwould be very well if all Members of the Senate and House reread the \nConstitution from time to time. It is vital that all Americans \nfamiliarize themselves with this document so that they know their \nconstitutional rights and their constitutional responsibilities.\n  Let me suggest, therefore, that May 25, marking the anniversary of \nthe day the Constitutional Convention got down to business, would be an \nappropriate day for all of us to once again read the Constitution and \nto appreciate the framers' efforts ``to form a more perfect Union, \nestablish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common \ndefense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of \nLiberty to ourselves and our Posterity.''\n  This coming Monday is Memorial Day, May 29. On that day, Edmund \nRandolph, Governor of the State of Virginia, presented his 15 resolves, \nhis 15 resolutions to the convention. The debates in those ensuing days \nlargely centered around Randolph's resolutions, or the so-called \nVirginia plan. So, I say to my colleagues, remember this coming Monday. \nThat was the day when the convention first heard about the Virginia \nplan.\n  Long live the memories of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4415-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WEDDING ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is not quite as important a subject to \nmy listeners, perhaps, as the words I have just spoken, but it is an \nimportant subject to me, because next Monday, the Lord willing--in the \nBook of James, we are told always not to say, I'll do this or I will do \nthat tomorrow; I'll go here or I'll go there tomorrow; always say, \n``the Lord willing'' --next Monday, the Lord willing, my wife and I \nwill celebrate our 63rd wedding anniversary.\n  I have to frankly say that what little I have amounted to, if it is \nanything much, I owe for the most part to her. She saw to it that I \nearned a law degree. She virtually put me through law school by her \ncaring ways. She fulfilled the responsibilities at home, rearing our \nchildren while I was busy. She went to the store, she did the buying, \nshe did the washing, she did the ironing, she pressed my clothes. She \nmopped the floors, she vacuumed the carpets, she did the work. I have \nnever seen a person who was a harder worker than my wife and the woman \nwho raised me, my old foster mother, my aunt.\n  But Erma is the one to whom credit is due. She has set the kind of \nexample for me over the years that I have not been able to emulate \nfully. This coming Monday, I am going to show her my appreciation by \ngoing back to the hills with her. On Monday, we will finish reading the \nKing James version of the Holy Bible together. We are down to where we \nlack four chapters. We try to read the Bible every Sunday--not that I \nam somebody who is good; the Bible says that no man is good; not that I \nam somebody good --but she and I read that Bible every Sunday. Three or \nfour months ago, I counted the number of chapters remaining, and it \ncame out to where if I divided them in a way that we would read six \nchapters every Sunday, we could finish the Bible, the reading of the \nHoly Bible, from beginning to end, the old testament and the new, on \nnext Monday, our wedding anniversary. We lack four chapters, and God \nwilling, we will finish those four chapters next Monday.\n  After that day, we will be on our way to our 64th wedding \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4415-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DETECTIVE JOHN EUILL\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I am talking about the Bible, I want to \ncall attention to a good man who works in this Capitol. He is a \ndetective. His name is John Euill.\n  Every time this little publication comes out, he brings it to me. The \ntitle of it is, ``Our Daily Bread.'' John Euill always brings that to \nme. Of course, we are not supposed to call attention to anyone in the \ngalleries in the Chamber, but I am going to call attention to someone \nwho is sitting on the Chamber bench on the Republican side right now. \nAll of our Members have shaken his hand. He is courteous. John Euill is \na wonderful man.\n  Let me read just a few words from ``Our Daily Bread,'' which he gave \nme today. The chapter titled, ``Building on the Bible'':\n\n       What can be done to improve society? An MTV political \n     correspondent had this unexpected but praiseworthy \n     suggestion: ``No matter how secular our culture becomes, it \n     will remain drenched in the Bible. Since we will be haunted \n     by the Bible even if we don't know it, doesn't it make sense \n     to read it?''\n       Our culture is indeed ``drenched in the Bible.'' Whether or \n     not the majority of people realize it, the principles on \n     which the United States was founded, and the values which \n     still permeate our national life, were based on the Holy \n     Scriptures.\n\n  If Senators don't believe that, go back and read the Mayflower \nCompact and many of the other great documents that form the basis of \nthis great Nation.\n\n       Yet, God's Word no longer occupies the commanding place it \n     held in the past.\n\n  And that is true.\n\n     Its ethics are sometimes still praised even though biblical \n     morality is flagrantly violated. So I agree with the \n     political correspondent's urging that people read the Bible.\n       We need to do more, however, than just read the Word of \n     God. We need to believe the Bible and put its inspired \n     teachings into practice. The psalmist reminded us that we are \n     to walk in God's ways, to keep His precepts diligently, and \n     to seek Him with our whole heart.\n\n  Psalm 119, the second through the fourth verses. I am going to read \nthose verses for the people who are watching through that electronic \neye above the presiding chair. I want in my small way to dedicate them \ntoday to Detective John Euill.\n\n       Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek \n     him with the whole heart.\n       They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.\n       Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.\n\n  I thank all Senators for their patience, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4415-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4415-S4416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SPECIAL AGENT JOHN J. TRUSLOW\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like at this time to pay my respects \nto FBI Special Agent John Joseph Truslow. John Truslow, an FBI agent \nstationed in Providence, was more than ``just an agent.'' He was a \nbrave man, a Rhode Islander who cherished his home state and served its \npeople with courage and distinction.\n  John grew up in Central Falls, Rhode Island and attended the \nUniversity of Rhode Island, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1972 and a \nmaster's degree in 1978. In 1980, he joined the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation in New York, where he was assigned for eleven years.\n  In 1991, John Truslow transferred back home to Rhode Island, with his \nwife, Diane, and their two children, Catherine and David.\n  During the next nine years with the Bureau, John Truslow \ndistinguished himself by leading several federal probes that attacked \ncorruption in our cities and towns.\n  In 1996, when the North Cape barge ran aground at Moonstone Beach, \nspilling over 800,000 gallons of home heating oil into Narragansett Bay \nand killing millions of fish and wildlife, John Truslow was hard at \nwork. Throughout that year and the next, he led a methodical \ninvestigation, which uncovered the corporate negligence that \ncontributed to the disaster. Because of his work, a groundbreaking \nagreement was reached in which the owner of the North Cape agreed to \npay $9.5 million in criminal damages. Today, despite one of the worst \nenvironmental accidents in Rhode Island's history, Narragansett Bay is \nrecovering, due, large part, to the work of Mr. Truslow.\n  Described by friends and co-workers as a man of substance and a man \nof honor, John continued to report to work each day, even after having \nbeen diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in August 1999. In fact, on \nApril 5, one day after his twentieth anniversary with the FBI and after \nmonths of being physically ravaged by cancer and the effects of \nchemotherapy, John testified before a federal grand jury to present \nevidence which lead to the indictment on bankruptcy fraud charges of a \nRhode Island traffic court judge. Twelve days later, on April 17, he \nwas in court for that indictment.\n\n  John was a dedicated agent, working up until his final days. We are \nhumbled by his courage, allegiance to duty and\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nhis perseverance in the face of adversity. He served with honor and \ndistinction, for the people of his home state of Rhode Island as well \nas the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Unfortunately, John lost his battle with cancer on May 5. To his \nfamily, I offer my sincerest condolences.\n  I need not tell them that they can be proud of John; they already \nknow that. But, I would like them to know what John's work meant to so \nmany in our state. He made a difference in our criminal justice system \nand has left a lasting impression on friends, co-workers and colleagues \nin law enforcement.\n  While he is gone, John's legacy of duty and courage lives on, and his \nrecord of service to his country and Rhode Island will not soon be \nforgotten.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Providence Journal-\nBulletin on the life of Mr. Truslow be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Providence Journal-Bulletin, May 14, 2000]\n\n        Remembering a Man Who Had the Courage of His Convictions\n\n                (By Mike Stanton; Journal Staff Writer)\n\n       Despite the ravages of brain cancer, FBI agent John \n     Truslow, whose cases included the North Cape oil spill and \n     Operation Plunder Dome, worked up until the final days of his \n     life.\n                                  ____\n\n       When two dozen FBI agents prepared to raid Providence City \n     Hall last spring, a lanky, bespectacled agent named John \n     Truslow was put in charge.\n       ``We specifically chose him because we wanted someone who \n     was low-key and decisive,'' recalls Daniel Knight, the head \n     agent in Providence.\n       Later that afternoon, while top federal prosecutors and FBI \n     officials held a news conference to announce Operation \n     Plunder Dome, Truslow was back in his familiar post behind \n     the scenes, poring through the arcane documents and tedious \n     tax records that would help the government build criminal \n     cases against corrupt Providence officials.\n       If John Truslow toiled in obscurity, his efforts were not \n     in vain. He worked on some of the most prominent criminal \n     cases in Rhode Island over the past decade from public \n     corruption in Johnston to criminal negligence in the 1996 \n     North Cape oil spill to the ongoing corruption probe of the \n     administration of Providence Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr.\n       Truslow kept working even after he was diagnosed with \n     terminal brain cancer last year.\n       As the cancer ravaged his body and the chemotherapy failed \n     to arrest the disease's advance, Truslow would say that he \n     was ``on top of the world'' and keep showing up for work.\n       Although his gait was unsteady and he was unable to drive, \n     Trusklow was still on the job in April, putting in a nine-\n     hour day as a federal grand jury indicted retired Rhode \n     Island traffic-court judge John F. Lallo on fraud-related \n     charges after an 18-month investigation.\n       On May 5, Truslow died, with his wife of nearly 22 years, \n     Dianne, and their daughter Catherine and son David nearby. He \n     was 50.\n       ``John would never, ever give up,'' says his friend and \n     colleague, Special Agent W. Dennis Aiken. ``He wasn't given a \n     lot of time by the doctors, but he had things that he wanted \n     to finish. He met every goal he set.''\n       That sense of purpose was evident at Truslow's wake last \n     Monday, a celebration of his life that drew an overflow crowd \n     of friends, family and colleagues from throughout the \n     Northeast.\n       Patting his friend's hand, Aiken talked about Truslow's \n     love of his family and his job, and vowed that his work would \n     continue:\n       ``There's still a lot of people we need to put in jail.''\n       EVEN AT 6-FOOT-5, John J. Truslow was a man who, with his \n     crumpled raincoat and mild personality, ``could easily fade \n     into the background,'' says friend and federal prosecutor Ira \n     Belkin.\n       ``He was all substance, no show,'' says Belkin. ``No task \n     was too small or too big. If I had 10 John Truslows, there \n     would be no crime in Rhode Island.''\n       Truslow grew up in Central Falls, one of four children. His \n     father worked for a local gas company; his mother worked in a \n     mill.\n       As a student at the University of Rhode Island in the early \n     1970s, Truslow met a high-ranking FBI official the father of \n     a classmate and ``became fascinated with the bureau,'' \n     recalls his wife, Dianne L. Truslow.\n       The FBI official told him that there were two paths to \n     becoming an agent accounting or law school. Truslow chose \n     accounting.\n       He joined the bureau in 1980, in New York, and within a few \n     years began specializing in white-collar crime. In 1991, he \n     transferred to Rhode Island, moving to East Greenwich.\n       Before long, Truslow was leading a federal corruption probe \n     of the Town of Johnston, involving bribes by developers to \n     town officials.\n       One official was charged with demanding a $10,000 bribe, \n     which he described as ``coffee money.'' Ultimately, eight \n     people were convicted. Long-time Johnston Mayor Ralph aRusso, \n     who wasn't charged, was voted out of office.\n       ``The people in Johnston Town Hall hated to see him,'' \n     recalls Dianne Truslow. ``He knew their records better than \n     they did.''\n       Other Johnstonians cheered him on. One was Rosie Cioe, \n     proprietor of the downtown Providence deli Amenities, where \n     Truslow would stop in every morning for a cranberry muffin.\n       ``John kept my hopes up that Johnston would turn itself \n     around,'' she recalls. ``I'd say, `You're doing a hell of a \n     job, John. Keep going.' He'd just smile.''\n       Peter DiBiase, a Providence criminal-defense lawyer who \n     represented people investigated by Truslow, calls him ``a \n     worthy adversary and an honorable man.''\n       ``He played hard and he played fairly,'' recalls DiBiase. \n     ``He's the most diligent FBI agent I ever met.''\n       ON JAN. 19, 1996, the tug Scandia caught fire in a storm \n     and ran aground at Moonstone Beach with the barge North Cape, \n     causing the worse oil spill in Rhode Island history.\n       Truslow led a team of state and federal investigators in \n     piecing together hundreds of boxes of ship records and \n     interviewing crew members who had concealed problems with the \n     boats.\n       The result was a groundbreaking 1997 agreement in which the \n     boat owner, Eklo Marine Corp., agreed to pay $9.5 million in \n     damages.\n       ``Some agents are good with paper and some are good with \n     people there aren't many agents like John who are good with \n     both,'' says Belkin.\n       Truslow had a patient, methodical style of interviewing \n     that broke down many a target into confessing criminal \n     wrongdoing, associates say. In one fraud case, Belkin \n     recalls, a suspect being questioned by Truslow raised his \n     hand and, to the dismay of his lawyer, said, ``Guilty.''\n       Last Aug. 11, while delivering subpoenas to Newport, \n     Truslow suffered a seizure and blacked out, crashing his car \n     into a tree in Middletown. He came to in an ambulance.\n       Hospital tests found seven tumors in his brain and three \n     more in his lungs. Following 10 days of radiation treatment, \n     doctors at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston found \n     that the tumors had grown. Last October, they estimated that \n     he had six months to live.\n       ``We were beside ourselves,'' recalls Dianne Truslow. ``We \n     sat there and wept.''\n       Agents continued to drive Truslow to Boston for treatment. \n     His hair fell out, his body grew gaunt, and he suffered \n     painful side effects from the chemotherapy. Still, he kept \n     working. His job helped distract him from the cancer, and the \n     cancer drove him to push hard to finish cases.\n       Truslow worked on a Plunder Dome case involving lawyer and \n     long-time State House insider Angelo ``Jerry'' Mosca Jr. In \n     January, Mosca pleaded guilty to delivering $25,000 in bribes \n     to city tax officials; one of the bribes involves allegations \n     that $10,000 was intended for an unidentified high-ranking \n     city executive.\n       Truslow also sat at the table with a federal prosecutor in \n     March, when Providence tax collector Anthony E. Annarino \n     pleaded guilty to taking bribes in another Plunder Dome case.\n       Truslow's wife says that he set milestones to keep himself \n     going: his 50th birthday in November, which was marked by a \n     surprise party attended by about 75 FBI agents and other \n     friends; Christmas, his children's birthdays, his 20th \n     anniversary with the FBI.\n       On April 5, the day after marking his 20th anniversary, \n     Truslow was back before a federal grand jury, presenting \n     evidence that led to the indictment of former Rhode Island \n     traffic-court judge John Lallo on bankruptcy fraud charges.\n       In the preceding months, Truslow had continued to build the \n     case, interviewing witnesses at Foxwoods casino in \n     Connecticut, where Lallo had piled up gambling debts.\n       On April 17, Truslow appeared in court for Lallo's \n     arraignment. One week later, on April 24, he came to work for \n     the last time. After a few hours, however, it became apparent \n     that he had taken a turn for the worse: he struggled to speak \n     in complete sentences, and had to be taken home.\n       He died nearly two weeks later. On Thursday, Truslow's wife \n     and children, following his wishes, scattered his ashes from \n     an airplane over a favorite spot overlooking Narragansett \n     Bay.\n       Dianne Truslow recalls her husband's pride back on April 4, \n     when he was honored for his 20 years of service in the FBI. \n     Barry W. Mawn, the head of the FBI's Boston office, hailed \n     Truslow as ``a profile in courage.''\n       As the 200 people there wept openly, a sobbing Truslow \n     thanked them.\n       ``I don't know how much longer I have,'' said Truslow, \n     ``but I will continue to work every day and do my best.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4416-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4416-S4443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AGRICULTURAL RISK PROTECTION ACT OF 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 2559) to amend the Federal Crop Insurance \nAct to strengthen the safety net for agricultural producers by \nproviding greater\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\naccess to more affordable risk management tools and improved protection \nfrom production and income loss, to improve the efficiency and \nintegrity of the Federal crop insurance programs and for other purposes \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill H.R. \n     2559, to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act have agreed to \n     recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by all of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report. (The conference \nreport is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of May 24, \n2000.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as a parliamentary inquiry, my \nunderstanding is that unanimous consent has been reached that this \nSenator controls 1 hour of debate, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, 1 hour of debate, and the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, controls 1 hour of debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to myself such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Agricultural Risk \nProtection Act of 2000. I am very pleased this legislation is before \nthe Senate today for final consideration after a great deal of work by \nSenators of both parties and both sides of this Capitol. I am here to \ntestify that there is proud bipartisan support for this legislation, \nhighlighted by the fact that all members of the conference committee \nfor this legislation signed the conference report after our meeting \nyesterday.\n  This conference report contains several titles. Title I pertains to \ncrop insurance important to so many agriculture producers throughout \nthe country. The fiscal year 2001 budget resolution provided $8 billion \nover 5 years for crop insurance legislation. This conference report \nincreases premium subsidies to make crop insurance more affordable. The \nbill also tightens program integrity provisions to limit abuse. It also \nhelps producers of non-insured crops, predominantly specialty crops, by \nmaking the non-insured assistance program more readily available to \nthem. Finally, the legislation encourages farmers to adopt a broad \narray of risk management activities beyond crop insurance alone.\n  Title II of this conference report provides $7.14 billion in economic \nassistance to farmers as provided in the fiscal year 2001 budget \nresolution. Included in this conference report is $5.466 for a market \nloss payment for farmers in this fiscal year based on last year's AMTA \npayment rate. Five hundred million dollars is provided for oilseed \nproducers. Funds are also provided for specialty crops including \nfunding for purchases of crops that have experienced low prices in 1998 \nor 1999 and loans for apple producers who are suffering economic and \nincome loss. Finally, funding is provided for purchases of commodities \nfor the school lunch program which benefits school children as well as \nfarmers.\n  Title III of the conference report contains the Biomass Research and \nDevelopment Act, a bill which I originally introduced in the Senate \nlast year. This legislation establishes a focused, integrated, and \ninnovation-driven research effort to develop technologies for the \nproduction of biobased industrial products. The bill also authorizes a \nbiomass research and development initiative to competitively award \ngrants to carry out research and development of low cost and \nsustainable biobased industrial products.\n  Title IV and V of the conference report consolidates and streamlines \nexisting statutory authorities for plant protection and authorizes \ncivil penalties for harming or interfering with animals used for USDA \ninspections. Senator Craig had originally introduced this legislation \nin the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Harkin, the ranking minority member of the committee, \nand Senator Roberts and Senator Kerrey for their hard work and that of \ntheir staff in finalizing the crop insurance legislation. All members \nof the conference committee and their staff are thanked for their \nimportant contributions to the process.\n  Finally, I also want to thank Congressman Combest, the chair of the \nHouse Agriculture Committee, and Ranking Minority Member Stenholm and \ntheir staff for their hard work in the past few weeks on this \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased to report the House of Representatives took action on \nthis conference report this morning and passed it unanimously. I am \nhopeful that we may have a result similar, if not exactly the same as \nthat, this afternoon in this body.\n  Let me simply add that this legislation is of enormous importance to \nAmerican agriculture. I have tried to summarize as succinctly as \npossible these five titles. But the consequences of this bill are very \nsubstantial. The dollars involved I have outlined. But the confidence, \nthe hope that comes to producers who have had great discouragement in \nterms of low prices, in terms of export markets that have been withheld \ndue to economic conditions in Asia, biotechnology disputes now in \nEurope, very great problems in negotiating trade agreements, whether it \nbe the Seattle scene or the Washington scene more recently--this has \nbeen a very tough time.\n  The Chair comes from the State adjacent to my own, a State which, \nlike Indiana, must export half of the soybeans we produce and about a \nthird of the corn we produce. There can be no prosperity in American \nagriculture without vigorous negotiations to knock down these trade \nbarriers and to open up prospects for our farmers to realize the \nbenefits of having the best--the best in terms of quality, the best in \nterms of price.\n  These economic circumstances do not pertain if there are barriers to \nexports. But in this interim period, it is appropriate that Congress \nhas understood these unusual international problems and understood we \nare in transition to more market-oriented farming. The crop insurance \ntitle in particular recognizes the possibility of farmers becoming much \nbetter marketers, much better business people, which all of us will \nhave to become if we are, in fact, to succeed over the coming \ngeneration.\n  I know many Senators will want to speak on this issue. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield myself time off the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as a member of the conference on the \ndisaster bill and the crop insurance bill, I am pleased to give strong \nsupport to the conference report.\n  First, I thank the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Lugar, for his leadership, his patience, and his very gracious \ntreatment of all of our colleagues. All of us understand this \nparticular bill was not Senator Lugar's first preference. Once again, \nhe responded to the concerns of colleagues on the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and in the larger body and did so in a most gracious way. For \nthat, I thank Senator Lugar. He has once again demonstrated the way we \nought to do business in the Senate. He has certainly set a high \nstandard.\n  I also thank our ranking member, Senator Harkin, who has been \nindefatigable in advancing the cause of American agricultural \nproducers. Senator Harkin has been a forceful advocate. Time after \ntime, he has stood in the breach and insisted we do what is right by \nfarmers and ranchers all across the country. I thank Senator Harkin for \nhis exceptional leadership. We would not be here today without him.\n  I also thank Senator Kerrey and Senator Roberts who were the primary \nsponsors of the legislation before us. Without their steadfastness \nright to the bitter end, we would not be here today. We faced a threat \nas late as last night when it was proposed we put the bankruptcy bill \non this legislation. All of us know what that would have meant. That \nwould have meant endless delay. That would have meant sinking into a \nbog of controversy that extends not only to the bankruptcy bill, but \nunrelated issues attached to it. Special thanks to those who stood firm \nand\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\nsaid, no, this needs to be a bill that deals with the critical problems \nfacing farmers and ranchers in the United States.\n  I also thank my close friend and colleague, Senator Grassley, who, as \na member of the Budget Committee, worked with me to secure the $8.2 \nmillion in the budget that makes possible crop insurance reform.\n  Finally, I recognize the work of the House committee chairman, \nCongressman Combest, for conducting what was a very fair and open \nconference committee. That is the way a conference committee should \nfunction. It was give and take, it was a debate, it was discussion, and \nat the end, it was a coming together around legislation that is, I \nthink, outstanding. I again single out the House committee chairman, \nCongressman Combest, for his leadership.\n  We have developed, I believe, the right bill at the right time with \nthe required budget support. In one bill, we have managed to bring \ntogether emergency farm relief for the families who are faced with the \nlowest prices, in real terms, in 50 years and a reform of the crop \ninsurance system to make it more affordable at every level.\n  In addition to that, we are righting a wrong done to Durum farmers a \nyear ago. This bill provides emergency relief in the form of 100-\npercent AMTA supplemental payments. For wheat farmers, that means \ninstead of getting 64 cents a bushel, as they did last year in an AMTA \npayment, they will get 64 cents in addition to the regular AMTA \npayment, which this year will be 57 cents. So they will get an AMTA \nsupplement--this is on wheat now--of 64 cents a bushel that is \nequivalent to last year's AMTA payment, married to the AMTA payment we \nwill be getting this year.\n  In addition, we have a crop insurance reform bill that is a dramatic \nimprovement. When I go home and have meetings all across North Dakota, \none of the most agricultural States in the Nation, what I am told, and \ntold repeatedly, is that crop insurance is not working. It does not \nwork because we do not have the right levels of support at the levels \nof coverage that farmers are buying, and they have a very serious \nproblem if they have multiple years of disaster.\n  Oddly enough, the way the formulas work, when farmers have multiple \nyears of disaster, the base that calculates the support they receive is \ndiminished--it is reduced, and it is reduced dramatically. The irony \nis, at the very time farmers need help the most, we have a formula that \ngives them the least help. It makes no sense. We have adjusted that in \nthis legislation.\n\n  I know there are those who are critical of using the AMTA payments as \na basis for the economic disaster assistance. I understand that. AMTA \npayments are not countercyclical. That is, they are not designed to \nhelp those commodities that are the exact ones that are being hurt by \nthis downturn.\n  In addition, AMTA payments are not based on current production. AMTA \npayments, as a result, can go to producers and landowners who may no \nlonger be producing the crop on which their payment is based or who are \nno longer growing a crop of any kind. Those are legitimate criticisms. \nMost of us recognize that.\n  The question is, Do we make the perfect the enemy of the very good? I \nsay to my colleagues, could we have done better? Yes, we could. We \ncould have adopted a countercyclical program. But I say to my \ncolleagues, at some point we have to make a decision: Are we going to \ndelay support for producers who are in very deep economic trouble, \nfaced with a circumstance in which USDA informs us, absent our action, \nfarm income will drop $8 billion this year; or do we act?\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in acting. Let's not delay. Let's not \nwait. Let's not make the perfect the enemy of the very good. The fact \nis, this package is going to make the difference for tens of thousands \nof farm families all across America between economic survival and \neconomic death. That is the reality. That is what motivates the urgency \nof our action.\n  I am very proud of the package that is before us. Many people labored \nhours and hours to produce this result. I salute not only the Members \nwho worked hard and provided the leadership, but I thank the staffs on \nboth sides who exhibited a dedication to public service because they \ndid not work just 9 to 5. I know there are some people who think the \nSenate is kind of an easygoing place and people work leisurely hours. \nThat is not the truth.\n  The truth is people here work very hard. No one works harder than the \nstaffs. The staffs in this circumstance have given us a perfect example \nof how to function to produce a result. They worked together \nharmoniously--well, not always harmoniously. Sometimes there was \nfriction, sometimes there were real differences of opinion, but they \nkept at it, and they produced a result, and it is a result that is good \nfor the country. They worked very long hours, many times late into the \nnight, through the weekends repeatedly, to help achieve this result. I \nsalute them today on both sides of the aisle because this was a \nbipartisan product. That happens, unfortunately, not as frequently as \nit should happen in this Chamber. I can tell you, this package is a \nproduct of coming together in a bipartisan effort. I salute all those \nwho helped produce it.\n  In addition to the disaster package we have, in addition to the crop \ninsurance reform which is wide sweeping and incredibly important to \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers, this bill also includes provisions that \neffectively resolve a lawsuit brought by an unfair action by USDA \nregarding the 1999 durum crop revenue coverage level in contracts that \nwere offered in various parts of the country. This means that both \nparties to that lawsuit--farmers and USDA--have a reason to settle that \nlawsuit, with every policyholder who received a claim getting \nadditional per-bushel assistance.\n  More importantly, the bill language makes it clear that actions on \nthe part of USDA that change the conditions of crop insurance policies \nretroactively are not acceptable for any commodity.\n  Whatever were they thinking of, to put out a contract--however flawed \nthat contract might be--to have farmers sign up to it, and then to \nwithdraw it? These contracts are contracts. That means there is a two-\nway bargain. You cannot have a circumstance in which the Federal \nGovernment puts out a contract, gets people to sign up to it, and then \nchanges its mind and withdraws it. That is not fair. That is not right. \nIn this legislation, we have sent that clear signal.\n  I close by suggesting to my colleagues that we now have a moment in \ntime that we can act together in the best interests of the farmers and \nranchers of America. I urge my colleagues to support this conference \nreport. I again say how proud I am to have been a part of this \nconference that functioned the way a conference should in a bipartisan \neffort to produce a result that is good for America.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I note that Senator Harkin was going to \ncome out on the floor. I will try to be relatively brief. I did not \nwant to precede him. Let me just take a few moments, and then I will \nreserve the remainder of my time for later on. I know my colleague from \nIdaho wants to speak as well.\n  Mr. President, I am speaking on my hour right now, though I will not \ntake up all the time, and I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  At the beginning, Mr. President, before I thank some of my colleagues \nfor their work and then be honest in some of my criticism, I will very \nbriefly, with the indulgence of my colleagues, just point out on the \nfloor of the Senate that yesterday--all of us have to deal with this in \nour States--Sheila and I received some unexpected news that has \ndevastating consequences for the people of part of Minnesota--an area I \nlove, the Minnesota Iron Range. The steel company LTV announced it is \ngoing to close the taconite plant in Hoyt Lakes. They employ 1,400 \npeople, I say to my colleague from Idaho. For Hoyt Lakes, Aurora, and \nother communities in the Iron Range, this is just devastating news.\n  It just makes me sick to my stomach because these workers are friends \nand their family members are part of our family. I have always been \nhonest that the Iron Range in Minnesota is a second home for me. It is \nall so unexpected.\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\n  Jerry Fallos, who is the president of the steelworkers local, got a \ncall yesterday at 6 a.m. in the morning. The company said: We want to \nmeet with you. He had absolutely no inkling there was any trouble. LTV \nsaid: We are closing the Erie plant.\n  I know that the steelworkers are asking for an accounting of the \nclosing. They are pledging to do whatever they can to keep it open. In \nwhatever way I can help as a Senator, I certainly intend to do it.\n  By way of concluding these remarks and getting on to the conference \nreport, I want to say this.\n  Tomorrow, I am going to leave early to go home and meet with county \ncommissioners, workers, union representatives, company people, small \nbusinesspeople, and all the rest. I know we will be talking about how \nto get assistance to people and how to have more economic development \nand the need to figure out yet other ways to diversify the local \neconomy. But the one thing I want to mention, because the Iron Range is \nso special, is that sometimes I do not think we focus enough on \ncommunity.\n  I think this should bring Democrats and Republicans together --a \nplace where people live, where people go to church or synagogue or \nmosque, or wherever people raise their families, where people know one \nanother, people love one another, and people support one another.\n  I truly do believe sometimes these capital investment decisions in \nthis new global economy, that get made over martinis, halfway across \nthe world, can have devastating consequences for the people in our \ncommunities. I think we need to put more of a premium on community, \nespecially on our smaller communities. I hate it when we are put in the \nposition of picking up the pieces as a result of the communities being \ndevastated by policies that are needless and should not be supported in \nthe first place.\n  Again, we have seen a torrent of dumped steel imports coming into our \ncountry that has made our industry vulnerable. We now have 1,400 \npeople--much less their families and communities--who are very much at \nrisk.\n\n  As a Senator, I am going to do everything I can to help these people.\n  In some ways this is like the farm crisis.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Idaho how long he intends to \ntake?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague.\n  I would speak probably no more than about 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I did not want to precede Senator \nHarkin, who is the ranking member on this committee. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Harkin be able to speak, after which Senator Craig \nwould be recognized for 5 minutes, and then I be recognized to follow \nSenator Craig. Would that be all right? I would be pleased to do that. \nI ask unanimous consent that that be the order. I say to my friend from \nIowa, I did not intend to precede him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wellstone for his \nconsideration. I do appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon, as most of us do, \nto speak about the crop insurance conference report that is now before \nus and to thank those conferees--the chairman of the full committee, \nSenator Lugar, Senator Roberts, and others on our side, certainly, who \nwere engaged, as they should be, to produce this conference report, and \nthank them for the hard work they have rendered in bringing about crop \ninsurance reform.\n  It is a challenging process at best. They have done an excellent job \nin balancing the interests we have in agriculture, and to have crop \ninsurance that reflects the diversity of agriculture itself.\n  With the passage of the farm bill, Congress--we--promised crop \ninsurance that would work. I am pleased to see that we now are living \nup to that promise by passing sweeping legislation to bring some \nnormalcy back to our Nation's farm economy and to expand the risk \nmanagement tools available to our farmers and ranchers.\n  The crop insurance conference report addresses several concerns \nfarmers from my State and I have about the current Crop Insurance \nProgram. The conference report provides increased subsidies for greater \nbuy-up of crop insurance, funding for research and development of \nspecialty crop insurance, and the removal of the NAP area trigger, just \nto name a few of the improvements.\n  This legislation is a very balanced approach, containing meaningful \nand sweeping reforms that all of us would admit are long overdue.\n  As we all know, the agricultural economy has been in a dramatic slump \nfor the last good number of years. USDA reports that overall conditions \nin the economy in early 2000 are largely a replay of last year. \nAgriculture is a part of the world economy, and farmers across the \nboard are facing very difficult times.\n  For the past 2 years, though, we here in Congress have tried to \nrespond to the agricultural crisis by providing over $15 billion in \nemergency economic aid. I do not stand back from that. I think it was \nappropriate and necessary to keep our agriculture economy out of \nbankruptcy.\n  The need this year is not much different than last. I am pleased that \nthere is $7.1 billion in economic farm aid in this conference report. \nThis funding includes $5.5 billion additional AMTA payments, or market \nloss payments; $200 million for specialty crops; $500 million for \noilseed payments; $11 million for wool and mohair maintenance; loans \nfor producers who were affected by the AgriBioTech bankruptcy that \nimpacted my State and other States dramatically, including Oregon, \nWashington, Montana, some 30-plus States that were involved in both \ngrass clover and alfalfa seeds.\n  I have worked for and supported the funding because I believe it is \nwhat our farmers need to stay in business in the short term. We must \nhelp them deal with this if we can; and I think we are. USDA reports \nthat global economies are now improving. Of course, we know that many \nof our products sell openly in the world market. As that economy \nimproves, so does the demand for agricultural commodities from this \ncountry and the improvement of price.\n\n  The conference report also includes the Plant Protection Act, a bill \nI have been working on for nearly 2 years. What is it? It is a weeds \nprogram. That is what it is all about. I think those of us who are \nfamiliar with agriculture recognize that we have not been good at \ndealing with weeds. Those of us who live near large tracts of public \nland recognize that our public land neighbors have been less than good \nstewards of their land by allowing major increases in noxious weed \npopulations on our public lands. This is a major step in the direction \nof improving that. It follows the President's initiative that was taken \na couple of years ago with the legislation Senator Akaka and I have \nworked on for some time. I hope we can meet the other needs that \nSenator Akaka has, and I will work with him in the agricultural \nappropriations that will follow to see if we can make that happen.\n  This legislation will organize and expand the function of the Animal \nand Plant Health Inspection Service. APHIS currently gets its authority \nfrom 10 different statutes, some of which are outmoded and conflicting \nand complicated. As a result, it simply has not provided us with the \nkind of consistency we need to deal with commercializing technologies \nand the use of biocontrols in the area of weeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for no more than 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. This bill has broad support from the American Nursery and \nLandscape Association, National Association of State Departments of \nAgriculture, the National Christmas Tree Association, the National \nPotato Council, and many others that for a long time have recognized \nthe need to reform this area of the law.\n  Again, I commend the conferees on both sides of the aisle for the \nhard work they have undertaken in producing this conference report in a \nway that will produce reform in crop insurance that I think is now \nfunctional, workable, and becomes the kind of risk\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\nmanagement tool we promised American agriculture some years ago. With \nthat is the supplemental program for emergency purposes that will go a \nlong way toward stabilizing the agricultural economy as we move through \nthis year and into next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Senator Roberts is here. He worked so \nhard on the crop insurance bill, which is a fine piece of legislation. \nI ask unanimous consent that Senator Roberts be recognized for about 15 \nminutes, and afterwards I follow him, and then Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n2559, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000.\n  As has been indicated by my colleagues, this legislation provides \nwhat we believe are very dramatic reforms to the Crop Insurance \nProgram. It also marks the final product of a legislative initiative \nSenator Bob Kerrey and I began working on nearly 2 years ago. Senator \nKerrey and I decided to undertake this task at the same time Congress \nwas passing the first of several large agriculture assistance packages \nin 1998. The problems we experienced in 1998 and again in 1999 exposed \nmany of the holes in the current Crop Insurance Program. We agreed that \nchanges needed to be made and that we must work together in a \nbipartisan manner to achieve program improvements. In fact, this is one \nof the reforms that was promised as an integral part of the 1996 farm \nbill. Obviously, those reforms did not take place, but here we are, \nfinally, in an effort to achieve those reforms.\n  Senator Kerrey and I did not just set out to write a bill based upon \nwhat we thought needed to be done. Rather, we wanted input from those \nwho were most directly affected by this program. We asked virtually \nevery producer, every farm organization, every commodity group, every \ncrop insurance company, every insurance agent group in the country for \ninput on this legislation. We traveled throughout the country. We held, \nliterally, hundreds of hours of listening sessions here in Washington \nto get the input both from the organizations and the producers.\n  The responses were overwhelmingly clear: Major changes were needed in \nregard to the Crop Insurance Program. These groups recommended more \naffordable crop insurance policies at higher levels of coverage, \nequalization of the subsidy on something called revenue insurance, \nprovisions to deal with multiple years of disaster, a better program \nfor new and beginning farmers, changes in the product approval process, \nand, finally, the removal of the regulatory roadblocks that had stifled \nnew product development.\n\n  Senator Kerrey and I took these recommendations very seriously, and \nthis legislation achieves each of these goals. The process has not been \neasy. We began our meetings on this issue in September of 1998. We \nintroduced our first legislation, S. 529, the Crop Insurance for the \n21st Century Act, last February. We then introduced a second bill, S. \n1580, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, in September. In \nMarch, the Agriculture Committee and the Senate approved the crop \ninsurance legislation that was based largely upon our original bill. \nSince passage of the Senate bill, we have spent nearly 7 full weeks in \nconference with the House. There have been many surprises, many bumps \nin the road, to say the least, sometimes arising at the last minute. I \nbelieve those unexpected bumps, however, were appropriate because they \nhelped remind us of the often unexpected, unpredictable risks that our \nfarmers and ranchers face on a daily basis, the same risks that this \nlegislation works to help them manage.\n  The task was difficult and the hours were often long, but in the end \nwe achieved a bipartisan bill that was supported by all 18 members of \nthe conference committee between the House and the Senate. That is no \nsmall achievement.\n  Exactly what does this bill do? It makes it easier for producers to \npurchase the higher levels of coverage by increasing the premium write-\ndowns and reducing the farmer's out-of-pocket expenses. By allowing the \nproducer to produce these higher levels of coverage, I believe we will \nreduce the need for future disaster bills, those disaster bills that \nare always a disaster to pass, a disaster to implement, and always seem \nto come during even-numbered years. The legislation makes the revenue \ninsurance policies that have become enormously popular for producers \nmore affordable as well. This is risk management. These are risk \nmanagement tools that, hopefully, will lessen the reliance on disaster \nbills and all of the expenditures that those entail, usually under \nemergency legislation.\n  The legislation also provides adjustments to something called the \naverage production history, the APH, for those farmers who have \nexperienced a year or years of significant crop losses and disaster. It \nprovides for a new assigned yield system that will benefit new and \nbeginning farmers.\n  The legislation also restructures the board of directors to provide \nmore producer and insurance expertise. The product approval and the \nresearch development processes are greatly improved. This will result \nin the development of new and improved products that will provide our \nproducers with the additional risk management tools they need.\n  We have also strengthened the fraud and abuse penalties in the \nprogram. Farmers and ranchers should pay attention to this; critics of \nthe farm program should pay attention to this. Under this legislation, \nthe producers and insurance representatives who would abuse the program \nface fines of up to $10,000 and possible disbarment from all USDA \nprograms for up to 5 years. Those who would try to destroy the \nintegrity of the program are going to be punished, and they are going \nto be punished big time.\n  I also comment on several provisions that do not necessarily affect \nmy State and producers but which I know are very important to other \nMembers in this body.\n  In recent years, there have been many complaints that specialty crop \nproducers and certain areas of the country have been ``underserved'' by \nthe Crop Insurance Program. This legislation takes major steps to \naddress these concerns.\n  First, it provides nearly $500 million over 5 years for changes to \nmake something called the Noninsured Assistance Program, or NAP. NAP \nwill work better for these producers. It requires the RMA to undertake \nstudies and report to Congress on ways to better serve these areas. And \nmore than $200 million is provided for expanded research and education \nto develop new and better risk management products for these producers.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the important crop insurance reforms \nincluded in this package, we have also provided $7.1 billion in \nagriculture assistance for farmers and ranchers who have not enjoyed \nthe booming economic times experienced by the rest of the U.S. economy. \nApproximately $5.5 billion of this amount will go out as market loss \npayments, through the AMTA payment mechanism established in the 1996 \nfarm bill.\n  Now, while I understand some of my colleagues believe this is not the \nbest way to distribute these funds, it is the quickest guaranteed \nmanner by which the USDA can make these payments. I remind my \ncolleagues who wanted to develop a new payment formula that in the past \n2 years it has taken the Department of Agriculture at least 9 months to \nmake these payments through the disaster and assistance programs that \nwere not paid to producers through the AMTA payment mechanism.\n  I also point out that after a lot of real criticism regarding the \nAMTA process, the department or the administration came forward with a \nplan, only to be roundly criticized by virtually every farm \norganization and commodity group. So I think this is the way to do it. \nThese are emergency payments.\n  As long as we don't have our export markets back, as long as farmers \nare not experiencing the kind of farm income at the country elevator, \nand market prices are depressed, I think this is appropriate, and \ndoubtless this will help. We are doing it early. We are doing it early \nin the spring. It is in the budget. No Social Security money. No \nemergency money. The farmers, ranchers, and the lenders can sit down, \nand\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\nunder consistency and predictability, know what they are getting this \nfall.\n  I am also pleased that $15 million is included for carbon \nsequestration research. The preliminary research indicates that \nagriculture can and will play an important and positive role in the \ndebate regarding global climate change, and this funding is an \nimportant downpayment on this research. Senator Kerrey and I worked \nhard to include this research money. It will enable farmers, again, to \nplay a positive role in taking carbon out of the atmosphere and to \nmitigate the global climate change problems we have.\n  I could continue to discuss the merits of this legislation, but I \nwill cease and desist. However, I do have a few closing comments.\n  First, this legislation has been a personal priority of mine for many \nyears. It was nearly 20 years ago that my predecessor in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Keith Sebelius, cast the deciding vote to \ncreate the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Since that time, I have been \ncommitted to strengthening this program and making it work for our \nproducers. We promised this in the 1996 farm bill. In addition, an \nimproved Crop Insurance Program has been an underlying promise ever \nsince that bill has been passed. It was a promise I personally made, \nand today I consider it a promise, hopefully, fulfilled.\n\n  It has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from Nebraska on \nthis issue. Senator Kerrey is retiring from the Senate when this \nsession ends, and I know passage of this bill before leaving the Senate \nhas been one of his top priorities. We could not have done the job, the \ncommittee could not have done the job, the staff could not have done \nthe job, we would not have had this bill without the support, \nleadership, advice, counsel, and hard work of Senator Kerrey. \nFurthermore, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Lugar, for his assistance in working with us to get a strong \nbill out of the conference between the House and Senate. Without his \nleadership as well, obviously, we would not have this package.\n  Finally, I thank the staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee. The \nSenate legislative counsel and the Congressional Budget Office spent \nconsiderable time on this legislation. As a matter of fact, maybe even \ntoo much time. It has been a Herculean effort, and all Members and \nstaff involved deserve to be commended. I would be remiss if I did not \nmention specifically Bev Paul, who works for Senator Kerrey; Mike \nSeifert, who works for me; and Keith Luse, the distinguished and able \nstaff director of the Senate Agriculture Committee. They basically did \nthe work and reported to us, and we reported to them to go back to work \nand they finally produced a bill. They persevered.\n  I close by stating that this is a good and fair bill. For the first \ntime, it is a truly national crop insurance bill that serves all \nregions of the country. I remind my colleagues that it is a bipartisan \nbill, supported by all 18 members of the conference committee. It \nrepresents a real investment in our farmers and ranchers and the \nagriculture sector of our economy. I am proud of our efforts on this \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support. I urge its quick passage. It \nis my understanding that it passed by unanimous consent in the other \nbody, which has a lot of difficulty deciding when to adjourn, let alone \npassing things by unanimous consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nspeak of my profound disappointment regarding the way in which the \nSenate is conducting its business. I am outraged that these payments \nhave been attached to a conference report without any consideration in \nthe full Senate.\n  Mr. President, without any public debate and with no hearings in the \nAgriculture Committee some of our colleagues have attached $7.1 billion \nto this conference report, and have unilaterally decided to continue \nthe failed farm policy of the 1996 farm bill.\n  First of all, I want to be very clear that I am pleased there was \nsome recognition in Congress that the Freedom to Farm bill, or as I \ncall it the Freedom to Fail bill, has not provided an adequate safety \nnet to our nation's family farmers. Furthermore, I am pleased that the \nBudget Committee recognized that after spending over $16 billion the \nlast 2 years on emergencies, family farmers were in need of an economic \nsafety net.\n  But I believe this emergency assistance package only relieves the \napparent symptoms of the economic crisis in agriculture. This \nassistance will help some farmers to continue their operations for the \nimmediate future, but this direct cash infusion cannot sustain farmers \nfor the long term.\n  I am deeply concerned about simply attaching this money to a \nconference report without any debate or possibility of amendments. And \nas a Senator from Minnesota, with thousands of family farmers in my \nstate who are suffering economic convulsion, I am completely opposed to \ncontinuing this disastrous farm policy passed 4 years ago.\n  Mr. President, this is very much an extension of the debate we began \nlast week--it's a debate about our right to be legislators. It is about \nbeing able to offer amendments to improve legislation--that is what the \npeople of Minnesota elected me to do. The people of Minnesota and the \nthousands of Minnesota family farmers certainly didn't elect me to be \nsilent, and accept the status quo in Washington, DC.\n  At times Senate procedure can seem a bit arcane to many people--let \nme explain what has happened with this legislation. We are now \nconsidering the crop insurance conference report--this is great. The \nlegislation passed 95-5, and I voted for the bill. The crop insurance \nbill passed by the Senate will, in fact, make crop insurance much more \naffordable for thousands of family farmers who have experienced years \nof crop losses--like the Red River Valley in Minnesota. I will do \neverything in my power to pass this important piece of legislation--I \nhave no objection there.\n  However, what has been done behind closed doors in a conference \ncommittee, with absolutely no public scrutiny, is completely different. \nWhat the conferees have done is to attach $7.1 billion in emergency \nfarmer relief payments to the crop insurance bill. They have not asked \nthe full Senate. They have not consulted with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  And conference reports are privileged which means that Senators \ncannot offer any amendment. Nor can Senators engage in extended debate. \nIn essence, we as Senators have been left with no options to alter the \nconference report in any way.\n  Mr. President, as a Senator from Minnesota this is one of the most \negregious maneuvers I have witnessed in the Senate. And the one thing \nthat greatly concerns me about this road we seem to be heading down is \nthat back home in Minnesota I meet with people, and they really believe \nthat I will make a difference in their lives--that I can in fact help \nthem.\n  However if, as a Senator, I cannot at least offer amendments, to what \nis probably the most important agriculture bill, I am shut out. In fact \nall Senators are shut out. I don't claim to agree with everyone, and I \nwelcome having debates about what is the best way to spend $7 billion, \nbut the Senate must have those debates.\n\n  And for Minnesota farmers time is not neutral. That was evident when \nnearly 4,000 family farmers from Minnesota, and all across the country, \ncame to Washington, DC, to demand a change in the failed Freedom to \nFarm Act. People really believe when we meet with them that we can do \nsomething right now about the abysmally low prices, whether it is the \nlivestock producers, or whether it is the corn growers, or dairy \nproducers. With what is going on in farm country with crops, people are \nin such pain. They still come out to meetings because they still \nbelieve in us as their Senators, and by meeting with us and talking \nabout what is happening to them, somehow since we are their Senators we \ncan do something to help.\n  But I am left with very few options. The majority has insisted on \nattaching a vital piece of legislation to a conference report without \nany public debate, or amendments. And that is to say nothing about the \nsubstance of the legislation they are attempting to ram through the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\n  However, I am glad that Minnesota will benefit from the emergency \npackage. And, although I have significant reservations that AMTA is not \nthe best mechanism to provide income assistance to producers, it will \nat least keep farmers going for another year. I preferred and pushed \nfor a mechanism that targets and ties assistance to actual production.\n  Mr. President for the first time since 1996 the majority has \nrecognized that the Freedom to Fail does not provide an adequate safety \nnet for our family farmers. Through including $7.1 billion in the FY \n2001 budget resolution for farm relief the Budget Committee has \nconceded that the Freedom to Farm Act has failed to provide an economic \nsafety net for our nation's family farmers.\n  We were presented with a tremendous opportunity to reverse the \ndisastrous farm policy enacted in 1996, by targeting this money to our \nnation's small and medium sized producers who are truly in an economic \ncrisis. But rather than examining serious policy alternatives that \ncould reverse the current economic crisis in rural America, we have \nbeen presented with legislation that continues the Freedom to Fail \nbill.\n  First of all, and I think this simply prudent public policy--and I \nsay this is with greatest respect for the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee--I do believe the Agriculture Committee had a responsibility \nto our nation's family farmers to hold hearings on mechanisms to target \nthe financial assistance to those small and medium farmers most in \nneed. I firmly believe it is a grave mistake not to base these payments \nboth on prices and production.\n  Basically what the majority has done is to double these disastrous \nAMTA payments. And they have refused to deal with any of the problems \nof distribution equity.\n  As we have seen over the last 2 years, emergency assistance packages \nonly relieve the apparent symptoms of the economic crisis in \nagriculture. Assistance will help some farmers to continue their \noperations for the immediate future, but direct cash infusion cannot \nsustain farmers for the long term.\n  There are a couple of problems with these AMTA payments. First of \nall, these payments are based on the old farm program's historic \nyields. Farmers such as traditional soybean farmers, who never had a \nprogram base in the old program, don't get any of these AMTA payments. \nThat is one huge problem.\n  In addition, it is possible for some people who might not even have \nplanted a crop to receive them because the Freedom to Farm--or what I \ncall the ``Freedom to Fail''--payments are completely unconnected to \nproduction or price. Furthermore, I predict, largely this money will be \nused to pay back banks and lenders from whom farmers needed to borrow \nmoney earlier this year just to get in their crops.\n\n  Let's be clear--it is now evident that the majority of AMTA payments \nhave not been distributed to family farmers, rather they have gone to \nthe largest farmers and corporate agribusiness. Recently a \ncomprehensive study was conducted on the federal farm payments from \n1996 through 1998 which shows that the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill (and \nsubsequent legislation) has provided minimal financial assistance for \nthe large majority of family farmers.\n  The study found that the largest farming operations were generously \ncompensated by Freedom to Farm, and many of the top payment recipients \nwere paid hundreds of thousands of dollars over the 3-year period \nstudied. Large operators received these enormous payments, even as \noperators of smaller farms (with average annual sales of $50,000 or \nless) actually lost money.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, these smaller farms \nrealized an average net loss of $3,400 in income from their farming \noperations in 1996 alone.\n  From 1996 through 1998 nearly 61 percent of all federal Freedom to \nFarm money approximately $13.8 billion in total went to the 144,000 \nindividuals, corporations and farm partnerships among the top 10 \npercent of recipients.\n  A recipient among the top 10 percent was paid an average of $95,875 \nover the 3 years (`96-`98). These payments were on top of any profits \nearned from the sale of agricultural commodities, and do not include \npayments made under conservation, disaster or crop insurance programs.\n  In contrast to the largest farmers, the vast majority of AMTA \nrecipients have seen very little benefit from Freedom to Farm. Half of \nall farmers received less than $3,600 in total from 1996 through 1998, \nor an average of about $1,200 per year.\n  Large corporate agribusiness already enjoy significant competitive \nadvantages over smaller farming operations in availability of capital. \nAccording to USDA's Economic Research Service, farm operator households \nfor farms with sales of $500,000 or more averaged $153,847 in farm \nincome in 1996, while operators of farms with between $250,000 and \n$500,000 in sales averaged $53,265 in household farm income in the same \nyear. And operators of farms with less than $50,000 in sales realized a \nnet loss of income from their farm operations.\n  The central question we need to ask ourselves is that if the largest \nU.S. agribusiness are inherently more efficient, as corporate America \nassures us they are, why do these efficient farms need Federal \nGovernment assistance, and why do they collect the majority of the \nassistance that is provided?\n  Hundreds of thousands of small- and medium-sized operations receive \nmeaningless amounts of AMTA assistance under Freedom to Farm programs. \nI believe, it is a great mistake not to target this money to producers \nbased on actual production.\n  That is the key issue. That is the key difference. In dealing with \nthis price crisis, we ought to make sure that the payments are \nconnected to production and price. So what the Republicans have is the \nwrong mechanism for addressing the price crisis. We must target the \nassistance to family farmers and tie direct assistance to production. \nThousands of family farmers across the country could go out of business \ndue to conditions that are beyond their control. In Minnesota, up to 30 \npercent of our family farmers are threatened--that's thousands of farm \nfamilies.\n  Whatever you do by way of dealing with low prices, you have to make \nsure that payments are connected to production and price. Too many of \nthe transition payments go to landowners, and not necessarily \nproducers. I don't think that makes a lot of sense. Some, like soybean \ngrowers, won't be helped at all. We can do better, we must do better.\n  We could at minimum target the assistance to those farmers who are in \nthe  most need. We have an opportunity to make at the very least \nincremental changes to current farm policy. The policy objective of the \nad-hoc aid is clouded by the apparent inability of Congress to pass aid \npackages targeting assistance to farmers most at risk.\n\n  Some of the largest and most profitable farms in the country will \nbenefit from this assistance if it is distributed in double AMTA \npayments and meanwhile there are no funds devoted to other needs in \nrural America.\n  Mr. President I also want to talk about the whole problem of \nconcentration of power. This is an unbelievable situation. What we have \nis a situation where our producers, such as our livestock and grain \nproducers, when negotiating to sell, only have three or four \nprocessors. They have the ADM's, the Smithfield's, the ConAgra's, the \nIPB's, the Hormel's and the Cargill's. The point is, you have two, \nthree, or four firms that control over 40 percent, over 50 percent, \nsometimes 70-80 percent of the market.\n  Let me just run through some statistics that illustrate this point. \nIn the past decade and a half, the top four pork packers have increased \ntheir market share from 36 percent to 57 percent.\n  The top four beef packers have expanded their market share from 32 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  The top four flour millers have increased their market share from 40 \npercent to 62 percent, while the market share of the top four soybean \ncrushers has jumped from 54 percent to 80 percent.\n  The top four sheep, poultry, wet corn, and dry corn processors now \ncontrol 73 percent, 55 percent, 74 percent, and 57 percent of the \nmarket, respectively. By conventional measures, none of these markets \nis really competitive.\n  Thousands of our livestock and grain producers are facing extinction, \nand\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nthe packers are in hog heaven. The mergers continue, and we have all of \nthese acquisitions. We need to put free enterprise back into the food \nindustry.\n  I have had a chance to review the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and \nthe work of Estes Kefauver and others. We had two major public hearings \nin Minnesota and in Iowa last year with Joel Klein, who leads the \nAntitrust Division of the Justice Department, and Mike Dunn, head of \nthe Packers and Stockyards Administration within the Department of \nAgriculture. And earlier this year we had thousands of family farmers \nin Washington to rally at the Capitol. In all the meetings I have been \nat over the last two years, producers are asking the same question: \nWhy, with these laws on the books, isn't there some protection for us? \nWe have all sorts of examples of monopoly. We want to know where is the \nprotection for producers.\n  It is critical to pass some stronger antitrust legislation. I know \nSenator Leahy and Senator Daschle have done a great job with their \nlegislation. I am pleased to join with them in cosponsoring the Fair \nCompetition Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, there is a frightening difference when the major \nagribusiness firms can raise billions on Wall Street while making \nrecord profits at the same time farmers and ranchers are faced with \ntake-it-or-leave-it low prices. Even, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, who I don't always agree with, testified on February 1, \n2000, that ``consolidation, and the subsequent concentration within the \nU.S. agricultural sector is having adverse economic impacts on U.S. \nfamily farmers.'' The administration recently testified that:\n\n       High concentration, forward sales agreements, production \n     contracts, and vertical integration have raised major \n     concerns about competition and trade practices in livestock \n     and procurement by meat packers and poultry processors. . . . \n     The four leading packers' share of steer and heifer slaughter \n     increased from 36 percent in 1980 to 81 percent in 1998.\n\n  This concentration of power in the hands of a few increases the \nlikelihood that farmers or ranchers will be the victim of unfair or \ndeceptive practices. The Fair Competition Act will give USDA the \nauthority to help address those practices. Firms and corporations, no \nmatter how large, which engage in unfair, deceptive, or unjustly \ndiscriminatory practices, or which give undue preferences, or make \nfalse statements regarding transactions, will be stopped by this bill.\n  The bill also focuses on mergers of agribusinesses and on \nagribusiness acquisitions. Over the last quarter century there have \nbeen a major increase in the horizontal, vertical and sectoral \nconcentration of agribusinesses and in industries serving agriculture. \nAt some breaking point, the concentration of agribusinesses in any \nregion will mean that farmers or ranchers are adversely affected by an \nimbalance of negotiating power and a lack of viable market \nalternatives. The bill gives the Secretary the authority to identify \ncircumstances where a proposed merger will result in unfair or \ndeceptive practices that adversely affect farmers or ranchers and to \ntake a strong action against such a merger.\n  In addition, under the bill the Secretary shall make findings about \nwhether a proposed merger or acquisition could ``be detrimental to the \npresent or future viability of family farms or ranches or rural \ncommunities in the areas affected by the merger or acquisition.''\n  If the Secretary determines that such adverse effects are likely, the \nSecretary would propose remedies, such as divestiture of asserts or \nother corrective action, designed to protect family farms and ranches, \nand the affected local communities. Failure to comply with those \nremedies could result in significant civil money penalties.\n  This authority is similar to that conferred by Congress on the \nSurface Transportation Board which takes into account the ``public \ninterest'' with respect to proposed mergers of railroads. That Board \nexamines the potential effects on the public, on employees and on \ncompetition and ``the impact of any transaction on the quality of the \nhuman environment and the conservation of energy resources.'' (49 CFR \n1180.1) To carry out its duties, ``the Board has broad authority to \nimpose conditions on consolidations * * *''\n  Similarly, the Federal Communications Commission exercises a major \nrole over the telecommunications or broadcasting industry mergers when \nit examines whether transferring licenses to the merged entity is ``in \nthe public interest.''\n  This bill thus aims at preventing the detrimental effects of such \nincreased concentration on farmers and ranchers, and rural communities, \njust as the Surface Transportation Board has imposed a moratorium on \nrailroad mergers to ensure that railroad mergers are in the ``public \ninterest.''\n  We need to pass this legislation now, and I think there is going to \nbe a considerable amount of support for this. The reason I think there \nis going to be a lot of support is that I think many of my colleagues \nhave been back in their States, and for those of us who come from rural \nStates, from agricultural States, you can't meet with people and not \nknow we have to take some kind of action.\n  This ought to be a bipartisan issue. I think this is one issue on \nwhich all the farm organizations agree. We must have some antitrust \naction. We must have some bargaining power for the producers. We must \nput free enterprise back into the food industry.\n  But this conference report moves us further away from making any real \nchange in farm policy. I would like to remind my colleagues that $7.1 \nbillion for assistance for producers was allocated, but a significant \nportion of the funds in this bill have been dedicated to programs and \nprojects, as worthy as they may be, that;\n  1. Do not provide assistance to family farmers or ranchers in the \nnear term.\n  2. Are more appropriate issues for the appropriations committee to \nhandle.\n  3. Distribute money to universities and agribusiness.\n  I would simply like to identify for my colleagues where some of this \n$7.1 billion, allocated for assistance for producers, will actually be \ngoing.\n  $20 million for the Market Access Program--a program that assists \nbusiness trade associations and cooperatives for marketing development. \nHow does that help the average family farmer deal with paying for \nhealth care for his family?\n  $3 million will be directed to Georgetown University and North \nCarolina State University for research regarding the extraction and \npurification of proteins from genetically altered tobacco. I ask my \ncolleagues, could not have $3 million be better spent on direct income \nassistance to the thousands of small family farms who are in danger of \nlosing their farms this year?\n  $30 million for training and technical assistance relating to the \nmanagement of water and waste disposal in Alaska. As a Senator from \nMinnesota, I am quite sure that small dairy producers, or soybean \nproducers in my state who are facing the biggest agricultural \ndepression in more than a generation, would appreciate the assistance \n$30 million could provide--it would allow many families to at least \nstay in farming this year.\n  Mr. President, the plain fact is that this short term assistance is \nsimply a band-aid. I understand the majority does not want to have any \npublic discussion on the farm bill they enacted. That is clearly \nevident by the way in which they have moved this legislation to the \nSenate floor, with no debate or examination.\n  The point is that farmers in this country want to know, they deserve \nto know, whether they have a future beyond 1 year. They can't cash flow \non these prices, whether it be for wheat, for corn, for cotton, for \nrice, or whether it be for livestock producers. They simply cannot cash \nflow--they cannot make it. They can work for 20 hours per day and be \nthe best managers in the world, and they still wouldn't make it.\n  But rather than open and make changes to the farm bill and avoid \nthese lump assistance infusions, the majority defends the status quo in \nfarm policy. Yet, how much longer can we mask reality of failing \nagricultural policy? Short-term fixes are more expensive than carefully \nplanned long-term programs. For the past 3 consecutive years, Congress \nhas passed supplemental appropriations bill. Direct farm payments for \n1999 were approximately $16 billion, making last year the highest \nrecord for direct farm payments in U.S. history.\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\n  We need to stop using ad-hoc assistance as a substitute for farm \npolicy. We need to reopen and rewrite a farm bill with a strong \nsustainable policy. Namely, we need a farm policy that empowers farmers \nnot only to merely survive, but to prosper.\n  And that was what the Rally for Rural America was all about. We had, \nfrom all over the country, around 4,000 people--most of them family \nfarmers. From the State of Minnesota, we had close to 500 people here, \nmost of them family farmers. I point out to my colleagues, this was an \nunusual gathering. They came to our Nation's Capital to try to have a \nconversation with America, to make sure people in the country know \nabout the economic convulsion that is happening in rural America.\n  And Congress appropriately responded with a commitment to reform \nrural policies to: alleviate the agricultural price crisis; ensure \ncompetitive markets; invest in rural education and health care; protect \nour Nation's resources for future generations; and ensure a safe and \nsecure food supply.\n  I ask my colleagues, what became of that commitment to the thousands \nof family farmers who came to Washington, DC--I ask where is the \nfollowup? Is the followup passing $7 billion in AMTA payments that has \nnever even been discussed in the Agriculture Committee? Is it in \nproviding huge payments to corporate farms and agribusinesses, while \nleaving little for the ordinary family farmer? Or is it in ignoring the \nroot problems in the 1996 Freedom to Fail Act. I don't think so.\n\n  For 2000, net farm income is forecast to decline for the 4th straight \nyear, by 17 percent. Low prices scale across the board for almost all \nmajor crops. USDA projects that 2000 crop corn prices will be the \nlowest since the mid 1980's. That's 26 percent below the average of \n1993-1997. Soybeans are projected to be at their lowest levels since \n1986. Yet, I do not need to list all the statistics. I have been on the \nSenate floor, and Senators know, economists and specialists know and \nmost importantly those who farm the land do not need to hear statistics \nto know times are tough.\n  Whatever our explanation for the very low commodity prices on the \nglobal market, federal farm policy needs to be there to offer some \nsafety net to help people stay in business when this happens. We need a \nfarm bill that establishes an equitable safety net. We need a farm bill \nthat provides a level of financial security during periods of market \ndisruption and commodity price instability. A safety net should include \na counter cyclical price and income assistance directed to producers. \nOne simple idea of providing a safety net is lifting caps on the loan \nrates.\n  In addition, long-term policy must be developed to enhance \ncompetitiveness and transparency throughout agriculture domestically \nand globally. We know these figures well. I and others have recited \nthese numbers time and time again on the Senate floor. We know \nconcentration in the agriculture economy has been accelerating at a \nrapid pace.\n  In the past decade and a half, the top four pork packers have \nincreased their market share from 36 to 57 percent, the top four beef \npackers have expanded their market share from 32 to 80 percent, and the \ntop four flour millers have increased their market share from 40 to 62 \npercent.\n  We must halt this trend of consolidation. Congress must pass the Fair \nCompetition Act to restore competitive markets in agriculture and give \nfarmers more equal bargaining power against corporate business.\n  It is greatly disturbing that a handful of firms dominate the \nprocessing of every major commodity. Many of them are vertically \nintegrated. This growing trend in concentration, low prices and \nanticompetitive practices are driving family-based farmers out of \nbusiness. Farmers are going bankrupt or giving up, and few are taking \ntheir places. More and more farm families are having to rely on other \njobs to stay afloat. In fact, reports indicate that off-farm income now \nconstitutes as much as 90 percent of all household income received by \nthe average farm operator.\n  There is a gross disparity of economic power that has shifted a \ngrowing share of farm income to agribusiness. We need to reverse that \ntrend and focus on equalizing the bargaining power between farmers and \nthe global agribusinesses.\n  According to economic literature, markets are no longer competitive \nif the top four firms control over 40 percent of the market. Yet, Excel \nand IBP control 60 percent of the beef packing industry and Kellogs and \nGeneral Mills have 63 percent of the market share for cereal.\n  Policy makers wrote the 1996 farm bill and we can rewrite it. The \ncorporate culture's powerful influence has penetrated to humankind's \ngreatest common denominator, food. We cannot allow our lives to become \nbeholden to corporate America. We must provide an agricultural policy \nthat preserves the family farm and protects the food industry from an \noligopoly of corporate agribusinesses. We must fight for these critical \npolicy changes.\n  We have some differences here in the Senate. They are honestly held \ndifferences. All of us care about agriculture. All of us know what the \neconomic and personal pain is out there in the countryside. But with no \nopportunity to consider and debate a fair and equitable distribution \nplan, and a bill that short changes the American family farmer by \ndiverting money away from equitable income assistance, the majority in \nCongress has failed America's family farmers.\n  Mr. President, I say to Senator Roberts and Senator Kerrey: Good \nwork. Thank you for your commitment and the work on the crop insurance \nconference report. This report is extremely important. To farmers, this \nis going to make a big difference. I also thank Senator Lugar. Senator \nConrad spoke of his graciousness, and I think he is always that way. \nBecause of the crop insurance reform, I will vote for this conference \nreport.\n  My dissent has to do with, again, the way we are conducting our \nbusiness. The crop insurance reform is very important. But this is a \ncrop insurance conference report. When the Budget Committee said, look, \nwe are going to have $7 billion to deal with the farm crisis, what the \nBudget Committee was saying and what the Senate was saying is, rather \nthan just doing emergency appropriations, let's have some deliberation \nand some policy evaluation and figure out how to get that money to \npeople in the most equitable manner.\n  My dissent, I say to my colleagues out of respect, is that I believe \nwe should have had debate about this. I believe that the Senate \nAgriculture Authorization Committee should have had hearings. I don't \nthink it is appropriate that the $7 billion in AMTA payments--\nessentially doubling the AMTA payments--was put into this conference \nreport. I don't think it was appropriate. I heard my colleague--two \nSenators spoke. Senator Conrad said there are legitimate concerns, but \nI think this is the quickest way to get assistance out to people. \nSenator Roberts said the same thing, roughly speaking.\n  The point is that we did have some time when we could have had some \nhearings and when we could have had some debate on this. I do not \nbelieve we should have just automatically taken the $7 billion and said \nit is going to be AMTA payments, that's it. We put it into a conference \nreport, which doesn't enable any of us to come out here and have much \ndebate about it, and it certainly doesn't enable us to testify, doesn't \nenable us to have amendments and to act the way I think we should act \nin the Senate on such important matters.\n  Mr. President, we had this farm rally here maybe 2 months ago. \nSeveral thousand farmers came. It was pouring rain and it was cold. \nThey came a long way. Many came by bus because, for them, they are \ntrying to survive. I have no illusions. We are not going to write a new \nfarm bill. The Freedom to Farm bill is really the ``freedom to fail'' \nbill. I have said that many times over. But it does seem to me that if \nwe are not going to write a new farm bill--at least not until after the \nelection--we ought to do the very best we can in getting the payments \nto people in such a way that people who need the assistance the most \nare the ones who get the lion's share of the benefits. Right now, with \nthese AMTA payments, we have a subsidy in inverse relationship to need.\n\n  What we have here--with no opportunity for real debate, with no \nopportunity for amendments--is $7 billion put into a conference report \non crop insurance in the form of more AMTA payments providing subsidy \nto farmers\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nin inverse relationship to need, with the vast majority of the benefits \ngoing to the very largest agricultural operations. This is a disastrous \ndistribution formula. I think it violates the very principle of equity \nand fairness.\n  Problem:\n  First of all, the AMTA payments are based upon the old farm programs' \nhistoric yields.\n  We don't have an opportunity to have an amendment on this? We don't \nhave an opportunity to say that this is unfair to farmers, such as \nsoybean farmers who never had a program base in the program and don't \nreceive any AMTA payments? There is no benefit for them? We don't have \nan opportunity to discuss this, to have an amendment to try to improve \nthis?\n   Second, since this was connected to the ``freedom to fail'' bill--\nwhat I call the ``freedom to fail'' bill--the payments aren't connected \nto production. Many of these payments go to these large landowners who \naren't necessarily even producers. I want the assistance to go to the \nproducers. I want it to have some relationship to price and to farm \nincome.\n  Let me simply quote some of the findings from the Environmental \nWorking Group.\n  The largest farm operations in the country are generously compensated \nwith these payments. They are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars \nover a 3-year period of AMTA payments going to large farm operations, \nand the midsized farm operations and the smaller farm operations are \nnot getting the benefits they need to survive.\n  Environmental Working Group:\n  From 1996 to 1998, 61 percent of all Freedom to Farm money AMTA \npayments--approximately $13.8 billion--went to 144,000 individuals, \ncorporations, and farm partnerships among the top 10 percent. The top \n10 percent, the large farm operations, and the least in need of \nassistance, get over 60 percent of the AMTA payments. It doesn't make \nany sense. Recipients in the top 10 percent, those large farm \noperations, are doing well. They get an average of $95,000 over this \nperiod of time. Half the farmers in the country get less than $3,600, \nand many of the farmers in my State get less than that.\n  While you have these large farm operations, that do not even need the \nassistance, getting well over the majority of all the money--the top 10 \npercent--the struggling, midsized family farmers in the State of \nMinnesota are lucky if they get $3,000 a year. These are the farms that \nare going to go under. The USDA says we are going to see a 17-percent \ndrop in farm income this year.\n  Why in the world, when you have these transition payments--AMTA \npayments--going to the largest landowners who aren't even necessarily \nproducers, based upon a program base going back years, providing the \nmajority of the benefits to the large operators, not helping those \nfarmers who are most in need and who may not survive--why do we have $7 \nbillion put into this conference report which doesn't have anything to \ndo with crop insurance reform, which means we don't really get to \ndebate it?\n\n  That is why we are doing it. I don't think that is Senator Lugar's \nstyle. He is probably one of the fairest Senators, I believe, in the \nSenate. But I have to keep saying this. It pains me to say this on the \nfloor because I think so much of him as an individual. But this \nshouldn't be in this conference report. We should have had hearings. We \nshould have had an opportunity to come out here with amendments.\n  I would love to have had an amendment saying it is going to go to \nproducers, and not just landowners. I would love to have had an \namendment that said we need to target more to the midsized producers. I \nwould love to have had an amendment that said it shouldn't be based \nupon the old program base--no opportunity. I would like to have had an \namendment that called for equity payments that said raise the loan \nrate--we could have done it for fiscal year 2001--to the same level it \nis for soybeans, in which case corn would be $2.11 and wheat would be \n$3.10. That would make a huge difference. We could have done that.\n  We could have had, and we should have had, an opportunity to have not \nonly a 1-hour speech or 2-hour speech in reaction to a conference \nreport, but we should have had hearings. We should have had \ndeliberation. We should have been able to do some serious policy \nevaluation. And we should have had the opportunity to come out here on \nthe floor and/or in committee with amendments that would have made sure \nthat until we write a new farm bill and get rid of this miserable \nfailure--this ``freedom to fail'' bill--we would have been allocating \nthe $7 billion of assistance with most of it going to those farmers \nmost in need--not to the top 10 percent, the largest farm operations, \nthose that are doing the very best right now in farm income, getting \nover 60 percent of the benefits.\n  The crop insurance reform package that Senators Roberts and Kerry \nworked on is superb. I am all for it. I am going to vote for this \nbecause of that. But I think it is just reprehensible that we continue \nnow along this line of taking really important policy questions and \nburying them in conference reports. I don't know what the $7 billion of \nassistance is doing in this report.\n  I just want to conclude--because I promised my colleagues I would be \nbrief, and then I will reserve the remainder of my time--by making one \nother point, which is, I hope we have the opportunity on the floor of \nthe Senate to have debate about farm policy. I hope we can have a \ndebate and a vote on the Fair Competition Act.\n  It is breathtaking, the extent to which these large conglomerates \nhave muscled their way to the dinner table, exercising their raw \neconomic and political power over producers, over consumers, and, I \nwould argue, over taxpayers. What we need is some competition in the \nfood industry. What we need is to put some free enterprise back into \nthe free enterprise system. What we need is some antitrust action.\n  I am going to try to do everything I can as a Senator--and I know \nother Senators will be supportive--to get this Fair Competition Act \npassed, which gives USDA, if they are willing to use it, some real \nauthority, which really gets tough in terms of dealing with some of \nthis horizontal integration that is taking place, which goes after \nanticompetitive practices, which really creates a level playing field \nfor our producers, and which doesn't exist right now.\n\n  It is just absolutely unbelievable to me that while the family \nfarmers in my State struggle to survive, a lot of these huge packers \nare making record profits. While family farmers in my State are \nstruggling to survive, a lot of these big exporters and huge grain \ncompanies are doing just fine. While the family farmers in my State \nstruggle to survive, the farm/retail spread grows wider and wider--the \ndifference between what farmers get by way of price and what consumers \npay at the grocery store, the supermarket.\n  I have two objections to what is going on on the floor of the Senate \nright now.\n  Objection No. 1: This is a great crop insurance conference report, \nbut this $7 billion of payments should not have been put into this \nreport. We should be allocating this assistance and getting it to the \nfarmers most in need. We should have had the opportunity for debate and \nthe opportunity for amendment.\n  I think it is a terrible way for us to continue to conduct our \nbusiness. I hope we don't continue this pattern of more and more \nimportant public policy questions that crucially define the quality, or \nlack of quality, of the lives of the people we represent--in this \nparticular case, family farmers, being put into an unrelated conference \nreport. That is wrong.\n  The second point I make is: It is time for us to really get serious \nabout the policy change in this area, and in particular I focus on \ndealing directly with the price crisis, and also the call for strong \nantitrust action.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I concur with what the Senator from \nMinnesota said. I defy anyone to explain in any rational context \nwhatsoever, any kind of rational terms, why we make payments to farmers \nbased on what they did 20 years ago. There is absolutely no rational \nbasis for that. I will talk about that in my comments a little bit \nlater.\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\n  I understand there is a unanimous consent request we are operating \nunder, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time allocated for three Senators: \nSenator Lugar, Senator Harkin, and Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are not under any kind of a speaking order unanimous \nconsent, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last order was for the Senator from Iowa \nto be recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor and let my \ncolleagues make their statements. I vitiate that unanimous consent and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 48 minutes and the \nSenator from Minnesota has 41 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 10 minutes \nfollowing the presentation of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of this crop insurance \nconference report.\n  As my colleagues from the Agriculture Committee are well aware, this \nlegislation has been a work in progress for a good long time.\n  The final package we reached with the House and that we bring to the \nfloor today is a very good bill. Farmers in my home state of Nebraska \nare going to be very pleased with it, as are farmers of all types of \ncrops all across the Nation.\n  The major provisions of this bill reflect just what we heard when \nSenator Roberts and I asked farm and lending groups what they wanted in \nthis legislation, nearly one and a half years ago.\n  At that time, they asked for more affordable coverage, equity for \nrevenue insurance, more new and innovative policies from the private \nsector and a better program for specialty crops.\n  This bill includes all of those provisions.\n  Although we've provided additional subsidies to buy crop insurance \nfor the past two years, this bill makes them permanent law.\n  And we go one step further by increasing subsidies even higher at the \nvery highest levels of coverage--a provision that would have been \nespecially helpful to farmers this year, as a broad stretch of the \nMidwest and South face severe drought.\n  The final bill moves the Risk Management Agency in what I strongly \nfeel is the right direction, toward being a regulator instead of \ncompetitor. We place new product development fully in the hands of the \nprivate sector, whether it be insurance companies, trade associations, \nor universities.\n  It includes authority that will finally help provide independent \nadvice to the FCIC Board of Directors and create an equal review \nprocess for all new policy submissions.\n  The bill includes and builds upon ideas forwarded by our colleagues \nfrom Florida, Senators Graham and Mack, regarding new policy \ndevelopment for specialty crops.\n  It includes an important provision first advocated by our Ag \nCommittee colleagues, Senators Baucus and Craig, to remove the area \nyield trigger requirement from the Non-Insured Assistance Program.\n  There are dozens of other equally important provisions in this bill \nthat benefit each and every region of the country. While I am aware \nthat the row-crop producing parts of the country will gain the most \nimmediate benefits because of their long-standing participation in the \ncrop insurance program, the potential for the program to work just as \nwell along the coasts and in the south is given great weight under this \nlegislation.\n  Not every provision benefits every region; a few are specific only to \none region or commodity. That is how we finally ended up with a bill \nwith national appeal, and I am very proud of that effort.\n  Let me say just a few words about the additional 2000 and 2001 \nspending added to the crop insurance bill.\n  I am pleased that the Budget Committee included additional ag \nspending in the budget resolution this year, much as they did crop \ninsurance funding last year, and of course Senators Conrad and Grassley \nare responsible for that and I thank them.\n  My concerns--and the concerns of many Nebraskans--are well-known: \ndistributing additional payments through the Freedom to Farm mechanism \nis unfair to many and the cause of a number of the problems rural \ncommunities are facing.\n  These payments, based on planting decisions made in the 1970s and \n1980s, disadvantage younger farmers and those who have traditionally \nrotated crops or tried to diversify--exactly contrary to what Freedom \nto Farm was supposed to accomplish.\n  Some payments go to producers and landowners who are no longer \nproducing the crop upon which their additional payment is based. Even \nworse, under this approach payments go to people who no longer farm at \nall.\n  The complaint I hear most frequently is about the crops included in \nthese payments versus those that are not. Freedom to Farm is destroying \nthe alfalfa processing industry in Nebraska. As prices for other \ncommodities have collapsed, more and more farmers are growing alfalfa--\na non-program crop. Yet they continue to benefit from these payments, \neven while long-time alfalfa producers receive nothing.\n  Adding additional payments for oilseeds--even while most oilseed \nproducers already receive Freedom to Farm payments and enjoy an \nartificially high support price--makes even less sense.\n  Despite the great expectations surrounding this farm program, I \ncontend that it creates greater market distortions than those supposed \n``failed'' farm programs of the past.\n  And meantime, we spend billions of dollars each year to keep it in \nplace, while our rural communities are dying.\n  Also attached to this bill is additional spending for 2001.\n  This package represents a good-faith effort by Chairman Lugar and \nChairman Combest to put together a package acceptable to the majority, \nand I do not envy their work.\n  Although there are provisions in the package I do not support, there \nare many that I do.\n  I commend them for structuring a package with national appeal and for \ngiving consideration to a broad group of commodities and interests.\n  Finally, let me offer my sincere thanks to a number of people for \ntheir work on this bill. Chairman Lugar and his staff have worked very \nhard on this legislation and made a tremendous effort to advance the \noften-diverse opinions of members of the Ag Committee.\n  Thanks also to our ranking member, Senator Harkin, and to his staff, \nas well as to our minority leader, Senator Daschle, and his staff. They \nmade this legislation possible.\n  The coalition that joined Senator Roberts and me on this legislation \nway back in March of 1999 and worked together throughout deserves \nspecial recognition: Senators Harkin, Conrad, Daschle, Baucus, Johnson, \nSantorum, Roberts, Grassley, and Craig. Special mention must go to \nstaff for each of these members, for working together tirelessly and in \na completely bipartisan fashion.\n  Let me also thank the Senate Legislative Counsel, especially Gary \nEndicott, for his work throughout this process, including too many \nnights and weekends.\n  And finally, my deepest thanks to Senator Roberts and to Mike Seyfert \nof his staff for their perseverance and good humor for the last \neighteen months. Their commitment to making this legislation \nbipartisan--right up to the closing hours--is a tribute to Kansas and \nthe Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about \nthe conference report that is before us today. As I do, I want to \ncompliment some folks for a lot of hard work: My colleague, Senator \nConrad, especially, who has played such an integral role in\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nthis; Senator Harkin, Senator Lugar, Senator Grassley, Senator Roberts, \nto just mention a few--for a whole series of folks in different areas \nhave played significant roles in trying to bring this to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Frankly, while there are some things I would have done differently in \nconstructing this legislation--particularly the emergency aid--I am \ngoing to vote for it. I think this is a good day for family farmers in \nmy State and the country.\n  We have a fellow in North Dakota named Arlo Schmidt. Arlo is an \nauctioneer. He told me one day about an auction sale he had conducted \nawhile back. What happened during that sale describes so well the \npassion and the hurt that exists in farm country when grain prices \ncollapse and family farmers lose their hopes and their dreams. This \nauction sale had occurred on a family farm, owned by a family who was \nnot able to make it. They had gone broke because prices collapsed. It \nwas not their fault. A whole series of things conspired to say to this \nfamily they could not farm anymore. They were losing their hopes, their \ndreams, and their future that day.\n  At the end of the auction sale, a young boy who lived on that farm--\nhe was 10 or 11 years old or so--came up to the auctioneer. The young \nboy was very angry with him, so angry, that he said to the auctioneer: \nYou sold my dad's tractor.\n  Arlo said he put his hand on the boy's shoulder to try to console him \na little bit, but the boy looked up at him through some tears and \nangrily said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I got big.\n  The young boy wasn't accepting any of that comfort from the \nauctioneer. He wanted to drive that tractor when he got big.\n  That boy felt like a lot of families feel, living on a family farm. \nThe farm was much more than a business. It was a way of life.\n  Family farmers cannot make a living when grain prices collapse. The \nunderpinning basis of Freedom to Farm was, let's not care about price \nsupports or safety nets; let's operate in the open market, the free \nmarket. Well, there wasn't an open market when Congress passed it; and \nthere's not one now.\n  It seems to me, after about 3 years of applying tourniquets, somebody \nought to ask the question: Isn't there some serious bleeding going on \nhere? We have brought to the floor--including this bill--emergency help \nthree times in 3 years. All of this emergency help is to try to take \nthe place of the safety net that does not exist in Freedom to Farm.\n  It seems to me it would be wise for us now--after we pass this bill--\nto learn from our mistakes. If we have to do this every single year, \nlet's do it in a thoughtful way and the right way. Let's repeal Freedom \nto Farm and replace it with a safety net that works for family farmers, \na safety net that says to that family who has those hopes and dreams: \nif you work hard and you do a good job we will give you an opportunity \nto make it, even during tough times.\n  This legislation has a lot of things in it. No. 1, it improves the \nCrop Insurance Program. I salute that effort by my colleagues. Many of \nus have had input, although I did not play the major role on this. The \nfact is, this improvement is a collaboration of Republicans and \nDemocrats that is significant. This legislation increases premium \nsubsidies to help family farmers buy up better levels of coverage; a \nbetter depth of coverage at less cost for family farmers.\n  In North Dakota, it solves some peculiar problems. We have had \nproblems year after year in which farmers have lost a substantial \namount of their crop to wet cycles and, therefore, their production is \ndecreased. Because of this, every single year their insurance coverage \nunder crop insurance is decreased. They have been caught in a Catch-22 \nfrom which they could not escape, and it did not make any sense. This \nbill addresses those issues. This is an important and significant piece \nof reform to the crop insurance bill.\n\n  Let me also say this proposal before us today includes emergency \neconomic assistance for family farmers. This assistance is what I \ntalked about earlier. My colleague, Senator Wellstone, was absolutely \ncorrect on this subject. We ought not use doubling the AMTA payment, \nyear after year after year, as a method of providing economic \nassistance to family farmers. It is not the most efficient and not the \nmost effective way to deliver this assistance.\n  I am going to vote for this bill. If I had written this legislation, \nI would have written it differently. This replicates what we have done \nthe last 2 years. This is the third year in a row we have increased \nAMTA payments. This will send money to people who have not seen a farm \nfor a couple of years; have not gassed up a tractor in the spring to \nplow a straight furrow for awhile. They are not farming now. They are \ngoing to get money under this bill, and it does not make any sense to \nme.\n  What we ought to be doing is extending emergency help to family \nfarmers living out there on the farm, and who are struggling to make a \nliving. This help should be going to family farmers who are confronted \nwith collapsed prices; all who have found that when you raise a bushel \nof grain for $4 a bushel and then have to sell it for $2.50, you are \ngoing to be in trouble. You cannot continue to make it that way. There \nought to be a safety net for those folks, the folks who are really \nfarming. Regrettably, the mechanism to distribute that emergency \neconomic aid has been the double AMTA payment. I think we could have \ndone much, much better than that.\n  My hope is that following the passage of this conference report--and \nI will vote for it even though I disagree with the mechanism of the \neconomic assistance package, and I do compliment those who helped bring \nthis to the floor--my hope is that when this is done, we will all \nunderstand that if we have to do this year after year after year, it is \ntime to learn from it. We really ought to be able to learn when \nsomething doesn't work. Let's just admit our farm policy doesn't work \nand change it.\n  I started by talking about family farming. Some will say--they are \ncareful about the circles they say it--but they say the family farm is \njust yesterday. This is all nostalgia about an economic unit that does \nnot work anymore. This view is just wrongheaded. We have the kind of \neconomy we intend to have. We can have the kind of economy we create in \nthis country. We can decide we want big corporate agrifactories from \nCalifornia to Maine producing America's food, or we can decide to have \na network of families working on farms producing America's food.\n  Europe has made that decision. Go to Europe and visit the rural \ncommunities in the countryside. You will discover small towns are doing \nwell. There is life, there is a heart, and there is pulse in small \ntowns. Why? Because Europe has decided they want a network of family \nfarmers producing their food.\n  The result of this decision is a rural economy that is thriving and \nworking. Europe has a safety net for family farmers they can rely on \nwhich gives them hope for the future. Regrettably, we have not had that \nsame continuity in this country.\n  On the other hand, we in this country have lurched back and forth \nfrom farm policy to farm policy. Finally, we fell off the cliff with \nFreedom to Farm, saying we have this new idea--not a very good idea, \nincidentally--but a new idea called Freedom to Farm. Now, after 3 years \nof tourniquets, having had to pass three successive economic assistance \npackages to make up for the deficiency, we all ought to understand that \nwe have to change the underlying farm bill.\n\n  This legislation includes a substantial amount of resources at a time \nwhen those resources will be critically important to our family \nfarmers. I have said, and I will say it again--I think repetition is \nprobably important, at least to make this point--while I think there is \na better way to move these resources to rural America, it is critical \nat this point, given the collapsed grain prices, to send these \nresources out now. This help will give farmers some hope.\n  Our family farmers are not some anachronism that does not fit in \ntoday's economy. As I said, there are some who think it is like the \nlittle diner that got left behind when the interstate came in--it is \nnostalgia to think about, but not really a significant part of our \nfuture economy.\n  People who think that way, in my judgment, are fundamentally wrong.\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\n Go to rural America and learn from where the seedbed of family values \ncomes. Understand the value of rural values in this country and the \nrolling of those values from family farms to small towns to big cities, \nand what it has done to nourish and refresh the values of our country. \nThen tell me somehow families living on America's farms don't count and \ndon't matter.\n  The fact is, they face economic challenges almost no one else faces. \nA small family unit trying to run a farm puts a seed in the ground and \nhas no idea whether that seed will grow. It might get too much rain; it \nmight not. Maybe this seed won't get enough rain. It might hail; it \nmight not. Maybe insects will come. Maybe not. Maybe crop disease will \ndestroy it. Maybe not.\n  If they survive all those uncertainties, maybe they will get it off \nin time to go to an elevator and discover they have lost $1.50 a bushel \nfor every bushel they raised. They get hit with this loss after all \ntheir months of work, starting with the tractor in the spring to plow \nthe furrows to plant the seeds all the way to the combining in the fall \nto get it in off the field and into the grain elevator.\n  The lack of connection here is striking. So many hundreds of millions \nof people are hungry and our grain markets tell us the food produced by \nfamily farmers has no value. It is a striking paradox.\n\n  In conclusion, I thank my friends, Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar, \nfor whom I have great regard, for what they have done in this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to come back, after we pass this \nlegislation--and I shall gladly vote for it--to reform the fundamental \nfarm program itself. If we do that, we will not then have to be \ncontinually passing emergency economic assistance packages, as we are \ndoing today with the crop insurance reform bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I commend the conferees for their efforts to finalize \nthe crop insurance report. The crop insurance proposal before us today \nis the culmination of literally years of hard work by numerous Senators \nand Congressmen. As you may remember, I have been a supporter of S. \n2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, and I am extremely \nhappy to see that the work on that legislation has finally been dove-\ntailed into the work of the House of Representatives. You will also \nnote that the report includes over $7 billion in supplemental \nappropriations to help farmers and ranchers cope with the current farm \ncrisis.\n  Some will note that this is the third year in a row Congress has \nprovided a large supplemental appropriation to help America's farmers. \nHowever, those of you that have traveled to our rural communities know \nthat every dime we can send to these areas is vitally needed. \nAgriculture is facing one of the most dire times that I can remember. \nFamilies are losing farms, ranches, and the livelihood that makes up \ntheir own family histories. A way of life is at risk, and in Montana, \nthat way of life is what makes my state what it has become. Without \nthese monetary adjustments to make up for failing markets, entire \ncommunities would dry up and blow away. In Montana, our economy is \nalready reeling, and agriculture is our number one industry.\n  Without adequate agricultural support, the investments we have made \nin economic development to diversify our economy will be threatened. \nAgricultural production is the foundation that we must build upon. \nAgriculture is what keeps products moving across the shelves, \nrestaurants open, and food on the table. Without that, it will be \nalmost impossible to keep towns vibrant enough to attract new \ninvestment and new technologies.\n  Some critics are pointing out that this is the third year in a row \nthat we have supplied rural America with supplemental appropriations. I \nagree that this pattern is costly, but I must point out that the \npromises given to rural America have not been carried out. We were \npromised strong foreign market penetration and a workable market that \nwould get our fair share of the dollar back to producers. This has not \nhappened. Look at any trade deal that has been negotiated in the last \nfew years and you will see that our agriculture industry is almost \nalways left with little protection, and actually very little support \nfrom our trade representatives. The result is an onslaught of foreign \ncompetition within our own markets, and not nearly enough of our \nproduct making it out of the country. Unfortunately, the administration \nand current world market trends have not allowed current farm policy to \nwork in the manner that was anticipated at the time of its \nimplementation. I continue to support the principles of our current \nfarm policy but am deeply disappointed that we have not found a way to \naddress the inaction of the administration in opening foreign markets. \nIt will be necessary for Congress to look for ways to allow our current \nfarm policy to continue and provide for the times of depressed markets \nsuch as we are facing currently.\n  The current farm policy has not created the trade imbalance and \nsubsequent market collapse, but it has not been flexible enough to \nprotect our consumers. The combination of failed trade policies, and an \nunresponsive farm policy has resulted in the need for direct supports \nbeing sent to our producers. This year may be even more vital than \nprevious years. We are facing  drought across the West. Livestock is \nalready being moved for lack of water and irrigation has started \nearlier than in recent memory. Markets and mother nature have combined \nforces and Congress must respond with a strong message to rural America \nthat we will be there to help, both this year and in the future.\n\n  I thank the conferees for heading some of my requests and helping out \nthose farmers hurt by the bankruptcy of AgriBiotech. The ABT language \nis vital to producers who have been negatively impacted by a bankruptcy \nthat was no fault of their own. Additionally, our wool producers have \nbeen given a shot in the arm to help make sure their industry remains \nviable. These are just a few examples, but I can assure you that this \nMontanan extends our thanks for these helping hands.\n  The underlying legislation that is carrying this supplemental package \nis equally important, and is part of the necessary message that \nCongress is willing to support agriculture in the future. It is a \nproposal that offers much-needed changes in the area of risk management \nfor farmers and ranchers. Managing risk in agriculture has become \nperhaps the most important aspect of the business. Agricultural \nproducers who are able to effectively manage risk are able to sustain \nand increase profit and operate more effectively in business cycles. An \neffective crop insurance program will provide our producers new \npossibilities for economic stability in the future. It will provide \nanother foothold in our attempts to help agriculture out the current \nhole that it is in, and it will provide a vital tool to help prevent \nfuture depressions in the agriculture industry.\n  The Federal Government must help facilitate a program to unite the \nproducer and the private insurance company. The control must be put in \nthe hands of the agricultural producer, and coverage must be high \nenough to warrant enrolling in the program. Although no producer can \ncompletely control risk, an effective management plan will reduce the \nnegative effects of unavoidable risks. Today's family farmer must have \nadequate options, or one bad year could mean the difference between \nkeeping the family farm or having to leave agriculture.\n  This bill addresses the inadequacies of the current crop insurance \nprogram. The problems and inconsistencies with the current program make \nit both unaffordable and confusing to agricultural producers. Costly \npremiums with low coverage percentages are the biggest problem. In \nyears of depressed market prices, crop insurance, though badly needed, \nis simply unaffordable for farmers.\n  This bill inverts the current subsidy formula, in order to provide \nthe highest levels of subsidies to producers at the highest levels of \nbuy-up coverage, and thus alleviate the problem of unaffordable \npremiums. It also allows for the revenue policies to be fully \nsubsidized.\n  Another important provision in this bill is a pilot program to reward \nproducers for risk management activities. It will allow producers to \nelect to receive a risk management payment or a\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\ncrop insurance subsidy. The risk management payments will be given to \nthose producers that utilize any two of several activities, including \nusing futures or options, utilizing cash forwards, attending a risk \nmanagement class, using agricultural trade options or FFARRM accounts \nor reducing farm financial risk. Quite simply, it rewards a producer \nfor utilizing management tools that will help protect his, and the \ngovernment's, exposure in the current agriculture market.\n  This bill also takes into account the lack of production histories \nfor beginning farmers or those who have added land or recently utilized \ncrop rotation. This will make it possible for producers to get a foot \nin the door and receive affordable crop insurance.\n  This bill is an important tool to reform the current crop insurance \nprogram into a risk management program, designed to help the producer \nin the long-term. It is vital to find a solution to provide a way for \nfarmers to stay in agriculture. They must be able to continue to \nproduce and distribute the world's safest food supply at a profitable \nmargin.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely happy that the conferees have finally \ncompleted their work on this important proposal. It is vital to Montana \nand the rest of our Nation's rural agriculture communities.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin of Iowa, Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska, Senator Roberts of Kansas, and the Ag Committee--I do not \nserve on the Ag Committee--for completing this legislation.\n  This legislation, by the way, was promised 2 or 3 years ago. They \nhave labored a long time with the Crop Insurance Program which is \nprobably the best package that has ever been produced by Congress and \ngiven to the American agricultural community to manage their risks. \nThis is a tool to manage their risks.\n  Also, my colleagues will note this report also includes $7 billion in \nsupplemental appropriations to help farmers and ranchers cope with the \ncurrent farm situation.\n  Think about that a bit. This is landmark legislation because we are \nnot even to Memorial Day, we are not even into the meat of the growing \nseason, and we have already made preparation to deal with the situation \nthat exists in agricultural today.\n  We have been stripped from some of our markets, and our prices \ncontinue to be very low. On the other hand, the American consumer is \nstill supplied with the most wholesome food in the world.\n  This Congress has fulfilled its promise to have this money ready to \ngo for our Nation's ag producers.\n  Without these monetary adjustments to make up for failing markets, \nentire communities will dry up. They are experiencing more financial \nstress than ever before, probably even through the Great Depression. \nWithout this support, the investments we have made in economic \ndevelopment to diversity our economy will be threatened. This also \nsends a strong message to the financial community and the farm \ncommunity that we are serious about the support of that industry and \nwill not just let it dry up on the vine.\n  I congratulate the people who worked so hard. This conference was not \nan easy conference. It was not an easy package to put together. Next \nyear, we will be debating what is good for a farm program, and we know \nthere will be some changes made. Right now, the signal to our producers \non the land is direct and it is very sharp.\n  We have had some unfortunate things happen in the State of Montana. \nWe depend heavily on the Pacific rim for exports. Three years ago, the \neconomics of the Pacific rim collapsed: Indonesia, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, South Korea, Thailand. Some of those economies are just \nstarting to come back.\n  Just yesterday, we signed an agreement with the Taiwanese--they will \nbe visiting the State of Montana--on buying wheat from my State. We \nhave also put in the act that the Department of Agriculture has tools \nto use to fight the competition on the international markets. They have \nchosen not to do that. There is enough blame to go around for a farm \neconomy that is hurting. Nonetheless, this is a positive bipartisan \nstep in the right direction.\n  The producers of our country should take a look at this package. \nThere is a lot of flexibility here. Not only do we talk with multiperil \nthings that can happen in a crop-year, but we are also talking about \nrevenue, and we have never done that before. We have a complete \npackage, a package that offers a tool for risk management for our ag \nproducers on the land.\n  Again, I compliment the Agriculture Committee on both sides of the \naisle for their work on this legislation. It is very important to the \nfarm States of this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for allowing me a little time. I \ncongratulate him and thank him for his leadership on this issue and \neverybody who had a part in putting this together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself on my time such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for his strong support and input \ninto this bill, as he said over a couple of years, trying to make sure \nwe get a crop insurance bill that helps farmers manage risks. I \nappreciate his input and his kind words. Hopefully, we will adopt this \nconference reports this afternoon and farmers in Montana and Iowa, and \nall points in between, will at least have some assurance they can help \nmanage their own risks.\n  Mr. BURNS. There are a lot of points.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There are a lot of points in there, that is true.\n  Mr. President, I express my support for the conference report to the \nAgriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 which we conferenced yesterday.\n  I thank Senator Lugar, our chairman, for his hard work and \npersistence, as I said, over a couple of years in crafting the crop \ninsurance title in this conference report which will provide \nsignificant benefits to farmers across the country.\n  This accomplishment is bipartisan, one of which we can be proud. I \nthank Senator Lugar again for his persistent and strong leadership. I \nthank both Senator Roberts and Senator Kerrey who really were the \nimpetus for these changes in the Crop Insurance Program. I know the two \nof them worked long and hard to put together this bill. In the \nbeginning stages, they worked with us on both sides of the aisle to \nmeet the needs of various parts of our country. I especially thank \nSenator Roberts and Senator Kerrey.\n  In this regard, Mr. President, this is probably the last agriculture \nbill we will have this year. There may be some bits and pieces that \ncome along later. I think it is safe to say this may be the last, and \nprobably will be the last, major ag bill this year.\n  In that regard, I pay my respects and thank our departing colleague, \nSenator Kerrey from Nebraska. He has been an invaluable member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee for all of these years. He has always \ngiven great input and great insight into our deliberations and \ndiscussions on all facets of American agriculture. He has been an \ninvaluable member of our committee. I know I will miss him greatly on \nour side of the aisle.\n  He has always worked in a bipartisan fashion to help move \nlegislation. I take this time to thank my friend and colleague from \nacross the Missouri River and to wish him well in the future and again \nthank him for his work in getting this legislation through. It is a \nfitting tribute to his work through the years in the Senate. His \nfingerprints are on this crop insurance bill we are passing today.\n  The point of the bill is to help farmers obtain better crop \ninsurance; that is, to help them buy up their coverage. The final \nstructure of the premium subsidy schedule provides higher discounts at \nboth lower and higher levels of buy-up coverage. The improvements at \nthe highest levels, 80 and 100 and 85 and 100, will benefit Iowa \nfarmers who typically face low risk of loss.\n  The bill also provides equivalent subsidies to farmers buying revenue \ninsurance policies such as CRC, which is the crop revenue coverage, a \nproduct which is very popular with Iowa farmers. This change spurred \ndevelopment of new insurance policies and products.\n  In addition, the bill will offer reimbursement to private developers \nof new plans of insurance. Again, that will be good for our farmers.\n  Another major provision maintained was the elimination of the area \nloss\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\ntrigger for the program for noninsured crops, such as hay and forage \ncrops or horticulture fruits and vegetables.\n  This change is important to Members in the West and Northeast, one \nwhich we fought very hard to maintain in conference.\n  The bill will also protect farmers by allowing them to maintain their \ninsurable yields, despite significant crop loss, by limiting how much \nof a loss affects future insurance coverage.\n  This feature could be very helpful to Iowa farmers, especially those \nfacing potential drought this summer. At some point today we will be \ntalking a little bit more about that drought. But this will also be \nvery helpful, again, to other farmers, too, in the Dakotas and other \nplaces where they have had some very severe losses for 1 or 2 years in \na row, which, if not balanced out, could unduly affect their rates and \ntheir coverage in future years. So we protected those farmers in those \nareas in those circumstances.\n  I also want to note some other positive provisions in this bill, in \nthe economic assistance package.\n  First, there is $50 million for conservation, $10 million for the \nFarmland Protection Act, and $40 million for EQIP.\n  I am disappointed, however, that an amendment that I had offered in \nthe Senate, and which was adopted by the Senate, that would have linked \nconservation compliance to the provisions of crop insurance, was \nrejected by the House conferees.\n  In every other Government farm programs, there is a provision that \nmandates that a farmer has to follow conservation compliance to be \neligible for those programs. We had it for crop insurance until 1996. \nIt was taken out. I and others desired to put that back in this crop \ninsurance bill.\n  As I said, it was adopted on the Senate side, but the House conferees \nrefused to go along with that. And in the interests of getting the crop \ninsurance bill through, we acceded to the unanimous consent request to \ngo ahead and remove that provision. I am hopeful to come back with that \nagain at some point in the future on some other piece of agricultural \nlegislation.\n  But other than that, there is $50 million for conservation. That is \ngood.\n  Secondly, there is $15 million in this bill to assist farmer-owned \ncooperatives, and other farmer-owned ventures, to help develop the \nvalue-added crops and processing for our farmers.\n  Third, there is $7 million in this bill to further fund vaccines for \npseudo-rabbies eradication program for hogs. It is very important in \nour area of the country.\n  Fourth, in the nutrition assistance programs, there is $110 million \nfor school lunch commodity purchases. Again, we have a lot of surplus \ncrops out there, a lot of surplus commodities. I think it is \nbeneficial, both for the health of our children, and the school lunch \nprogram, the school breakfast program, and the summer feeding program, \nthat we purchase these commodities and get them out to our young kids.\n  Also, we have reformed the Child and Adult Care Food Program to guard \nmore against fraud which has come up repeatedly.\n  Also, there is a provision in this bill--that is also a small \nprovision--but I think it is going to be very important, which is going \nto permit us to get more children into health insurance for low-income \nfamilies.\n  Right now, under the provisions in this bill, if you qualify for \nreduced-price school lunches, or free school lunches, a provision in \nthe bill will then say the people in the school have to inform your \nfamilies that since you qualify for free or reduced lunches, you will \nprobably qualify for things such as the CHIP program, to make sure, \nthrough Medicaid, your children are in a health insurance program. That \nis another way of reaching low-income families to make sure that their \nchildren are indeed covered by health care. That is another good \nprovision in this bill.\n  Lastly, there is a biomass research and development title in this \nbill that Senator Lugar has worked on for a long time. He is a real \nchampion of it. I have been a cosponsor of it, but it is Senator Lugar \nwho has pushed this bill to help make more fuel and industrial raw \nmaterials from biomass. And this bill is part of this. Again, another \ngood provision of this bill is the biomass research and development \nbill that has been championed by Senator Lugar.\n\n  So there is much that is good in this bill. That is why I will \nsupport it. That is why I was reluctant in the conference committee to \ntake any more time than we did yesterday, in just a few hours, to get \nthis bill through.\n  But I am compelled to speak for a little bit about what is in this \nbill that I think is detrimental to our family farm structure in \nAmerica and to ensuring that we have a diversified and widely spread \nsystem of agriculture.\n  The $7.1 billion in emergency assistance that is included in this \nreport, I believe, is misapplied, misdirected, and in many cases will \nbe misspent.\n  It is clear that our farmers are going to need aid. There is no doubt \nabout that. But how this final package looks, I think, does not really \nmeet those needs. This is the third year in a row that we have had \nadditional AMTA payments--payments to farmers based on emergency help \nin the farm economy. The farm economy is still in shambles. For 3 years \nin a row, it has been in shambles. Every year, we come back and do the \nsame thing year, after year after year, after year. Someone once \ndefined ``insanity'' as doing the same thing over and over and \nexpecting a different result. Every year we keep doing the same thing \nover and over, and we expect some different result; and we do not get a \ndifferent result. The only result we get is fewer and fewer family \nfarmers, more stress in rural areas, and more and more of our money \ngoing to the larger concerns who are driving out our family farms.\n  But I want to recite for the Record where this money is going, these \nbillions of dollars that we are taking from taxpayers and putting out \nthere.\n  During the first 3 years of our Freedom to Farm bill--1996 to 1998--\nthe top 10 percent of payment recipients, or about 150,000 individuals, \ngot 61 percent of the payments. Ten percent of the recipients got 61 \npercent of the money. Their annual payments from AMTA, the supplemental \nAMTAs, we passed every year, and the loan deficiency payments averaged \n$95,000. That is for the top 10 percent.\n  The other 90 percent averaged only $7,000 in payments.\n  I have a chart that illustrates this. It shows the average Government \npayments by farm size in 1997. The average was $7,378 for all farms. \nBut those farms that had sales greater than $1 million averaged \n$33,699. For those farms that had sales of $250,000 to $500,000, they \naveraged $16,524--and on down.\n  As you can see, the bigger you are, the more you got. And I daresay, \nit is usually those bigger farmers that were better able to protect \nthemselves with insurance and other methods, who may not have needed \nthat kind of assistance.\n  It is the farmers down here in the lower end that needed the \nassistance and the help. But they were left stranded.\n  On a State-by-State basis, the lopsided nature is even more striking. \nI will talk about Iowa, too, but the top 10 percent of recipients in \nMississippi received 83 percent of the payments. In Alabama, the top 10 \npercent received 81 percent of the payments. In my own State of Iowa, \nlest anyone think that I am singling out other States other than my \nown, the top 12 percent, in terms of income, received 50 percent of the \npayments in my State of Iowa.\n  I do not think that is fair. The inequities of the current system \nhave been exacerbated during the current economic crisis in \nagriculture.\n  The last 2 years have shown that when prices are low, regular AMTA \npayments do nothing to keep an ad hoc disaster package under control. \nMore importantly, they are not an effective mechanism in targeting aid \nto those who need it.\n  We have had the AMTA payments. We come along every year, and we have \na disaster program. They are a very poor method of response to our \ncurrent farm crisis.\n  While it is important to get needed aid out to producers, it is \nimperative that we get it out to help mostly family farmers who are \nreally hurting, not to help the bigger farms bury the smaller ones.\n\n  The data indicates just the opposite is happening. The lion's share \nof this additional aid will go to the largest\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\nproducers, while small producers receive almost nothing. Under the \ncurrent scheme, a recipient at the high end of the spectrum may qualify \nfor as much as $240,000 in AMTA payments this fiscal year. Under the \ncurrent law, a person ``may be eligible'' to receive the payment \nmaximum of $40,000 for each round of AMTA payments, the original \npayment plus the supplemental payment we have in this bill. That adds \nup, of course. Then they already received the supplemental payment that \nis in the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill. So that is $120,000. If \nthey structure their operations to fit under the three-entity rule, \neach person can receive payments from three entities. That, in effect, \ndoubles that $120,000 up to $240,000. And that is not the end of it. As \nmuch as $300,000 in loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains \ncan go to that farmer. One farmer in this country this year can get up \nto $540,000 of taxpayers' money. I don't believe that is right; I don't \nbelieve that is fair.\n  I was going to offer a provision in the conference committee. I \ndidn't. The reason I didn't is that I thought it was important to get \nthe crop insurance bill through. As I said in the conference committee \nyesterday, we should have a crop insurance bill before us.\n  The budget resolution that was passed here, that allowed us to have \nadditional spending this year for supplemental payments to farmers, \nprovided for the authorizing committee to authorize it by June 29, \nwhich means we had until the end of June to have a debate in our \ncommittee to talk about the policy implications of what we have been \ndoing the last couple years and whether or not we want this policy \nstructure to continue.\n  Do we want to really continue to put our AMTA payments out like this?\n  Well, we did not have that debate, so here we are confronted with \nthis on a crop insurance bill, which should not be. This should be a \nseparate bill from the Agriculture Committee on the floor where we \ncould debate this.\n  Maybe it would be the will of the majority of the Senate to continue \nto give large payments to large farmers, to continue the three-entity \nrule to allow some farmers to get hundreds of thousands of dollars. \nThat could have been the outcome. But at least we should have been \ndebating it. It should be here in a manner in which it would be \ndebatable and amendable. We don't have that.\n  I was going to offer an amendment to limit to $100,000 the most \nanyone could get through the AMTA system. I heard all kinds of talk \nfrom different people saying this would be terrible. That would have \naffected five-tenths of 1 percent of all the recipients; 6,700 farmers \nwould have been affected by that if we would have capped it at \n$100,000.\n  I have always thought I was here to fight for the vast majority of \nthe family farmers who are out there, not just the top one-half of 1 \npercent who, by and large, have the economic wherewithal to protect \nthemselves. Many of our smaller farmers simply don't. Again, the data \nindicates that it is those at the top of the spectrum who are getting \nthe most money.\n  I have another chart. This chart illustrates how we are going in the \nwrong direction. As we continue down this pathway of AMTA payments, \nsupplemental AMTA payments, loan deficiency payments built on each \nother year after year, without addressing the underlying provisions of \nthe Freedom to Farm bill, what is happening is we are creating a bigger \ngap between the big farmers and the smaller farmers in our country. \nThis chart illustrates that.\n  As one can see by Government payments here on the left side, $20,000, \n$40,000, $60,000, $80,000, $100,000, and producers who receive those \npayments, if they look at this block, they will see that those \nproducers who received about $50,000 or more in payments in the last 3 \nyears almost doubled the amount of money they were getting from the \nGovernment--almost doubled it.\n\n  Look here at our smaller, family-sized farmers, who only got maybe \n$2,000 or $3,000 in payments. They just went up a very small amount. \nThese doubled in size, doubled in payment; these hardly went up at all. \nWhat kind of policy are we pursuing here?\n  I am not talking about farmers just getting big on their own and \nmaking more money. If these big farmers are more efficient and can do a \nbetter job and get this money in the marketplace, God bless them. We \nare talking about taxpayers' money going from here to these farmers. \nThe big ones almost doubled in the amount of money they are getting \nfrom the Government; the smaller ones barely got any increase at all. I \nwish someone would explain to me how this is sound public policy.\n  I have the figures right here. Recipients who averaged $50,000 or \nmore in Government payments from 1996 to 1998 received $42,337 more in \n1998 than in 1996. In contrast, if you were at the bottom of the \npayment spectrum, these little ones down here at the bottom, you \naveraged between $5,000 and $10,000 per year, which is the bulk of the \nfarmers in my State; you received a mere $740 more in 1998 than you did \nin 1997.\n  I will repeat that. In my State--just talking about my State; I don't \nwant to pick on anybody else's State--in my own State of Iowa, if you \nreceived an average of $50,000 or more in Government agricultural \npayments from 1996 to 1998, in 1 year you got more than a $28,000 \nincrease, from 1997 to 1998. You got $42,000 more over the 2 years. \nThat is if you were at the top of the heap. If you were at the bottom \nand you only got $5,000 to $10,000 in Government payments, you got $740 \nmore.\n  Someone please tell me how this is good public policy, that we give \nGovernment money out like this to the biggest, those who can protect \nthemselves. Do you know what they are doing with that money? They are \nbuying more land. They are getting bigger, because our smaller farmers \nare going out of production and the bigger farmers are buying their \nland.\n  Again, if this were a free market approach, I would say fine, but it \nis Government payments going out to large farmers who are providing for \nthe extinction of our family farmers--Government policies, right now, \nallowing these bigger farmers to get these massive Government payments, \nsqueezing the smaller producers, and the bigger producers are buying up \nthe land and getting bigger and bigger and bigger. It isn't because of \nany free market approach, it is because of governmental policies. \nAgain, the disparities are not just size related, they are based on \nplanting history.\n  When I opened my remarks earlier today, I said someone please explain \nto me how it is good public policy that we pay farmers AMTA payments, \nGovernment payments, this year based on what they did 20 years ago. \nThat is right. I try to explain this to people, and I get blank stares. \nIt is a fact. If you have two farmers out there, one who has a 20-year \nhistory of planting and the other who maybe only has a 5-year history \nof planting, the one who has the 20-year history of planting may be \nplanting nothing this year, but guess what, you are going to get money.\n  Yet if you were a farmer out there planting for the last 3, 4, or 5 \nyears, you don't have that 20-year history, you won't get anything. \nAgain, please explain to me how this is good policy. It is not tied to \nwhat farmers are producing today. It is tied to what they produced 20 \nyears ago.\n  Two farmers in Iowa, with half their production in corn and half \ntheir production in soybeans, can be paid markedly different levels \nbecause of past planting history. When you figure the AMTA payment \nlevel, the farmer with a 50-percent corn base and a 50-percent soybean \nbase will be paid half as much in AMTA payments as the farmer who has a \n100-percent corn base. What sense does this make? It makes no sense. \nFarmers all over my State recognize that.\n  Now, as if all I have said isn't bad enough, the prospects for \ndrought this year will even cause this program to be worse than it is. \nIf a drought of the proportions that is predicted actually occurs, the \ndisparity between the haves and the have-nots will grow even more. Why \nis that? Because let's say we have a drought--and it looks as if we are \ngoing to have pretty severe droughts in some parts of the country and \nother parts of the country will not--that means that the price, say, of \ncorn is going to go up. But you, who are in a drought area, may only \nget a certain portion--you may get an AMTA payment, but you won't get \nanything out of the market because you won't have\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\na crop. If, however, you are in an area where you haven't had a \ndrought, you are going to get high prices for your crop and an AMTA \npayment. Those who have no crop to sell will have their incomes \nplummet; they will get no adjustment in their AMTA payment to address \nthose losses. They will get absolutely no more than the farmer who has \na huge crop because they were not in the drought area. Again, these \npayments will exacerbate again this disparity between the large farmers \nand the small farmers in America. Again, I think that is bad public \npolicy.\n  Now, maybe if we have a big drought, we will come rushing in here \nwith some kind of a disaster package. But, again, I wonder who is going \nto get the benefits of that. So throughout all of this, the mantra has \nbeen that there is no other viable mechanism, that AMTA payments are \nour best means of getting aid to our producers. Well, if this is the \nbest we can do, I would hate to see what the worst is.\n  There is a better way. I believe both sides should come together to \nfigure out a better way of getting payments out to farmers. This idea \nof giving more and more to the biggest is not right, not good for our \ncountry; it is not good public policy. I have urged the Senate to have \na frank and open discussion about the failures of the current system \nand on ways to improve it. We have not been afforded that opportunity \nin a meaningful way.\n  As I said, this is in no way disparaging of my friend and the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee. I know he was more than willing \nto have this discussion and this debate. But the powers that be \ninsisted that we have this AMTA payment provision on the crop insurance \nbill. So here we are with it, without any provision for our authorizing \ncommittee to discuss and debate, and perhaps modify. As I said, I don't \nknow if the will of the majority would have been there to do that, but \nat least we could have had an open and frank discussion about whether \nor not we wanted to go in that direction. Hopefully, we will have that \nopportunity in the future.\n  So, again, I hope we will have this type of debate. I think our \nfarmers and our taxpayers deserve that type of debate. In the meantime, \nI have no problems with the underlying bill. It is a good bill. The \ncrop insurance bill is a good bill. It is going to go a long way toward \nhelping our farmers manage the risk. As I said, there are other good \nprovisions attached onto it. I am just sorry we had to attach on the \npayment provisions to this bill without having the committee do its \njob.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to briefly express my support for \nthe crop insurance reform package that is being considered today, and \nthe additional emergency assistance that was appended to the bill.\n  This crop insurance reform is critically needed in the heartland of \nAmerica. As the sponsor of the first crop insurance reform legislation \nintroduced in the 105th and 106th Congress, I have worked hard on crop \ninsurance reform and on keeping this issue at the forefront of \ncongressional priorities, so it is gratifying to finally see this \nmeasure completed by conferees and the Congress.\n  I worked with a committee of Minnesotans representing producers, \nlenders, agriculture economists, and other stakeholders to build a \nconsensus on solutions to the current discontentment in rural America \nwith the federal crop insurance program. I am pleased that the final \nbill contains the expansion of pilot programs I worked for, expansion \nof the dairy options pilot program that I cosponsored, and higher \npremium subsidies at the higher levels of coverage that was the \ncritical portion of my original legislation.\n  The premium subsidies will be crucial to help farmers manage their \nrisk, and possibly reduce the need for ad hoc disaster assistance. Many \nproducers believe that the current crop insurance program is too costly \nto take part in, and this reform measure should increase participation \nand thus spread risk more widely.\n  I am also pleased that the crop insurance package includes an \nadditional $7.1 billion in emergency aid to producers, which includes \nAMTA payments and oilseed producer assistance payments. This will \nhopefully give rural economies and farm families the financial boost \nthey need until commodity prices start to rise again. While I have \nconcerns about AMTA, this is the best way to quickly distribute these \nfunds to farmers. I agree AMTA should be revisited in the next farm \nbill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this report is a good example of how the \nSenate--when we sit down and work together--can craft sound \nlegislation.\n  New England and Mid-Atlantic farmers who do not usually participate \nin crop insurance will greatly benefit from this effort. There is \nfunding to help preserve farmland, protect the environment and to give \nfarmers better tools to manage risk.\n  In addition, farmers who have suffered through two years of low \nprices will get some relief as USDA purchases $200 million worth of \napples, cranberries, potatoes, melons, and the like. There will also be \nmajor purchases of specialty crops for the school lunch program--this \nwill benefit farmers and school lunch programs.\n  In the beginning, there were a lot of strong differences of opinion \non how to reform crop insurance and provide assistance to farmers. In \nfact, we had a 10-8 split in the Agriculture Committee on how to \nstructure this reform.\n  But Republicans and Democrats worked together and got the job done. \nSure, it's more work but that is why we are here.\n  I was very upset yesterday when I learned--after we ended our \nconference negotiations and worked out all the final deals, and after \nwe terminated the conference and had signed the conference report--that \nthe unfinished bankruptcy bill was going to be thrown into the crop \ninsurance conference report.\n  That is an example of how the Senate should not operate. It would be \nhard to imagine a more serious breach of trust.\n  I was prepared to discuss the world history of crop insurance from \n1860 through the year 2000, which could have put me to sleep while I \nwas talking. In the end, it appears that cooler heads prevailed and \ndecided they would rather pass crop insurance than listen to me speak.\n  I appreciate the role of Senators Lugar and Roberts to get us back on \ntrack on crop insurance.\n  For my part, I will continue to work with Senators Grassley, \nSessions, Daschle, Hatch, Torricelli, and others on both sides of the \naisle to craft a fair balanced and bipartisan bankruptcy bill. If we \ncould do this for crop insurance, we can do it in bankruptcy--if there \nis the will to get it done.\n  While there are aspects of the crop insurance compromise that I do \nnot like, there clearly was a significant attempt to design a package \nthat benefits all areas of the nation and a wide range of commodities--\nincluding specialty crops. This is a very good bill.\n  I appreciate this national focus because a narrowly focused crop \ninsurance bill would not have been helpful to New England and the Mid-\nAtlantic States. I was pleased to work with many of my colleagues from \nthat region--both Democrats and Republicans--to formulate a package \nthat would also benefit our regions.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Lugar and his ranking member \nSenator Harkin in working out a good compromise. Also, Senators Roberts \nand Kerrey deserve a great deal of thanks for all their work on this \nissue.\n  I want to point out one general concern.\n  Because of the simultaneous work on Agriculture appropriations some \nprovisions critical to New England and the Mid-Atlantic States, and to \nmany other states, have been omitted from this package--because the \nplan is to include them in appropriations.\n  It is crucial to me--and Republicans and Democrats in both Houses--\nthat dairy farmers not be left out of Agriculture appropriations bill \nsince this report does not provide them with direct financial \nassistance. I am counting on some assurances I have received to keep \nthe dairy funding in the appropriations bill. I will be working closely \nwith my appropriations colleagues Senator Cochran and his ranking \nmember, Senator Kohl, on this matter.\n  Also, I understand that the House appropriations bill includes $100 \nmillion for apple farmers who have been hard-hit by low yields or low \nquality after two years of unavoidable weather extremes, from floods to \ndrought. Helping\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\nthese farmers is extremely important to New England, Mid-Atlantic \nStates, Washington State, California, and other areas.\n  As I pointed out during the conference, farmland protection programs \nwork very well to help preserve farmland as farmland. There is so much \nneed for funding, that our modest program in Vermont could instantly \nuse the full $10 million since there is such a need and desire for this \nprogram.\n  Indeed, I had a major role in getting section 388 included in the \n1996 farm bill. Similarly, in the 1990 farm bill contained a related \nfarmland preservation program which I drafted called ``Farms for the \nFuture.''\n  I was pleased that the conference would accept this latest farmland \nprotection proposal found at section 211, the ``Conservation \nAssistance,'' provision. This provision will be of great help to the \nVermont Housing and Conservation Board which has done a tremendous job \nhelping preserve Vermont farms and the farming way of life by buying \ndevelopment easements on farmland property.\n\n  I was proud to fight to include funding for such a great agency--the \nVermont Housing and Conservation Board of Vermont. Providing funding to \nthem as soon as possible will enable them to free up money which could \nbe used to preserve additional farmland in Vermont.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the other Members to include this \nprovision and am anxious to allow the Board to greatly enhance its \nservice to farm families in Vermont.\n  Section 211(b) is also a very important provision for many regions of \nthe country. It allows the Secretary through the CCC to provide \nfinancial assistance to farmers for a very wide range of activities \nsuch as addressing threats to soil, or water, or related natural \nresources.\n  In the alternative, it permits funds to be used to help farmers \ncomply with environmental laws or to be used for ``beneficial, cost-\neffective changes'' to a variety of different efforts or uses needed to \nconserve or improve soil, or water, or related natural resources.\n  This gives the Secretary a broad range of land preservation and \nconservation alternatives for funding under that subsection.\n  There is language in this report for a temporary suspension of \nauthority to combine USDA field offices. I am concerned that in small-\npopulation states, such as Vermont, cuts in federal staff have been so \nsignificant that the offices do not function effectively. During this \ntemporary suspension the Secretary should also suspend staffing cuts.\n  These staff cuts, particularly in the Farm Services Agency, should be \nhalted in very small states so we can figure out what minimal numbers \nwe need to properly run these offices. Indeed, in a small state like \nVermont it only makes sense to allow them to hire the staff they need \nsuch that USDA can, during the suspension, properly determine which \noffices should be closed.\n  I want to briefly mention a special crop provision, section 203, \nwhich provides $200 million to the Secretary to purchase specialty \ncrops ``that have experienced low prices during the 1998 and 1999 crop \nyears . . .'' We expect the Secretary to very aggressively use this \nauthority to purchase apples, cranberries, potatoes, and the other \ncommodities listed. This provision is very important to New England, \nMid-Atlantic states and to other areas.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the crop insurance conference for \nall their efforts to craft a strong compromise report. I appreciate all \nthe hard work of Chairman Lugar and his great sense of fairness. As \nusual, his staff did an excellent job. Keith Luse, his chief of staff, \nhelped carefully balance many competing interests.\n  His chief counsel, Dave Johnson, was extremely helpful and provided \noutstanding guidance throughout this complicated process. Andy Morton, \nthe chief economist, and Michael Knipe, the lead counsel, provided \nsound analysis and helpful assistance.\n  Senators Kerrey and Roberts played a very major role in this effort \nand I appreciate their contributions. Mike Seyfert of Senator Roberts' \nstaff demonstrated great expertise on these complicated issues. Hunt \nShipman, with Senator Cochran, and Scott Carlson, with Senator Conrad, \nwere very instrumental during this effort.\n  Bev Paul, with Senator Kerrey, was creative and energetic throughout \nthe staff negotiations and of great help in crafting the final \ncompromises. While not a conferee, the Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, and his staff, Zabrae Valentine, were very helpful regarding \nthis effort.\n  As always, the ranking member of the committee, Senator Harkin, was a \nstrong spokesman for farmers and ranchers. His staff, Mark Halverson \nand Stephanie Mercier, provided help to all of us.\n  The House staff also did a great job and I salute them. The chairman, \nMr. Combest, as have past chairmen, was very ably represented by his \nChief of Staff, Bill O'Conner. Jeff Harrison, the majority legal \ncounsel, did a terrific job drafting and explaining very complex legal \nlanguage.\n  It is always a pleasure to work with Congressman Stenholm, the \nranking member on the House Agriculture Committee. His staff, including \nVernie Hubert, Chip Conley, and John Riley, displayed a thorough \nunderstanding of the issues and are a great resource for the Members.\n  My own staffer on these matters, Ed Barron, as usual did a tremendous \njob, put in endless hours and helped me work out a good package. Also, \nMelody Burkins, who joined my staff recently, did a terrific job.\n  I have praised the work of Gary Endicott, of Senate Legislative \nCounsel, many times and do so again today. David Grahn with the Office \nof General Counsel of USDA has once again greatly assisted the Congress \nin providing expert technical drafting advice.\n  Ken Ackerman, head of the Risk Management Agency, also provided \nexpert technical advice to the Congress on this bill.\n  Let me bring your attention to another aspect of this report, the \nPlant Protection Act that has been incorporated into this legislation. \nThis modernization of existing laws provides tools and resources for \nanimal and plant health inspection services for the Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service of USDA so that they can better do their job.\n  This legislation will not only help protect agricultural plants in \nthe United States from pests and disease but will also assist APHIS in \ndealing with invasive species. The Plant Protection Board has indicated \nthat passage of this Act is their number one recommendation for \nsafeguarding American plants. I want to thank Under Secretary Mike Dunn \nfor his leadership on this important matter.\n  Mr. GRAHAM, Mr. President, Members of the Senate. I come before you \ntoday to speak in support of the conference report of the Agriculture \nRisk Protection Act of 2000 which we are voting on today.\n  First, I believe that this conference report is the beginning of a \nnew era of cooperation between traditional row crop states and \nspeciality crop states. During our development of this legislation, I \nhave worked closely with my colleagues Senators Mack, Lugar, Kerrey, \nand Roberts to address the unique needs of speciality crop producers. \nThis new cooperation speaks well of our ability in the next Congress to \ncooperatively review the impacts of the 1996 farm bill on American \nagriculture. I believe that, based on this cooperative effort, we will \nbe successful in ensuring that all American agriculture, not just row \ncrop producers or speciality crop producers, but all of agriculture \nreaps the benefits from those reforms.\n  Let me say a few words about agriculture in the state of Florida. The \nimage that many of us hold of the state is one of white sand beaches, \ncoral reefs alive with hundreds of tropical fish, or Disney World. \nWhile accurate, this image is not complete.\n  Florida has 40,000 commercial farmers. In 1997, Florida farmers \nutilized a little more than 10 million of the state's nearly 35 million \nacres to produce more than 25 billion pounds of food and more than 2 \nmillion tons of livestock feed. Florida ranks number nine nationally in \nthe value of its farm products and number two in the value of its \nvegetable crops.\n  Florida agriculture is not only valuable, but diverse. We rank number \ntwo nationally in horticulture production with annual sales of over $1 \nbillion. Florida grows 77 percent of U.S. grapefruits and 47 percent of \nworld supply of\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\ngrapefruit. The state produces 75 percent of the nation's oranges and \n20 percent worldwide.\n  In 1997, Florida's farmers led the nation in the production of 18 \nmajor agriculture commodities including: oranges and grapefruits, \nsugarcane, fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, sweet corn, ferns, fresh \ncucumbers, fresh snap beans, tangerines, tropical fish, temple oranges, \nfresh squash, radishes, gladioli, tangelos, eggplant, and houseplants.\n  Florida livestock and product sales were $1.1 billion in 1997. We are \nthe largest milk-producing state in the southeast. We rank 14th \nnationally in the production of eggs. Florida's horse industry has \nproduced 39 national thoroughbred champions and 47 equine millionaires. \nFlorida also has active peanut, cotton, potato, rice, sweet corn, and \nsoybean industries.\n  As these facts demonstrate, agriculture in Florida means many things \nto many people. However, all Floridians recognize that agriculture is a \ncritical part of our economy. Each year, Florida agriculture ranges \nfrom the second to the third largest industry in the state on an income \nbasis. It is this diverse industry that the Agriculture Risk Protection \nAct of 2000 will assist.\n  On July 20, 1999, I joined my colleagues Senators Mack, Feinstein, \nand Boxer in introducing S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of \n1999. This legislation sought to reduce the dependence of the specialty \ncrop industry an emergency spending and catastrophic loss insurance \ncoverage by improving its access to quality crop insurance policies.\n  Currently, crop insurance policies available for specialty crops do \nnot cover the unique characteristics associated with the planting, \ngrowing, and harvesting of specialty crops. According to a GAO report \non USDA's progress in expanding crop insurance coverage for specialty \ncrops, even after an expansion in policies available to specialty corps \nplanned through 2001, the existing crop insurance program will fail to \ncover approximately 300 specialty crops that make up 15 percent of the \nmarket share. In some cases, although crop insurance may exist for a \nspecialty crop, it may not be available in all areas where the crop is \ngrown. For example, the GAO report indicates that crop insurance for \ngrapes is available in selected counties in Arkansas, California, \nMichigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and \nWashington but not in other growing areas located in Arizona, Georgia, \nNorth Carolina, and South Carolina.\n  In an effort to increase producer participation in buy-up coverage, \nthe Risk Management Agency last year undertook a pilot program to \nincrease the premium subsidies at a total cost of $400 million. In \n1999, the Congress enacted this same program which was deemed a success \non an emergency basis.\n  This program was not a success for specialty crops. Of the 125,772 \nproducers who bought additional buy-up coverage after this subsidy was \noffered, 81 percent were producers of program crops. The highest \nincrease in a single commodity was 31,191 additional policies sold to \ncorn producers while the lowest increase was an additional 3 policies \nsold to pepper producers. Even when corrective action is taken to work \non increasing buy-up coverage for all crops, the program that is \ndesigned does not have a dramatic effect on specialty crop \nparticipation. We need a different approach for this unique sector of \nU.S. agriculture.\n  The original legislation that I introduced sought to promote the \ndevelopment and use of affordable crop insurance policies designed to \nmeet the specific needs of producers of specialty crops. The \nAgricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 will increase specialty crop \nproducer participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program, encourage \nhigher levels of coverage than provided by catastrophic insurance, and \nenable better planning and marketing decisions to be made.\n  I am pleased to say, Mr. President, that the crop insurance \nconference report we are considering today enacts the major provisions \nof my original bill. With the key support of Senators Kerrey and \nRoberts, who have focused their attention on the needs of speciality \ncrop producers, we have forged a bi-partisan piece of legislation that \naddresses the needs of multiple regions of the country.\n  In addressing speciality crops, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act \nof 2000 takes the following actions:\n  First, to ensure that the Risk Management Agency utilizes private \nsector expertise in developing new crop insurance policies, it requires \nthat portions of research and development funds in this bill and \nresearch and development funds for new crop insurance policies \nappropriated to RMA each year be focused on specialty crop product \ndevelopment. The legislation specifically authorizes $20-25 million per \nyear for RMA to enter into public and private partnerships to develop \nspecialty crop insurance policies.\n  Second, it also establishes a process to review new product \ndevelopment and ensure that crop insurance products are available to \nall agricultural commodities, including specialty crops.\n  Third, the Agriculture Protection Act of 2000 expands the \nauthorization for the Risk Management Agency to conduct pilot programs \nto increase its flexibility in developing better products for specialty \ncrop producers. Today, we are voting on legislation that will allow \npilots to be conducted on a state, regional, and national basis for a \nperiod of four years or longer if desired by RMA. This legislation also \nspecifies authority for the Risk Management Agency to conduct a pilot \nprogram for timber, a provision I originally introduced on April 22 of \n1999 in S. 868, the Forestry Initiative to Restore the Environment.\n  Fourth, to encourage specialty crop producers to buy up to 50/100 \ncoverage once these new policies are developed, the report before us \ntoday increases the rate for 50/100 coverage, the initial buy-up level \nafter catastrophic coverage to 67 percent. This will create an \nincentive for growers to purchase buy-up coverage and bring us closer \nto meeting our goal of reducing dependence on the CAT program.\n  Fifth, to ensure that aid for farmers who have no crop insurance \npolicies available to them actually receive aid in times of natural \ndisasters, this report modifies the Non-insured Assistance Program \n(NAP) to eliminate the area trigger, making any grower whose crop is \nuninsurable and experiences a federally-declared disaster, eligible for \nthese funds.\n  I will not enumerate each of the provisions of this legislation, as \nalmost each page contains a specific remedy for problems faced by \nspecialty crop producers. I commend my colleagues for their efforts to \nensure that crop insurance reform passed by the 106th Congress will \ntake into account the needs of all agriculture producers. In \nparticular, I thank Senators Mack, Kerrey, and Roberts for joining me \nin my efforts to ensure that the needs of production agriculture in \nFlorida are met.\n  I believe that the provisions in the Agriculture Risk Protection Act \nof 2000 will ensure that specialty crop producers have access to high \nquality insurance products designed to meet their needs.\n  Turning away from crop insurance for a moment, I would like to \nmention a few key times in this package that are just as critical for \nspecialty crop producers.\n  First, this legislation includes $25 million for compensation to \ngrowers who have experienced losses due to plum pox virus, Pierce's \ndisease, and citrus canker. To date, citrus canker has spread to over \n1600 acres of commercial citrus groves in Florida and is threatening \nthe existence of the industry. The entire lime industry is on the verge \nof being eliminated. Already, over half of the 3000 acres in lime \nproduction have been destroyed or marked for destruction. Once an \ninfected tree is discovered, federal regulation, designed to eradicate \nthis disease, requires the destruction of all trees, healthy or \ndiseased, within a 1,900-foot radius. Literally thousands of citrus \ntrees, which require three to four years to reach maturity, have been \nburned to the ground during this year's growing season. These funds are \na critical first step in the ability of our grower to recover from the \ndevastation that this disease has caused in Florida.\n\n  Second, this legislation includes a streamlined version of the Plant \nProtection Act. In 1988, I commissioned a study by the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture and the Animal and Plant\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nHealth Inspection Service (APHIS) to evaluate the viability of our \nnation's system of safeguarding America's plant resources from invasive \nplant pests. In today's global marketplace where international travel \nis commonplace, the importance of APHIS' role in ensuring that invasive \npests and plants do not enter our borders in paramount. The passage of \nthe Plant Protection Act was the number one recommendation of this \nreport which included almost 300 individual recommended actions. Today, \nwe are taking our first step toward a serious commitment to protecting \nAmerican agriculture from the ravages of diseases like citrus canker or \nthe Mediterranean fruit fly.\n  Third, conference report includes over $70 million for key \ninfrastructure improvements to the fruit and vegetable inspection \nsystem that was recently embroiled in controversy when eighty USDA \ninspectors were arrested for taking bribes to reduce the value of \nproduce and allow receivers to negotiate lower prices with shippers. \nThese funds will restore the integrity of this system.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues for their fine work and perseverance \nin bringing this conference report to completion and before the Senate \nfor a final vote. Today's action will enact long-term change in our \ncrop insurance program that will provide specialty crop producers with \naccess to affordable crop insurance policies which are designed to meet \ntheir specific needs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to address the Senate today \nin support of a conference report (H.R. 2559) that improves and expands \nthe crop insurance and risk management tools available to farmers in \nthe United States. I am equally pleased to support economic and \ndisaster assistance attached to H.R. 2259 not because I believe the \nassistance will always be targeted to those that need it most, but \nrather because Congress cannot afford to ignore the opportunity to act \nnow in order to provide timely relief to our nation's family farmers \nand ranchers.\n  Collapsed crop and livestock prices, weak export demand, and \nagribusiness concentration continue to threaten the viability of our \nindependent family farmers and ranchers. Crop insurance provides many \nagricultural producers with a risk management tool, and with the \nreforms made in the legislation before us today, crop insurance will \nprove even more effective.\n  Nonetheless, I must caution that no matter how well crop insurance is \nimproved, it is not a substitute for a sound farm policy or a safety \nnet. Instead, crop insurance is an important part of that farm safety \nnet. Moreover, the economic and disaster farm aid attached to this \nlegislation will help in the near-term, but for the third year in a row \nthis Congress has failed to address the underlying shortcomings of the \ncurrent farm bill.\n  Crop insurance is critical to the farmers of South Dakota. Nearly \ntwenty South Dakota grown crops are currently eligible for crop \ninsurance, and among our major commodities, participation in the crop \ninsurance program is high. Ninety-five percent of our corn acreage is \nenrolled in crop insurance while ninety two percent of our soybean \nacres are in this program. Wheat producers in South Dakota place \nseventy-six percent of their acreage in crop insurance. After the \nreforms made to the program in 1994--when I chaired the House \nAgriculture Subcommittee dealing with this issue--over 10 million acres \nof farmland in my state were enrolled in crop insurance.\n  I was pleased to co-sponsor a bipartisan reform bill that is a \nmodification of S. 1580, the Kerrey-Roberts Crop Insurance for the 21st \nCentury Act. The conference report before the Senate today closely \nmirrors the Kerrey/Roberts legislation and addresses some of the most \nserious concerns of the current crop insurance program; affordability, \ndependability, and flexibility.\n  Nearly every agricultural producer wants the opportunity to purchase \nhigher levels of crop insurance coverage, but most have found that buy-\nup coverage becomes cost prohibitive. This bill makes coverage more \naffordability by providing higher subsidies for higher levels of \ncoverage. South Dakota farmers support this provision of our bill \nbecause affordability seems to be the most pressing issue facing crop \ninsurance today.\n  In recent years, the issue of coverage dependability has come into \nserious question. Farmers in South Dakota and elsewhere have suffered \nunder multiple years of weather related disasters. The bill before us \ntoday ensures greater coverage dependability by providing relief for \nproducers suffering from insurance coverage decreases and premium \nincreases due to multi-year crop losses resulting from natural \ndisasters.\n  The conference report authorizes USDA to conduct a series of pilot \nprograms to provide risk management protection to livestock producers, \nI am hopeful livestock producers can stand to benefit from this action \nbecause to date they have been specifically excluded from this \nprotection.\n  Yet, I am disappointed the crop insurance conference committee \nmembers dropped a provision that sought to maintain conservation \ncompliance as a part of crop insurance coverage.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I helped secure $6 \nbillion last year (over a four year period) in order to improve the \noverall crop insurance program. This year, funds were added to this \nlevel to bring a total of $8.2 billion over five years to crop \ninsurance improvements. As a member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I am pleased the legislation I cosponsored and supported \nclosely mirrors the conference report before us today; therefore, I am \npleased to vote for H.R. 2259.\n  Nonetheless, I want to discuss some items in the economic and \ndisaster assistance package included in the conference report. I am \nconcerned that the conference committee ignored the inequity inherent \nwith the current farm bill, and instead, chose to make economic aid \npayments to farmers based on AMTA payments.\n  Even though South Dakota producers stand to receive--in a timely \nfashion--about $158 million in additional AMTA payments within the \neconomic aid package, these payments are unfair to many of the family \nfarmers in my state for a number of reasons.\n  First, AMTA payments are made regardless of whether crop prices are \nhigh or low. I would prefer an approach (in overall farm policy and in \nthe context of disaster aid) that provides targeted, counter-cyclical \nbenefits to family-sized farmers because it would be more market-\noriented and provide a more reliable safety net.\n  Second, since AMTA payments are based on outdated crop yields and \nbase acres from 1985, they are unfair to many South Dakota farmers. In \nthe mid-1980s, farmers in my state planted more grain sorghum and oats \nin combination with the staple crops like wheat, corn, and soybeans. \nBut, all of these crops make up their ``base acres'' upon which an AMTA \npayment is made. As such, farmers in South Dakota may receive AMTA \npayments on low-value crops like oats and grain sorghum that they don't \neven plant today.\n  Moreover, crop yields in the mid-1980s were much lower than crop \nyields today, yet, AMTA payments are based on these outdated crop \nyields. For example, the 1985 corn yield assigned to AMTA payments is \nset at 64 bushels per acre. Yet today, most farmers raise around 100 \nbushels of corn or better. Once again, the AMTA payments fail to \nrecognize modern day farming conditions.\n  Finally, there still exist situations where landlords and not farm \noperators receive the AMTA payments.\n  Last week I sent a letter to Conference Committee Chairmen Lugar and \nCombest insisting that Congress must not alter statutory payment \nlimitations so large farming entities can't swallow up the majority of \ngovernment assistance. Last year, an amendment to the fiscal year 2000 \nAgriculture appropriations bill increased payment limits on loan \ndeficiency payments and marketing loans from $75,000 to $150,000 for \n1999. As a result of this specific change last year, only the largest \nof the large farms stood to benefit. My letter urged the conference \ncommittee members to not extend this special treatment of the payment \nlimits beyond 1999. I am very pleased the conference committee agreed \nto reinstate the more responsible, lower, payment limits for this year. \nFamily farmers are the backbone of rural America. If we have a limited \namount of taxpayer funds in which to provide a safety net for farmers, \nit is simply common sense that we target the benefits to those who need \nthe assistance.\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\n  I also want to mention that there are several items within the \neconomic and disaster aid package that I support, and as such, I will \nvote in favor of this legislation.\n  First, sheep producers in South Dakota have suffered under near all-\ntime low wool prices. To add insult to injury, many of these same \nproducers must try to compete in lamb meat production with unfair and \nsurging imports from other countries. I am especially pleased the \nconference committee agreed to provide $11 million in fiscal year 2001 \nto provide direct payments to sheep producers based on poor wool \nprices.\n  Second, as a strong advocate of farmer-owned value-added \ncooperatives, I am extremely satisfied to support the inclusion of $15 \nmillion worth of competitive grants in fiscal year 2001 to assist \nproducers in establishing these types of business ventures.\n  Because flooding remains an obstacle to crop production in many parts \nof South Dakota, I am pleased to support the $24 million in the \nconference report for the Flooded Lands Compensation Program.\n  I am also pleased this legislation offers honey producers in South \nDakota and across the nation a recourse loan program to help provide a \nsafety net and price support in order to market their product.\n  Finally, I am pleased the conference committee included provisions \nfrom my legislation--S. 2056, The Emergency Commodity Distribution Act \nof 2000--which restores funding to USDA in order to procure commodities \nfor the School Lunch Program over a nine year period.\n  Last year, Congress enacted the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \nImprovement Act. A provision of this legislation amended the School \nLunch Act to require USDA to count the value of ``bonus'' commodities \nwhen it determines the total amount of commodity assistance provided to \nschools. This change will result in a $500 million budget cut for the \nSchool Lunch Program over a nine-year period without congressional \naction this year. While not large in overall budget terms, this cut \nwill have an immediate impact that is especially severe in school \ndistricts more dependent on the program.\n  My legislation would ensure that schools receive the full value of \nentitlement commodity assistance, and allow the School Lunch Program to \ncontinue to meet its dual purpose of supporting American agriculture \nwhile providing nutritious food to children across the country. While \nthe provision included in today's legislation provides $34 million in \nfiscal year 2000 and $76 million in fiscal year 2001, it does not \nrestore the entire $500 million over the nine-year period. However, I \nam greatly pleased the conferees agreed to include part of my \nlegislation in the conference report as this represents a step in the \nright direction.\n  I also encouraged the conference committee to consider inclusion of \nmy bills to forbid packer ownership of livestock and to label meat for \nits country-of-origin.\n  My legislation enjoys broad support all across the nation because it \nwill restore confidence and freedom in livestock markets. I am \ndisappointed the committee failed to include either of these items as \nit will once again become clear that Congress largely ignored the \nindependent livestock producer trying to compete in an unfair \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank Senators \nKerrey, Daschle, and Roberts who have worked to craft a national crop \ninsurance reform bill. I rise in support of the Conference Report \nbecause it represents a fundamental shift in farm policy in its \nrecognition of the importance of agriculture in the Northeast.\n  Historically, New Jersey farmers have been at a disadvantage when it \ncomes to crop insurance for two principle reasons. First, many of the \nspecialty crops they grow are not eligible for insurance. And second, \nbecause our region has a history of non-participation, many farmers \nfail to investigate what options they may be eligible for. They simply \nassume that they are not eligible or that the programs are not \neconomically worthwhile.\n  Without crop insurance, farmers in my region will not be able to \ncontinue farming, they will be forced out of a way of life, they will \nbe forced to sell their land. New Jersey may be the best example of \nwhat can happen when we do not protect our farmers. In 1959, New Jersey \nhad 15,800 farms. Today we have 9,400. In 1959, New Jersey had \n1,460,000 acres of farmland. Today we have but 800,000.\n  The current Federal Crop Insurance program has failed to curb the \nlosses which farmers have experienced and has forced them to sell their \nland and their livelihood. It has facilitated the end of a way of life \nin New Jersey.\n  When the Senate passed its version of the crop insurance reform bill, \nit adopted the so-called ``Northeast Amendment'' drafted by myself, \nSenator Schumer, Leahy, Reed, Rockefeller and others. The amendment has \nbeen almost entirely preserved in the Conference Report. The amendment \nis targeted at increasing participation in states in which there is \ntraditionally, and continues to be, a low level of crop insurance \nparticipation and availability.\n  The conference report provides $50 million over five years for \nresearch to create new crop insurance policies. The goal is to develop \nnew programs tailored to the crops in our region so that our farmers \nwill find it economically worthwhile.\n  An additional $25 million over five years for education programs \ndesigned to inform farmers of the current crop insurance options \navailable to them. This would include hiring more agents to sell \ninsurance and more USDA officials to help farmers craft a strategy for \ntheir farm. This money will put in place the necessary human \ninfrastructure.\n  The final provision of the Northeast amendment is $50 million over \nfive years for payments to farmers who adopt certain conservation \npractices. The effect of this amendment will be to increase \nparticipation, by making it more attractive, more affordable, and more \naccessible to farmers who grow specialty crops and have low rates of \nparticipation in crop insurance.\n  But the Conference Report also vastly improves the situation for \nfarmers who grow non-insurable crops by improving the Non-insured Crop \nDisaster Assistance Program (NAP). Because farmers who grow the \nmajority of crops in my state do not qualify for crop insurance, the \nNAP program is the only assistance my farmers can rely on when their \ncrops are decimated, as during last summer's drought. Under current \nlaw, losses in the region where a farmer grows must be extensive before \na single farmer is eligible for NAP relief. The Conference Report \nremoves this ``area trigger'' and ensures that farmers not eligible for \ncrop insurance receive protection in times of hardship, regardless of \nwhether they are the only farmer who suffered.\n  The Conference Report also addresses the needs of states like New \nJersey by including additional provisions to develop broad specialty \ncrop policies. These policies are designed to protect farmers who grow \n``specialty crops'', fruits and vegetables which constitute many of the \ncrops grown in the Northeast. By focusing on specialty crop product \ndevelopment, the bill truly addresses the needs of farmers in all \nregions throughout the country. Because of these provisions, I will \nsupport the bill and will urge my other Northeast colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  However, I am extremely concerned that the $7.1 billion in emergency \nfarm aid included in this bill essentially provides no relief to our \nregion. The majority of this funding will be distributed in AMTA \npayments to farmers in the Midwest and South who grow commodity crops \nsuch as corn, soybeans, and wheat. It will not help the specialty crop \nfarmers in New Jersey or anywhere else in the Northeast. This is \nunfortunate, considering that the farmers in my state are still \nsuffering from last summer's drought.\n  The Senate will soon have another opportunity to provide this \ndesperately needed relief when it considers the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill after Memorial Day. As written, this bill includes \nadditional aid for dairy farmers, livestock and peanut farmers. But it \nstill fails to address the situation faced by small family farmers \nthroughout the Northeast. During consideration of that bill, I plan on \noffering an amendment with my colleagues from the Northeast that will \nprovide some relief for the specialty crop farmers in our\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nregion. I hope at the time we will enjoy the support of the other \nregions of the country who so generously are benefitting from the \nemergency aid included in this crop insurance bill.\n  Again, I want to thank Senators Kerrey, Roberts, Daschle, Harkin and \nLeahy for their willingness to work with us during this process.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend many of my \ncolleagues who were instrumental in the development of this \nlegislation. The conference report before us today represents new \nopportunities for family farmers through a reformed crop insurance \nprogram and short term assistance in the form of an additional economic \nrelief payment equivalent to the levels established last year.\n  The conference report before us today provides Congress with an \nopportunity to assist farmers during this time of need. My friends and \nneighbors just came off a year in which they lost tremendous amounts of \nequity due to commodity prices hitting twenty year lows. If we would \nnot have provided an economic relief payment last year we would have \nlost many more family farmers.\n  What does a strong agricultural economy mean for my home state of \nIowa? The agricultural industry contributes a total of around $70 \nbillion and 446,000 jobs in Iowa. Therefore, when things are in bad \nshape down on the farm, all Iowans feel the negative economic effects.\n  While commodity prices have improved slightly from last year, margins \nare still tight. We promised our constituents a smooth transition from \nthe failed, government-dominated farm policies of the last 63 year \nperiod prior to 1996. We must follow through on that promise, and this \nlegislation helps us fulfill that goal.\n  This bill provides tremendous opportunities for farmers. The Crop \nInsurance title helps farmers utilize additional risk management \nactivities. Farmers can increase their individual coverage levels \nthanks to better premium subsidies. And for the first time, pilot \nprograms will be available to determine how livestock producers can be \nincluded as an insurable commodity.\n  I also want to thank the members of the Senate Budget Committee in \nsupporting my efforts earlier this year in crafting a budget resolution \nwhich set aside over $15 billion to help farmers. The bill before us \ntoday would not have been possible otherwise. The Budget Committee's \nwork and cooperation allowed the Agriculture Committee to supply \nfarmers with the funds necessary for the smooth transition farmers \ndeserve by providing what is viewed as an additional AMTA payment at \n1999 levels.\n  The package also includes $500 million for oilseeds, $7 million to \ncover pseudorabies vaccination costs incurred by pork producers, and \n$15 million for what I have termed the Agricultural Marketing Equity \nCapital Fund.\n  The Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund will provide $10 \nmillion to establish grants for developing new value-added agricultural \nmarkets for independent producers. This fund will assist agricultural \nproducers by providing grants for ventures to capture a greater share \nof the consumer food dollar.\n  It is my hope that the fund will help independent grain and livestock \nproducers find real solutions to address the loss of competition in \nagricultural markets, to combat concentration in food production and \nprocessing, and create new value-added business opportunities for \ngroups like:\n  The Iowa Cattlemen, who are developing a regional ``grid'' of \nproducers to supply cattle to a proposed harvest facility being \ndeveloped with the cooperation of one of the nation's largest \nprocessors;\n  Heartland Grain Fuels, a group of grain producers who have banded \ntogether in Huron, South Dakota to develop an ethanol facility;\n  Iowa Premium Pork, a group of 1,400 pork producers across my home \nstate which have joined together in a cooperative venture to market \ntheir hogs;\n  Sunrise Energy, an ethanol plant in Blairstown, Iowa;\n  The 21st Century Group, independent dairy producers from Kansas;\n  Pork America, a national cooperative of independent pork producers; \nand\n  The New Jersey Farm Bureau, which recently commissioned a study to \ndetermine the feasibility of ethanol production and held a meeting at \nwhich 300 New Jersey farmers attended due to their interest in value-\nadded opportunities.\n  An informal poll by my office found hundreds of millions of dollars \nin possible requests for this type of program. The reason for this is \nthat family farmers cannot compete with an industry that has billions \nof dollars in equity and capital resources and which seems to be \nwilling to use this advantage to kill any producer driven competition.\n  Industry's aggressive stance toward competition from farmers made it \nimpossible for me to provide more money for independent producers. In \nfact, the American Meat Institute, which is the political muscle behind \n70 percent of the packers and processors in the US, fought against this \nprovision tooth and nail.\n  When I found out that AMI was opposing my efforts to help farmers I \nknew that I must be doing something right. I just want the leadership \nof AMI to know that I was very aware of his efforts and I hope that \nAMI's successful opposition to my request for $35 million to help \nAmerica's family farmers was worth it to them.\n  I plan to publish AMI's membership in the record and I hope that \nevery independent producer in the nation takes a good look at who is \ntrying to limit value-added opportunities for family farmers. I'm not \nsaying that every processor or packer knew exactly what AMI's \nWashington lobbyists were doing, but I sure hope to inform every \nmember, through one medium or another, what happened and why \nindependent producers won't have the funds to reach out to processors \nin joint ventures and receive working capital to help everyone survive \nand thrive.\n  One last point, if you thought I was pushing hard for my agri-\nindustry concentration legislation before, hold on to your seat.\n  Regardless of my disappointment in industry's effort to kill my \nprovision, on the whole, this bill includes a bold new approach that \nwill help create a brighter future for family farmers and their rural \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, in summation I want to thank my colleagues on the Ag \nCommittee who worked hard to develop this package. This bill is good \nfor Iowa and good for agriculture and the family farmer nationwide. I \nlook forward to sending it to the President and for the President to \nsign it quickly so that we may provide family farmers with the tools \nthey need to be successful in today's marketplace.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today we are considering the conference \nreport on the crop insurance reform bill. I believe this bill makes \nfundamental changes to the existing Federal Crop Insurance Program that \nare necessary to make crop insurance more workable and affordable for \nproducers across the country and I urge its passage.\n  Congress has been attempting to eliminate the ad hoc disaster program \nfor years because it is not the most efficient way of helping our \nfarmers who suffer yield losses. Due to the Ag economic crisis, there \nhas been much discussion lately on the issue of the ``safety net'' for \nour nation's producers. On that point I would like to be perfectly \nclear. Crop insurance is a risk management tool to help producers guard \nagainst yield loss. It was not created and was never intended to be the \nend-all be-all solution for the income needs of our nation's producers.\n  Last year, Senator Cochran and I introduced a comprehensive bill that \naddressed what we saw as the various reform needs of the crop insurance \nprogram.\n  I am pleased that many of these provisions are included in the \nconference report that we are considering here today. This bill \nestablishes a process for re-evaluating crop insurance rates for all \ncrops and for lowering those rates if warranted. After pressure from \nCongress and the National Cotton Council last year, RMA reduced rates \nby as much as 50 percent for cotton in Arkansas and the Mid-South. The \nprovision included in today's bill will require further review of all \nSouthern commodities.\n  By making the crop insurance program more affordable, additional \nproducers will be encouraged to participate in the program and protect \nthemselves against the unforeseeable factors that will be working \nagainst them once they put a crop into the ground.\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\n  The bill also provides for an enhanced subsidy structure so that \nproducers are encouraged to buy-up from their current level of \ncoverage. The structure included in this bill will make the step from \ncatastrophic coverage to buy-up easier for producers and will make \nobtaining the highest level of coverage easier for those who are \nalready participating in the crop insurance program.\n  In an attempt to improve the record keeping process within USDA, this \nlegislation requires that FSA and RMA coordinate their record keeping \nactivities. Current USDA record keeping, split between FSA and RMA, is \nredundant and insufficient. By including both crop insurance program \nparticipants and non-program participants in the process, we hope to \nenhance the agricultural data held by the agency and make acreage and \nyield reporting less of a hassle for already overburdened producers.\n  In addition, this bill establishes a role for consultation with state \nFSA committees in the introduction of new coverage to a state. The need \nfor this provision was made abundantly clear to Arkansas' rice \nproducers this spring. A private insurance policy was offered to \nfarmers at one rate, only to have the company reduce the rate once the \namount of potential exposure was realized.\n  In my discussions with various executives from the company on this \nissue it became apparent that their knowledge of the rice industry was \nfairly minimal. Had they consulted with local FSA committees who had a \nworking knowledge of the rice industry before introduction of the \npolicy, the train wreck that occurred might have been stopped in its \ntracks.\n  I am pleased that another reform measure that I worked on has been \nincluded to help rice producers suffering losses caused by drought. \nRecent droughts have left many Arkansas farmers with low reservoirs and \ndepleting aquifers. If rains do not replenish them, an adequate \nirrigation supply may not exist by summer.\n  In addition, drought conditions in Louisiana have caused salt to \nintrude into the water supply used for irrigation on many farms. \nCurrent law states that rice is excluded from drought policies because \nit is irrigated. This is not equitable since rice producers do suffer \nlosses due to drought.\n  I have worked with Senators Breaux and Landrieu to provide these \npolicies for our rice producers who are experiencing reduced irrigation \nopportunities due to the severe drought conditions that have plagued \nthe South for the last two years. I am pleased that this provision has \nbeen included in the bill.\n  Many of the problems associated with the crop insurance program have \nbeen addressed in previous reform measures. However, fraud and abuses \nare still present to some degree.\n  This bill strengthens the monitoring of agents and adjusters to \ncombat fraud and enhances the penalties available to USDA for \ncompanies, agents and producers who engage in fraudulent activities.\n  There is simply no room for bad actors that recklessly cost the \ntaxpayers money.\n  Mr. President, I was prepared during our Committee markup earlier \nthis year to offer an amendment related to a cooperative's role in the \ndelivery of crop insurance.\n  I held off at that time due to concerns from the Committee related to \npossible ``rebating'' ramifications and preemption of state law, but in \nworking with RMA and Senators Kerrey and Grassley, we were able to \ncraft an amendment that clarifies the role of cooperatives in the crop \ninsurance program.\n  I am pleased that the conferees included this amendment in the final \nversion of the bill.\n  This amendment does nothing to preempt state law or even change \ncurrent federal law. It simply provides that current approved business \npractices be maintained. With the inclusion of my amendment Congress is \nrecognizing the valuable role cooperatives play in the crop insurance \nprogram, specifically, encouraging producer participation in the crop \ninsurance program, improving the delivery system for crop insurance, \nand helping to develop new and improved insurance products.\n\n  My amendment requires the Risk Management Agency to finalize \nregulations that would incorporate the currently approved business \npractices of cooperatives participating in the crop insurance program \nand to do so within 180 days of enactment of this Act.\n  If farmer owned entities are not allowed to sell crop insurance, then \nanyone can sell crop insurance in America except an American farmer. \nSuch a legal result would give the appearance that crop insurance is \ndesigned for a closed club to exploit farmers.\n  That appearance would inhibit broader use of crop insurance. I do not \nbelieve that such a result is the intent of those who have put so much \neffort into improving the crop insurance program.\n  Mr. President, I would personally like to thank all staff members of \nthe Committee and industry representatives that have helped with this \neffort. I would particularly like to thank Louie Perry of the National \nCotton Council for his tireless efforts to make crop insurance more \neffective for cotton and other southern commodities.\n  Mr. President, Arkansas farmers have told me time and time again that \ncrop insurance just isn't affordable for the amount of coverage they \nreceive. As the program currently exists, it does not make sound \nbusiness sense to purchase crop insurance in our state. Since this \nreform process began, I've been working to correct this inequity. I \nhope that the changes we make today will lead to a crop insurance \nprogram that is equitable, affordable and effective.\n  Crop insurance reform is not the only thing included in this \nlegislation, however. $7.1 billion has been included to address the \nongoing crisis in the agricultural community due to depressed market \nprices. I am pleased that Congress is acting more promptly this year to \naddress the needs of our nation's producers. Numerous farmers in my \nhome state of Arkansas have indicated that the additional assistance we \nprovided over the last two years is the only reason their operations \nare still afloat today. While some commodities have seen a slight \nrebound, prices across the board are still too low to meet the \nincreasing costs of production on our nation's farms.\n  Congress has to provide these ``add on'' payments to producers \nbecause the current farm bill does not provide an adequate safety net \nwhen commodity markets head south. I voted against the 1996 Farm Bill \nbecause I feared that we would find ourselves in the exact position we \ndo today, with one bailout after another.\n  I introduced a bill earlier this year that would make reforms to the \nexisting marketing loan program. An enhanced marketing loan program \nwould provide additional assistance to our nation's producers without \ngoing through this annual ``horse trading'' over billions of dollars \ntrying to determine who we are going to help. Farmers would be able to \nknow at the beginning of the growing season what to expect from the \ngovernment with regards to economic assistance instead of having to \ncross their fingers and hope Congress comes through.\n  We are coming near the end of the life of the ``Freedom to Farm'' \nbill and as we begin discussions on what the next farm bill should look \nlike I hope my colleagues will see the importance of providing an \nadequate safety net to our nation's farms.\n  We must adequately support those who are supplying our nation, and \nmany others, with safe, affordable food.\n  Do not misread my remarks, I am pleased that Congress has acted \npromptly to address the needs of the agricultural community this year. \nI simply feel that there is a better way to approach our nation's \nagricultural policy. I hope my colleagues will agree and work to \nprovide a better farm bill in the future.\n\n\n                            inspection scam\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, I want to briefly raise an issue that is of \nthe utmost importance to produce growers and shippers throughout every \nregion in the United States and of great concern to me and several \nother of my colleagues in both the House and Senate.\n  On October 27, 1999, eight Department of Agriculture (USDA) fruit and \nvegetable inspectors stationed at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in \nthe Bronx, NY, were arrested and charged with accepting bribes for \ndowngrading loads of produce so that receivers could negotiate lower \nprices with shippers. This week, I understand those inspectors were \nsentenced for their illegal\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nand fraudulent scam at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx, \nNew York.\n  While these guilty inspectors are being held accountable through our \nlegal system for their actions, the economic damages to the produce \nindustry remain unaddressed. Moreover, to my knowledge, those \nindividuals with direct oversight responsibility within the United \nStates Department of Agriculture (USDA) have not acknowledged to the \nCongress how their oversight activities failed, why the Department \ndiscounted complaints by the industry over the past several years, the \nnumber of inspections that are connected with the guilty USDA produce \ninspectors or even an estimate of the damages incurred by produce \ngrowers and shippers. This is unacceptable and USDA must act \nexpeditiously to restore confidence and integrity in the federal \ninspection system for the produce industry.\n  If injured parties are not justly compensated through the legal \nprocess, we must ensure that every appropriate action is taken by the \nCongress to ensure the losses that occurred as a result of this scam \nare returned to injured parties. Based on similar cases where fines \npaid by guilty parties have gone directly to the federal Treasury, it \nis very doubtful that growers or shippers injured will see any of the \nfunding owed to them as a result of this unfortunate scam. I am \ncertainly committed to working with the industry on this critical issue \nand urge both the Senate and House Agriculture Committees to take \nimmediate action as soon as possible to move forward with a full \ninvestigation of this matter.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate the remarks by my colleague from Idaho, \nSenator Craig. I agree that the Senate Agriculture Committee should \nreview how these growers can recover their economic losses resulting \nfrom illegal actions by federal employees. The Department of \nAgriculture has oversight responsibility for the actions that may have \nresulted in millions of dollars of losses to these growers. This matter \nshould be fully explored and resolved. As part of committee review, I \nwill continue to receive reports from the office of the Inspector \nGeneral. It is important that this industry regain confidence in the \ninspection system that they use.\n  Mr. President, two provisions of the conference agreement warrant \nsome clarification as to how they should be carried out. Section 243(g) \nallows a third State to expand coverage of the Child and Adult Care \nFood Program to additional for-profit child care centers serving lower-\nincome children. It should be clear to the Secretary in implementing \nthis amendment that the additional State must meet the criteria for \napproval at the time of enactment and is one that exempts all of its \nlower-income families from child care cost-sharing requirements, while \nallowing fees to be charged on a sliding scale to higher-income \nfamilies. Section 243(b)(2) requires that a minimum number of site \nvisits to day care centers, homes, and sponsors be conducted. The \namendment recognizes that the Secretary can strengthen this measure by \nrequiring more than the minimum numbers called for in the amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconference report on H.R. 2559, the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of \n2000. This conference report has two major components: a crop insurance \nreform bill and a major farm relief package. I want to comment briefly \non each of these.\n  I support the crop insurance reform bill because it will increase \npremium subsidies for farmers who buy more comprehensive coverage and \nsupport research of new crop insurance policies for currently non-\ninsurable specialty crops that are important in Rhode Island and other \nstates in the Northeast. It is an important step forward in a long-term \nbipartisan effort to encourage farmers across the country to obtain \nmore crop insurance coverage and reduce income losses due to natural \ndisasters. I was disappointed that the Senate bill's risk management \npilot project was dropped in conference with the House. The pilot \nproject would have allowed farmers to choose between traditional crop \ninsurance and a direct payment for adopting new risk management \npractices such as farm diversification, futures contracts and options, \ncreation of conservation buffers, soil erosion control, and irrigation \nmanagement. I believe we should continue to explore ways to offer \nincreased income to farmers for whom crop insurance has not worked \nwell, while encouraging producers to adopt new risk management \nstrategies that are good for the environment.\n  I am pleased that this crop insurance bill removes the ``area \ntrigger'' for the Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, also \nknown as NAP. I believe broader NAP eligibility is one of the most \neffective ways to assist farmers in the eastern United States who face \nsevere production losses due to drought, floods, or other disasters.\n  Currently, NAP crops are eligible for assistance when: (1) expected \n``Area Yield'' for the crop is reduced by more than 35 percent because \nof natural disaster; and (2) individual crop losses are in excess of 50 \npercent of the individual's approved yield, or the producer is \nprevented from planting more than 35 percent of the acreage intended \nfor the eligible crop.\n  These criteria have proven to be unworkable in many eastern states, \nboth in terms of program accessibility and timeliness of payments. For \nindividual growers of specialty crops, typically grown on small \nacreage, a loss of as little as 20 percent can be devastating, \nespecially given the high per-acre value of these crops. Moreover, the \nprocess of verifying area yield reductions is cumbersome and \nexceedingly time-consuming, resulting in waiting periods of several \nmonths or, in some cases, more than a year for payment.\n  Giving the Secretary of Agriculture broader discretion over delivery \nof NAP program funds will streamline the approval process and make \ndirect assistance available to thousands of farmers whose substantial \nlosses do not meet NAP criteria under the current area trigger.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes $50 million for the \nSecretary of Agriculture to provide cost-share assistance to farmers in \nstates with low historical participation in traditional crop insurance \nprograms. These funds will be targeted to farmers who pursue innovative \nconservation and risk management techniques, including: streambank \nrepairs and reconstruction; integrated pest management tools; \nconstruction or improvement of watershed management structures; \ntransition to organic farming, particularly among dairy farmers; and \nfutures, hedging or options contracts to help reduce production, price \nor revenue risks.\n  Substantial funds are also included for crop insurance education and \ninformation programs for states with low levels of federal crop \ninsurance participation and availability. Combining expanded outreach \nprograms like these with increased research into new policies for \nspecialty crops is the best way to get more farmers into the program \nand hopefully reduce the need for farm disaster legislation.\n\n  With regard to the farm relief component of the conference report \nbefore us today, I am disappointed that the entire $5.5 billion of the \npackage's FY2000 funds, fully 77% of the $7.1 billion provided in this \nfarm assistance package, consists of additional AMTA or ``Freedom to \nFarm'' payments. Only a very small proportion of farmers in my state \nand in other Northeastern states will benefit from these payments. \nMeanwhile, additional AMTA payments will be made to many other farmers \nregardless of whether they have experienced substantial losses during \nthe current crop year.\n  I and many of my colleagues from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic \nopposed the farm disaster bill passed by the Senate last year because \nit did not provide adequate relief to farmers in our region who were \nhit by the terrible drought conditions of 1999. The National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that four states in the \nNortheast, including Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware, \nexperienced the driest growing season in their histories. From April \nthrough July, Rhode Island was the driest it has been in 105 years of \nrecord-keeping by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center.\n  Forecasters at the National Weather Service are predicting continued \ndrought conditions this year, because we are starting out with a \ndeficit of rainfall and, even with the snowstorms of January, winter \nprecipitation was 3.5 inches below normal for our region.\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\n  Fortunately, the removal of the NAP area trigger I described earlier \nwill help if disaster strikes again this year. In addition, the farm \nrelief package includes $200 million for purchases of specialty crops \nfor low prices in 1998 and 1999, including apples, cranberries, black-\neyed peas, cherries, citrus, onions, melons, peaches, and potatoes. \nManager language is included to direct the Secretary of Agriculture, to \nthe extent practicable, to purchase directly from farmers or \nagricultural co-ops.\n  Another $5 million is provided by the farm relief package for apple \nproducers that are suffering economic loss as a result of low prices. \n$35 million is provided for Loan Deficiency Payments for non-AMTA farms \nfor the 2000 crop year, and $50 million is provided for the Farmland \nProtection Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, \nboth of which are important to my state and the Northeastern region of \nthe country. Finally, the farm relief package requires the Department \nof Agriculture to purchase specialty crop farm products for the school \nlunch program, again with manager language included to direct the \nSecretary, to the extent practicable, to purchase directly from farmers \nor agricultural co-ops.\n  With the passage of this legislation we will give farmers the tools \nthey need to manage their risk more effectively, and possibly reduce \nthe need for Congress to pass massive farm disaster packages year after \nyear. At the same time, I believe we are beginning to recognize the \ncontributions and needs of farmers in every region of the country, \nfarmers who not only feed the world but preserve a way of life that \nmakes our Nation stronger and protects our precious open spaces from \nthe encroachment of development and urban sprawl.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report to accompany \nthe Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000.\n\n\n     submitting changes to h. con. res. 290 pursuant to section 216\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, section 216 of H. Con.

Mr. President, today we address two issues vital to our \nNation's farmers and ranchers: the need to reform the Federal Crop \nInsurance Program, and the need for financial relief to help producers \ndeal with the third year in a row of low prices.\n  I support this Crop Insurance conference report, and I will vote for \nit. But I must also express my deep concerns about the farm relief \nprovisions of the bill.\n  Half of this bill represents Congress at its best.\n  Last year Congress was given a mandate to improve the federal crop \ninsurance program--both by the strength of public support for reform, \nand by the Budget Committee's allocation of $6 billion last year and $8 \nbillion this year expressly to implement that reform.\n  Half of this bill responds to that call, and offers increased \nbenefits to farmers. Those benefits are well-conceived, and they are \nequitable.\n  The program invests public resources in a system that effectively \nleverages funds in the private sector, and empowers producers to use \ntheir own best judgment in managing their production risk.\n  I want to thank my colleagues and their staffs, who have dedicated \nlong hours over the past year, for their excellent work in reforming \nthis vital program.\n  However, I believe that the other half of this bill represents a low \nmoment for Congress.\n  The other half of this bill represents, for the third year in a row, \nCongress' stubborn refusal to address another significant risk of \nfarming: price risk.\n  Across the country, and for numerous commodities, poor prices have \ndogged producers for three years now.\n  The $7.1 billion in this bill that will go to producers as ad hoc \nemergency relief is critically needed in the countryside. We should be \nproviding resources to struggling farmers and ranchers.\n  But I am deeply disappointed with the way the funds are distributed.\n  Clearly, it would have been impossible to perfectly match resources \nto need--particularly under the time constraints we face.\n  But we could have done better than this.\n  This year could have been different than the past two years. \nProducers pleaded with Congress to make it different, and it should \nhave been different.\n  First, by including the relief allocation in the Budget resolution, \nthe Budget Committee allowed Congress to avoid the rancorous fight over \nemergency spending authorization that has plagued us in the past two \nyears.\n  Second, in contrast to the previous two years, this year the \nAgriculture Committee was made the arbiter of how the funding would be \nallocated.\n  This should have resulted in hearings and the kind of substantive, \nconstructive debate that yields good policy.\n  Third, Congress was given a deadline of June 29 by which to determine \nhow to spend this money, which provided more than adequate time for \nsuch a debate to occur.\n  Despite all of these advantages, here we are, a month early, with a \nbill produced in the very same way as the two emergency relief bills \nthat preceded it--behind closed doors, without the free and open \nexchange of ideas, and without the opportunity for amendments by \nmembers on behalf of their constituents.\n  So, we are left with farm relief that I and many of my colleagues \nbelieve is deeply flawed. Once again, our assistance fails to target \nfamily farmers.\n\n  Once again, it wastes public dollars on the biggest operators, who \nhave little or no need for emergency relief.\n  Once again, it wastes public dollars on some people who do not farm \nat all.\n  Most importantly--once again--it fails to meet critical needs in farm \ncountry.\n  With over $7 billion at our disposal, Agriculture Committee \njurisdiction, and time for debate, not one hearing has been held to \nassess the scope of need.\n  A flawed process has produced a flawed bill. But because farmers and \nranchers are in need of relief, I intend to vote for the conference \nreport.\n  For the third year in a row, I urge my colleagues to acknowledge the \nfailures of current farm policy, and come together to change it.\n  We need policies that better address the interests of family farmers \nand ranchers.\n  In addition to crop insurance, fair trade, and competitive \nopportunities for all producers, farmers and ranchers must have an \nincome safety-net that can offset severe price fluctuations, and that \ncan help manage uncertainties in the marketplace.\n  Such policies are critical to long-term survival in an industry in \nwhich the majority of producers operate on margins of less than 5 \npercent.\n  I believe there is a lot we can agree on.\n  And by working together, in the spirit of the crop insurance portion \nof this bill, I am certain that there is a lot we can accomplish.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000. Farmers in \nWisconsin and all across the country need improved risk management \nproducts to\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\nhelp them guard against adverse weather and market conditions. I also \nwant to express my thanks to Chairman Lugar, Senator Harkin, and other \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee for including in this conference \nreport expansion of a dairy options pilot program that will help dairy \nfarmers achieve similar levels of protection afforded other \nagricultural producers.\n  I also want to mention the fact that this conference report includes \n$7.1 billion in additional assistance to farmers and ranchers this year \nand in 2001. This level of spending was made possible due to a budget \nreserve included in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution which \nprovided an additional $5.5 billion in mandatory spending to the \nAgriculture Committee in fiscal year 2000 and an additional $1.6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001. The budget resolution specified that these \nfunds were to be made available to assistance producers of program and \nspecial crops. Senator Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, made reference to the action taken by both the Budget and \nAgriculture Committees in providing for this budgeted approach to \nmeeting the needs of America's farmers.\n  I want to take this opportunity to mention additional assistance for \nfarmers provided in the pending Agriculture appropriations bill which \nincludes, among other items, emergency spending for America's dairy \nfarmers. Senators will note that within the additional $7.1 billion \nincluded in the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, no funds are \nprovided for dairy farmers who are now suffering from the greatest \nprice collapse in history. Dairy farmers in Wisconsin, in Vermont, in \nthe South, in the West, in all parts of the nation are suffering \nterribly from this dire emergency and it is proper that the Congress \ntake action, as we have, to meet this situation.\n  I mention this in order to remind my colleagues that we will shortly \nbe considering the Agriculture appropriations bill on the Senate Floor \nand I ask for the support of all Senators in our efforts to help \nAmerica's dairy farmers. I would also note that to those who may be \nconfusing the funding provided in our bill with the amount provided in \nthe budget resolution, that dairy producers were not included in the \ndescription of agricultural producers to receive assistance though the \nagricultural budget reserve directed to the authorizing committee. The \nemergency funding for dairy farmers is separate from the actions taken \nin the bill now before the Senate, is indeed an emergency, and the \naction taken by the Appropriations Committee in this regard is proper \nand must go forward.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, our colleagues have suggested that if \nSenators are amenable to yielding back time, at least in this instance, \nwe might proceed to a vote, with the understanding that provision might \nbe made for additional time for comments by Senators on this \nlegislation. There would appear, at least to the ranking member and \nmyself, to be no visible opposition.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have no problem with yielding time. I have to go to my \ndaughter's recital. If I can speak after the vote for 5 minutes, I \nwould appreciate that.\n  Mr. LUGAR. We have been trying to accommodate our side. They were \naware we might have another hour of debate, but in the event that the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Minnesota are \nprepared to yield back all time, I would be prepared to do that.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator will yield, I would like to comment \nfor the Record, also.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield back the time yielded to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nconference report.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to take just 1 minute to thank the \nstaffs who have made this event possible. From my own staff: The chief \nof staff Keith Luse, Dave Johnson, Terry Nintemann, Andy Morton, \nMichael Knipe, Carol Dubard, Bob White, Danny Spellacy, Jeff Burnam, \nMarcia Asquith, and Bob Sturm;\n  From Senator Harkin's staff, who worked with us so well: Mark \nHalverson and Stephanie Mercier;\n  From Senator Roberts' staff: Mike Seyfert;\n  From Senator Cochran's staff: Hunt Shipman;\n  From Senator Helms' staff: George Holding and Brian Meyers;\n  From Senator Coverdell's staff: Richard Gupton and Alex Albert;\n  From Senator Kerrey's staff: Bev Paul;\n  From Senator Leahy's staff: Ed Barron and Melody Burkins;\n  From Senator Conrad's staff: Scott Carlson;\n  From the Legislative Counsel's staff: Gary Endicott and Greg Kostka;\n  And from the House Agriculture staffs, who worked for 3 weeks \ncontinuously with our Senate staff: Bill O'Conner, chief of that staff; \nTom Sell; Vernie Hubert; and Chip Conley.\n  I thank again the distinguished ranking member.\n  I earlier mentioned especially Senator Roberts and Senator Kerrey as \nauthors of an excellent crop insurance legislation bill, and Senator \nCraig who has offered titles IV and V. I thank the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, and minority leader, Senator Daschle, for expediting our \nhaving this opportunity.\n  Finally, I thank all Senators for a decisive vote on what I believe \nis significant legislation for America's farmers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished chairman, \nthanking all the staff who worked so hard on this and hammered out all \nthe agreements over a long period of time on both sides of the aisle. \nAll the Members of our committee and their staffs did a great job. I \njoin our distinguished chairman in thanking them.\n  Let me also thank our chairman, our leader, Senator Lugar, for his \npersistence and doggedness in getting this bill through. I think it has \nbeen at least 1\\1/2\\ years, if I am not mistaken, since we started on \nthis road. It has had a lot of twists and turns and ups and downs.\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\n Senator Lugar stayed in there. He knew how important this bill was to \nour farmers. It is a great bill. It is one that is really going to help \nour farmers manage their risks.\n  I again compliment him and thank him for his leadership but also for \nbeing so kind and generous, to always work with me and be open and \naboveboard. I have never had an instance where I thought in any way \nthat my chairman was ever keeping anything hidden, going behind the \ndoor or anything such as that. It has been a great working \nrelationship. I thank my friend and my chairman for having that kind of \ngood working relationship with this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will take a few seconds. Earlier in my \nstatement I said very nice things, as they deserved, about the \nchairman, ranking member, and their staffs and every other staff member \nof the Agriculture Committee except for one. That was the person who \nwrote the statement I was reading earlier on the floor. So I want to \njust take a moment to thank Bev Paul for all the work she did on this \npiece of legislation. I appreciate very much Senator Harkin, you and \nLeader Daschle, trusting me enough to put me on the \nconference committee. I appreciate Bev's contribution to it.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the distinguished manager will just yield \nfor an observation? It will not take long.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say hearty thanks to the U.S. \nSenate for passing the budget resolution that contemplated this issue \nand this problem and this solution. Normally, in years past on \nagriculture emergencies, we have waited until the end of the year and \ngotten into an enormous argument as to how much emergency relief is \nenough emergency relief. This year we decided, in the budget \nresolution, with the help of some experts and the committee, to decide \nthat we would modify the resolution that applies to this year and \nprovide $5.5 billion in this year's budget to be spent by the \nauthorizing committee from a reserve fund set up by the Budget \nCommittee and $1.6 billion for next year, all of which could be used \nfor emergency purposes by the authorizing committee if they chose.\n  They have chosen to follow that to the letter: $5.5 billion this year \nand $1.6 billion next year. We have provided in advance a pretty good \npackage, as my colleagues have said, on emergency relief.\n  I am not the expert. I am not here vouching for every item in the \nbill, but I am suggesting it is good to recognize that we had the \nforesight this time in advance to devise a prescription for the \nsolution of what I think is most of the emergency relief that is going \nto be sought for farmers. There may be others in other bills. I thank \neveryone for living under that resolution and under that format. I \nthank the experts who told us this is a pretty good package, and we \nprovided for it in advance. It turned out to be a pretty good dollar \nnumber that provides a rather substantial amount of relief.\n  In addition, we have had budgeted for quite sometime money for crop \ninsurance. It has been languishing until now. It is high time a \nsolution to that has been tailored, and now they are together. There is \n$7.1 billion of emergency assistance, and it is prescribed by the \nbudgets we have voted for heretofore.\n  I commend those who have lived within those margins. I do hope the \nfarmers of America understand that we have prescribed a very large \npackage here, in addition to the regular appropriations bill that comes \nthrough, and we may have additional arguments on how much additional \nemergency money might be provided, if any.\n  I do believe this is a good example of doing it right for a change. \nWe did it right from the very start, and now we are seeing the fruits \nof some good thinking in advance to avoid conflict at the end of the \nyear.\n  Mr. President, while the spending in this conference report does not \nviolate the budget, and again I congratulate the authors for following \nthose spending guidelines, I must be honest in saying that some \nprovisions in Title II of this conference report concern me. When the \nBudget Committee established the $7.1 billion funding to assist \nproducers of program crops and specialty crops, I can assure you that \nat least this Senator did not envision some of the types of indirect \nassistance to producers this bill provides. Nonetheless the bulk of \nassistance will go directly to producers and provide some relief to \nthose now suffering depressed farm incomes.\n  Finally, it must be said, that once this $5.5 billion in Agriculture \nMarketing Transition Act, AMTA, payments are made this year, total \nCommodity Credit Corporation, CCC, outlays for FY 2000 may exceed $30 \nbillion--a historic record level of spending. Just for the calendar \nyear 2000, direct payments to producers will exceed $21.6 billion--\nanother record. It is also understood that when we return from the \nMemorial Day recess, the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill may be \nbefore the Senate, and it to may contain additional emergency spending \nfor the current fiscal year.\n  At a time when the U.S. Congress and the European Parliament are \nfocused on agriculture trade issues, and the level of subsidies being \nprovided on both sides of the Atlantic, I think it is important to take \na step back and make sure we all understand what assistance is being \nprovided in this bill to agriculture.\n  I will support this conference agreement today. But I hope that \nanother bill the Senate may consider after the recess--the PNTR China \nbill--will provide expanded markets for our agriculture sector and \nthereby lessen the need for future agriculture subsidies. Most farmers \nand ranchers I know want to and will produce for the market given a \nchance. They do not want and should not want to ``farm'' government \nsubsidies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lugar, \nSenator Harkin, and all the conferees for their hard work in producing \na fair final crop insurance package that will provide $100 million in \ntargeted programs for Northeastern farmers who have struggled in recent \nyears, facing low prices and severe damage by drought, flooding, and \nfreezing.\n  Speaking on behalf of the farmers of New York State, I especially \nthank my esteemed colleague, Senator Pat Leahy, and his hardworking \nstaff--Ed Barron, J.P. Dowd, and Melody Burkins--for their creativity \nand persistence in defending the interests of our region which have all \ntoo often been neglected in agricultural debates.\n  Back in March, I joined Senators Pat Leahy, Bob Torricelli, and Jack \nReed in a spirited and successful effort to amend this bill to include, \nfor the first time in the history of crop insurance, funds targeted \nspecifically to help our region.\n  Northeastern farmers have historically low participation in crop \ninsurance for several reasons. Many grow speciality crops that are not \neligible for Federal crop insurance, or find that, while they are \neligible, the Federal crop insurance programs do not fit their needs. \nMany are simply not aware of available crop insurance options or have \nno agents located nearby to sell them policies.\n  The results have often been catastrophic. When a disaster such as \nlast summer's drought strikes, our farmers have no safety net to fall \nback on, unlike so many of their Midwestern and Southern counterparts.\n  As such, these provisions--a $50 million program to promote risk \nmanagement practices tailored to Northeastern farmers, $25 million for \ncrop insurance education and recruitment targeted at areas \ntraditionally underserved by crop insurance, and $25 million for \nresearch into better crop insurance programs for the Northeast--will go \na long way to helping the farmers of New England and the Mid-Atlantic \nregion.\n  Our farmers will especially benefit from the removal of the area \ntrigger for crop insurance policies. This will benefit farmers located \nin areas isolated by valleys or mountains by allowing them to collect \ncrop insurance for their localized disasters.\n  Further, specialty crop farmers, as so many of the fruit and \nvegetables growers in New York State, will benefit from the $200 \nmillion USDA purchase of speciality crops as directed in the emergency \nagriculture package attached to this bill.\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n  I also echo Senator Leahy's remarks on our understanding of the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, which we have been assured will \ncontain several additional critical provisions, particularly the \nassistance for our Nation's dairy farmers who have suffered terribly \nfrom low prices, and for apple farmers who have been hard hit by low \nyields and low quality after 2 years of unavoidable weather extremes, \nfrom hurricanes to drought.\n  I have visited regularly with dairy and apple farmers in my own State \nand can say they desperately need our help.\n  I thank, once again, the conferees for crafting a bill that for the \nfirst time truly takes into account the unique needs of Northeastern \nfarmers. I voted for the package, and I am glad so many of my fellow \nSenators voted for it as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4443-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAT ROONEY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to a \nbusinessman who has witnessed the transformation of a company from a \nsingle plant operation into a multinational corporation. The \nbusinessman I am referring to is Pat Rooney, who is retiring on June \n3rd after almost 45 years of service to Cooper Tire and Rubber Company. \nMr. Rooney began his career with Cooper Tire in 1956 as a sales \ntrainee. In 1994, Pat Rooney was elected CEO and Chairman of the Board \nof Cooper Tire. That hierarchical progression is astounding. In this \nday and time with the ever changing economy, it is almost hard to \nfathom someone working for one employer for four and a half decades. \nPat Rooney saw Cooper Tire and Rubber grow from 1,000 total employees \nto now 25,000 worldwide. During his tenure at Cooper Tire, Mr. Rooney \nspent time working in Clarksdale, Mississippi at the rubber products \noperation in the Mississippi Delta. Cooper has built a significant \npresence in my state, employing numerous Mississippians at locations in \nClarksdale and Tupelo. Pat Rooney lives in Findlay, Ohio and has been \nvery active in the community. He is a Rotarian, active in the Findlay/\nHancock County Chamber of Commerce, and the County Community \nDevelopment Foundation and served on the advisory council of the Arts \nPartnership of Hancock County. Again, I want to commend Pat Rooney \ntoday for his service to his company and his community. Cooper Tire has \nbeen fortunate to have such a dedicated employee, leader, and \nvisionary. Mr. Rooney I hope you will enjoy your well deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4443-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4443-S4444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SCHOOL SAFETY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Senate began \nconsideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a \nreauthorization bill that would determine our national education \npolicy. We spent a few days on that bill, offering and debating \namendments, to reduce class size and reward teachers who improve \nstudent achievement, among other things.\n  On May 9, 2000, the Majority Leader withdrew the education bill from \nconsideration, and the Senate moved on to other business. At the time, \nthe Majority Leader indicated his intent to come back to the education \nbill, either later in that same week, or the week after.\n  It is now more than three weeks later and Congress is preparing to \nadjourn for the Memorial Day recess without addressing a critical \ncomponent of our national education policy: school safety.\n  The education bill was likely withdrawn from the Senate because of \nthe possibility of a school safety amendment aimed at curbing gun \nviolence. Unfortunately, education and gun violence are now inseparable \nissues. The wave of school shootings--in Jonesboro, Arkansas, \nLittleton, Colorado, and recently, in Mt. Morris Township, Michigan--\nhas changed America's perception of safety in school.\n  Over the last few years, we have made some gains. Over the four year \nperiod, from 1993 to 1997, the percentage of high school students who \ncarried a weapon to school declined from 12% to 9%; the rate of crime \nagainst students ages 12 to 18 fell one-third; and 90 percent of \nschools reported no incidents of serious violent crime in 1996-1997.\n  Despite these gains, students feel less safe at school, and access to \nguns is a primary reason why. School violence, or even the threat of \nschool violence, instills fear in our students, and limits their \nability to learn. School violence also threatens and intimidates \nteachers--making instruction more difficult.\n  The learning environment is in jeopardy, and unless we address the \nvulnerabilities of our schools, many of our other efforts to improve \nthe education system will be undermined.\n  I'm sure all of us agree that any act of violence--whether it's as \ncommon as a fist fight in the locker room or as extreme as a shoot out \nin the cafeteria--interferes with the educational process. Ron Astor, \nan assistant professor of social work and education at the University \nof Michigan in Ann Arbor, has said: ``Violence in schools . . . \ninterferes with children's physical well being, academic functioning, \nsocial relations, and emotional and cognitive development.''\n  School violence has always posed a threat to students and teachers, \nbut the advent of gun violence in schools has escalated the problem. \nGun violence, not only affects students at a particular school, it has \na rippling effect on students at schools in the same county, state, and \nin some cases, the entire country.\n  I have a letter from Professor Astor, who wrote to me earlier this \nmonth, when the Senate was debating education policy. Professor Astor \nhas been researching the topic of school violence for over 17 years, \nand has produced 23 publications on the topic. His research gives us a \nclear understanding of how gun violence, and the fear of gun violence, \nimpacts schools in Michigan, and in the  United States.\n\n  Professor Astor writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Levin,\n       I am pleased that the Senate is debating the topic of \n     education in our nation. As a professor of education, I hope \n     that you will include in your discussions the issue of school \n     safety. As you know, the general public is seriously \n     concerned with the safety of our schools. Polls taken over \n     the past seven years indicated that the public considers \n     school violence to be the top problem facing U.S. schools. \n     Hopefully, the Senate's efforts will result in policy and \n     legislation that make our schools safer for our children.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Clearly, teachers, students, and school staff are most \n     concerned about the presence of firearms and weapons in our \n     schools. In the context of a discussion on guns and mass \n     shootings, consider the fear described by this middle school \n     teacher who participated in one of our studies: ``A lot of us \n     are afraid. You come in the morning and you're just afraid to \n     even go to work. You're just so stressed out, because you're \n     all tensed up, you can't feel happy and teach like you want \n     to because you've got to spend all of your time trying to \n     discipline. You're scared somebody's going to walk in. We \n     keep our doors locked. We have to keep our doors locked.'' \n     Middle school teacher. (Meyer, Astor & Behre, 2000).\n\n  Professor Astor goes on:\n\n       In our studies, students and school staff often mention \n     fear from the threat of guns and other lethal weapons. \n     Without a doubt, the knowledge or rumor of a gun in a school \n     instills fear in the school community. Teachers and students \n     are well aware that the shocking mass murders recently \n     perpetrated in schools are exclusively associated with \n     firearms. Our country has a long history of lethal acts in \n     schools (see Kachur et al, 1996 in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association), however, the use of guns as a \n     weapon of choice, has made multiple murders a more common \n     occurrence. This, in turn, has promoted a high level of fear \n     within schools. Obviously, the fear of death or potential \n     catastrophe is not conducive with a positive learning \n     environment. Consequently, I urge you and your colleagues to \n     take a strong stance on the issue of firearms.\n\n  Professor Astor quotes a middle school teacher frightened by the \nthought of a school shooting, and she is not alone. Teachers and \nstudents across this nation fear what may happen to them in the \nclassroom. Those of us who feel strongly about education and school \nsafety must do something to ease their fears. Congress must curb young \npeople's access to guns. We must pass legislation designed to reduce \nthe level of gun violence, and the fear of such violence, in our \ncommunities.\n  Gun violence is certainly not the only cause of fear in school. \nProfessor Astor explains, that in addition to concerns about firearms, \nteachers and students fear more common forms of violence, such as fist \nfights, sexual harassment, teasing and bullying. All violence in school \nis unacceptable and we should continue to work toward curbing any and \nall student harm. But gun\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nviolence is a dominant cause of fear among teachers and students in our \nschools\n  We have the opportunity to take the first step toward establishing a \nsafer and more secure school environment, by among other things, \npassing the juvenile justice bill which would ban juvenile possession \nof assault weapons and close the gun show loophole. But if we can not \npass the juvenile justice bill, we will use other means to prevent the \ngun violence that has plagued too many American schools and \ncommunities.\n  I hope this Senate will continue its debate on this country's long-\nterm education needs and at the same time, work toward finding a long-\nterm solution for reducing the shootings in American schools. Students \naround the country may be off for the summer, but Congress will have to \nkeep working until we can make the grade on school safety.\n  I ask unanimous consent to submit the full text of Professor Astor's \nletter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       University of Michigan,\n\n                                       Ann Arbor, MI, May 2, 2000.\n     Senator Levin,\n     Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin, I am pleased that the Senate is \n     debating the topic of education in our nation. As a professor \n     of education, I hope that you will include in your \n     discussions the issue of school safety. As you know, the \n     general public is seriously concerned with the safety of our \n     schools. Polls taken over the past seven years indicated that \n     the public considers school violence to be the top problem \n     facing U.S. schools. Hopefully, the Senate's efforts will \n     result in policy and legislation that make our schools safer \n     for our children.\n       I have been researching school violence for over 17 years. \n     I have 23 publications on the topic of school violence in the \n     U.S.A. and abroad. In addition, I teach courses on school \n     violence to teachers, psychologists and social workers who \n     will be creating and administering school violence programs \n     in U.S. schools. Consequently, I have a perspective on this \n     issue that spans both research and practice.\n       Based on my research, I would like to encourage you and \n     your colleagues to pass legislation that addresses children's \n     perceptions of safety in school. Our research shows that both \n     children and teachers (in elementary, middle, and high \n     school) are reluctant to categorize their entire setting as \n     unsafe. However, when students and their teachers are asked \n     to identify specific locations in their school (e.g., the \n     bathrooms, playgrounds, hallways, areas immediately \n     surrounding the school), most identify dangerous areas that \n     they fear or avoid. Therefore feelings of danger are far more \n     common experiences for students than the data in federal \n     studies suggest. For example, in recent studies (enclosed \n     Astor, Meyer & Behre, 1999; Astor, Meyer & Pitner, in press), \n     we mapped violence-prone school locations within schools and \n     then conducted in-depth interviews with students, teachers, \n     and principals in Michigan elementary, middle and high \n     schools. In these studies we found students and teachers very \n     reluctant to categorize their entire school as being unsafe \n     even though the vast majority of students identified areas \n     that they avoid due to school safety issues. Furthermore, \n     girls consistently identify more areas than boys that they \n     feared or avoided. One study found that over a third of \n     school territory was considered unsafe by girls.\n       The teachers are also aware of danger in their work-\n     settings (e.g., enclosed Meyer, Astor, & Behre, 2000). For \n     example, 75% of the teachers in our sample, identified at \n     least one area in or around their school that they considered \n     unsafe or dangerous. Female middle and high school \n     teachers identified more areas than their male colleagues \n     that they perceived to be unsafe (e.g., 58% vs. 87% of \n     males and females respectively). Teachers are very brave. \n     Although they sense danger in specific school locations \n     the vast majority of teachers claimed they would intervene \n     even though they may be placing themselves in harms way. \n     Teachers continually mentioned the need for protection \n     against physical harm, legal issues, and policies that \n     support their actions to make school safer. Contrary, to \n     the current trend in zero tolerance policies, most of the \n     students and teachers in our studies advocate for a \n     relationship oriented approach that focuses on building a \n     caring school community. Neither students nor teachers \n     feel that security oriented measures (video cameras, \n     security guards, police officers, alarm systems, \n     expulsions) are conducive to a healthy learning \n     environment. Furthermore, the findings in our studies show \n     that interventions designed to encourage teacher/student \n     relationships are perceived to be the most effective and \n     consistent with the educational goals of our nation's \n     schools.\n       Clearly, teachers, students, and school staff are most \n     concerned about the presence of firearms and weapons in our \n     schools. In the context of a discussion on guns and mass \n     shootings, consider the fear described by this middle school \n     teacher who participated in one of our studies:\n       ``But I'm telling you, there's so much violence and in \n     different areas and in different districts and different \n     states where teachers are being killed every day. And don't \n     look to me as a teacher to solve the violence in the school. \n     It was there before I got there. It is getting worse. I'm \n     here to tell you. I will--a lot of us are afraid. You come in \n     the morning and you're just afraid to even go to work. You're \n     just so stressed out, because you're all tensed up, you can't \n     feel happy and teach like you want to because you've got to \n     spend all of your time trying to discipline. You're scared \n     somebody's going to walk in. We keep our doors locked. We \n     have to keep our doors locked.'' Middle school teacher. \n     (Meyer, Astor & Behre, 2000).\n       In our studies, students and school staff often mention \n     fear from the threat of guns and other lethal weapons. \n     Without a doubt, the knowledge or rumor of a gun in a school \n     instills fear in the school community. Teachers and students \n     are well aware that the shocking mass murders recently \n     perpetrated in schools are exclusively associated with \n     firearms. Our country has a long history of lethal acts in \n     schools (see Kachur et al, 1996 in the Journal of the \n     American Medical Association), however, the use of guns as a \n     weapon of choice, has made multiple murders a more common \n     occurrence. This, in turn, has promoted a high level of fear \n     within school. Obviously, the fear of death or potential \n     catastrophe is no conducive with a positive learning \n     environment. Consequently, I urge you and your colleagues to \n     take a strong stance on the issue of firearms.\n       Our findings demonstrate that in addition a focus on \n     weapons in schools, national legislation should be focusing \n     on most common forms of student harm such as school beatings, \n     sexual harassment, relentless humiliation/teasing, bullying, \n     and other forms of victimization. These kinds of events have \n     a very large impact on students overall sense of school \n     safety. We just conducted a large scale (16,000 students) \n     international study that shows these more common forms of \n     violence account for many students nonattendance of school \n     due to fear/humiliation. Creating on overall climate of \n     safety in the school is essential. Draconian security \n     measures used in the name of school safety (expulsion, \n     police, metal detectors), may actually increase students \n     fear of school violence and interfere with their learning.\n       Finally, the Columbine shootings have qualitatively changed \n     our countries perceptions of school violence. Based on my \n     contacts with hundreds of teachers, school principals, and \n     school district superintendents in Michigan and across the \n     country, I can confidently say that school districts are now \n     more punitive, frightened, and authoritarian, surrounding \n     issues of school violence. Consequently, it appears that \n     schools harsh responses (usually suspension and expulsions) \n     are now extended to innuendo's, nasty stares, verbal threats, \n     and rude behaviors. Rather than creating a safer school \n     climate, students, teachers, and principals claim that these \n     security measures are fostering an oppressive environment \n     which may be equally detrimental to learning. From a public \n     policy perspective, expelling our most aggressive children is \n     a social disaster because it increases the likelihood that \n     these children will commit serious violent acts in the \n     community. Being banished from school at a young age \n     increased the chances of a ``dead end'' life, prison, \n     welfare, being at the periphery of our economy, and a life of \n     crime. Positive relationshps created in schools may actually \n     serve as a protective factor for many of our most aggressive \n     children. Therefore, I'd like to encourage you and your \n     esteemed colleagues to carefully consider policies that \n     mirror a democratic, caring, community-oriented, and \n     relationship-oriented school environment. These empirically \n     supported virtues would accomplish the dual goals of \n     fostering academic excellence within the context of safe \n     feeling environments. Students, teachers, principals and \n     parents do not want their schools turned into prison-like \n     environments. This would not benefit our children's education \n     or our democracy. Finally, they do not increase children's \n     sense of safety. The facts suggested that the opposite is \n     true.\n       I have enclosed a series of articles published or in press \n     (in scientific peer reviewed journals).

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the \nimportance--the critical need--for early Senate consideration of the \ndefense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001. This bill, which we \nreported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 12th with \nbipartisan support, is a good bill which will have a positive impact on \nour nation's security, and on the welfare of the men and women of\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\nthe Armed Forces and their families. It is a fair bill. It provides a \n$4.5 billion increase in defense spending--consistent with the \ncongressional budget resolution. But, the real beneficiaries of this \nlegislation are our servicemen and women who will not only have better \ntools and equipment to do their jobs, but an enhanced quality of life \nfor themselves and their families. We must show our support for these \nbrave men and women--many of whom are in harm's way on a daily basis--\nby passing this important legislation.\n  I am privileged to have been associated with the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the development of a defense authorization bill \nevery year of my modest career here in the Senate--a career quickly \napproaching 22 years. During those years, the committee has used the \nannual defense authorization bills to address the most fundamental \nnational security issues facing the nation, including: the \nrevitalization of the Armed Forces under President Reagan; the \nGoldwater-Nichols reorganization of the Department of Defense; the \nrestructuring and reduction of the Armed Forces following the end of \nthe cold war; investigating the tragedies in Beirut, Somalia, and Saudi \nArabia (Khobar Towers); and the review and implementation of the \nlessons learned from military operations in Grenada, Panama, the \nPersian Gulf, and, most recently, the lessons learned from the \noperations in the Balkans and, in particular, Kosovo.\n  This year's legislation follows in this fine tradition. The \nimportance of this bill is without question.\n  While this legislation is not the only bill on defense spending, it \noccupies a very unique and critical role in the congressional defense \nfunding process. Both it's timing and function in the congressional \nbudget process are intended to achieve important goals: fully explore \npublic concerns and fulfill statutory requirements.\n  The venerable soldier-statesman, General George Marshall once stated, \n``In a democracy such as ours, military policy is dependent on public \nopinion.''\n  The crucial step of ensuring that public opinion on national security \npolicy issues has a forum begins in the Armed Services Committee. Since \nthe beginning of the 106th Congress, the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices has conducted almost 170 hearings, briefings, and meetings, to \nfully explore, examine and deliberate matters of concern to the public \non national security policy and funding issues. This year, in \nparticular, a sample of the issues addressed in our hearings include: \nhealthcare for military personnel, their families and retirees; the \nfuture of the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal; U.S. military involvement \nin the Balkans; Defense Department efforts to counter the threat of a \nterrorist attack; security clearance procedures for defense personnel; \nimmunizing our personnel against anthrax; and ensuring Russia safely \nsecures and disposes of its nuclear arsenal.\n  Mr. President, the discussion on these important issues does not end \nwith consideration in the Armed Services Committee. In fact, in the \nlast twenty years, our Chamber's collective interest in continuing the \npublic debate on pressing national security matters presented in the \ndefense authorization bill has significantly increased. In 1979, the \nfirst opportunity I had to be a part of the defense authorization bill \nprocess, there were only 11 amendments to the bill during Senate floor \ndebate. Last year, during our debate on the national defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 2000, there were over 160 \namendments.\n  But we know our responsibility to consider and pass the defense \nauthorization bill goes beyond statutory requirements and historical \nprecedent. We must also be aware of the importance of this measure to \nour men and women in uniform around the world.\n  U.S. military forces are involved in overseas deployments at an \nunprecedented rate. Currently, our troops are involved in over 10 \ncontingency operations around the globe. Over the past decade, our \nactive duty manpower has been reduced by nearly a third, active Army \ndivisions have been reduced by almost 50 percent, and the number of \nNavy ships has been reduced from 567 to 316. During this same period, \nour troops have been involved in 50 military operations worldwide. By \ncomparison, from the end of the Vietnam war in 1975 until 1989, U.S. \nmilitary forces were engaged in only 20 such military deployments.\n  In an all-volunteer force, where increasing deployments and \noperations challenge the capabilities of our military to effectively \nmeet those commitments, as well as challenge the efforts of our \nmilitary to recruit and retain quality military personnel, we must \nembrace every opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to our military \npersonnel. The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001 \nsends this important message.\n  Mr. President, I noted previously in these remarks the important role \nof the defense authorization bill as a means by which the Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate address many of the today's important \nmilitary policy matters. I would like to take a moment to highlight the \nimpact of not passing the National Defense Authorization Bill for \nFiscal Year 2001.\n  With respect to personnel policy, the committee included leglsiation \nin the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001 to continue to \nsupport initiatives to address critical recruiting and retention \nshortfalls. In this regard, the committee increased compensation \nbenefits and focused on improving military health care for our active \nduty and retired personnel and their families.\n  Without this bill, there will be:\n  No 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel;\n  No pharmacy benefit for medicare eligible military retirees;\n  No extension of TRICARE benefits to active duty family members in \nremote locations;\n  No elimination of health care co-pays for active duty family members \nin TRICARE Prime;\n  No Thrift Savings Plan for military personnel;\n  No five year pilot program to permit the Army to test several \ninnovative approaches to recruiting; and\n  No transit pass benefit for Defense Department commuters in the \nWashington area.\n  And, without this bill, the current Department of Defense Medicare \nsubvention demonstration program will not be expanded, as we \nenvisioned, but instead terminated. Currently, the Medicare Subvention \ndemonstration program provides medical services to approximately 28,000 \nmilitary retirees in Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, \nWashington, and Delaware. Expanding the program would provide medical \nservices to military retirees living in the District of Columbia, \nVirginia, Ohio, Georgia, Hawaii, and Maryland.\n  Without this bill, almost every bonus and special pay incentive \ndesigned to recruit and retain service members will expire December 31, \n2000, including: special pay for health professionals in critically \nshort wartime specialities; special pay for nuclear-qualified officers \nwho extend their service commitment; aviation officer retention bonus; \nnuclear accession bonus; nuclear career annual incentive bonus; \nSelected Reserve enlistment bonus; Selected Reserve re-enlistment \nbonus; special pay for service members assigned to high priority \nreserve units; Selected Reserve affiliation bonus; Ready Reserve \nenlistment and re-enlistment bonuses; loan repayment program for health \nprofessionals who serve in the Selected Reserve; nurse officer \ncandidate accession program; accession bonus for registered nurses; \nincentive pay for nurse anesthetists; re-enlistment bonus for active \nduty personnel; enlistment bonus for critical active duty specialities; \nand Army enlistment bonuses and the extension of this bonus to the \nother services.\n\n  The committee has carefully studied the recruiting and retention \nproblems in our military. We have worked hard to develop this package \nto increase compensation and benefits. We believe it will go a long way \nto recruit new servicemenbers and to provide the necessary incentives \nto retain mid-career personnel who are critical to the force.\n  Mr. President, on many occasions I have shared my concerns about the \nthreats posed to our military personnel and our citizens, both at home \nand abroad, by weapons of mass destruction: chemical, biological, \nradiological and cyber warfare. Whether these weapons are used on the \nbattlefield or by a terrorist within the United States, we, as a \nnation, must be prepared.\n  Without this bill, efforts by the committee to continue to ensure \nthat the\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\nDOD is adequately funded and structured to deter and defeat the efforts \nof those intent on using weapons of mass destruction would not be \nimplemented. Efforts that would not go forward without this bill \ninclude: establishing a single point of contact for overall policy and \nbudgeting oversight of the DOD activities for combating terrorism; \nfully deploying 32 WMD-CST (formerly RAID) teams by the end of fiscal \nyear 2001; the establishment of an Information Security Scholarship \nProgram to encourage the recruitment and retention of Department of \nDefense personnel with computer and network security skills; and the \ncreation of an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information \nProtection to conduct research and critical technology development and \nto facilitate the exchange of information between the government and \nthe private sector.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly highlight some of the other \nmajor initiatives in this bill that would be at risk without Senate \nfloor consideration of the defense authorization bill:\n  Without this bill, multi-year, cost-saving spending authority for the \nBradley Fighting Vehicle and UH-60 ``Blackhawk'' helicopter would \ncease.\n  Without this bill, there would not be a block buy for Virginia Class \nsubmarines. Without the block buy, there would be fewer opportunities \nto save taxpayer dollars by buying components--in a cost-effective \nmanner--for the submarines.\n  All military construction projects require both authorizations as \nwell as appropriations. Without this bill, over 360 military \nconstruction projects and 25 housing projects involving hundreds of \ncritical family housing units would not be started.\n  The Military Housing Privatization Initiative would expire in \nFebruary 2001. Without this bill, the program would not be extended for \nan additional three years, as planned. The military services would not \nbe able to privatize thousands of housing units and correct a serious \nhousing shortage within the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, it has been said that, ``Example is the best General \nOrder.'' The Senate needs to take charge, move out, consider and pass \nthe National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001. This \nlegislation is important to the nation and to demonstrating to the men \nand women in uniform, their families and those who have gone before \nthem, our current and continuing support and commitment to them on \nbehalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4446-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4446-S4449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONTINUING PROBLEMS FOR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DUE TO McDADE LAW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a pressing criminal \njustice problem. The problem stems from a provision slipped into the \nomnibus appropriations law during the last Congress, without the \nbenefit of any hearings or debate by the Senate. Although some of us \nfrom both sides of the aisle objected to the provision at the time, our \nobjections were ignored and the provision became law. It is having \ndevastating effects on federal criminal prosecutions and, as I describe \nin some detail below, it is no exaggeration to say that this provision \nis costing lives.\n  In the last Congress, the omnibus appropriations measure for FY 1999 \nincluded a provision originally sponsored by former Representative \nJoseph McDade that was opposed by most members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, both Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, we sent a joint \nletter to the leadership of the Appropriations Committee urging that \nthis provision be removed from any conference report because, in our \nview, the McDade law ``would seriously impair the effectiveness of \nfederal prosecutors in their efforts to enforce federal criminal laws \nand protect our communities.''\n  Nevertheless, the McDade provision was enacted as part of that \nappropriations measure and went into effect on April 19, 1999. This \nlaw, now codified at 28 U.S.C. Sec. 530B, subjects federal prosecutors \nto the state bar rules, and discipline, of ``each State where such \nattorney engages in that attorney's duties.'' There has been enormous \ntension over what ethical standards apply to federal prosecutors and \nwho has the authority to set those standards.\n  This debate over the ethical rules that apply to federal prosecutors \nwas resolved with the McDade law at a time of heightened public concern \nover the high-profile investigations and prosecutions conducted by \nindependent counsels. Special prosecutors Kenneth Starr and Donald \nSmaltz were the ``Poster boys'' for unaccountable federal prosecutors. \nBy law, those special prosecutors were subject to the ethical \nguidelines and policies of the Department of Justice. They defended \ntheir controversial tactics by claiming to have conducted their \ninvestigations and prosecutions in conformity with Departmental \npolicies.\n  The actions of these special prosecutors provided all the necessary \nfodder to fuel passage of the McDade law. For example, one of the core \ncomplaints the Department had against the McDade law is that federal \nprosecutors would be subject to restrictive state ethics rules \nregarding contacts with represented persons. A letter to the Washington \nPost from the former Chairman of the ABA ethics committee pointed out:\n\n       [Anti-contact rules are] designed to protect individuals \n     like Monica Lewinsky, who have hired counsel and are entitled \n     to have all contacts with law enforcement officials go \n     through their counsel. As Ms. Lewinsky learned, dealing \n     directly with law enforcement officials can be intimidating \n     and scary, despite the fact that those inquisitors later \n     claimed it was okay for her to leave at any time.\n\n  I have outlined before my concerns about the tactics of these special \nprosecutors, such as requiring a mother to testify about her daughter's \nintimate relationships, requiring a bookstore to disclose all the books \na person may have purchased, and breaching the longstanding \nunderstanding of the relationship of trust between the Secret Service \nand those it protects. I was appalled to hear a federal prosecutor \nexcuse a flimsy prosecution by announcing after the defendant's \nacquittal that just getting the indictment was a great deterrent. \nTrophy watches and television talk show puffery should not be the \ntrappings of prosecutors.\n  Yet, I opposed the McDade law and continue to believe that this law \nis not the answer. I firmly support improvements in the disciplinary \nprocess for federal prosecutors but this important task may be \naccomplished without hindering legitimate law enforcement investigative \ntechniques and practices--which is what the McDade law is doing. While \nsubjecting federal attorneys to state bar rules sounds like good policy \nat first blush, the McDade law has ceded to the vagaries of fifty state \nbar associations control of how federal prosecutions are to be \nconducted. I am concerned that Federal prosecutors are being hamstrung \nbecause the McDade law makes them answerable to multiple masters.\n  The Department of Justice has been surprisingly quiet, both before \nand after the McDade law went into effect, about seeking a legislative \nmodification to address the most devastating consequences of this new \nlaw for federal law enforcement. Unfortunately, we are fast approaching \nthe end of this Congress without making any progress on addressing the \nproblems created by the McDade law.\n  I have asked the Department of Justice for an update on how the \nMcDade law is working, and whether any of my fears were warranted. The \nresults are in: This law has resulted in significant delays in \nimportant criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of federally-\nauthorized investigative techniques and posed multiple hurdles for \nfederal prosecutors.\n  The Justice Department's November, 1999, response to my prior \nquestions on this issue stated that the McDade law ``has caused \ntremendous uncertainty,'' ``delayed investigations,'' ``creat[ed] a \nrift between agents and prosecutors,'' ``prevented attorneys and agents \nfrom taking legitimate, traditionally accepted investigative steps, to \nthe detriment of pending cases,'' and served as the basis of litigation \n``to interfere with legitimate federal prosecutions.'' Yet, these \ngeneralities do not fully demonstrate the significant adverse impact \nthis law is continuing to have to slow down or bring to a standstill \nfederal investigations of serious criminal wrongdoing. Let me describe \nsome recent examples.\n\n\n                         airline whistle blower\n\n  In one recent case, an airline mechanic whistleblower claimed that \nhis airline was falsely claiming to the FAA that required maintenance \nprocedures\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\nhad been performed on the airline's planes when in fact they had not \nbeen done. The FBI executed a search warrant for documents at the \nmaintenance facility and began simultaneous interviews of the \nmaintenance personnel to determine the validity of the allegations. The \nairline's attorney immediately interceded, claimed to represent all \nairline personnel, and halted the interviews. Because of the McDade \nlaw, the prosecutor was forced to tell the agents that they could not \ncontinue to interview the employees.\n  Rather than having several agents out interviewing witnesses \nsimultaneously to avoid culpable witnesses from trying to get their \nstories ``straight,'' the prosecutor then had to resort to an \nalternative strategy to obtain information from the employees. The \nprosecutor subpoenaed the witnesses to the grand jury. Unfortunately, \nthe risk of this strategy is that it may play right into the hands of \nthose who are willing to cover up. With the grand jury route, one \nwitness at a time testifies and is then debriefed immediately after by \nan attorney, who in turn briefs all future witnesses about what \nquestions will be asked and what answers have already been given.\n  Indeed, the attorney for the airline again claimed to represent \neveryone who was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. The \noffice advised the attorney that he had a conflict doing so, and the \nattorney then obtained a separate attorney for each witness.\n  The impact on this investigation was severe. Because the attorney for \neach witness insisted on a grant of immunity, and because of scheduling \nconflicts with the various attorneys, the investigation was stalled for \nmany months. When the witnesses finally appeared before the grand jury, \nthey had trouble remembering significant information to the \ninvestigation.\n  After about a year of investigation, one of the airline's planes \ncrashed, with calamitous loss of life.\n  Immediately after the crash, the FBI received information that the \nplane had problems on the first leg of its trip. The agents could not \ngo out and interview the airline's employees because of questions \nraised by the McDade law. Does the corporation have a right to be \nnotified before interviews and to have its counsel present? Are these \npeople represented by the corporate attorney? Thus, those interviews \nthat are most often successful--simultaneous interviews of numerous \nemployees--could not be conducted simply because of fear that an \nethical rule--not the law--might result in proceedings against the \nprosecutor.\n\n\n                       child-murder investigation\n\n  A 12-year-old girl was abducted while riding her bicycle near her \nfamily home in a Midwestern city in 1989. An exhaustive investigation \nled by the FBI turned up nothing. In 1996, an apparent eyewitness \nconfessed on his deathbed to the abduction and stated that he had been \ntold by an accomplice that an individual known as ``T,'' who was then \nin the custody of the state Department of Corrections, had buried the \nlittle girl's body in a deep freeze on T's property near a small mid-\nwestern city. T admitted to former inmates, to prison nurses and to his \ngrandmother that he was involved in the case. When interviewed by the \npolice, he on one occasion denied any involvement, but later admitted \nbeing present when the young girl was killed.\n  A federal prosecutor and two FBI agents attempted to meet with T at \nthe county jail. The prosecutor explained that the purpose of the \nmeeting was to obtain T's cooperation; T stated that he wanted to speak \nto his attorney, and was allowed to speak with his federal public \ndefender from a prior closed case. The federal public defender informed \nT that he did not represent him, but T then spoke in confidence to the \nfederal defender, who informed the prosecutor that T had no information \nand did not wish to continue the conversion.\n  Agents have located an individual who believes that T would confide \nin him and that he would be willing to assist in attempting to find out \nfrom T what had happened to the girl's body. This individual has agreed \nto a consensually monitored meeting with T.\n  Because of T's prior representation by the state and federal public \ndefenders, the U.S. Attorney's office contacted the state bar \ndisciplinary counsel concerning whether it could conduct the consensual \nmonitoring. A staff attorney in the bar disciplinary office stated that \nT was a represented person and that the prosecutors could not make the \ncontact until the public defenders informed T that they no longer \nrepresented him and the U.S. Attorney's Office gave T adequate \nopportunity to retain other counsel.\n  This advice was given by the State Bar Disciplinary Counsel despite \nthe relevant U.S. Supreme Court and federal appellate case law to the \ncontrary. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314, 321 n. 6. (1987) (a \nconviction becomes final when ``a judgment of conviction has been \nrendered, the availability of appeal exhausted, and the time for a \npetition for certiorari elapsed or a petition for certiorari finally \ndenied''); United States v. Fitterer, 710 F.2d 1328 (8th Cir. 1983); \nUnited States v. Dobbs, 711 F.2d 84 (8th Cir. 1983) (contact with \nrepresented persons permitted in the course of pre-indictment criminal \ninvestigations).\n  The Chief Disciplinary Counsel for the State Bar made it clear that \nhe was not bound by judicial determinations, including federal court \ndecisions, other than those made by the State Supreme Court in which he \nwas located. The investigation is currently at a standstill. The \nprosecutor is considering giving T immunity for his testimony, as a \nlast resort.\n\n\n                               Oil spill\n\n  After leaving the port of a major city, a ship on its way to a \nforeign country dumped thousands of gallons of fuel oil into the United \nStates coastal waters near the major city. The spill killed wildlife \nand caused millions of dollars of damage to the coast. The Coast Guard \npursued the ship and boarded it in international waters. While the \nCoast Guard was boarding the ship, the lawyers for the ship's owners \nwere on the telephone to the ship's captain and to the Coast Guard. \nThey claimed to represent all crew members and prohibited further \ninterviews. The attorneys also told the Captain to direct the crew not \nto speak to the Coast Guard.\n  Because of the state ethical rules and the claim that those rules not \nonly prevent AUSA's, but also federal investigative agents from \nspeaking to corporate employees, the prosecutors directed the Coast \nGuard not to seek further interviews. The ship's crew as then spirited \nout of the foreign country and were not ever available to testify \nbefore the grand jury. No eyewitness to the spill ever materialized.\n\n\n                     clean water act investigation\n\n  A United States Attorney's office is conducting an ongoing grand jury \ninvestigation into allegations that a large corporation violated the \nClean Water Act. Certain former employees of this corporation have \nindicated that they have relevant information and are willing to speak \nwith federal investigators about that information. Nothwithstanding \ntheir desire to speak to federal investigators, a state case has \ninterpreted the relevant state's ethics rule as prohibiting contact \nwith former as well as current employees of a represented corporation. \nA federal case has interpreted the same state's ethics rule as \npermitting contact with former employees.\n\n  The state's disciplinary counsel has conveyed his view that only \nstate court decisions construing that state's ethics rule are \ncontrolling and that federal case law cannot be relied upon to govern \nproceedings that are brought solely in federal court.\n  As a consequence, federal prosecutors may be stymied by a State \nethical rule and State court interpretation of that rule from gathering \nmaterial evidence of a federal crime from willing witnesses.\n\n\n                      kickbacks and contract fraud\n\n  In United States v. Talao, 1998 WL 1114043 (N.D. Cal.), vacated in \npart by 1998 WL 1114044 (N.D. Cal.), a company's bookkeeper was \nsubpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Her employers were the \nsubjects of the criminal investigation because they were believed to \nhave failed to pay the prevailing wage on federally funded contracts, \nfalsified payroll records, and demanded illegal kickbacks. The \nbookkeeper came to the U.S. Attorney's Office the day before the \nscheduled grand jury appearance and asked to speak to the prosecutor, \nbut the prosecutor was not in.\n  The next day, when the bookkeeper arrived for her grand jury \nappearance, she encountered the prosecutor in the\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\nhall outside the grand jury room. The bookkeeper agreed to meet with \nthe prosecutor and the case agent, and in a ten minute conversation in \na nearby witness room, the bookkeeper told the prosecutor that her \nemployers (the subjects of the investigation) had pressed her to lie \nbefore the grand jury, she was afraid of them, and she did not want the \ncompany's lawyer to be in the same room as her or know what she had \nsaid in the grand jury, for fear that the attorney would report \neverything back to the employer.\n  During this interview, the corporate attorney banged on the witness \nroom door and demanded to be present during the interview; he also \nasserted the right to be present in the grand jury. The prosecutor \nasked the bookkeeper whether she wished to speak to the attorney. She \nsaid that she did not. The grand jury later indicted the employers for \nconspiracy, false statements, and illegal kickbacks.\n  The district judge first ruled that the prosecutor violated the \ncontacts with represented persons rule because there was a pre-existing \nDepartment of Labor administrative proceeding and qui tam action (the \ngovernment had not intervened) and, therefore, the corporation had a \nright to have its attorney present during any interview of any \nemployee, regardless of the employee's wishes, the status of the \ncorporate managers, or the possibility that the attorney may have a \nconflict of interest in representing the bookkeeper. The judge referred \nthe AUSA for disciplinary review by the State of California.\n  Upon rehearing, the judge held that, though the ethical rule \nviolation was intentional, he would withdraw the referral to the state \nbar. He held that he would instruct the jury to consider the \nprosecutor's ethical violation in assessing the credibility of the \nbookkeeper. The government sought a writ of mandamus and that was \nargued before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on March 15, 2000. The \nprosecutor has also sought to appeal the district court's misconduct \nfinding.\n\n\n                        monitored conversations\n\n  A common tool of law enforcement authorities who are investigating \nallegations of criminal and civil violations is to have either a law \nenforcement agent or a confidential informant (under the direction of a \nlaw enforcement agent) act in an undercover capacity. Often, during the \ncourse of these undercover investigations, undercover agents and \nconfidential informants engage in a monitored conversation with \nindividuals suspected of illegal conduct. When engaging in such \nmonitored conversations, the law enforcement agent or confidential \ninformant working for the government hides his true identity.\n  ABA Model Rule 8.4(c) provides that it is misconduct for a lawyer to \nengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or \nmisrepresentation. In one jurisdiction--Oregon--bar disciplinary \ncounsel has interpreted the relevant version of this rule to prohibit \nattorneys not only from authorizing or conducting such consensual \nrecordings but also from supervising or overseeing undercover \ninvestigations themselves, since the very nature of the undercover \noperation conduct involves deception. Thus, in Oregon, government \nattorneys may risk violating the ethics rules when they supervise \nlegitimate criminal and civil law enforcement investigations that use \ninvestigative methods recognized by courts as lawful.\n\n\n                       grand jury investigations\n\n  In a series of existing grand jury investigations, an attorney for a \ncorporation under investigation prevented interviews of corporate \nemployees by federal agents because of the rule governing contacts with \nrepresented persons. The following examples took place after the McDade \nlaw was passed.\n  a. In John Doe Corp. #1, as federal agents began to execute a search \nwarrant at a company, the attorney for the corporation announced over \nthe loudspeaker that he represented all of the employees and that no \ninterviews could take place.\n  b. In John Doe Corp. #2, agents of the U.S. Customs Service executed \na search warrant at a computer component manufacturer in a major U.S. \ncity. While executing the warrant at Company A, a lawyer called the \nprosecutor and claimed to represent all employees at Company A and its \nsubsidiaries. During the search the manager of Company B, a subsidiary \nof Company A, approached the agents and asked to cooperate, offering to \ntape conversations with those managers above him who had committed \ncrimes. Because Company B was controlled by Company A, the prosecutor \ndirected the agents not to conduct any undercover meetings or interview \nthe potential witness.\n  Virtually every investigation involving a corporation is now subject \nto interference where none existed before.\n\n\n                         whistle blower actions\n\n  Increasingly, the government uses its civil enforcement powers under \nfederal statutes to crack down on corporations that engage in health \ncare fraud, defense contractor fraud, and other frauds that cost the \ngovernment--and the taxpayers--substantial sums of money. One method of \npursuing such fraud claims is through qui tam suits, which often are \ninitiated by corporate employees seeking to ``blow the whistle'' on \noffending companies.\n  Many states' ethics rules forbid government attorneys from obtaining \nrelevant information from concerned whistle blowers and corporate \n``good citizens'' without the consent of the counsel that represents \nthe corporation whose conduct is under investigation. This prohibition, \nwhich affects criminal investigations as well, presents a particularly \nacute problem in civil enforcement investigations. Unlike criminal \ninvestigations, which sometimes can be conducted in the first instance \nby law enforcement officers, without the involvement of government \nattorneys (and the restrictions that attorneys' involvement brings), \ncivil enforcement actions often are investigated directly by the \ngovernment attorneys themselves, as the resources of federal law \nenforcement authorities typically are not available for civil \nenforcement matters.\n\n\n                     we need to fix the mcdade law\n\n  Due to my serious concerns about the adverse effects of the McDade \nlaw on federal law enforcement efforts, I introduced S. 855, the \nProfessional Standards for Government Attorneys Act, on April 21, 1999. \nThe Justice Department states that ``S. 855 is a good approach that \naddresses the two most significant problems caused by the McDade \nAmendment--confusion about what rule applies and the issue of contacts \nwith represented parties.'' (Justice Department Response, dated \nNovember 17, 1999, to Written Questions of Senator Leahy).\n  Since that time, I have conferred with the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee about crafting an alternative to the McDade law. This \nalternative would adhere to a basic concern of proponents of the McDade \nprovision: the Department of Justice would not have the authority it \nhas long claimed to write its own ethics rules. The legislation would \nestablish that the Department may not unilaterally exempt federal trial \nlawyers from the rules of ethics adopted by the federal courts. \nFederal--not state--courts are the more appropriate body to establish \nrules of professional responsibility for federal prosecutors, not only \nbecause federal courts have traditional authority to establish such \nrules for federal practitioners generally, but because the Department \nlacks the requisite objectivity.\n  The measure would reflect the traditional understanding that when \nlawyers handle cases before a federal court, they should be subject to \nthe federal court's rules of professional responsibility, and not to \nthe possibly inconsistent rules of other jurisdictions. But \nincorporating this ordinary choice-of-law principle, the measure would \npreserve the federal courts' traditional authority to oversee the \nprofessional conduct of federal trial lawyers, including federal \nprosecutors. It thus would avoid the uncertainties presented by the \nMcDade provision, which subjects federal prosecutors to state laws, \nrules of criminal procedure, and judicial decisions that differ from \nexisting federal law.\n  The measure would also address the most pressing contemporary \nquestion of government attorney ethics--namely, the question of which \nrule should govern government attorneys' communications with \nrepresented persons. It asks the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed uniform national rule \nto govern this area of professional conduct, and to study the need for \nadditional national rules to\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\ngovern other areas in which the proliferation of local rules may \ninterfere with effective federal law enforcement. The Rules Enabling \nAct process is the ideal one for developing such rules, both because \nthe federal judiciary traditionally is responsible for overseeing the \nconduct of lawyers in federal court proceedings, and because this \nprocess would best provide the Supreme Court an opportunity fully to \nconsider and objectively to weigh all relevant considerations.\n  The problems posed to federal law enforcement investigations and \nprosecutions by the current McDade law are real with real consequences \nfor the health and safety of Americans. I urge the Chairmen of the \nHouse and Senate Judiciary Committees, and my other colleagues, to work \nwith me to resolve those problems in a constructive and fair manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4449-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING THOSE WHO DIED ON D-DAY\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as we approach the 56th Anniversary of D-\nDay, June 6th, 1944, we should pause to reflect on the valor and \nsacrifice of the men who died on the beaches of Normandy. In the \nvanguard of the force that landed on that June morning, was the 116th \nInfantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division. In 1944 the 116th Infantry \nRegiment, as it is today, was a National Guard unit mustering at the \narmory in Bedford, Virginia. They drew their members from a town of \nonly 3,200 people and the rich country in central Virginia nestled in \nthe cool shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n  On the morning of June 6th, 1944, Company A led the 116th Infantry \nRegiment and the 29th Infantry Division ashore, landing on Omaha Beach \nin the face of withering enemy fire. Within minutes, the company \nsuffered ninety-six percent casualties, to include twenty-one killed in \naction. Before nightfall, two more sons of Bedford from Companies C and \nF perished in the desperate fighting to gain a foothold on the blood-\nsoaked beachhead. On D-Day, the town of Bedford, Virginia gave more of \nher sons to the defense of freedom and the defeat of dictatorship, than \nany other community (per capita) in the nation. It is fitting that \nBedford is home to the national D-Day Memorial. But we must remember \nthat this memorial represents not just a day or a battle--it is a \nmarker that represents individual soldiers like the men of the 116th \nInfantry Regiment--every one a father, son, or brother. Each sacrifice \nhas a name, held dear in the hearts of a patriotic Virginia town--\nBedford.\n  Mr. President, in memory of the men from Bedford, Virginia who died \non June 6th, 1944, I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed \nin the Record at the end of my statement as a tribute to the town of \nBedford, and every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine who has made the \nsupreme sacrifice in the service of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               COMPANY A\n\n       Leslie C. Abbott, Jr., Wallace R. Carter, John D. Clifton, \n     Andrew J. Coleman, Frank P.

Mr. President, as an original co-sponsor of Senator \nMoynihan's resolution commemorating the 10th anniversary of the free \nand fair elections in Burma which were overturned by a military junta, \nI rise today to mark that event and to discuss the repressive \nconditions that have dominated the lives of the Burmese people for the \npast 37 years and that continue to define the terms of their existence \nto this very day.\n  For the past 12 years, a brutal authoritarian regime has denied the \nBurmese people the most basic human freedoms, including the rights of \nfree speech, press, assembly, and the right to determine their own \npolitical destiny through free and competitive elections.\n  In 1988, the government led by General Ne Win--who overthrew the \npopularly elected government of Burma in 1962--brutally suppressed \npopular pro-democracy demonstrations. In September of that same year, \nthe Government, in a futile public relations gambit to deflect \ninternational censure, reorganized itself into a junta of senior \nmilitary officers and renamed itself the State Law and Order \nRestoration Council (SLORC).\n  The SLORC seemed to bow to international opinion in 1990, when it \npermitted a relatively free election for a national parliament, \nannouncing before the election that it would peacefully transfer power \nto the elected assembly.\n  Burmese voters overwhelmingly supported anti-government parties, one \nof which, the National League for Democracy (NLD)--the party of Aung-\nSan Suu-Kyi--won more than 60 percent of the popular vote and 80 \npercent of the parliamentary seats.\n  SLORC's public promises were a fiction. The military junta nullified \nthe results of the elections and thwarted efforts by NLD \nrepresentatives and others elected in 1990 to convene the rightfully \nelected parliament.\n  Instead, SLORC convened a government-controlled body, the National \nConvention, with the goal of approving a constitution to ensure that \nthe armed forces would have a dominant role in the nation's future \npolitical structure. The NLD has declined to participate in the \nNational Convention since 1995, perceiving it to be nothing more than a \ntool of the ruling military elite.\n  SLORC reorganized itself again in 1997, changing its name to the \nState Peace and Development Council (SPDC). But an oppressive regime by \nany other name remains an oppressive regime. Burma continues to be \nruled by a non-elected military clique, this time headed by General \nThan Shwe. And, even though Ne Win ostensibly relinquished power after \nthe 1988 pro-democracy demonstrations, in reality, he continues to \nwield informal, if declining, influence.\n  To this day, Burma continues to be ruled by fiat, denied both a valid \nconstitution and a legislature representing the people.\n  To solidify its hold on power and suppress Burma's widespread \ngrassroots democracy movement, the military junta--whether it be named \nSLORC or the SPDC--has engaged in a campaign of systematic human rights \nabuses throughout the 1990s. It has been aided in this effort by the \narmed forces--whose ranks have swelled from 175,000 to 400,000 \nsoldiers--and the Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI), \na military and security apparatus that pervades almost every aspect of \na Burmese citizen's life.\n  For many in Burma, the prospect for life has become nasty, brutish, \nand short. Citizens continue to live a tenuous life, subject at any \ntime and without appeal to the arbitrary and too often brutal dictates \nof a military regime. There continue to be numerous credible reports, \nparticularly in areas populated mostly by ethnic minority, of \nextrajudicial killings and rape. Disappearances happen with sickening \nregularity. Security forces torture, beat, and otherwise abuse \ndetainees. Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Arbitrary \narrest and detention for holding dissenting political views remains a \nfact of life. Since 1962, thousands of people have been arrested, \ndetained, and imprisoned for political reasons, or they have \n``disappeared''. Reportedly, more than 1,300 political prisoners \nlanguished in Burmese prisons at the end of 1998.\n  The Burmese judiciary is an SPDC tool. Security forces still \nsystematically monitor citizens' movements and communications, search \nhomes without warrants, relocate persons forcibly without just \ncompensation or due process, use excessive force, and violate \ninternational humanitarian law in internal conflicts against ethnic \ninsurgencies.\n  The SPDC severely restricts freedom of speech and of the press, and \nrestricts academic freedom: since 1996, government fear of political \ndissent has meant the closing of most Burmese institutions of higher \nlearning. And even verbal criticism of the government is an offense \ncarrying a 20-year sentence.\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\n  And while the SPDC claims it recognizes the NLD as a legal entity, it \nrefuses to recognize the legal political status of key NLD party \nleaders, particularly General-Secretary and 1991 Nobel Laureate Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and her two co-chairs. The SPDC constrains their activities \nseverely through security measures and threats.\n  The SPDC restricts freedom of religion. It exercises \ninstitutionalized control over Buddhist clergy and promotes \ndiscrimination against non-Buddhist religions. It forbids the existence \nof domestic human rights organizations and remains hostile to outside \nscrutiny of its human rights record. Violence and societal \ndiscrimination against women remain problems, as does severe child \nneglect, the forced labor of children, and lack of funding and \nfacilities for education.\n  In sum, as the latest biannual State Department report on:\n\n       Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Towards Burma notes, \n     over the last six months the SPDC has made no progress toward \n     greater democratization, nor has it made any progress toward \n     fundamental improvement in the quality of life of the people \n     of Burma. The regime continues to repress the National League \n     for Democracy . . . and attack its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, \n     in the state-controlled press.\n\n  Burma's political repressiveness is matched only by its poverty. \nBurma's population is thought to be about 48 million--we can only rely \non estimates because government restrictions make accurate counts \nimpossible. The average per capita income was estimated to be about \n$300 in 1998, about $800 if considered on the basis of purchasing power \nparity.\n  Things do not have to be this way. Burma has rich agricultural, \nfishing, and timber resources. It has abundant mineral resources--gas, \noil, and gemstones. The world's finest jade comes from Burma. But the \neconomic deck is stacked against Burma.\n  Three decades of military rule and economic mismanagement have \ncreated widespread waste, loss, and suffering. Economic policy is \nsuddenly reversed for political reasons. Development is killed by overt \nand covert state involvement in economic activity, state monopolization \nof leading exports, a bloated bureaucracy, arbitrary and opaque \ngovernance, institutionalized corruption, and poor human and physical \ninfrastructure. Smuggling is rampant; the destruction of the \nenvironment goes on unabated. Decades of disproportionately large \nmilitary budgets have meant scant spending on social development and \neconomic infrastructure.\n  There is no price stability. The Burmese currency, the Kyat, is \nworthless. There is a telling anecdote about this: one year, Burma \nasked the U.K., then its primary foreign aid donor, to give it paper so \nthat it could print more Kyat because the Kyat was so devalued that \nBurma could not afford to buy the paper needed to print it. Imagine, \nthe paper was worth more as paper than as money. I don't know if the \nstory is true or not. The point is that in Burma's case, it easily \ncould have been. In 1998-1999, the official exchange rate was 6 Kyat to \none dollar; the black market rate was 341 Kyat to the dollar. This says \nit all.\n  I could go on and on. But I don't need to. We all know that Burma's \neconomy is a basket case. We all know that, for the Burmese people, \nmere existence, not life, is the norm. We all know that Burma cannot \nexpect to begin the road to recovery, prosperity, and long term \neconomic stability as long as the basic human rights and political will \nof the Burmese people are denied.\n  The questions before us now are: what tools do we have for stopping \nthis government's inhumanity toward its own citizens and for giving \nhope to the Burmese people? Are the tools we are now using the correct \nones?\n  The debate over unilateral sanctions represents a fundamental \nquestion in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy: Are U.S. interests \nadvanced best by deepening relations or diminishing relations with a \ncountry that is not acting as we would like?\n  I do not endorse sanctions as a panacea. Each case must be considered \non its own merits.\n  In Burma, I believe the United States government had a responsibility \nto respond to a situation in which the democratically-elected leaders \nhad been summarily thrown out of office, assaulted, and imprisoned by \nrenegade militarists.\n  Consequently, in 1996, then-Senator Cohen and I coauthored the \ncurrent sanctions legislation on Burma. The Cohen-Feinstein amendment \nrequired the President to ban new investment by U.S. firms in Burma if \nhe determined that the Government of Burma has physically harmed, \nrearrested for political acts, or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed \nlarge-scale repression or violence against the Democratic opposition.\n  Shortly after Congress passed the Cohen-Feinstein Amendment, \nPresident Clinton implemented sanctions against Burma.\n  Unfortunately, since Cohen-Feinstein went into effect on October 1, \n1996 there appears to be little improvement in human rights conditions \nin Burma: The SPDC continues to implement its repressive policies.\n  Nevertheless, until the SPDC shows a willingness to make progress \ntowards democracy and improved human rights, the Cohen-Feinstein \nsanctions must remain in place.\n  The sanctions make us a leader on Burma and in forging a common \ninternational position. I believe, for example, that the European Union \nwould have a much softer line on Burma if not for U.S. policy. The EU \nhas no economic sanctions in place, but has taken some other measures, \nsuch as a visa ban for members of the SPDC government and support of \nthe U.S. in introducing the annual United Nations Human Rights \nCommittee resolution on Burma. The United States must continue trying \nto develop a multilateral approach, particularly with the ASEAN \nnations, to bring additional pressure to bear on the SLORC.\n  There is some indication that the sanctions are causing some \nhardships for the SPDC. For example, last year the SPDC let the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross back into Burma under \nconditions the ICRC found acceptable, including access to prisons and \nprisoners. Although there was no clear link to the impact of sanctions \nin getting the ICRC back in, some analysts contend that the SPDC is \nheeding international pressure. This may indicate that the SPDC could \nbe willing to make some positive changes, even though it is still an \nopen question if they will change the ``core behavior'' that triggered \nthe sanctions to begin with.\n  The bottom line is that the current sanctions should not be lifted \nwithout some major concession by the SPDC. To lift any sanctions \nwithout a concession would send the wrong signal and give the SPDC the \nmessage that they could continue to stifle democracy.\n  We should make it clear that the United States stands on the side of \ndemocracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Burma. We should make \nit clear that the United States stands on the side of Aung San Suu Kyi \nand the National League of Democracy and that we support their efforts \nto return Burma and its government to the people.\n  I am pleased to co-sponsor Senator Moynihan's resolution which \ncommemorates the 10th anniversary of the free and fair elections in \nBurma, and calls on the SPDC to: guarantee basic freedoms to the people \nof Burma; accept political dialogue with the National League for \nDemocracy; comply with UN human rights agreements; and reaffirms U.S. \nsanctions as appropriate to secure the restoration of democracy.\n  I look forward to the day when the United States has cause to lift \nthe Cohen-Feinstein sanctions and welcome Burma into the community of \nfree nations. In the interim, I urge my colleagues to support the \nMoynihan resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4450-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4450-S4451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONFIRMATION OF NICHOLAS G.

Mr. President, each year, on the third Saturday in May, \nthe nation expresses appreciation and gratitude to our military. In \nLouisiana, we are proud of our men and women in uniform and have a \nlong-standing tradition of honoring them every year. We are proud of \nthe military in times of war, and we are proud of the military in times \nof peace. We know that without our fighting men and women ``life, \nliberty and the pursuit of happiness'' would be just hollow words. \nSince the birth of our Nation, America's Armed Forces has served the \nUnited States with honor, courage, and distinction, both at home and \nabroad. America's patriots have assumed a sacred duty, understanding \nthat our history, our heritage, and our honor, require us to bear the \nburdens of sacrifice. We acknowledge and applaud their selfless \nservice, courage, and dedication to duty.\n  Today, thousands of troops are deployed throughout the world, \noperating in every time zone, and in every climate defending our \nfreedom. Our sailors and Marines are aboard ships and submarines in the \nAdriatic. Our Air Force and Navy pilots fly the perilous skies over \nIraq. Our soldiers keep the vigil and preserve the peace in the former \nYugoslavia. They do it to promote American values: democracy and \nfreedom from the oppression of demagogues, tyrants and totalitarian \ngovernments. The peace and freedom so longed for by people throughout \nthe world often starts over here, on American soil. When our Armed \nForces go overseas, they take with them our national values: a \ntradition of democracy and a love of individual liberty. Our service \nmembers are truly freedom's ambassadors.\n  So on behalf of the state of Louisiana and a grateful nation, we \nthank you. We thank you for all that you give to us every day of your \nlives. We thank those serving on active duty, those standing by in the \nReserves and National Guard, and we thank all family members for their \npatience and their sacrifices. Thank you for your devotion to duty, for \nyour loyalty, for your courage and for your patriotic and profound love \nof country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4451-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4451-S4452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL MISSING CHILDREN DAY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to promote awareness of \nmissing children and honor those who work to search and rescue the \nthousands of children who disappear each year. As my colleagues may \nknow, today is recognized as National Missing Children Day.\n  In proclaiming the first National Missing Children Day in 1983, \nPresident Ronald Reagan noted, ``Our children are the Nation's most \nvaluable and most vulnerable asset. They are our link to the future, \nour hope for a better life. Their protection and safety must be one of \nour highest priorities.'' Since that time, National Missing Children \nDay has been a reminder that we must strengthen our resolve to keep \nchildren safe.\n  I believe that the Federal Government can help state and local law \nenforcement agencies reunite missing and runaway children with their \nfamilies. In particular, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children \nProtection Act enacted by Congress last year is an example of an \neffective federal and state partnership that reduces crime and prevents \nmissing children cases. This law reauthorized the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and the Runaway and Homeless Youth \nProgram through fiscal year 2003 and provides local communities with \nthe resources to find missing children and prevent child victimization.\n  In my home state, the Jacob Wetterling Foundation and Missing \nChildren Minnesota have worked effectively to locate missing children \nand raise public awareness about ways to prevent child abduction and \nsexual exploitation. Additionally, the Minnesota Association of Runaway \nYouth Services, comprising eighteen nonprofit agencies in Minnesota, \nhas been instrumental in providing services to runaway and homeless \nyouth and their families. Their efforts have been guided by the Runaway \nand Homeless Youth Program, which provides resources to community-based \norganizations to provide outreach, temporary shelter, and counseling \neach year to thousands of Minnesota's homeless young people.\n  I am also working to secure federal funding to support the State of \nMinnesota's development of a statewide criminal justice information \nsharing system that would allow police, judges, and other criminal \njustice professionals to communicate quickly about the criminal \nhistories of violent offenders. My proposal will help to provide local \ncommunities with the technology to identify criminals and protect our \ncommunities from sexual predators and violent offenders.\n  As chairman of the Minnesota House Crime Prevention Committee, \nRepresentative Rich Stanek recently led the effort to pass ``Katie's \nLaw''--legislation that will provide state funding for an integrated \ncriminal justice system. I greatly appreciate Representative Stanek's \ndedication to improving the Minnesota criminal justice system and the \nopportunity to work with him on this very important public safety \ninitiative.\n  Mr. President, I again commend the numerous volunteers, \norganizations, businesses, state legislators, and government agencies \nwho all work on a daily basis to find missing children. I look forward \nto our continued work together.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate this very special \nday, National Missing Children's Day. Proclaimed by President Ronald \nReagan in 1983 and honored by every administration since, May 25th is \nthe day 6 year old Ethan Patz disappeared from a New York City street \ncorner on his way to school in 1979. His case remains unsolved and is \nan annual reminder to the nation to renew efforts to reunite missing \nchildren with their families and make child protection a national \npriority. As a mother of two beautiful children, I cannot imagine what \nI would do if my children were missing. All of us with children know \nthat this a parent's greatest nightmare. Yet every 18 seconds a child \ndisappears, and so each day over three thousand parents go through the \nterror of losing their child.\n  The Theme of this year's National Missing Children's Day is ``Picture \nthem Home.'' This national public awareness campaign is aimed at \nencouraging the public at large to be aware of their important role in \nthe recovery of these children. One in six children featured in the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children's photo-distribution \nprogram is recovered as a direct result of someone in the public \nrecognizing the child in the picture and notifying the authorities. \nUnlike so many of our national tragedies, we can do something to help \nreturn a missing child to their families. I urge the American public to \nreally look closely at pictures of missing children they see. The small \ngesture can be the key to reuniting a mother or father with their \nmissing child.\n  In closing, I would like to commend those individuals who were \nhonored this morning by the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren (NCMEC), the Fraternal Order of Police and the Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the U.S. Department of \nJustice Fifth Annual National Missing and Exploited Children's Awards \nCeremony.\n  Sergeant Investigator Awilda Cartagena, Texas Dept. of Public \nSafety--For the recovery of Johnny Tello, a family abduction victim \nfrom Dallas, Texas, after a six-year search.

Jill \nHill, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Little Rock, Arkansas--For the \nlocation and recovery of non-family abduction victim, three-year-old \nDestiny Leann Richards, who was kidnapped from her home in Mabelvale, \nArkansas, on June 11, 1999, and located in a wooded area the next \nevening following extensive ground searches.

Mr. President, one of the myths dear to President \nClinton's heart these days is that the government of Russia has been \n``a supportive and reliable partner in the effort to bring peace and \nstability to the Balkans.'' That myth was shattered once again earlier \nthis month when a war criminal indicted by the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY, was hosted in Moscow--not by \nRussia's criminal underworld--but by the Kremlin itself.\n  General Dragolub Ojdanic, Minister of Defense of the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia, visited Moscow for nearly a week earlier this month--\nfrom May 7-12, 2000. He was there as a guest of the government of the \nRussian Federation and enjoyed the privilege of attending President \nVladimir Putin's inauguration ceremonies.\n  As Slobodan Milosevic's military Chief of Staff during the Kosovo \nwar, General Ojdanic was directly responsible for the Serbian \nmilitary's ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo. For this, the General \nwas indicted by the ICTY for crimes against humanity and violations of \nthe laws and customs of war for alleged atrocities against Albanians in \nKosovo.\n  Mr. President, the ICTY has issued international warrants for General \nOjdanic's arrest and extradition to The Hague. The Russian Federation, \na permanent member of the United Nations Security Council which \nestablished the ICTY, has an obligation to arrest General Ojdanic and \nextradite him to The Hague if and when they have the opportunity.\n  But what did President Putin and his regime do when Ojdanic was in \nMoscow? Instead of arresting and sending him to The Hague, they \nprovided a week of fine food and camaraderie and a privileged seat at \nthe Putin inauguration!\n  What truly disturbs me, Mr. President, is that General Ojdanic's \nvisit was not just for fun. He was there to work--to reestablish the \nlinks between the Milosevic regime and the Kremlin. While in Moscow, he \nheld official talks with Defense Minister Sergeyev, Army Chief of Staff \nAnatoly Kvashnin, and Foreign Minister Ivanov.\n  On May 16, four days after General Ojdanic's visit to Moscow, Russia \nannounced that it has provided the Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic \nwith $102 million of a $150 million loan. The Russian government also \nannounced that it will facilitate the sale to Serbia of $32 million \nworth of oil, despite the fact that the international community has \nimposed economic sanctions against the Milosevic regime.\n\n  I confess that I am impressed by the audacity of Russian President \nPutin. Here he is, providing the Milosevic regime with over $150 \nmillion in economic support while seeking debt relief from the \ninternational community and loans from the International Monetary Fund. \nHe is doing this while his country seeks and receives food aid from the \nUnited States.\n  What should we conclude from all this?\n  First, President Putin seems comfortable ignoring the requirement to \narrest and transfer indicted war criminals to The Hague. I suppose we \ncan just add this to the long list of international obligations Mr. \nPutin sees fit to disregard.\n  Second, Russia does not share NATO's goals and objectives in bringing \npeace and stability to the Balkans. If it did, its leaders would not be \nso brazenly and warmly supporting senior officials of the Milosevic \nregime.\n  Third, the Kremlin must regard Western, and particularly, U.S. \neconomic assistance and aid to be unconditional. He has evidently \nconcluded that he can conduct his foreign policy with impunity and \nstill count on the West's economic largesse. The fact that the \nhospitality and support provided to these Serbian war criminals occurs \njust one month before President Clinton's visit to Moscow shows how \nlittle respect Putin has for the policies of the United States.\n  Mr. President, what concerns me most about the relationship between \nthe Kremlin and the Milosevic regime is the threat it poses to our men \nand women in uniform serving in the Balkans--and those of our allies. \nThe political support the Kremlin provides Slobodan Milosevic directly \njeopardizes the safety and security of American and allied forces \ndeployed in the Balkans. This outreach by Putin to the Milosevic regime \nonly encourages that brutal dictator to continue his policies of \ndestruction in the Balkans.\n  While we are trying to force the Milosevic regime to step down and to \nturn power over to Serbia's democratic opposition, Russia is signaling \nto Milosevic that he can survive and even outlast the Alliance--and \nthat Russia will help him prevail.\n  It is for these reasons, that I plan to introduce an amendment to the \nforeign operations appropriations bill that will restrict material and \neconomic assistance the United States provides to the Russian \nFederation. There is no reason why the United States should be \nproviding Russia loan forgiveness and economic assistance when the \nKremlin continues to support a regime in Serbia whose forces directly \nthreaten our troops and those of our allies trying to bring peace to \nthe Balkans.\n  This amendment does four things:\n  First, it reduces assistance obligated to the Russian Federation by \nan amount equal in value to the loans, financial assistance, and energy \nsales the Government of the Russian Federation has provided and intends \nto provide to the Milosevic regime.\n  Second, it ensures U.S. opposition to the extension of financial \nassistance to Russia from the International Monetary Fund, the World \nBank and other international financial institutions.\n  Third, it suspends existing programs to Russia provided by the \nExport-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.\n  Fourth, it ensures the United States will oppose proposals to provide \nRussia further forgiveness, restructuring, and rescheduling of its \ninternational debt.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely believe that a partnership with Russia is \npossible and indeed, would serve the interests of both countries. A \nstrategy of engagement, however, cannot and must not ignore reality. \nPartnership cannot occur when Russia blatantly supports a regime that \ncontinues to threaten stability in the Balkans, whose calling cards are \nethnic cleansing and political repression, and that continues to \nthreaten U.S. soldiers in the field.\n  I will be pleased to treat Russia as a responsible partner when it \nbehaves as one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4452-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4452-S4453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIRTHDAY OF KATHERINE ``KITTY'' WILKA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, ``Mother's Day''--that special day when \nchildren the world over celebrate and honor their mothers--falls during \nthe month of May. Appropriately, the month of May is also the month \nwhen one of the most selfless and dedicated mothers I know celebrates \nher birthday. Today, I would like to share the story of that remarkable \nwoman from my home state of South Dakota.\n  I have known and admired Katherine ``Kitty'' Wilka for more than two \ndecades. Today, as she celebrates her 70th birthday, she will be \nsurrounded by numerous family members and friends. Kitty Wilka is the \nmother of 12, the grandmother of 29 and, as of last week, the great-\ngrandmother of 3. But it is not just the size of the Wilka family that \nis noteworthy. It is also the quality of their character and the \ndiversity of their accomplishments.\n  Kitty Wilka and her late husband, Bill, led by example and instilled \nadmirable values in all their children. Widowed for over a decade, \nKitty is the\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nheart and soul of her extended family. She is a role model for her \nchildren and grandchildren. Her life example epitomizes both the love \nof family and commitment to community.\n  Kitty has raised public servants, community and church leaders and \nbusiness owners. After working for 18 years at McKennan Hospital in \nSioux Falls, she continues to contribute to her community, volunteering \nat St. Lambert's Catholic Church and its school.\n  I must confess that I have personally benefitted from the Wilka \nfamily's belief in public service. Kitty's son, Jeff, has volunteered \nin my Sioux Falls office since my first election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1978.\n  Born with cerebral palsy, Jeff grew up with a positive attitude and a \ndetermination to be involved in his community. He has been a loyal, \ndedicated and valued member of my Sioux Falls staff for over two \ndecades. In fact, Jeff has become a fixture of sorts, having the second \nlongest running tenure on my staff.\n  With the help of his loving mother and close-knit family, Jeff has \novercome many obstacles in his life, including physical ailments that \nrequired surgery and therapy, and a dependency on alcohol. He has been \nsober for 11 years and is an ardent worker on behalf of many civic \ncauses, including the Children's Care Hospital and School, the March of \nDimes and Easter Seals. He also has a deeply held faith in our \nelectoral process, working in the political trenches for many years for \na variety of local, state and federal candidates in whose philosophy he \nbelieves.\n  I am proud of what Jeff has accomplished and the significant \nchallenges he has overcome. I think he would be the first to tell you \nthat his successes have been based upon the solid Midwestern values \nthat Kitty and Bill Wilka instilled in him and his siblings. They \ntaught their children to work hard, to never give up and to do their \npart to improve the communities in which they live. It is clear that \nJeff has taken those lessons to heart.\n  Kitty Wilka has much to be proud of in her life. And I know that her \nloving family is extremely proud of her. I want to join her 12 \nchildren, 29 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren in wishing Kitty \nthe very best on her birthday. She deserves it.\n  Happy 70th birthday, Kitty!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4453-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate passed \nConcurrent Resolution 116, commending Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. \nThe resolution notes the original reason Israel was forced to occupy a \nnarrow security strip in southern Lebanon--constant attacks on Israeli \ncivilians from Lebanon-based terror groups. Israel had no designs on \nLebanese territory; the Jerusalem government was forced to do the job \nthat the central Lebanese authorities were unable or unwilling to \nperform.\n  Lebanon is in a sad situation. It is a nation torn by sectarian \nstrife, occupied by tens of thousands of Syrian troops, and overrun \nwith terrorists. In the final analysis, however, the government of \nLebanon must be called to account. For more than two decades, the \ninternational community has bemoaned Lebanon's fate without demanding \nresponsible leadership. That era is now over.\n  There are Christians and Muslins in southern Lebanon whose fate hangs \nin the balance. They have been under the protection of Israel for more \nthan two decades. What will happen to them? Will they be subject to the \nwhims of yet another Lebanese militia, a Hezbollah state within a \nstate? Will Christians be forced to flee, as they have from the West \nBank and from so many other states? Or will the Lebanese central \ngovernment and the Lebanese Army, as required under United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions, take control of southern Lebanon and \nensure safety and security for all?\n  Will the Lebanese government allow the United Nations and UNIFIL to \ndo its job and deployment throughout the South? Or will Lebanon remain \na pawn in the hands of terrorists, a puppet state in the hands of Syria \nand Iran? This is the test. The President and the Congress have \ndemanded that Lebanon secure its southern border and reintegrate \nsouthern Lebanese into the country. Hezbollah must be disarmed. The \nSyrian military must be evicted. The world is watching and the time is \nnow.\n  The citizens of northern Israel--indeed all Israelis--deserve to live \nwithin secure borders in peace. If they cannot, it is the solemn \nobligation of the Israeli government to secure those borders and to \nhunt down those who violate it and eliminate them. For my part as a \nUnited States Senator, I intend to do all that I can to support Israel \nin that aim, and to ensure that the means and the political, diplomatic \nand material support are at hand for the Israeli government to do just \nthat.\n  This month could be a turning point for Lebanon, for Syria and for \nIsrael. Or it could be the beginning of a new cycle of conflict. I pray \nthat the Lebanese and the Syrians will be smart enough to seize the \nopportunity for real peace in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4453-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4453-S4454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING FREE ELECTIONS IN CROATIA\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues, Senators \nFeingold, Hutchinson, Abraham, and Lieberman, to introduce a resolution \ncongratulating the people of Croatia on their successful parliamentary \nand presidential elections, the peaceful transition of power, and new \ninitiatives for reform. In addition to congratulating the people of \nCroatia, the resolution solidifies U.S. support for their progress and \nencourages Croatian participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace \nprogram. One day, I hope that we will be expressing our support for \nCroatia, and other nations with similar democratic inclination, in NATO \nitself.\n  Mr. President, the Balkan nations that are embracing democracy must \nbe supported at every opportunity available because the government \ncould so easily have taken the other path. The leaders of Croatia could \nhave chosen to repress popular involvement and other fundamental rights \nof democracy, but instead they have chosen the harder but correct path \nof working through discourse, debate, and democracy. Because we have \nalso been through these trials as a nation, it is my hope that the \nAmerican people will watch closely the progress of the Croatian people \nand will support their path to freedom, stability, and peace.\n  The most important benefit to come out of this election will \nhopefully be the resolution of Croatia's domestic difficulties. Through \nthe successful election, the Croatian people have taken the reins of \ncontrol. In addition to the power instilled by this self-determination, \nthe Croatian people are hopefully now spurred to take up the mission of \nreform that might further improve their government. Among the stated \ngoals of President Mesic are the reintroduction of Serbian refugees to \nthe homes they left behind, reform of the privatization system that has \nfaced serious corruption allegations, and support for the International \nCriminal\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. These improvements would certainly \ngo far to legitimize the new Administration in the view of the \ninternational community but more importantly, in the eyes of the \nCroatian people. President Mesic's continued efforts on these fronts \nwill show its people that their new government takes seriously the need \nfor honesty and accountability.\n  As the government wins the support of its people, I am also \nencouraged by the efforts of the new Administration to get involved \nwith the European community. In such a volatile region, a nation \nuniting the many groups will be the key to fostering a stable political \nand economic atmosphere. Part of the victory of democracy in Croatia \nhas been the new spirit of regional harmony that I hope will spread to \nits neighbors. Peace in the Balkan nations will only come with honest \nattempts to live with difference, and Croatia will be a leader in the \nefforts for peace there.\n  In addition to better conditions in the Balkans, democracy will \nencourage the involvement of other foreign nations. Just two weeks ago, \nCroatian President Stipe Mesic met with French President Jacques Chirac \nto discuss an agreement on stabilization and association, as well as \nthe Croatian entrance to the NATO Partnership for Peace program. The \nresolution I am supporting today suggests U.S. support for the addition \nof Croatia in the partnership, and I am happy to inform my colleagues \nthat the nations of NATO have announced that Croatia will become a full \nmember of the Partnership for Peace program today. This is truly a \ngreat accomplishment, and it affirms the commitment of all NATO allies \nto help Croatia in its chosen path.\n  In addition to my appreciation for the democratic and international \nprogress of the Croatian people, I would also like to take this \nopportunity to thank the work of the Croatian American Association in \nbringing this subject to my attention and to the attention of the \nAmerican people. The Croatian American community has worked tirelessly \nto create bonds of friendship between our two nations, and I hope that \nas Croatia becomes more democratic and involved in worldwide political \naffairs that we, as Americans, will continue to support them.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this resolution will be an additional bond \nbetween two nations that democratic tenets have already joined.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4454-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ROLLING THUNDER'S 13TH ANNUAL RIDE FOR FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to recognize the 13th \nAnnual Rolling Thunder ``Ride for Freedom'' and highlight the important \nrole Rolling Thunder plays in making sure that our nation's POW/MIAs \nare honored and never forgotten.\n  The first time that Rolling Thunder's Ride for Freedom roared and \nrumbled its way to the Vietnam Memorial on Memorial Day 1988, 2,400 \nmotorcycles banded together for the ride. Some 5,000 Veterans, their \nwives, children, and other citizens of all backgrounds gathered near \nthe Vietnam Memorial Wall to honor and remember our nation's POW/MIAs. \nSince then, Rolling Thunder has grown into an international event that \ngarners national attention and focuses it on remembering our POW/MIAs. \nIn fact, Rolling Thunder has become such a large presence that anyone \nwho happens to be anywhere near our nation's Capital cannot help but \nnotice it. For example, last year's Rolling Thunder run included over \n250,000 motorcycles and 400,000 participants. There were people at last \nyear's run from every state in the nation, and many foreign countries \nincluding Canada, England, Germany, France, Austria, Holland, South \nKorea, Australia and New Zealand. Made up of over 40 Chapters \nthroughout the United States, Rolling Thunder is a volunteer, non-\nprofit organization.\n  I would like to thank the several organizations whose support and \nefforts have helped make Rolling Thunder possible here in Washington \nD.C. for the past twelve years: the Virginia Police, Virginia State \nPolice, Maryland Police, D.C. Metropolitan Police, Park Police, Park \nServices and the Pentagon.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to highlight some legislation I \nsponsored and Rolling Thunder supports. Rolling Thunder's input and \nsupport has been invaluable to the legislative process.\n  The first bill I want to mention is S. 484, the Bring Them Home Alive \nAct of 1999. This legislation would grant asylum in the United States \nto foreign nationals from key countries who personally deliver a living \nAmerican POW/MIA from either the Vietnam War or the Korean War to the \nUnited States.\n  A key section of this bill would help spread news of the Bring Them \nHome Alive Act around the world. This is needed to help make sure that \nthe key foreign nationals who need to hear about this act, hear about \nit. The bill calls on the International Broadcasting Bureau to use its \nassets, including WORLDNET Television and its Internet sites, to spread \nthe news. The bill also calls on Voice of America, Radio Free Europe \nand Radio Free Asia to participate.\n  If this bill leads to even one long-held POW/MIA being returned home \nto America alive this effort will be well worth it--10,000 times over. \nEven though it has been decades since these two wars ended, they have \nnot ended for any Americans who may have been left behind and are still \nalive or their families and friends. As long as there remains even the \nslightest possibility that there may be surviving POWs in these \nregions, we owe it to our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines to do \neverything possible to bring them home alive. This is the least we can \ndo after all they have sacrificed.\n  Today, I am especially pleased to announce that S. 484 passed the \nSenate last Wednesday, May 24th. Now we need to get it passed in the \nHouse of Representatives and enacted into law.\n  Rolling Thunder was also helpful in getting another important bill \nenacted into law, the National POW-MIA Recognition Act, legislation I \nsponsored in the 105th Congress.\n  This law requires that the POW-MIA flag be displayed on important \nnational buildings--all across America--on six important days. These \ndays include: Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Independence Day, Armed \nForces Day, Flag Day and National POW-MIA Recognition Day.\n  Rolling Thunder captures the American people's attention--and those \nelected to represent them--and then brightly focuses our attention on \nremembrance of, and continuing duty to, our nation's POWs and MIAs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4454-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4454-S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   H.R. 4489 IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE DATA MANAGEMENT \n                        IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor H.R. 4489, the ``Immigration and Naturalization Service Data \nManagement Improvement Act of 2000.'' Passage of this legislation will \nrepeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 and prevent it from ever being implemented.\n  Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration law was intended to track \nindividuals who overstay their legally permissible visit in the U.S. \nHowever, to accomplish that well-intentioned goal, this law required \nall foreign travelers or U.S. permanent residents to be individually \nrecorded at ports of entry. In practical effect, the provisions would \nbring traffic to a halt on the Canadian border for miles.\n  Those of us who represent states along the Canadian border are well-\naware of the close bonds between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S.-Canadian \nborder is the longest continuous open border in the free world and \nCanadians come into our country freely and easily under current U.S. \npolicy. In Maine, our ties with Canada are particularly deep because \nmany Mainers' extended families live across the border in Canada. Our \ncurrent border-crossing policy allows these family members to quickly \nand easily cross the border every day in order to be with a husband, \nwife, a brother, a sister, cousin or even in-laws as the case may be.\n  Canada is not only our friend and ally, but our largest trading \npartner--it is important to maintain and foster our relationship with \nour neighbor to the North by promoting U.S.-Canadian friendship and \ntrade. The ill-thought out provisions passed as part of the 1996 \nimmigration law would grossly delay\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\nall those crossing the Northern border from Canada, and injure the \nNorthern economy as critical trade and travel routes are slowed. In my \nState of Maine, this new border policy would have the most immediate \nimpact on border communities such as Calais, Houlton, Madawaska, Fort \nKent, and Jackman. Businesses in these communities rely on Canadians to \ncross the border each and every day in order to buy their goods and \nservices. In addition, the impact on critical Maine trade, including \nlumber and tourism, would extend beyond these communities and \nreverberate across my State.\n  The bill we consider today, H.R. 4489, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000, repeals \nSection 110 of the Immigration law. In its place, the bill directs the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to amass data already collected \nat entrance and departure points in an electronically searchable \nmanner. The legislation explicitly states no new documentary \nrequirements or data collection can be directed as a result of the \npassage of this bill, ensuring that INS new database will rely on \nalready available data.\n  Those of us who represent the northern regions of our country have \nbeen working for over four years now to repeal Section 110. With the \nsupport of Senate colleagues, the deadline for implementation of the \nentry/exit control system for land and sea points of entry has been \npostponed until March 31, 2001. But until now, we have been unable to \nbreak the impasse that left Section 110 in place. I salute all the \nefforts which have yielded this ground breaking agreement today, \nparticularly the hard work of Senator Abraham who has worked tirelessly \non this issue. I look forward to passage of H.R. 4489, and a final end \nto the threat to the economy posed by Section 110 of the 1996 \nImmigration law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4455-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DASCHLE AMENDMENT NO. 3148\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on May 16, 2000, the United States Senate \ntook a procedural vote on Senator Daschle's amendment to S. 2521, the \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Bill. Senator Daschle lost this \nprocedural vote by a vote of 42-54.\n  I did not support the Daschle amendment at that time because it was a \nprocedural amendment to an unrelated bill. This unrelated Daschle \namendment kept the Senate away all day from the important business of \nthe Military Construction Appropriations Bill. In addition, it appeared \nthat the Daschle amendment might indefinitely delay consideration of \nthis important bill. As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I have a responsibility to secure passage of the important \nMilitary Construction Appropriations Bill. This bill provides \ncritically needed funding for military construction projects, improves \nthe quality of life for the men and women who are serving our country \nin the armed forces, and sustains the readiness of our armed forces. \nThese areas are traditionally underfunded, and this bill provides the \nnecessary funds to help make up for this shortfall. For these reasons, \nI did not support the Daschle amendment when it came before me on a \nprocedural vote on May 16, 2000.\n  Subsequent to the procedural vote on the Daschle amendment on May 16, \n2000, Senators Lott and Daschle reached an agreement to have two up or \ndown votes--one on the aforementioned Daschle amendment and another on \nan amendment to be offered by Senator Lott. Under the agreement, debate \non the amendments was limited by a time agreement.\n  Once this leadership agreement was reached, it became apparent that \nthe Daschle amendment would no longer indefinitely delay the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Bill. Therefore, my previous objections to \nthis amendment were no longer relevant.\n  The Daschle amendment is a ``Sense of the Senate'' amendment. After \nstating a number of findings, the amendment states, among other things, \nthat it is the Sense of the Senate that ``Congress should immediately \npass a conference report to accompany'' the Juvenile Justice Bill that \nincludes the Senate passed gun-related provisions.\n  During the Senate's debate of the Juvenile Justice Bill in May of \n1999, I supported the Lautenberg amendment, and other amendments to \nclose the gun show loophole in the Brady Act. I also supported an \namendment to require licensed firearm dealers to provide a secure gun \nstorage or safety device when a handgun is sold, delivered or \ntransferred. Unfortunately, the Juvenile Justice Bill has been locked \nin a House and Senate Conference Committee.\n  I remain firm in my stance on these issues. I certainly hope that \nHouse and Senate conferees can reach an agreement in conference on the \nJuvenile Justice Bill. And, I will continue to support the common-sense \ngun provisions that passed the Senate during the Juvenile Justice \ndebate. I believe the Senate passed gun-related amendments to the \nJuvenile Justice Bill will help keep guns out of the hands of convicted \nfelons and increase public safety without infringing on the rights of \nlaw-abiding citizens. Therefore, when it became clear that the Daschle \namendment would not indefinitely delay consideration of the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Bill, I supported this amendment and voted \nfor it on May 17, 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4455-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4455-S4456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        SENATOR LANDRIEU WELCOMES HIS EXCELLENCY, MUGUR ISARESCU\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to extend a warm welcome to His Excellency, Mugur Isarescu, \nthe Prime Minister of Romania. Prime Minister Isarescu's visit is very \nwell-timed. United States' policy in the Balkans is at a decisive \npoint. We took an extremely important vote in the Senate last week that \nserved as a litmus test for our commitment to the region. I am relieved \nat the results. Ultimately, the United States did not sent the wrong \nsignal to Serbia about our intentions. However, the amendment by the \nSenior Senators from Virginia and West Virginia, gave the Senate the \nopportunity to reevaluate our role in the Balkans. The debate of that \namendment highlighted the need to establish a more coherent rationale \nfor our leadership in the region.\n  Mr. President, that is why the Prime Minister's visit is so \nopportune.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to extend a warm welcome to His Excellency, Mugur Isarescu, \nthe Prime Minister of Romania. Prime Minister Isarescu's visit is very \nwell-timed. United States' policy in the Balkans is at a decisive \npoint. We took an extremely important vote in the Senate last week that \nserved as a litmus test for our commitment to the region. I am relieved \nat the results. Ultimately, the United States did not sent the wrong \nsignal to Serbia about our intentions. However, the amendment by the \nSenior Senators from Virginia and West Virginia, gave the Senate the \nopportunity to reevaluate our role in the Balkans. The debate of that \namendment highlighted the need to establish a more coherent rationale \nfor our leadership in the region.\n  Mr. President, that is why the Prime Minister's visit is so \nopportune. The United States has rarely had an ally that has suffered \nso much for the reward of serving a just cause. However, that is \nprecisely what Romania has done. Romania enjoys good relations with all \nof its neighbors, but the historical links with Yugoslavia were \nparticularly strong.

CHAFEE. Mr. President, on May 6th, twenty-five \noutstanding students from Central Falls High School in Rhode Island \nvisited Washington to compete in the national finals of the ``We The \nPeople . . . The Citizen And The Constitution'' program. This is the \nthird time that the Central Falls High School team has won the \nstatewide competition, and I would like to commend their achievement.\n  The ``We The People . . . The Citizen And the Constitution'' program \nfocuses on teaching our nation's students about the history, \nphilosophy, and meaning of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, as \nwell as increasing civic participation. The national finals competition \nsimulates a congressional hearing in which students testify as \nconstitutional experts before a panel of judges.\n  I am very proud of Francisco Araujo, Sean Brislin, Andrzej Budzyna, \nDelia Buffington, Eloisa Dellagiovanna, Rachel Dittell, Renee Dittell, \nMatthew Doucett, Ricky Ferreira, Hipolito Fontes, Michelle Fontes, \nSonia Gaitan, Jennifer Golenia, Joshua Lapan, Celia Marques, Edward \nPare, Kassandra Reveron, Helen Reyes, Kathleen Roach, Amy Rodrigues, \nAnthony Rodrigues, Jennifer Savard, Cassie Tripp, Monica Vicente, and \nLeslie Viera for making it to the national finals. I applaud this \nterrific group of young men and women for their hard work and \nperseverance. Also, Mr. President, I want to congratulate Jeffry \nSchanck, a fine teacher who deserves so much credit for guiding the \nCentral Falls High School team to the national finals.\n  Mr. President, it is encouraging to see young Rhode Islanders \nparticipating in the ``We The People . . . The Citizen And the \nConstitution'' program. They have learned that the Constitution is not \njust a piece of paper, but a living document that all Americans should \ncherish. It gives me great hope for the future of Rhode Island and our \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4456-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF MR.

Richard \nwill be receiving the National Jewish Medical and Research Center's \nHumanitarian Award on June 3, 2000. The Humanitarian Award recognizes \nindividuals who have made significant civic and charitable \ncontributions, and whose concern is not personal, but for the greater \ncommunity. There is no one more deserving of this honor than Richard \nBunker.\n  Richard's legacy of service to the state of Nevada is long and \nremarkable. He has served as Assistant City Manager of Las Vegas and \nClark County Manager, before being appointed Chairman of the \nprestigious State Gaming Control Board. He is currently a member of the \nColorado River Commission and a member of the Board of Trustee for the \nHotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union Welfare/\nPension Funds.\n  As Chairman of the Colorado River Commission of Nevada, Richard is \nNevada's ambassador on the Colorado River. With shrewdness and finesse, \nhe has developed positive relations with officials of the Colorado \nRiver basin states. His political skill has firmly reestablished Nevada \nas a player on the important issues of the Colorado River community. He \nalso made the critically needed expansion of Southern Nevada water \nfacilities a reality when he brokered a financial plan with the \nbusiness, developer, and gaming communities.\n  Over the years, Richard Bunker has also been recognized by a variety \nof distinguished organizations. In 1993, he received the prestigious \nNevadan of the Year award from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The \nAnti-Defamation League honored Richard with the Distinguished Community \nService Award in 1996. In June 1999, he was presented with the Lifetime \nAchievement Award by the Nevada Gaming Attorneys and the Clark County \nBar Association.\n  For those of us who have had the pleasure to work closely with \nRichard, as I have, the above awards pale in comparison to his true \ngrit. He is knowledgeable of the system of government and totally aware \nof the magic of our system of free enterprise. For the growth and \ndevelopment of southern Nevada, no one for the past twenty-five years \nhas played a more key role than Richard Bunker.\n  On a more personal note, Richard has played an important part in my \npolitical endeavors. He has been an advisor, counselor, and sounding \nboard. Above all else, he is a god listener, for this Richard, I am \ngrateful.\n  I extend to you my congratulations and the appreciation of all \nNevadans for your good work on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4456-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO PORTER HOSPITAL AND THE HELEN PORTER NURSING HOME\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to \nrepresent the people of the state of Vermont. On this occasion, I rise \nto pay tribute to two health care institutions in Vermont that add so \nmuch to their communities and make ``the Green Mountain State'' such a \nwonderful place to live.\n  This year Porter Hospital is celebrating its 75th anniversary and \nHelen Porter Nursing Home is celebrating its 30th anniversary of \nproviding quality health care to the people of Addison County, Vermont. \nTogether these two institutions have played a vital role in delivering \na continuum of care to thousands of people. They have demonstrated \ntheir commitment to serving as catalysts in the development of health \nservices for the people of this region.\n  Porter Hospital has been caring for its community since 1925 and is a \nfull service, community hospital, providing emergency services and \ncomprehensive medical care. Helen Porter Nursing Home provides skilled \nand intermediate care to residents in a home-like environment where \nprivacy is honored and individuality respected.\n  The devoted and professional staff of both institutions provide the \nfull range of health care from outpatient services and rehabilitation, \nto long-term care and Wellness programs. Additionally, Porter Hospital \nand Helen Porter Nursing Home have contributed significantly to the \neconomic vitality of the region as major employers and active members \nof the Addison County business community.\n  In a rural state such as Vermont, we count our successes one \ncommunity at a time. We hold our institutions dear and we thank the men \nand women who devote their lives to improving the health status of our \nstate.\n  Porter Hospital and Helen Porter Nursing Home have displayed a \nsteadfast commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of \nAddison County. The citizens of Vermont are tremendously grateful for \nthat commitment, and I join them in sharing gratitude.

HUTSON, USN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, USN, the Judge Advocate General \nof the Navy. Admiral Hutson will retire from the Navy on August 1, \n2000, having completed a distinguished 27-year career of service to our \nNation.\n  Admiral Hutson was born in North Muskegon, Michigan, and is a \ngraduate of Michigan State University and the University of Minnesota \nLaw School. He also earned a Master of Laws degree in labor law from \nGeorgetown University Law Center.\n  During his military career, Admiral Hutson excelled at all facets of \nhis chosen professions of law and naval service. He served as a trial \nand defense counsel at the Law Center, Corpus Christi, Texas, \nfaithfully preserving military justice at its very foundations. As a \nstaff judge advocate, he provided legal counsel to Commanding Officers \nat Naval Air Station, Point Mugu, California, and Portsmouth Naval \nShipyard, Kittery, Maine. He served as an instructor and later as the \nCommanding Officer of Naval Justice School, Newport, Rhode Island, \nplaying a critical role in preparing and mentoring future generations \nof judge advocates.\n  As the Executive Officer of the Naval Legal Service Office, Newport, \nRhode Island, and later the Commanding Officer, Naval Legal Service \nOffice, Europe and Southwest Asia, Naples, Italy, Admiral Hutson proved \nto be an inspiring leader. He guided young judge advocates in the \nunderstanding, appreciation and dedication of their roles as both judge \nadvocates and naval officers, exemplifying the Navy's core values of \nhonor, courage, and commitment.\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\n  During his career Admiral Hutson also provided counsel and support to \nsenior leaders while serving as the Staff Judge Advocate and Executive \nAssistant to the Commander, Naval Investigative Command and as \nExecutive Assistant to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues remember and appreciate Admiral \nHutson's service as a legislative counsel and later as the Director of \nLegislation in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. During these \nassignments, he directly contributed to clear and thorough \ncommunication with Congress on the interests of the Navy in a broad \nrange of legislative matters.\n  Admiral Hutson's dedication to service and superior performance in \nall assignments appropriately culminated in his appointment as the 36th \nJudge Advocate General of the Navy. In this role, he provided \ninvaluable legal service to both the Secretary of the Navy and the \nChief of Naval Operations, and the Judge Advocate General's Corps. He \nfulfilled these duties with great distinction, leaving the Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps strong and well-prepared for the challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n  It is fitting that following his retirement Admiral Hutson will \nbecome the Dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New \nHampshire, where he will continue to lead and mentor future servants of \nthe law.\n  Mr. President, the Nation, the United States Navy, and the Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps have been made better through the talent and \ndedication of Rear Admiral John D. Hutson. I know all of my colleagues \njoin me in wishing him and his wife, Paula, fair winds and following \nseas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4457-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MANUAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL.

These young scholars \nworked diligently to reach the competition and through their academic \nexcellence and teamwork, prevailed at the end of a tough, four-day \nchallenge held in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\n  First, and most importantly, I recognize the students on this year's \nManual High School team and commend them for their hard work and \ndetermination: Mariah Cummins, Marty Mudd, Matthew Reece, Gabe Wood, \nand Yan Xuan.\n  I also applaud and thank their teacher, Skip Zwanzig, who taught \nthese students and provided the leadership which brought them to this \nyear's competition.\n  The National Science Bowl is a rigorous academic competition among \nteams of high school students. This year is the 10th anniversary of the \nprogram, which has brought more than 60,000 high school mathematics and \nscience students from across the country together in competition since \nits inception in 1991.

I would like to \nthank Mr. Gary A. Thuro, Jr., Manager, Promotions, and Mr. Ernest \nCascino, Jr., Project Manager, for bringing the awards to my attention. \nThe United States Postal Service deserves special recognition for \nreceiving the Department of Transportation's Design for Transportation \nNational Award of Merit and the Transportation Marketing & \nCommunications Association's 2000 Award of Excellence.\n  Both awards were presented in recognition of the United States Postal \nService's Celebrate the Century Express Train which is a specially \noutfitted four-car Amtrak train and traveling postal history exhibition \nthat serves as the ``iron ambassador'' of the Celebrate the Century \ncommemorative stamp and education program. The train is a rolling \nhistory museum, presenting the story of how the mails and rails helped \ndevelop our country and, highlighting some of the most significant \npeople, places and events of the 20th century.\n  Over its 18-month tour from March 1999 to fall 2000, the Celebrate \nthe Century Express will visit dozens of communities across the nation, \nfrom the biggest cities to the smallest towns. In 1999, the train \ntraveled over nearly 13,000 miles of track, visiting 36 cities in 18 \nstates and being viewed by more than 150,000 people, including \nthousands of schoolchildren. The train is expected to make at least 36 \nstops this year before concluding its two-year run in November 2000.\n  The Design for Transportation National Awards 2000 honor those \nfacilities and activities that exemplify the highest standards of \ndesign and have made an outstanding contribution to the nation's \ntransportation systems and the people they serve. The United States \nPostal Service received a Merit Award (which is only given every 5 \nyears) for achieving a high level of design quality for its Celebrate \nthe Century Express. The Postal Service is among 30 winners out of more \nthan 300 entries and is the only recipient to receive an award for any \ntype of vehicle.\n  The Transportation Marketing & Communications Association's \nTransportation Communicators Award program, also known as the \n``Tranny'' Awards, recognizes excellence in communications programs in \nthe transportation and logistics industries. The program recognizes \nindividual practitioners who apply solid communications principles and \ncreativity to effectively promote the goals of their organizations.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an innovative \nprogram in my home State of Idaho that honors our Nation's law \nenforcement officers.\n  As you know, May 15, 2000, was National Law Enforcement Memorial Day. \nThis important day was established to commemorate the brave men and \nwomen of law enforcement who lost their lives in the line of duty. Law \nenforcement personnel risk their lives every day to protect and serve \nthis Nation. According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of \nJustice, the incidents of violent crime are steadily declining. Their \nis no doubt that this is a direct result of the hard-work and \ndedication of law enforcement officers across the Nation.\n  This year, I was pleased to be able to join the Idaho Education \nAssociation in sponsoring a state-wide poster contest in conjunction \nwith National Law Enforcement Memorial Day. Using the theme ``Thank You \nIsn't Enough,'' creative and talented public school students from \ncommunities throughout Idaho submitted posters honoring the service and \nsacrifices of law enforcement. The winning posters, chosen from four \ndifferent grade ranges, were announced on May 15. The winning entries, \nwhich I will have the honor of displaying in my office here in \nWashington, D.C., were submitted by the following Idaho public school \nstudents:\n  Kindergarten through Second Grade: Jenefer Kramer from Westside \nElementary in Idaho Falls.\n  Third through Fifty Grade: Mirella Toncheva from Washington \nElementary in Pocatello.\n  Sixth through Eighth Grade: Jenni Henscheid from Sandcreek Middle \nSchool in Idaho Falls.\n  Ninth through Twelfth Grade: Cassey Newbold from Alameda Junior High \nSchool in Pocatello.\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\n  I congratulate these winners and all the students who submitted \nentries.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), as expanded to address the actions \nand policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the \nterritory that they control within Bosnia and Herzegovina, is to \ncontinue in effect beyond May 30, 2000, and the emergency declared with \nrespect to the situation in Kosovo is to continue in effect beyond June \n9, 2000.\n  On December 27, 1995, I issued Presidential Determination 96-7, \ndirecting the Secretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the \napplication of sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(Serbia and Montenegro) and to continue to block property previously \nblocked until provision is made to address claims or encumbrances, \nincluding the claims of the other successor states of the former \nYugoslavia. This sanctions relief, in conformity with United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995 (hereinafter the \n``Resolution''), was an essential factor motivating Serbia and \nMontenegro's acceptance of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in \nBosnia and Herzegovina initialed by the parties in Dayton on November \n21, 1995, and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995 (hereinafter the \n``Peace Agreement''). The sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) were accordingly suspended \nprospectively, effective January 16, 1996. Sanctions imposed on the \nBosnian Serb forces and authorities and on the territory that they \ncontrol within Bosnia and Herzegovina were subsequently suspended \nprospectively, effective May 10, 1996, also in conformity with the \nPeace Agreement and the Resolution.\n\n  Sanctions against both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) and the Bosnian Serbs were subsequently terminated by \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1074 of October 1, 1996. \nThis termination, however, did not end the requirement of the \nResolution that blocked those funds and assets that are subject to \nclaims and encumbrances until unblocked in accordance with applicable \nlaw.\n  Until the status of all remaining blocked property is resolved, the \nPeace Agreement implemented, and the terms of the Resolution met, this \nsituation continues to pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security, foreign policy interests, and the \neconomy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that \nit is necessary to maintain in force these emergency authorities beyond \nMay 30, 2000.\n  On June 9, 1998, I issued Executive Order 13088, ``Blocking Property \nof the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro, \nand Prohibiting New Investment in the Republic of Serbia in Response to \nthe Situation in Kosovo.'' Despite months of preparatory consultations \nand negotiations, representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(Serbia and Montenegro) in March 1999, completely blocked agreement on \nan internationally backed proposal for a political solution to the \nKosovo crisis. Yugoslav forces reinforced positions in the province \nduring the March negotiation and, as negotiations failed, intensified \nthe ethnic cleansing of Albanians from Kosovo. Yugoslav security and \nparamilitary forces thereby created a humanitarian crisis in which \napproximately half of Kosovo's population of 2 million had been \ndisplaced from the province and an unknown but apparently large portion \nof the remaining population had been displaced within Kosovo by mid-\nApril.\n  On April 30, 1999, I issued Executive Order 13121, ``Blocking \nProperty of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(Serbia and Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of \nMontenegro, and Prohibiting Trade Transactions Involving the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in Response to the \nSituation in Kosovo.'' Executive Order 13121 revises and supplements \nExecutive Order 13088 to expand the blocking regime by revoking an \nexemption for certain financial transactions provided in Executive \nOrder 13088; to impose a general ban on all U.S. exports and reexports \nto and imports from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) (the ``FRY (S)'') or the Governments of the FRY (S), \nthe Republic of Serbia, or the Republic of Montenegro; and to prohibit \nany transaction or dealing by a U.S. person related to trade with or to \nthe FRY (S) or the Governments of the FRY (S), the Republic of \nSerbia, or the Republic of Montenegro. In addition, Executive Order \n13121 directs that special consideration be given to Montenegro and the \nhumanitarian needs of refugees from Kosovo and other civilians within \nthe FRY (S) in the implementation of the Order. Finally, Executive \nOrder 13121 also supplements Executive Order 13088 to direct that the \ncommercial sales of agricultural commodities and products, medicine, \nand medical equipment for civilian end-use in the FRY (S) be \nauthorized subject to appropriate safeguards to prevent diversion to \nmilitary, paramilitary, or political use by the Governments of the FRY \n(S), the Republic of Serbia, or the Republic of Montenegro.\n  This situation continues to pose a continuing unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy \ninterests, and the economy of the United States. For these reasons, I \nhave determined that it is necessary to maintain in force these \nemergency authorities beyond June 9, 2000.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to prohibit products that contain dry ultra-filtered \nmilk products or casein from being labeled as domestic natural cheese, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                     the quality cheese act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, along with Senator Jeffords, I am \npleased to introduce the Quality Cheese Act of 2000. This legislation \nwill protect the consumer, save taxpayer dollars and provide support to \nAmerica's dairy farmers, who have taken a beating in the marketplace in \nrecent years.\n  When Wisconsin consumers have the choice, they will choose natural \nWisconsin cheese, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) may change current law, and \nconsumers won't know whether cheese is really all natural or not.\n  If the federal government creates a loophole for imitation cheese \ningredients to be used in U.S. cheese vats, cheese bearing the labels \n``domestic'' and ``natural'' will no longer be truly accurate.\n  If USDA and FDA allow a change in federal rules, imitation milk \nproteins known as milk protein concentrate or casein, could be used to \nmake cheese in place of the wholesome natural milk produced by cows in \nWisconsin or other part of the U.S.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by recent efforts to change \nAmerica's natural cheese standard. This effort to allow milk protein \nconcentrate and casein into natural cheese products flies in the face \nof logic and could create a loophole for unlimited amounts of \nsubstandard imported milk proteins to enter U.S. cheese vats.\n  My legislation will close this loophole and ensure that consumers can \nbe confident that they are buying natural cheese when they see the \nnatural label.\n  Our dairy farmers have invested heavily in processes that make the \nbest quality cheese ingredients, and I am concerned about recent \nefforts to change the law that would penalize them for those efforts by \nallowing lower quality ingredients to flood the U.S. market.\n  Over the past decade, cheese consumption has risen at a strong pace \ndue to promotional and marketing efforts and investments by dairy \nfarmers across the country. Year after year, per capita cheese \nconsumption has risen at a steady rate.\n  Back in the 1980's, when I served in the Wisconsin State Senate, \ncheese consumption topped 20 pounds per person. During the 1990s \nconsumption increased by over 25 percent, and passed 25 pounds per \nperson. Last year we saw an even more dramatic increase when per capita \ncheese consumption rose an amazing 1.5 pounds to reach 29.8 pounds.\n  This one-year increase amounts to the largest expansion since 1982! I \nam proud to say that my home state of Wisconsin, America's dairyland, \nwas one of the main engines behind this growth. After all, when \nconsumers see the label ``Wisconsin Cheese,'' they know that it is \nsynonymous with quality.\n  Over the past two decades consumers have increased their cheese \nconsumption due to their understanding, and taste for the quality \nnatural cheese produced by America's dairy industry.\n  Recent proposals to change to our natural cheese standard could \ndecrease consumption of natural cheese. These declines could result \nfrom concerns about the origin of casein and other forms of dry UF \nmilk.\n  The vast majority of dry ultra filtered milk originates from \ncountries with State Trading Enterprises. Many of these countries \nsubsidize their dairy exports through these trading mechanisms, and \nhave quality standards that are well below those of the United States.\n  While it is difficult to obtain specific numbers about the amount of \ndry UF milk produced in foreign countries, I have heard disturbing \nstories about the conditions under which the casein and milk proteins \nare sometimes produced.\n  For the most part, dry UF milk is not produced in the US. In fact, it \nis, for the most part, produced in countries where sanitary standards \nare well below those of the United States.\n  These products are sold on the international market, and under the \nproposed rule they could be labeled as natural cheese. This cheap, low \nquality dry UF milk tends to leave cheese greasy and increases \nseparation problems.\n  The addition of this kind of milk will certainly leave the wholesome \nreputation of ``natural cheese'' significantly tarnished in the eyes of \nthe consumer.\n  This change would seriously compromise decades of work by America's \ndairy farmers to build up domestic cheese consumption levels. It is \nsimply not fair to America's farmers!\n  Mr. President, consumers have a right to know if the cheese they buy \nis unnatural. And by allowing unnatural dry UF milk into cheese, we are \ndenying consumers the entire picture.\n  The Feingold-Jeffords legislation will paint the entire picture for \nthe consumer, and allow them enough information to select cheese made \nfrom truly natural ingredients.\n  Allowing dry Ultra-Filtered milk into cheeses will have a significant \nadverse impact on dairy producers throughout the United States. Some \nestimate that the annual effect of the change on the dairy farm sector \nof the economy could be more than $100 million.\n  The proposed change to our natural cheese standard would also harm \nthe American taxpayer.\n  If we allow dry UF milk to be used in cheese we will effectively \npermit unrestricted importation of these ingredients into the United \nStates. Because there are no tariffs and quotas on these ingredients, \nthese heavily subsidized products will displace natural domestic dairy \ningredients.\n  These unnatural domestic dairy products will enter our domestic \ncheese market and may further depress dairy prices paid to American \ndairy producers.\n  Low dairy prices result in increased costs to the dairy price support \nprogram. So, at the same time that U.S. dairy farmers are receiving \nlower prices, the U.S. taxpayer will be paying more for the dairy price \nsupport program.\n  Mr. President, this change does not benefit the dairy farmer, \nconsumer or taxpayer. Who then is it good for?\n  The obvious answer is nobody.\n  America's farmers have invested a tremendous amount of time and \neffort create the best cheese industry in the world. They should not be \npenalized for their efforts.\n  This legislation takes a two pronged approach to address these \nconcerns. First, it prohibits dry ultra-filtered milk from being \nincluded in America's natural cheese standard.\n  Second, it requires the Food and Drug administration to conduct a \nstudy into the impact of allowing wet ultra-filtered milk into the \nnatural cheese standard.\n  Let me be clear, currently, neither of these products are allowed in \nAmerica's natural cheese standard. Under current regulations, wet \nultra-filtered milk may only be used in natural cheese products if--and \nonly if--both the wet UF milk and the cheese are produced at the same \nplant.\n  I have heard a number of concerns from dairy farmers, but the most \nimmediate concern is the importation of milk protein concentrate and \ncasein. This legislation is the first step in addressing their \nconcerns, and ensuring that any future changes incorporate the concerns \nof America's dairy farmers.\n  Congress must shut the door on any backdoor efforts to stack the deck \nagainst America's dairy farmers. And we must pass my legislation that \nprevents a loophole that would allow changes that hurt the consumer, \ntaxpayer and dairy farmer.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2631. A bill to authorize a project for the renovation of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs medical center in Bronx, New York; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n        BRONX VA MEDICAL CENTER'S RESEARCH FACILITY LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan to introduce legislation that would authorize \nrenovations to the Bronx VA Medical Center's research facility.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  This facility, when renovations are completed, will serve as a center \nof excellence for VA research on neurodegenerative diseases that are \nmore prevalent in our veterans population than in any other group of \nAmericans. Specifically, the research would focus on Alzheimer's and \nParkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis \n(ALS) and brain and spinal cord injury.\n  Major neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's \ntend to occur later in life and are progressive lifelong afflictions. \nSome 20 million Americans have been diagnosed with one of these \ndiseases and the costs of their treatment have reached over $100 \nbillion annually. US Census Bureau statistics indicate that because of \nour aging population, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases and \nthe associated human and economic costs will increase four-fold by \n2040. Veterans, an aging population are disproportionately affected. \nTraumatic brain and spinal cord injury are also highly represented in \nthe veterans population. Over 200,000 individuals in the US are living \nwith spinal cord injury today, and another 2 million suffer traumatic \nbrain injury annually.\n  The bill I introduce today would authorize $12.3 million for \nrenovations to an aging facility on the campus of the Bronx VAMC. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs researchers there, are in desperate need \nof modern, state-of-the-art laboratories to continue efforts to \nunderstand, treat and develop new methods of care for all Americans \nafflicted with these horrible diseases. This legislation represents an \nimportant step in ensuring that the quality of care provided to \nveterans in New York and across the country reflects our highest esteem \nfor those who answered their country's call. We owe our veterans no \nless than the best medical care anywhere--and the research and \ntreatments that come from this renovated facility will help ensure that \nhappens. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and enacting \nthis critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECT, \n                   DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may carry out a major \n     medical facility project for the renovation of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs medical center in Bronx, New York, in an \n     amount not to exceed $12,300,000.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2001 for \n     the Construction, Major Projects, account $12,300,000 for the \n     project authorized in section 1.\n       (b) Limitation.--The project authorized in section 1 may \n     only be carried out using--\n       (1) funds appropriated for fiscal year 2001 pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations in subsection (a);\n       (2) funds appropriated for the Construction, Major \n     Projects, account for a fiscal year before fiscal year 2001 \n     that remain available for obligation; and\n       (3) funds appropriated for the Construction, Major \n     Projects, account for fiscal year 2001 for a category of \n     activity not specific to a project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Lautenberg, and \n        Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2632. A bill to authorize the President to present gold medals on \nbehalf of the Congress to astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. \n``Buzz'' Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins, the crew of Apollo 11; to \nthe Committee on Banking Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS TO THE CREW OF THE APOLLO 11\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith my colleagues, Senators Voinovich, Lautenberg, and Torricelli, to \nauthorize the President to present gold medals on behalf of Congress to \nastronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, and Michael \nCollins--the heroic crew of the Apollo 11.\n  For thousands of years, man has gazed at the moon with awe, dreaming \nof the day when that celestial body would no longer be out of man's \ngrasp. On July 20, 1969, thanks to the crew of the Apollo 11, the \nheavens became part of man's world.\n  The mission to the moon was a long and treacherous endeavor. It \nstarted with President Kennedy's vision to put a man on the moon before \nthe end of the decade and concluded with a simple step and the immortal \nwords: ``One small step for man and one giant leap for mankind.'' We \nowe a great deal of gratitude to the men and women of America's space \nprogram. And, I believe that presenting Congressional gold medals to \nthe crew of Apollo 11 is a fitting tribute to them and the mission.\n  The primary objective of Apollo 11 was simple and straightforward: \n``Perform a manned lunar landing and return.'' The mission, though, was \nanything but simple. The historic journey began with the Eagle's fiery \nlift-off at Cape Kennedy at 9:32 a.m. on July 19, 1969. The world \nwatched as astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins blasted toward \nouter space. While the millions who witnessed the event were excited \nand exhilarated, I do not think any of us truly appreciated the \ncomplexity and magnitude of the crew's responsibilities. One mistakenly \npulled lever, one power failure could have rendered Apollo 11 a \ndisaster. When asked to recall his thoughts on the mission's outcome, \nAstronaut Michael Collins said: ``I am far from certain that we will be \nable to fly the mission as planned. I think we will escape with our \nskins, or at least I will escape with mine, but I wouldn't give better \nthan even odds on a successful landing and return.''\n  On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin began their descent to the \nlunar surface. The Eagle landed with less than 45 seconds worth  of \nfuel and the buzz of several warning alarms. It was shortly after that \nlanding when Neil Armstrong emerged from the craft and set foot on the \nmoon's surface. Never before in the history of mankind had a human \nbeing set foot on another celestial body. The crew of Apollo 11 \nembodied the spirit of discovery that is so prevalent in our space \nprogram. It is this same spirit that we need to communicate to our next \ngeneration.\n\n  Neil Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11, was born on August 5, \n1930, in my home state of Ohio. He developed an interest in flying at \nan early age. In fact, he obtained his student pilot's license before \nhe got his driver's license. After high school, he received a \nscholarship from the U.S. Navy and studied aeronautical engineering. He \nlater became an aviator in the Navy and was chosen for the space \nprogram with the second group of astronauts in 1962. He made seven \nflights in the X-15 program, reaching an altitude of 207,500 feet. He \nwas the command pilot for Gemini 8 and Apollo 11. After Apollo 11, he \nwas Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics at NASA from July \n1970 until August 1971, when he left to become Professor of \nAeronautical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. He served on \nthe National Commission on Space from 1985 to 1986 and on the \nPresidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident in \n1986.\n  Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin was born in New Jersey on January 20, 1930. He \nattended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and later entered the \nU.S. Air Force, where he received pilot training. He was chosen with \nthe third group of astronauts in 1963. He was a pilot on Gemini 12, \nwhere he was one of the key figures working to improve in-space docking \nand was the lunar module pilot for Apollo 11. After leaving NASA in \n1971, he became Commandant of the Aerospace Research Pilot's School at \nEdwards Air Force Base in California. He retired from the Air Force in \n1972 and became a consultant for the Comprehensive Care Corporation, \nNewport Beach, California. He has authored two books, ``Return to \nEarth'' and ``Men From Earth.''\n  Michael Collins was born on October 30, 1930, in Rome, Italy and \nlater moved to Washington, DC. Upon finishing high school, he attended \nthe U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Prior to joining NASA, he was \na test pilot at the Air Force Flight Center, Edwards Air Force Base. He \nwas chosen in the third group of astronauts in 1963. He served as a \npilot for Gemini 10, where he set a world altitude record; became the \nnation's third spacewalker; and served as the command module pilot for \nApollo 11. He left NASA in 1970 and was appointed Assistant Secretary \nof State\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\nfor Public Affairs. He became Director of the National Air and Space \nMuseum at the Smithsonian Institution in April 1971 and was promoted to \nUnder Secretary of the Smithsonian in April 1978. He retired from the \nAir Force with the rank of Major General. He has written numerous \narticles and two books, ``Carrying the Fire and Liftoff,'' as well as a \nchildren's book, ``Flying to the Moon and Other Strange Places.''\n  Mr. President, presenting Congressional Gold Medals to the crew of \nthe Apollo 11 is as much about the future as it is about the past. \nThese medals will be a reminder of the great accomplishment of Apollo \n11 and her crew. Moreover, the presentation of the medals will help \ninspire future generations of Americans to continue striving to \naccomplish tasks that may seem out of reach, like putting a man on the \nmoon. I am convinced that somewhere in our schools today are the next \nNeil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Before long, our \nchildren will be talking about where they were when the first man or \nwoman set foot on Mars. Let's honor the immense achievement of the crew \nof Apollo 11. I urge my colleagues to support presenting Congressional \nGold Medals to Neil Armstrong, Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin, Jr., and \nMichael Collins.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2633. A bill to restore Federal recognition to the Indians of the \nGraton Rancheria of California; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                    graton rancheria restoration act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. I am delighted today to introduce \nlegislation to restore federal recognition to the Graton Rancheria, \nwhich is composed of Coastal Miwok and Southern Pomo tribal members. \nThis bill is identical to legislation that has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey. It is my great \npleasure to carry this legislation in the Senate and to correct an \ninjustice committed against these original inhabitants of the region \nsome 34 years ago.\n  The Coastal Miwok and Southern Pomo Indians flourished in Marin and \nsouthern Sonoma counties for many hundreds of years. At the time of \nEuropean settlement, there were as many as 5,000 of these tribal \nmembers. By the end of the 19th Century, however, disease and enforced \nlabor had killed off most of them. And the federal government formally \nterminated the tribe's identity in 1966 under the California Rancheria \nAct, after concluding, incorrectly, that virtually all of the members \nwere deceased.\n  The descendants of 12 Graton Rancheria survivors now number over 300, \nand they refer to themselves as the ``Federated Indians of Graton \nRancheria''--after the town in southern Sonoma County where an acre-\nsized piece of their original reservation is still owned by a Miwok \ndescendant.\n  This legislation not only restores dignity and a sense of identity to \nthe Graton Rancheria, it will restore all federal rights and privileges \nto the tribal members including health, education, and housing \nservices. It will also permit the Graton Rancheria to maintain an \nexisting cemetery and place of worship. Finally, this bill is unique in \nthat it contains a clause whereby the tribe permanently waives any \nright to casino-style gambling on their land.\n  Mr. President, the tribes of the Graton Rancheria are an integral and \nimportant part of the Bay Area's cultural heritage and history. It was \nwrong to terminate their status in 1966, and it is only right to \nrestore their formal recognition now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By. Mr. BOND:\n  S. 2634. A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to provide liability relief to \nsmall businesses; to the Committee on Environmental and Public Works.\n\n\n                   small business relief act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to introduce the \nSmall Business Relief Act of 2000. This bill will provide a lifeline \nfor the thousands of small business owners threatened by lawsuits and \nlitigation under the broken Superfund liability system.\n  This bill is simple. All this bill does is relieve innocent small \nbusiness owners from superfund liability unless it is demonstrated that \nthe small business is guilty of gross negligence or did contribute \nsignificantly to the toxic waste at the superfund site.\n  My bill will not let polluters off the hook. This common-sense \nproposal will make the Superfund program a little more reasonable and \nworkable. With this legislation, we can begin to provide some relief to \nsmall business owners who are held hostage by potential Superfund \nliability.\n  For years now, members from both sides of the aisle have said that \nthe Superfund program is broken, it doesn't work, it must be reformed. \nUnfortunately we haven't gotten past the rhetoric to fix the problem. \nInstead of making changes that will produce results that are better for \nthe taxpayers, better for the environment, and more efficient for \neveryone involved--government agencies, federal bureaucrats, and \nCongress has protected this troubled and inefficient program from \nmeaningful reform.\n  As Washington has played politics with the Superfund program, \ninnocent Main Street small business owners across the nation, the \nengine of our economy, continue to be unfairly pulled into Superfund's \nlegal quagmire. Even the EPA has stated its support for protecting \nrestaurant owners, mom-and-pop convenience store operators, and other \nsmall business owners who have legally disposed of their trash and \ncannot afford the tab that comes with Superfund legal bills.\n  Let's put a human face on this: last year, just across the Missouri \nborder--in Quincy, Illinois--160 small business owners were asked to \npay the EPA more than $3 million for garbage legally hauled to a dump \nmore than 20 years ago. The situation in Quincy is just one example of \nthe very real, ongoing Superfund legal threat to small business owners \nacross the nation.\n  Mr. President, we all know that Superfund was created to clean up the \nnation's most-hazardous waste sites. Superfund was not created to have \nsmall business owners sued for simply throwing out their trash! These \nsmall business owners are faced with so many challenges already, that \nthe thousands of dollars in penalties and lawsuits leave them with no \nchoice but to mortgage their businesses, their employees and their \nfuture to pay for the bills of a broken government program.\n  How many times will we tell ourselves that this unacceptable \nsituation must be fixed before we act? Small business owners literally \ncannot afford to wait around while we delay action on the common-sense \nfixes required to protect them and our environment.\n  In recognition of our small businesses around the country and Small \nBusiness Week, I introduce this bill and look forward to leading the \nfight to ensure timely adoption of this long-overdue legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 2635. A bill to reduce health care costs and promote improved \nhealth by providing supplemental grants for additional preventive \nhealth services for women; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  the wisewoman expansion act of 2000\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, many of us associate cardiovascular \ndisease with men, but the American Heart Association estimates that \nnearly one in two women will die of heart disease or stroke. \nUnfortunately, most women do not realize that they are at such high \nrisk for cardiovascular disease because of its historically male \nstereotype. In fact, cardiovascular diseases kill nearly 50,000 more \nwomen each year than men. Even more alarming is a recent survey \nreported by the Society for Women's Health Research which revealed that \nnot all physicians know that cardiovascular diseases are the leading \ncause of death among American women.\n  Each year nearly half a million women lose their lives as a result of \nheart disease and stroke. Since 1984, fortunately, men have experienced \na decline in deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, while, \nunfortunately, women have not. Tragically, many of these deaths could \nhave been prevented. Had these women known they were at risk\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nfor cardiovascular disease, they could have taken preventive measures \nby not smoking, lowering their cholesterol or blood pressure, or by \neating more nutritiously, and perhaps prevented becoming a victim of \nheart disease or stroke. For many women, prevention is truly the only \ncure, since it has been reported that as many as two-thirds of women \nwho die from heart attacks have no warning symptoms of any kind.\n  Cardiovascular diseases kill more American females each year than the \nnext 14 causes of death combined, including all forms of cancers. Over \nhalf of all cardiovascular deaths each year are women, and in 1997 \nalone heart diseases claimed the lives of 502,938 women. My home state \nof Tennessee has the second highest death rate from heart disease, \nstroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in the nation and the 13th \nhighest ranking state in women's heart deaths. In 1997, 10,884 \nTennessee women died from these two cardiovascular diseases alone. \nAccording to the CDC, women in the rural South are more likely to die \nof heart disease than those in other parts of the country. An even more \ndisturbing disparity is that the age adjusted death from coronary heart \ndisease for African-American women is nearly 72 percent higher than \nthat of white women.\n  Fortunately, some preventive measures, such as physical activity and \nbetter nutrition, can be taken by women to reduce their risk for \ncardiovascular diseases, as well as other preventable diseases, such as \nosteoporosis. Osteoporosis, affecting one out of every two over 50, is \nalso a preventable disease that American women are facing. Furthermore, \nosteoporosis is a health threat for roughly 28 million Americans, 80 \npercent of whom are women.\n  In an effort to continue to draw attention and greater awareness to \nhealth issues among American women, particularly cardiovascular \ndiseases, I am very pleased to introduce today the ``WISEWOMAN \nExpansion Act of 2000,'' with Senator Harkin. Our goal in expanding \nthis program is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and \nother preventable diseases, and to increase access to screening and \nother preventive measures for low-income and underinsured women. In \naddition to making cardiovascular diseases screening accessible to \nunderserved women, this program will also educate them about their risk \nfor cardiovascular diseases and how to make lifestyle changes thus \ngiving them the power to prevent these diseases.\n  The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program \n(NBCCEDP), run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \nis an example of a successful program that has provided critical \nservices to help prevent major diseases affecting American women. The \nNBCCEDP has done an outstanding job of bringing in low-income \nunderinsured women and providing them with preventive screenings for \nbreast and cervical cancers. The women who benefit from this program \nare generally too young for Medicare, unable to qualify for Medicaid or \nother state programs, and would otherwise fall through the cracks in \nour health system.\n  Our bill provides for the expansion of the WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated \nScreening and Evaluation for Women in Massachusetts, Arizona, and North \nCarolina) demonstration project, which is run by the CDC in conjunction \nwith the NBCCEDP, to additional states. The WISEWOMAN program \ncapitalizes on the highly successful infrastructure of the NBCCEDP to \noffer ``one-stop shopping'' screening and preventive services for \nuninsured and low-income women. In addition to these very important \nbreast and cervical cancer screenings, WISEWOMAN screens for \ncardiovascular disease risk factors and provides health counseling and \nlifestyle interventions to help women reduce behavioral risk factors. \nThe program addresses risk factors such as elevated cholesterol, high \nblood pressure, obesity and smoking and provides important additional \nintervention and educational services to women who would not otherwise \nhave access to cardiovascular disease screening or prevention. This \nbill also adds flexibility to the program language that would allow \nscreenings and other preventive measures for diseases in addition to \ncardiovascular diseases, such as osteoporosis, as more preventive \ntechnology is developed.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Judy Womack and Dr. Joy Cox of \nthe Tennessee Department of Health for their counsel and assistance on \nthis legislation and for their efforts in helping Tennesseans.\n  This bipartisan bill is supported by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer \nFoundation, the Society for Women's Health Research, the American \nCancer Society, the National Osteoporosis Foundation, and the American \nHeart Association. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place the \nfollowing letters of support in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                       Society for\n\n\n                                      Women's Health Research,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Chair, Subcommittee on Public Health, Committee on Health, \n         Education, Labor, and Pensions, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Harkins: On behalf of the Society \n     for Women's Health Research, we express our appreciation for \n     your leadership on the introduction of the ``WISEWOMAN \n     Expansion Act of 2000.'' In addition to a strong national \n     research program, disease prevention is vital to our nation's \n     health. Chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, \n     diabetes, and ostoeoporosis are among the most prevalent, \n     costly and preventable of all health problems.\n       As you know, women tend to live longer but not necessarily \n     better than men. They have more chronic health conditions and \n     are more economically insecure. Safety net programs often are \n     the difference between life and death. The WISEWOMAN \n     Expansion Act is building on a foundation that has provided \n     positive feedback and will allow additional states to provide \n     prevention services to those women in need. We applaud the \n     flexibility of the legislation. With the passage of time, as \n     new technologies develop, as disease burdens shift, and a \n     lifestyle change, the program can address women's most \n     critical health needs.\n       We thank you for your commitment to improving the nation's \n     health through prevention. By focusing on the health of \n     women, you ultimately will be improving the health of the \n     nation's families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Phyllis Greenberger,\n       Executive Director.\n     Roberta Biegel,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                The Susan G.

William Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Harkin: On behalf of the Susan G. \n     Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, I would like to express our \n     support for The WISEWOMAN Expansion Act of 2000. Your \n     leadership has made the expansion effort a reality and we \n     intend to activate our Komen affiliates grassroots to help \n     gather more Senatorial support. We understand that the \n     expansion would allow flexibility for the WISEWOMAN program \n     to grow and adapt with the needs of the individual states and \n     will ensure full collaboration of the WISEWOMAN program with \n     the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \n     Program (NBCCEDP) on which it is piggybacked.\n       Further, our discussions with your staff have reiterated \n     the importance of being certain that the programs are funded \n     separately and that the WISEWOMAN expansion is accomplished \n     as a complement to the existing NBCCEDP effort.\n       We applaud your efforts to provide greater screening \n     coverage for women as a means of detecting problems sooner \n     and strongly believe that this program will save many lives \n     as it expands nationwide.\n       The mission of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation \n     is to eradicate breast cancer as a life-threatening disease \n     by advancing research, education, screening and treatment. \n     The Komen Foundation is comprised of 115 affiliates in 45 \n     states and the District of Columbia, with over 40,000 \n     volunteers and 4 international affiliates. Komen has raised \n     well over $200 million in furtherance of its mission. But we \n     cannot do it alone. It takes dedicated Members of Congress \n     like you.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts to advance WISEWOMAN as a \n     separate program and we look forward to working with you to \n     make this legislation a reality for all.\n           With best regards,\n\n                                               Diane L. Balma,\n\n                                                Senior Counsel and\n     Director of Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Osteoporosis Foundation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Frist: On behalf of the National \n     Osteoporosis Foundation\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n     (NOF), I commend you on the introduction of the bipartisan \n     WISEWOMEN Expansion Act of 2000 that supports your effort to \n     provide additional preventive health services, including \n     osteoporosis screening, to low-income and uninsured women.\n       As you know, osteoporosis is a major health threat for more \n     than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women. In \n     the United States today, 10 million individuals already have \n     the disease and 18 million more have low bone mass, placing \n     them at increased risk for osteoporosis. Also, one out of \n     every two women over 50 will have an osteoporosis-related \n     fracture in their lifetime. It is estimated that the direct \n     hospital and nursing home costs of osteoporosis are over \n     $13.8 billion annually, with much of that attributed to the \n     more than 1.5 million osteoporosis-related fractures that \n     occur annually.\n       The health care services included in the WISEWOMEN program \n     have provided positive results for many women who have \n     participated and ultimately cost-savings for the states that \n     have participated. Expansion of teh WISEWOMEN model to \n     additional states and for additional preventive services, \n     such as screening for osteoporosis, should enhance positive \n     results for both the women and states participating in the \n     program.\n       The National Osteoporosis Foundation is most appreciative \n     of your efforts to promote improved bone health and endorses \n     the WISEWOMEN Expansion Act of 2000.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Sandra C. Raymond,\n                                       Executive Director.\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Frist \ntoday to introduce the ``WISEWOMAN Expansion Act.'' This bill will help \nthousands of women have access to basic preventive health care they may \notherwise not receive. The legislation builds on a successful \ndemonstration program and expands screening services and preventive \ncare for uninsured and low-income women across the nation.\n  Beginning in 1990, I worked as Chairman of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee to provide the \nfunding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \nProgram (NBCCEDP), run through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. In Iowa alone, the program has successfully served 8694 \nwomen through 618 provider-based breast and cervical cancer screening \nsites.\n  Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently run \nthe WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women in \nMassachusetts, Arizona and North Carolina) program through the NBCCEDP \nas a demonstration project. The program has successfully built upon the \nframework of the NBCCEDP to target other chronic diseases among women, \nincluding heart disease, the leading cause of death among women, and \nosteoporosis. The programs address risk factors such as elevated \ncholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and smoking and provide \nimportant additional intervention services.\n  This demonstration project has been successful. It is now time to \nexpand the program to additional states, and eventually make it \nnationwide. As the brother of two sisters lost to breast cancer and the \nfather of two daughters, I know first hand the importance of making \nwomen's health initiatives a top priority. The first step to fighting a \nchronic disease like cancer, heart disease or osteoporosis is early \ndetection. All woman deserve to benefit from the early detection and \nprevention made possible by the latest advances in medicine. This bill \nensures a place for lower-income woman at the health care table.\n  Mr. President, the majority of Americans associate cardiovascular \ndisease with men, but the American Heart Association estimates that \nnearly one in two women will die of heart disease or stroke. In fact, \ncardiovascular diseases kills nearly 50,000 more women each year than \nmen. In my own state of Iowa, cardiovascular disease accounts for 44 \npercent of all dealths in Iowa. Close to 7,000 women die annually in \nIowa from cardiovascular disease. Each year, nearly half a million \nwomen lose their lives as a result of heart disease and stroke. Sadly, \nwith appropriate screening and interventions, many of these deaths \ncould have been prevented.\n  Osteoporosis is also a preventable disease and affects 1 out of every \n2 women over the age of 50. Fortunately, some of the preventive \nmeasures women can take to reduce their risk for cardiovascular \ndiseases, such as eating more nutritious foods and exercising, can also \nreduce their risk for osteoporosis.\n  Mr. President, our bill would do the following:\n  Expand the current WISEWOMAN demonstration project to additional \nstates;\n  Add flexibility to program language that would allow screenings and \nother preventive measures for diseases in addition to cardiovascular \ndiseases;\n  Allow flexibility for the WISEWOMAN program to grow and adapt with \nthe changing needs of individual states and our better understanding of \nnew preventive strategies; and\n  Ensures continued full collaboration of the WISEWOMAN program with \nthe NBCCEDP;\n  Authorizes the CDC to make competitive grants to states to carry out \nadditional preventive health services to the breast and cervical cancer \nscreenings at NBCCEDP programs, such as: screenings for blood pressure, \ncholesterol, and osteoporosis; health education and counseling; \nlifestyle interventions to change behavioral risk factors such as \nsmoking, lack of exercise, poor nutrition, and sedentary lifestyle; and \nappropriate referrals for medical treatment and follow-up services.\n  In order to be eligible for this program, states are required to \nalready participate in the NBCCEDP and to agree to operate their \nWISEWOMAN program in collaboration with the NBCCEDP.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan legislation has the support of the \nNational Osteoporosis Foundation, the American Cancer Society and the \nKomen Foundation, among others. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 2636. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide pay \nparity for dentists with physicians employed by the Veterans Health \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n      the department of veterans affairs dentists appreciation act\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, there has \nbeen a great deal of attention given to the sizeable problems both in \nrecruiting and in retaining the men and women in our military services. \nIn response, Congress last year passed a 4.8 percent across the board \npay raise, reformed the pay scales, and corrected a retirement system \nfor our soliders, sailors, airmen, and marines in the service of our \ncountry. This year, Congress is considering ways to reform and improve \nthe strength of our military health care system.\n  Mr. President, these measures are the least we can do to recognize \nthe men and women of our military services for the important part they \nplay in maintaining our nation's security and our influence around the \nglobe.\n  But, Mr. President, there are other members of our civilian workforce \nthat also face recruiting and retention problems, and deserve \ncongressional attention. Last year, Congressman Steve LaTourette and I \nintroduced the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Nurse Appreciation \nAct, which is designed to correct a provision in the law that has been \nused in recent years to deny VA nurses the annual cost of living pay \nadjustments given to federal employees. In some cases, the law was used \nto cut the pay of some VA nurses. The law needs to be changed.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to address another field of \ncritical importance to the VA--dental care, which is also facing \nserious personnel retention problems. Over the past five years, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs has experienced a decline from 830 full-\ntime dentists to only 630, and the numbers are still declining. In \naddition, the turnover rate during the past 2 years have been more than \n11 percent. An increasing number of young and mid-career dentists are \nleaving the VA. There are fewer highly qualified applicants applying to \nfill vacant positions, and most vacancies take several months to fill. \nAn additional concern is the aging of the current VA dental workforce. \nWithin 2 years, almost 50 percent of all VA dentist will be eligible \nfor regular or early-out retirement.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would attempt to address these \nchallenges and ensure the availability of quality dental health care \nfor our veterans.\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\n  One of the major reasons for the decline in the numbers of VA \ndentists is the availability of higher paying jobs in the civilian \nsector. The type of work done at the VA is more challenging than that \nof the average hometown dentist. VA dentists frequently provide their \nservices to homeless veterans whose dental needs are much more \ndemanding.\n  An additional reason is that even with the ``special pay'' and the \n``responsibility pay'' that is available under current law, VA \ndentists' salaries still are not competitive with fellow non-VA \ndentists. In addition, all full-tme VA physicians receive a ``special \npay'' incentive of $9,000 annually, while VA dentists receive only \n$3,500. The ``responsibility pay'' depends on the additional \nresponsibilities the physician or dentist is performing.\n  The reason for the difference is that when current law was passed \nnearly a decade ago, there was a shortfall of physicians, and a ready \nsupply of dentists.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, would correct this disparity \nand bring ``special pay'' for dentists to $9,000 annually and would \nincrease the ``responsibility pay'' for dentists in management \npositions, so that they would be in the same responsibility pay range \nas physicians. This bill is similar to legislation introduced by \nCongressman Bob Filner of California\n  The National Association of VA Physicians and Dentists have offered \ntheir full support for this initiative and so has the American Dental \nAssociation. As a matter of fact, a very dear longtime friend of my \nfamily, Doctor Dwight Pemberton, a friend of my parents and \ngransparents, was the one who brought this issue to my attention and \nencouraged me to introduce this legislation. I thank him for his \nsupport and advocacy for this legislation, and look forward to working \ntoward a positive solution to this problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the continued reliable \ndental coverage for our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Dentists Appreciation Act be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                                S. 2636\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support for \nlegislation introduced today by my colleague, Senator Baucus, that will \ntransfer ownership of the Miles City, Montana Veterans Hospital from \nthe Veterans Administration to Custer County, Montana. Indeed, I am co-\nsponsor of this bill for the reason that within the Veterans \nAdministration there are unused properties that have become liabilities \nthat detract from the mission of the VA, which is to take care of our \nveteran population. At the same time, these resources could be assets \nto the communities where they exist.\n  This is exactly the situation we have in Miles City, Montana. \nMaintaining a facility that is no longer needed costs the VA \napproximately $500,000 that would otherwise be dedicated to improving \naccess and quality of care for Montana's veterans. At the same time, \nthe community of Miles City has need of additional space for use by the \ncommunity college and other entities designed to enhance the quality of \nlife and economic development opportunities for all the people of \nsoutheast Montana.\n  This legislation represents a creative solution that serves the best \ninterest of all involved. The situation is not unique to Montana but we \nare willing to address the issue and take the first step towards a more \nefficient Veterans Administration. We need to dedicate the limited \nresources of this agency to the essential task of maintaining our \ncommitment to America's veterans with adequate health care rather than \nto excessive administration and maintenance costs.\n  At the same time, what is a liability for the VA will be an asset to \na community that has an inadequate tax base to support the development \nof infrastructure that will have a significant and long-lasting impact \non jobs creation, educational opportunity, and will ultimately enhance \nthe tax base as well.\n  The concept that is inherent in this bill is a win-win situation for \nall the affected parties and I encourage positive consideration by my \ncolleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2639. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprograms for the treatment of mental illness; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nthe mental health early intervention, treatment, and prevention act of \n                                  2000\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of 2000 \nwith my friend Senator Kennedy.\n  Today we do not even question whether mental illness is treatable. \nBut, today we recoil in shock and disbelief at the consequences of \nindividuals not being diagnosed or following their treatment plans. The \nresults are tragedies we could have prevented.\n  Just look at the tragic incidents at the Baptist Church in Dallas/\nFort Worth, the Jewish Day Care Center in Los Angeles, and the United \nStates Capitol to see the common link: a severe mental illness. Or the \nfact that there are 30,000 suicides every year, including 2,000 \nchildren and adolescents.\n  It was not too long ago that our nation decided we did not want to \nkeep people chained in institutions. Simply put, it was inhumane to \nsimply lock these individuals up without even using science to consider \nother alternatives. In fact, one of the first awards I received as a \nSenator was a Freedom Bell made from these very chains.\n  Make no mistake, our nation still has these same individuals with \nmental illness, we just do not have a very good way to deal with these \nindividuals. Many of these individuals formerly locked up are now our \nneighbors taking the proper medication to control their illness.\n  However, our nation simply does not have an understanding of what \nhappens when individuals stop taking their medications.\n  I believe the American people are ready for a direct assault on their \nconsciences about a comprehensive approach to prevent the tragic \nincidents\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nmentioned. Many people just do not take notice because America is known \nfor her freedom, but sadly many of these highly publicized incidents of \nmass violence all too often involve an individual with a mental \nillness.\n  When these incidents occur, my wife and I watch with horror on \ntelevision and we often turn to each other and say that person was a \nschizophrenic or that individual was a manic depressive.\n  Sadly, society often does not want to take the extra step to help \nthese individuals because they are either scared or simply do not know \nhow to help. Unfortunately, there is no place that a community can take \nthese individuals for help. The police can do very little and likewise \nfor hospitals.\n\n  I believe we must come together as a nation to find a community based \nsolution so when someone sees an individual in obvious need of help \nthey will know exactly what to do.\n  Some of you may have seen the recent 4 part series of articles in the \nNew York Times reviewing the cases of 100 rampage killers. Most notably \nthe review found that 48 killers had some kind of formal diagnosis for \na mental illness, often schizophrenia.\n  Twenty-five of the killers had received a diagnosis of mental illness \nbefore committing their crimes. Fourteen of 24 individuals prescribed \npsychiatric drugs had stopped taking their medication prior to \ncommitting their crimes.\n  In particular I would point to a couple of passages from the series: \n``They give lots of warning and even tell people explicitly what they \nplan to do.'' . . . ``a closer look shows that these cases may have \nmore to do with society's lack of knowledge of mental health issues . . \n. In case after case, family members, teachers and mental health \nprofessionals missed or dismissed signs of deterioration.''\n  It is for these reasons that I am so pleased that Senator Kennedy has \njoined me to introduce this comprehensive piece of legislation. The \nlegislation attempts to prevent these incidents and the other tragic \nresults of mental illness before they happen.\n  The bill we are introducing today will provide for: A mental Illness \nAnti-Stigma and Suicide Prevention Campaign; Emergency Mental Health \nCenters to serve as the central receiving point in communities for \nfamilies, friends, emergency medical personnel, and law enforcement to \ntake an individual in need of emergency mental health services; Mental \nHealth Awareness Training for Teachers and Medical Personnel to \nidentify and respond to individuals with a mental illness; Mental \nHealth Courts that will maintain separate dockets and handle only cases \ninvolving individuals with a mental illness; A Blue Ribbon Panel to \nmake recommendations on issues relating to mental illness with a focus \non the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness; and Increased Funding \nfor Innovative Treatment and Research.\n  I really believe we have a historic opportunity to become preventers \nof serious, serious acts of violence before they happen. Thank you very \nmuch and I look forward to working with Senator Kennedy and my \ncolleagues on this legislative initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \nsummary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2639\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health Early \n     Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Almost 3 percent of the adult population or 5 million \n     individuals in the United States suffer from a severe and \n     persistent mental illness.\n       (2) Twenty-five to 40 percent of the individuals who suffer \n     from a mental illness in the United States will come into \n     contact with the criminal justice system each year.\n       (3) Sixteen percent of all individuals incarcerated in \n     State and local jails suffer from a mental illness.\n       (4) Suicide is currently a national public health crisis, \n     with approximately 30,000 Americans committing suicide every \n     year, including 2,000 children and adolescents.\n       (5) The stigma associated with mental disorders often \n     discourages individuals from seeking treatment, decreases \n     such individuals' access to housing and employment, and \n     interferes with such individuals' full participation in \n     society.\n       (6) In industrialized countries, mental illness constitutes \n     4 of the 10 leading causes of disability for individuals who \n     are 5 years of age or older. Such illnesses are, in the order \n     of prevalence, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, \n     and obsessive compulsive disorder.\n       (7) Presently, nearly 7,500,000 children and adolescents, \n     or 12 percent of such population, suffer from 1 or more types \n     of mental disorders.\n       (8) Of the almost 850,000 individuals who are homeless in \n     the United States, approximately \\1/3\\ or about 300,000 of \n     such individuals suffer from a serious mental illness.\n       (9) The majority of individuals with a mental illness can \n     now be successfully treated.\n       (10) The primary care setting provides an important \n     opportunity for the recognition of mental disorders, \n     especially in children, adolescents, and seniors.\n       (11) The first Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health, \n     released in December 1999, describes a vision for the future \n     that includes 8 areas, being--\n       (A) continuing to build the science base;\n       (B) overcoming stigma;\n       (C) improving public awareness of effective treatment;\n       (D) ensuring the supply of mental health services and \n     providers;\n       (E) ensuring delivery of state-of-the-art treatments;\n       (F) tailoring treatment to age, gender, race, and culture;\n       (G) facilitating entry into treatment; and\n       (H) reducing financial barriers to treatment.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to work \nwith Senator Domenici on this important issue of mental health care, \nand I commend him for his leadership. In American medicine today, \npatients with biochemical problems in their liver are treated with \ncompassion, but those with biochemical problems in their brain are \ntreated harshly. That discrepancy is unacceptable. The stigma against \nthe mentally ill is a blatant form of discrimination. The legislation \nthat Senator Domenici and I are introducing is intended to correct this \ninequity and to assure that those with mental illness will get the \ntreatment they need.\n  The first-ever Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health was released \nlast December. It provides a solid foundation on which to build. It is \na powerful statement that treating the problems of mental illness more \neffectively must be one of our Nation's highest priorities. The Surgeon \nGeneral's Report makes two basic points. Mental illness is a national \ncrisis--and our treatment of the mentally ill is a national disgrace.\n  One in five Americans will experience some form of mental illness \nthis year. Mental illnesses are our second leading cause of disability. \nYet success rates for treating mental illnesses are as high as 80 \npercent. Effective drugs with limited side effects have become \navailable in recent years. Note that the success rates for treatment of \nother chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, are not \nquite as high. But people with high blood pressure or diabetes still \nseek treatment. Unfortunately, fear, stigma and lack of available \ntreatment combine to prevent individuals with mental illness from \nseeking treatment.\n  There are several reasons for this. First is stigma. People are \nafraid to admit mental illness to their doctors, or even to themselves. \nIn fact, two-thirds of those with diagnosable mental illnesses do not \nseek treatment. Second, there is a very low public understanding of \nmental disorders and of the fact that they are treatable. Third, \nindividuals with mental illness may not be correctly diagnosed or \nappropriately referred for treatment. Fourth, people who do seek \ntreatment for mental illness find that it is not available or that \ntheir insurance plans will not cover it.\n  One result of the lack of treatment is suicide. Fifty percent more \nAmericans die by their own hand each year than\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nare killed by other; 29,264 suicides occurred in 1998 compared with \n17,350 homicides. Suicide is the third leading killer of the Nation's \nyouth.\n  What is happening to many of those who suffer from mental illness? \nJails and prisons represent the largest residential center for those \nsuffering from mental illnesses, but few prisoners receive treatment \nthere.\n  The bill that Senator Domenici and I are introducing today, ``The \nMental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of \n2000,'' is a giant step toward giving mental health the priority it \ndeserves. But we cannot promote mental health without eradicating the \nstigma surrounding mental illness. Since fear and ignorance compound \nthe problem, a campaign to improve public understanding about mental \nillness will combat the ignorance and decrease the fear.\n  Increased public understanding is not sufficient, however. Successful \ntreatment of those suffering from mental illness requires effective \ncare by skilled professionals. Many individuals with mental illness do \nnot realize the nature of scope of their problem, and those whom they \nmight encounter in daily life are unable to assist them. Our bill will \nenable us to reach out to find persons with mental illness. It will \ntrain teachers, police and others to provide front-line help.\n  Our legislation provides for the establishment of suicide prevention \nprograms. It will also develop screening programs to identify and reach \nout to those with mental illnesses so that they seek effective \ntreatment. We will also establish response teams and designate centers \nto provide patients with such treatment.\n  Patients suffering from mental illness are more likely to experience \na greater number of physical ailments as well. Their primary care \nphysicians are often not equipped to recognize mental illness or to \nmake the appropriate referral to a mental health professional. Our bill \nwill develop programs to train primary care health providers to treat \nthe physical symptoms of those who suffer from mental illness, while \nmaking sure that they obtain care for their mental well-being too.\n  In addition, ignorance of the biology of the brain and the mind has \noften prevented the development of cures for many forms of mental \nillness. Our bill will develop educational programs to increase the \nnumbers of researchers investigating the science of mental illness. \nSpecial emphasis will be given to training psychiatrists and \npsychologists in effective ways to bring the discoveries of the \nlaboratory more quickly to the bedside of the patient.\n  Our bill will develop new strategies to assist individuals with \nmental illness in the criminal justice system and to strengthen the \nunderstanding of mental illness by law enforcement officials. It is \nlikely, as a result, that many who suffer from mental illness will \nreceive treatment rather than punishment, so that they contribute to \nsociety instead of being incarcerated by society.\n  Mental illness is a serious national problem that all of us must deal \nwith more effectively. Our goal in this legislation is to give mental \nhealth the high priority it deserves. The enactment of this bill will \nhelp those millions of our fellow citizens who, at this moment, are \nsuffering in silence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2640. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs pharmacies to dispense medications to \nveterans for prescriptions written by private practitioners, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                   veterans prescriptions legislation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the country enters this Memorial Day \nweekend to pay tribute to those who gave their lives to protect and \ndefend the United States, I come before the Senate to introduce \nlegislation aimed at making it easier for veterans to receive \nmedications through the VA health care system.\n  Right now, VA pharmacies are prohibited from dispensing medications \nthat are prescribed by non-VA practitioners. This means that veterans \ncan not have their prescriptions filled at a VA facility if it is \nwritten by their private doctor. Under current law, veterans only have \nto pay $2 for each 30-day supply of medication supplied by the VA. \nTherefore, if a veteran needs to have a prescription filled by a non-VA \npractitioner, it can mean great out-of-pocket expenses. My legislation \nwould change the current system to allow the VA to fill prescriptions \nthat are written by non-VA practitioners.\n  This bill has been endorsed by The American Legion, the National \nAssociation of Uniformed Services and the Non-Commissioned Officers \nAssociation. I believe it is a common sense approach, and I think we \nowe it to veterans to make health care as affordable and accessible as \npossible.\n  Earlier today, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Veterans \nWashington Rally which was sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, Rolling Thunder, the Jewish War Veterans and other veteran \nsupporters. These veterans were asking for full funding for the VA \nhealth care system as spelled out in the Independent Budget, a \ncomprehensive analysis of the VA budget which is prepared each year \nwith the support of several veteran organizations.\n  Veterans are rightly concerned that current budget plans are barely \nenough to keep up with health care inflation and is nowhere near enough \nto provide quality emergency and long-term care or begin a serious \nfight against hepatitis C. I was proud to see these veterans fighting \nfor the benefits and services that are rightly theirs, and I hope we \ncan address their concerns when the Senate considers the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill later this year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. And, may God bless all of America's \nveterans this Memorial Day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 2641. A bill to authorize the President to present a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to former President Jimmy Carter and his wife \nRosalynn Carter in recognition of their service to the Nation; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n   to authorize the president to present the gold medal on behalf of \n    congress to former president jimmy carter and former first lady \n                            Rosalynn Carter\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould authorize the President to present a Gold Medal on behalf of \nCongress to former President Jimmy Carter and former First Lady \nRosalynn Carter in recognition of their service to the Nation. I would \nlike to thank Senator Coverdell for co-sponsoring this bill and extend \nan invitation to all our other colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation to award these two great Americans with Congress' highest \nhonor.\n  It is widely agreed that President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn \nCarter have distinguished records of public service to the American \npeople and the international community. Internationally, the Carters \nhave been involved in a number of public service initiatives ranging \nfrom combating famine in Sub-Sahara Africa and encouraging better \nhealth care in Third World nations to serving as mediators in an effort \nto end civil wars in half a dozen countries. President Carter has \nmonitored numerous foreign elections in an effort to spread democracy \nthroughout the world.\n  A Congressional Gold Medal awarded by Congress will show the \nappreciation of the American public for the many contributions that \nPresident and Mrs. Carter have made, including service in public office \nfrom the state legislature to the White House. Jimmy and Rosalynn \ncontinue to promote human rights worldwide due to their active \ninvolvement in the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta that has \ninitiated projects in more than 65 countries to resolve conflicts, \npromote human rights, build democracy, improve health care worldwide, \nand revitalize urban areas. In addition, the Carters serve as \nvolunteers for Habitat for Humanity, which helps low income families \nbuild their own homes.\n  I hope that other members of Congress will join me and Senator \nCoverdell in recognizing President and Mrs. Carter for their \ndistinguished records of public service by awarding them the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2642. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nmajor tax simplification; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\n               the tax ease and modernization act--part i\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nintended to start us on the path to a simpler, more rational, and \nfairer federal tax system. The bill I am introducing in the Senate \ntoday, the Tax Ease and Modernization Act--Part I (TEAM-I), is designed \nto be the first of several installments to incrementally transform the \nInternal Revenue Code into a revenue collection device that is more \nefficient, more responsive to the needs of taxpayers, more able to help \nthis nation compete in a global marketplace, and most importantly, much \neasier to understand, comply with, and administer.\n  I realize that this is a tall order. I also believe that such a \ntransformation cannot occur overnight. This is why my plan calls for \nincremental action through a multi-year plan--a plan that we can start \nimplementing this year rather than waiting for consensus to develop \naround a fundamental tax reform approach that centers on a flat tax, a \nnational consumption tax, or some hybrid system.\n  As I said on this floor on April 4, 2000, when I announced this plan, \nI recognize the need for a new paradigm in taxation for this country. I \nbelieve our Internal Revenue Code is fundamentally flawed and needs to \nbe replaced with a new system. But such a new tax code will require \nyears of presidential leadership, public education, and an intelligent \ntransition from the current system.\n  In the meantime, we should not wait for an elusive tax Utopia to come \nalong and remove the immediate need for improvements to the Internal \nRevenue Code. We should begin to act now, and do what we can to make \nour current system better in the short run. This is what my plan is all \nabout.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today begins this transformation \nprocess by repealing or repairing some of the most complex and unfair \nprovisions in the Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, it does so in a \nbalanced way, with relief from complexity for every classification of \ntaxpayer--low-income and high income individuals, school teachers and \nchief executive officers, members of neighborhood investment clubs and \nhigh rollers, small businesses and sprawling multinationals, people \nwith IRS problems and families with foster children. The goals are to \nsimplify the tax code and make it more fair for everyone.\n  Because the Internal Revenue Code is so riddled with complexity at \nevery level, attempting to eliminate it all at once would be difficult \nat best. Therefore, this bill focuses on solving several of the largest \nproblems affecting millions of taxpayers, then supplements these \nfeatures with a number of smaller provisions that may appear relatively \nminor, but as a whole add a tremendous amount of complexity, \nunfairness, or hassle for many taxpayers, as well as for the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n\n\n                     alternative minimum tax repeal\n\n  Mr. President, the Tax Ease and Modernization Act--Part I starts with \nrepealing what is likely to be the largest source of tax compliance \nheadaches for middle- and upper-income families over the next decade--\nthe alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax, or AMT for \nshort, remains unknown to many Americans, and is not well understood \neven by those nearly 1 million taxpayers it already affects.\n  The AMT was originally designed to ensure that taxpayers with \neconomic income who take advantage of the tax code's many incentive \ndeductions and credits still pay some tax. However, because of basic \ndesign flaws, the AMT's reach now goes far beyond what was intended in \n1969 when it was conceived or even in 1986 when it was expanded. In \nfact, the Treasury Department estimates that at least 17 million \ntaxpayers will be subject to the nightmare-like complexity of the \nalternative minimum tax by 2010. Even the Clinton administration, \ntraditionally a strong supporter of the AMT, now admits it has grown \nout of control and advocates changes to tame it.\n  This bill goes one better and repeals the alternative minimum tax \naltogether, Mr. President. It is time to rid the code of the kind of \nsuper-complexity brought by the AMT, which, in my view, has failed to \nachieve its objectives of bringing greater fairness to our tax system.\n\n\n                    capital gains tax simplification\n\n  A second major provision of this bill would greatly simplify the \ntaxation of capital gains. Many of my constituents were pleased in 1997 \nwhen Congress lowered the capital gains tax rates from 28 percent to 20 \npercent. However, many were not as excited when they found out what the \nnew law meant come tax return filing time--a 54-line Schedule D \naccompanied by two worksheets and seven pages of instructions. This is \ncompared to a 39-line form and just two pages of instructions prior to \nthe change.\n  TEAM-I would simplify capital gains by repealing the current maximum \nrate approach and instituting a 50 percent exclusion, as was the case \nbefore the 1986 Tax Reform Act repealed the capital gains preference. \nIn other words, taxpayers would be allowed to exclude 50 percent of the \nlong-term capital gain from gross income. The remaining 50 percent \nwould be taxed at ordinary income rates. This would do away with the \nneed for a special computation on the tax forms. It would also result \nin a lower capital gains rate for every tax bracket, with those in the \nlowest tax brackets getting the largest rate decreases. This bill thus \nboth simplifies capital gains and cuts the effective capital gains tax \nrate for all individuals.\n\n  We should not underestimate the importance of this change. Mr. \nPresident. Over the past few years the number of Americans who are \ninvested in capital assets has skyrocketed. The Joint Economic \nCommittee reported last month that the percentage of American families \ndirectly and indirectly holding stocks climbed from 31.6 percent in \n1989 to 48.8 percent in 1998. Moreover, a recent Federal Reserve study \nshows that stockholdings made up a record 31.7 percent of household \nwealth in 1999. And this does not include other capital assets, such as \nbonds, real estate, and partnership interests. No longer can even the \nmost hardened opponent of capital gains rate reductions argue that it \nis a tax break only for the wealthy.\n  In addition, there is abounding evidence that lowering the capital \ngains tax rate has had a very salutary effect on the economy over the \nyears, particularly since the 1997 change. A 1999 study by Standard and \nPoor's DRI concluded that the 1997 capital gains tax reduction from a \ntop rate of 28 percent to 20 percent was responsible for about 25 \npercent of he increase in stock prices from 1997 to 1999. Also, the \ncost of capital for new investment fell by about 3 percent as a result \nof the 1997 change. Clearly, when it comes to capital gains, simplicity \nis needed as well as lower rates. TEAM-I delivers both.\n  The bill I am introducing today also features a smaller but important \nprovision relating to capital gains from the sale of a principal \nresidence. In 1997, Congress passed a provision that allows homeowners \nto exclude up to $250,000 of capital gains from the sale of their \nprincipal residence. The number is $500,000 for married couples filing \na joint return. This has been or will be a tremendous benefit for \nmillions of American families. The provision was flawed in one respect, \nhowever, in that it was not indexed for inflation. My bill would index \nthe exclusion for future inflation, in increments of $1,000.\n\n\n                earned income tax credit simplification\n\n  Mr. President, millions of lower-income taxpayers face one of the \nmost complex tax provisions in the entire Internal Revenue Code--the \nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Taxpayers trying to figure out if they \ncan claim this credit and how to compute it face a daunting challenge--\ninstructions and tables in the Form 1040 instructions that take up ten \nfull pages, including a nine-step flowchart and two worksheets. Even \nall of this is not enough to provide all the needed information in \nevery case.\n  Taxpayers, many if not most of whom are surely aggravated and \nconfused by these rules, are referred to IRS Publication 596, a 54-page \nbooklet, to even more detailed information.\n  Practically every professional tax group that has studied tax \ncomplexity recommends major simplification to the EITC. TEAM-I would \nprovide major simplicity, while expanding the credit.\n  The bill would simplify the EITC rules in two ways, Mr. President. \nFirst it modifies the definition of earned income to include only \ntaxable employee\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\ncompensation and business income readily available on Form 1040. \nCurrent law requires the consideration of non-taxable compensation, \nsuch as meals and lodging provided for the convenience of the employer \nand employer-provided educational assistance benefits. Many times these \namounts are not readily available to the employee, who is likely to be \nuncertain whether such nontaxable compensation is provided or not.\n  Second, TEAM-I simplifies the definition of a dependent child. The \nsource of one of the greatest complexities in the EITC is the \ndefinition of a qualifying child. Current law is confusing in part \nbecause the definition of a qualifying child is very similar, but not \nidentical, to the definition of a dependent child for purposes of the \ndependency exemption. In some cases, a child can qualify a taxpayer for \nthe EITC but not for the dependency exemption. The bill simplifies both \nthe dependency exemption and the EITC by moving the definition of a \ndependent child closer to that of a qualifying child for purposes of \nthe EITC. Thus, with this new definition, taxpayers who are able to \nclaim a dependent child for the exemption should be able to also claim \nthe child for purposes of the earned income tax credit. This solution \nis based on a concept proposed by the Clinton Administration in the \nbudget for fiscal year 2001.\n  Mr. President, the bill also expands in three ways the earned income \ntax credit, which is a program that has proven vital in assisting \nmillions of families at the margin of poverty. The first expansion \nprovides a new category for taxpayers with three or more qualifying \nchildren, which offers a higher percentage credit. Current law provides \ndifferent levels of the credit for taxpayers with no children, \ntaxpayers with one qualifying child, and those with two or more. \nSecondly, the bill provides a larger maximum credit for all qualifying \ntaxpayer with children by increasing the phaseout amount, which is the \nlevel of the taxpayer's earnings at which the credit begins to be \nphased out, from the current law level of $12,690 to $15,000.\n  Perhaps even more significantly, the bill takes a major step toward \nrelieving the onerous marriage penalty inherent in the current Earned \nIncome Tax Credit. This is accomplished by increasing the amount at \nwhich the credit begins to be phased out by an extra $5,000 for \ntaxpayers who are married filing a joint return. While this will not \neliminate the marriage penalty problem of the EITC, which is among the \nlargest marriage penalties in the tax code, it does take an important \nstep toward reducing it.\n\n\n  repeal of limitations on itemized deductions and personal exemptions\n\n  Mr. President, two of the most unfair and complex provisions of the \ncurrent tax law are aimed squarely at upper-middle and higher-income \ntaxpayers. After the 1986 Tax Reform Act lowered the top tax rate to 28 \npercent, the Democratically led Congress decided that this was too low \na tax rate for successful Americans who were considered wealthy. Rather \nthan a straightforward increase in the top tax bracket, however, \nCongress decided to be sneaky about it and raised the marginal tax \nrates on certain taxpayers by limiting their itemized deductions and \npersonal exemptions. The effects of these provisions are twofold. \nFirst, they obscure the true rate of tax being levied on taxpayers \nsubject to these provisions. Second, and probably most damaging, they \nadd a great deal of unwarranted complexity. My bill solves both \nproblems by simply repealing these provisions.\n\n\n                      business tax simplification\n\n  While the Tax Ease and Modernization Act--Part I focuses mostly on \nthe complexity problems of individual taxpayers, it does not ignore \nbusinesses, who often face complexity in the extreme. The second and \nthird installments of this effort will feature many more simplification \nprovisions to help ensure that American businesses stay competitive in \nthe global marketplace and are not forced to waste resources on \nunnecessary tax compliance costs.\n  Part I features three relatively small but important provisions that \nwill simplify taxes for practically all business taxpayers in America. \nThe first provision would change the law to provide that corporate \ntaxpayers no longer have to pay a higher rate of interest to the \nInternal Revenue Service on underpayments of tax than the rate the \ngovernment pays to them for overpayments. Currently, individual \ntaxpayers enjoy an equal interest rate for overpayments and \nunderpayments. Corporations, however, must pay as much as a 4.5 \npercentage points more in interest on underpayments than they receive \non overpayments. The bill would equalize these amounts at a rate of the \nshort-term Applicable Federal Rate plus three percentage points.\n  The second business provision would clean up a complex inequity that \nwas only partially addressed by the Internal Revenue Service \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998. That Act established a net \ninterest rate of zero where interest is payable and allowable on \nequivalent amounts of overpayment and underpayment that exist for any \ntax period. However, that provision fell short of providing the \nsimplicity and fairness needed by taxpayers. Therefore, my bill would \nextend the concept of global interest netting to all periods and would \nmake the change retroactive as if enacted in the 1998 Act.\n  The final business provision included in TEAM-I would simplify the \naccounting for purchases of software by business taxpayers by allowing \nthem to immediately expense the first $20,000 per year instead of \ncapitalizing the cost and depreciating it over three years, as under \ncurrent law. Having to depreciate relatively small software programs, \nwhich are often obsolete well before three years, is costly and \ncomplex.\n\n\n                miscellaneous simplification provisions\n\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today includes a number of \nsmaller but very important simplification provisions designed to ease \nthe tax lives of all taxpayers. Many of these are similar or identical \nto provisions recently passed by the House in the Taxpayer Bill of \nRights 2000 legislation. Other provisions are based on concepts \nrecently suggested to Congress by Mr. Val Oveson, the National Taxpayer \nAdvocate. One of the National Taxpayer Advocate's duties is to \nrecommend to Congress what legislative changes are needed to improve \nthe tax code and make it simpler and easier to administer. Last year, \nMr. Oveson presented 53 separate recommendations for legislative \nimprovement in the tax area. My bill incorporates more than a dozen of \nthe most critical of these recommendations.\n  Also included in the bill are several other tax simplification \nmeasures, suggested by a variety of sources. One of these is S. 1952, a \nbill introduced last year by Senator Abraham that would simplify the \ntaxation of investors who participate in small investment clubs. Also \nincluded is the text of S. 670, a bill introduced last year by Senators \nJeffords and Dodd that would simplify the tax rules for foster care \npayments. This provision was also included in last year's large tax \nbill that was vetoed by President Clinton.\n  Another provision in the bill would help taxpayers who are former \nfoster parents by providing that if those parent provide over one-half \nof the support of a foster child beyond the age where the state pays \nthe expenses, they can claim the former foster child as a dependent, \njust as they could for their own child.\n  Mr. President, I have also included in TEAM-I another simplification \nprovision, suggested by the Clinton Administration in its fiscal year \n2001 budget, which would both simplify the law and remove a \ndisincentive to young people working and saving for their future. Under \ncurrent law, young people who can be claimed as dependents on their \nparents tax returns must file a return and pay income tax if they have \nover $250 of income from savings if their earnings from working plus \nthat income from savings exceeds $700. My bill would increase the \nallowed amount of earnings from savings from $250 to $1,000 before a \nreturn or tax is required.\n  The bill I am introducing today also includes a provision added as a \nfloor amendment to S. 1134, The Affordable Education Act, by Senator \nCollins, myself, and several others. This provision would allow \nelementary and secondary school teachers to deduct the cost of their \nprofessional development expenses without regard to the current-law 2-\npercent of adjusted gross income floor. This adds a small measure of \nboth simplicity and fairness to the tax code.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing is far from perfect. It \nrepresents\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nonly a relatively small down payment on tax simplification in just a \nfew areas of the Internal Revenue Code. However, I hope that its \nintroduction will lay down a marker for tax simplification that will \nevoke further discussion and suggestions from interested groups and \naction toward simplification by my colleagues on the Finance Committee. \nI welcome comments on how this bill can be improved and what other tax \nsimplification items should be considered in the future of this effort.\n  One thing I have learned in my study about the problems of our \ncurrent tax system and ways to improve it is that simplification is far \nfrom simple. Some of the most complex portions of the Internal Revenue \nCode can be easily and reasonably be simplified by their repeal. Others \nparts, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, should not be repealed but \nimproved. Doing so, however, can be most difficult.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, simplification often comes at a cost of lost \nrevenue. While I have not yet received an estimate of the revenue \neffect of this bill from the Joint Committee on Taxation, it seems \nclear that the numbers will be high. However, I have concluded that one \nof the best ways we can spend the projected surplus is on tax \nsimplification. I like to think of it as tax relief for all taxpayers \nthrough simplification. Additionally, I believe that simplification \nshould not create winners and losers. To the extent possible in my \nbill, I have tried to leave all taxpayers at least as well off as under \ncurrent law. This, however, is also costly in terms of lost revenue.\n  While it is unclear whether Congress can pass, or whether the \nPresident will sign, major tax simplification legislation in this \nelection year, I believe these issues are of such importance that we \nshould not wait to embark on a major debate about them. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate and House will join in the discussion, as well \nas taxpayer advocacy groups, businesses, and other stakeholders \nthroughout the nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2643. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprovide increased foreign assistance for tuberculosis prevention, \ntreatment, and control; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                        stop tb now act of 2000\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today my friend the senior Senator from \nHawaii, Senator Inouye, and I are introducing the Stop TB Now Act.\n  This bill would amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize \none hundred million dollars in each of fiscal years 2001 and 2002 to \nfight tuberculosis. Each year, eight million people develop active \ntuberculosis. One and one-half million of those that develop active \ntuberculosis will die from that disease alone. One person can infect 10 \nto 15 people in a year.\n  The global economy and its mobile work force makes the world a \nsmaller place. No country is immune from the reach of this highly \ncontagious disease. In 1999, the United States had almost 18,000 active \nTB cases. That comes to 6.4 per 100,000 people. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control, Alaska was ranked fourth in per capita \ncases of active tuberculosis in 1999. Hawaii has been number one since \nat least 1997.\n  This bill has two components. A treatment strategy and the goal of \narresting the rise of more dangerous strains of tuberculosis. The World \nHealth Organization has developed directly observed treatment, short-\ncourse, referred to by its acronym DOTS. DOTS is a community-based \ntreatment strategy. It uses standardized short course chemotherapy for \n6 to 8 months, with direct observation of TB patients. Strict adherence \nto a drug regime is really the only way to successfully treat TB. \nParticipation at the local level can perpetuate a culture of vigilance \nagainst this and other public health threats. Ineffective treatment \nstrategies in the past have led to the emergency of multi-drug \nresistant tuberculosis, known as MDR-TB.\n  MDR-TB are strains that are resistant to one or both of the two most \neffective existing TB drugs. Drugs to treat MDR-TB are at least 100 \ntimes more expensive than traditional TB drugs.\n  This is a staggering cost. Even in our country where the medical \ncommunity can readily identify and treat MDR-TB, half the patients \nstill die. These are patients using MDR-TB drugs. According to the \nWorld Health Organization, in another 3 to 5 years, without a \ncomprehensive prevention and treatment strategy, drug resistant strains \nof TB will be the dominant form of the disease. Time is of the essence.\n  In my own State of Alaska, we are concerned about the dramatic \nincrease in MDR-TB in the Russian Far East. That region has enormous \ntrade potential for the State. Our native peoples also travel there on \ncultural exchanges. Tuberculosis has been called the poor man's \ndisease. Perhaps from our perspective it was once considered a poor \ncountry's disease. This is not the case and we cannot ignore the global \nreach of this disease and its new variants.\n  I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are concerned \nabout tuberculosis, as well as its association with the AIDS epidemic. \nI urge my colleagues to join Senator Inouye and myself in sponsoring \nthis legislation. It is my hope Congress will act to address this \nthreat this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Santorum, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. L. Chafee):\n  S. 2644. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand Medicare coverage of certain self-injected biologicals; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n       the access to innovation for medicare patients act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we know the Medicare program has not kept \npace with advances in medical care and changing technology, whether \nthrough access to new medical devices or to prescription drugs. \nSometimes seniors do not have access to the most advanced care. That \nneeds to change. Some issues, like adding a prescription drug benefit, \nrequired broad reform of the program and an influx of new money to pay \nfor the changes. But there are some common sense changes that can be \nmade today could enhance access to life-saving therapies for seniors, \nparticularly those living in rural areas, and potentially save Medicare \ndollars.\n  Medicare covers drugs that are administered in the hospital or in a \nphysician's office but will not cover self-injectable drugs or \nbiologics to treat the same disease, notwithstanding the fact that the \nlatter may be superior in terms of efficacy and safety and less \nexpensive. This outdated policy creates a perverse incentive for drug \ncompanies to develop drugs that can only be administered by I.V. in a \nhospital or other acute setting. Those companies that ignore Medicare's \ncoverage policy and develop their products so that they are patient-\nfriendly are penalized, as are the patients who need these products. \nThe end result is often higher costs to the Medicare program, lack of \nbeneficiary access to the best therapies, and treatment delivery \nproblems for beneficiaries in rural areas who may not be in a position \nto travel to a hospital to receive regular treatments.\n  Patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are particularly \nvictimized by this coverage policy. RA is a devastating chronic \ndisease. As the disease progresses, sufferers move from self-\nsufficiency to total disability. The pain in most cases is \nexcruciating. Like all patients with a chronic disease, RA patients \nface extraordinary out of pocket costs. However, Medicare beneficiaries \nwith RA face a unique set of costs.\n  One of the most promising breakthroughs for the treatment of RA is a \nself-injected biologic developed through recombinant DNA technology. It \nalready has been proven to prevent and reverse disability caused by RA, \nas well as dramatically reduce pain and avoid costly surgery. For many \nRA sufferers with private insurance or on Medicaid, it has meant the \ndifference between being confined to a wheelchair and walking--and even \nreturning to the workforce!\n  Since it is self-injected, it is not covered by Medicare. Yet, \nMedicare will cover another therapy which happens to be delivered \nintravenously, simply because it is administered (via I.V.) in a \nhospital. In doing so, Medicare ends\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nup spending more money when one factors in the costs of services and \nancillary drugs associated with administration of this covered therapy. \nJust as important, the current policy denies beneficiaries access to a \ntherapy that has been proven to be more effective, less toxic, and much \neasier to administer. This anomaly in Medicare's existing drug coverage \npolicy is rooted in 1960's medicine, before the advent of biotechnology \nand the development of patient-friendly therapies.\n  Fortunately, there is a simple, budget-neutral way to help seniors \nwho are dependent on Medicare. The Access to Innovation for Medicare \nPatients Act of 2000, which I will introduce today, along with Senators \nMurray, Mikulski, Santorum, Chafee, and Cochran would change Medicare's \ncurrent drug coverage policy to allow coverage for self-injected \nbiologics that are prescribed in lieu of an intravenous or physician-\nadministered therapy. It would provide individuals suffering from \nrheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, and deep vein \nthrombosis access to the latest, most promising biotechnology \ntherapies.\n  This is a modest, common sense change that can and should be \naccomplished this year regardless of what may happen on comprehensive \nMedicare reform. If we do enact a Medicare drug benefit this year, this \nbill should be a part of that. Failure to do so would institutionalize \na coverage gap that denies seniors access to breakthrough technology \nand the best care our medical system provides to everyone else with \nprivate health coverage.\n  According to a budget impact analysis by the Lewin Group, this \nlegislation would not cost the Medicare program money and actually \ncould save approximately $2 million per year. This is a compassionate, \ncommon-sense improvement we can make this year to improve the Medicare \nprogram for seniors. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring \nthis bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Access to \nInnovation for Medicare Patients Act of 2000 and to thank my fellow \ncolleague from Washington state, Senator Gorton, for his work on this \nimportant legislation. The Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients \nAct is critical for Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from chronic and \ndebilitating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple \nsclerosis.\n  As many of you know, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis most \noften affect women. Until recently, few treatments existed. But \nadvances in biotechnology products have given hope to thousands of \nindividuals. Self-injectable biologic therapies have proven highly \neffective in reducing the daily, chronic pain that accompanies these \ndevastating diseases. Patients have reported amazing results from self-\ninjectable biologic therapies such as Enbrel in clinical trials.\n  However, before the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act, \nno legislation existed that addressed adequate Medicare coverage of \nthese therapies. Currently, Medicare only covers physician-administered \ntherapies and most Medicare prescription drug coverage proposals do not \naddress this issue at all or they place restrictive coverage caps on \nthe use of self-injectable biologic therapies. Beneficiaries should not \nbe denied access to the most effective and convenient therapies for \ntheir condition. Ultimately, coverage of self-injectable biologic \ntherapies could save Medicare money in reducing costly, prolonged \nhospital stays and reducing the number of care provider visits. Most \nimportantly, this legislation will improve the lives of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who suffer from these diseases. Congress must ensure that \nseniors and the disabled receive the best possible medical treatment \nand therapies through the Medicare program.\n  Finally, on a more personal note, my family has had first-hand \nexperience with the constant pain and frustration caused by multiple \nsclerosis. My father suffered from this devastating disease, and I \nwitnessed his daily fight to overcome the pain that accompanied it. I \nknow that self-injectable biologic therapy may have made his fight much \neasier. We cannot allow Medicare beneficiaries to suffer from \npreventable, overwhelming pain.\n  In the past, we worked to eliminate barriers to care and research. \nToday, we seek to tear down Medicare's barriers to self-injectable \nbiologic therapies. Seniors and the disabled should not be denied these \nlife-saving, treatments simply because they are self-injected.\n  Therefore, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators Gorton, \nMikulski, Cochran, Stevens, and Chafee in introducing the Access to \nInnovation for Medicare Patients Act. This legislation would: provide \naccess to innovative therapies that are now on the market and making \nenormous improvements in the life and care of Medicare beneficiaries; \nallow physicians to prescribe the most appropriate therapy for their \npatients; make a common-sense, responsible change in Medicare; and \neliminate the current bias against biotechnology therapies inherent in \nthe Medicare program and many of the prescription drug proposals.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2665. A bill to establish a streamlined process to enable the \nNavajo Nation to lease trust lands without having to obtain the \napproval of the Secretary of the Interior of individual leases, except \nleases for exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral \nresources; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n              navajo nation trust land leasing act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, to introduce the Navajo Nation Trust Land Leasing Act of \n2000, a bill to establish a streamlined process for the Navajo Nation \nto lease trust lands without having to obtain the approval of the \nSecretary of the Interior. This new authority would apply to individual \nleases, except leases for exploration, development, or extraction of \nany mineral resources.\n  Mr. President, the current leasing process simply does not work very \nwell. It can be cumbersome, and, because of the need to obtain approval \nfrom both the Nation and the Interior Department, the process can be \nlengthy. That can discourage many businesses from even considering \nlocating the Navajo Reservation.\n  The fact is, there is no longer a need for the Secretary to be \ninvolved in routine leasing decisions that can and should be made by \nthe Nation itself.\n  The changes proposed in this bill are intended to speed up the \nprocess for issuing leases by at least 50 percent, create predictable \nprocedures for leasing trust land, and create incentives for businesses \nto open and operate in the Navajo Nation. It would help improve the \nmanagement of tribal property, and promote economic development within \nthe 100 Chapters of the Navajo Nation.\n  The need to create jobs and diversify the Reservation economy are \nclear. A December 1998 report by the Navajo Nation Division of Economic \nDevelopment reported that the unemployment rate for the Nation was 43.3 \npercent, up 15.5 percent from 1990. An estimated 56 percent of Navajo \nfamilies live below the poverty level, with a per capita annual income \nof just $5,759.\n\n  The lack of employment opportunities, low industrialization, slow \ndevelopment, insufficient infrastructure, weak economy, and difficulty \nin obtaining homesites and housing are causing many Navajo people to \nrelocate to urban areas.\n  The Navajo Nation is looking for ways to reform its regulations to \nmake it easier to attract and retain new businesses, and to create jobs \nthat will improve the standard of living of Navajo people. The reforms \nin the Navajo National Trust Land Leasing Act will give the Nation some \nof the tools it needs to succeed in that regard.\n  Mr. President, the bill incorporates suggestions made by both the \nNavajo Nation and the Department of the Interior. There is one \nprovision, though, that I will ask the Nation and the Department to \nreview and provide further input. That is paragraph three of the \nproposed new Section 415(e) of title 25 of the U.S. Code.\n  As introduced, the bill gives the Secretary of the Interior the \nauthority to approve or disapprove the Navajo Nation regulations under \nwhich the tribe will subsequently consider and approve leases of trust \nland. The Nation understandably wants to ensure that the Secretary acts \npromptly on the regulations once they are submitted. We do\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nnot intend that the Secretary should be able to veto the regulations \nthrough inaction.\n  One way to address that concern is through the imposition of some \ntime limit for Secretarial review--maybe 30 days. Another way might be \nto establish criteria in the law for the Secretary to use in reviewing \nthe Nation's regulations. That approach would give the Secretary some \nguidance as to how the regulations should be assessed. It would also \ngive the Navajo Nation some assurance that objective criteria will \nguide the Secretary's action. If the regulations meet the criteria, the \nSecretary's ability to disapprove them would be limited.\n  As I said, I will be asking both the Interior Department and the \nNation for their further recommendations about these various \napproaches. The bill language on Secretarial approval or disapproval \nshould, therefore, be considered open to change.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks, and I look forward to early \naction on the legislation:\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2665\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Navajo Nation Trust Land \n     Leasing Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Recognizing the special relationship between \n     the United States and the Navajo nation and its members, and \n     the Federal responsibility to the Navajo people, Congress \n     finds that--\n       (1) the third clause of section 8, Article I of the United \n     States Constitution provides that ``The Congress shall have \n     Power...to regulate Commerce...with Indian tribes'', and, \n     through this and other constitutional authority, Congress has \n     plenary power over Indian affairs;\n       (2) Congress, through statutes, treaties, and the general \n     course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the \n     responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian \n     tribes and their resources;\n       (3) the United States has a trust obligation to guard and \n     preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster \n     strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency;\n       (4) pursuant to the first section of the Act of August 9, \n     1955 (25 U.S.C. 415), Congress conferred upon the Secretary \n     of the Interior the power to promulgate regulations governing \n     tribal leases and to approve tribal leases for tribes \n     according to regulations promulgated by the Secretary;\n       (5) the Secretary of the Interior has promulgated the \n     regulations described in paragraph (4) at part 162 of title \n     25, Code of Federal Regulations;\n       (6) the requirement that the Secretary approve leases for \n     the development of Navajo trust lands has added a level of \n     review and regulation that does not apply to the development \n     of non-Indian land; and\n       (7) in the global economy of the 21st Century, it is \n     crucial that individual leases of Navajo trust lands not be \n     subject to Secretarial approval and that the Navajo Nation be \n     able to make immediate decisions over the use of Navajo trust \n     lands.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To establish a streamlined process for the Navajo \n     Nation to lease trust lands without having to obtain the \n     approval of the Secretary of the Interior of individual \n     leases, except leases for exploration, development, or \n     extraction of any mineral resources.\n       (2) To authorize the Navajo nation, pursuant to tribal \n     regulations, which must be approved by the Secretary, to \n     lease Navajo trust lands without the approval of the \n     Secretary of the Interior of the individual leases, except \n     leases for exploration, development, or extraction of any \n     mineral resources.\n       (3) To revitalize the distressed Navajo Reservation by \n     promoting political self-determination, and encouraging \n     economic self-sufficiency, including economic development \n     that increases productivity and the standard of living for \n     members of the Navajo Nation.\n       (4) To maintain, strengthen, and protect the Navajo \n     Nation's leasing power over Navajo trust lands.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e)).\n       (2) Navajo nation.--The term ``Navajo Nation'' means the \n     Navajo Nation government that is in existence on the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Tribal regulations.--The term ``tribal regulations'' \n     means the Navajo Nation regulations as enacted by the Navajo \n     Nation Council or its standing committees and approved by the \n     Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. LEASE OF RESTRICTED LANDS FOR THE NAVAJO NATION.\n\n       The first section of the Act of August 9, 1955 (25 U.S.C. \n     415) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and inserting \n     a semicolon; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) the term `individually owned Navajo Indian allotted \n     lands' means Navajo Indian allotted land that is owned by 1 \n     or more individuals located within the Navajo Nation;\n       ``(4) the term `Navajo Nation' means the Navajo Nation \n     government that is in existence on the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       ``(5) the term `Secretary' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior; and\n       ``(6) the term `tribal regulations' means the Navajo Nation \n     regulations as enacted by the Navajo Nation Council or its \n     standing committees and approved by the Secretary.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e)(1) Any leases by the Navajo Nation for purposes \n     authorized under subsection (a), except a lease for the \n     exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral \n     resources, shall not require the approval of the Secretary if \n     the term of the lease does not exceed 75 years (including \n     options to renew), and the lease is executed under tribal \n     regulations that are approved by the Secretary under this \n     subsection.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to individually owned \n     Navajo Indian allotted land located within the Navajo Nation.\n       ``(3) The Secretary shall have the authority to approve or \n     disapprove tribal regulations required under paragraph (1). \n     The Secretary shall not have approval authority over \n     individual leases of Navajo trust lands, except for the \n     exploration, development, or extraction of any mineral \n     resources. The Secretary shall perform the duties of the \n     Secretary under this subsection in the best interest of the \n     Navajo Nation.\n       ``(4) If the Navajo Nation has executed a lease pursuant to \n     tribal regulations required under paragraph (1), the United \n     states shall not be liable for losses sustained by any party \n     to such lease, including the Navajo Nation, except that--\n       ``(A) the Secretary shall continue to have a trust \n     obligation to ensure that the rights of the Navajo Nation are \n     protected in the event of a violation of the terms of any \n     lease by any other party to such lease, including the right \n     to cancel the lease if requested by the Navajo Nation; and\n       ``(B) nothing in this subsection shall be construed to \n     absolve the United States from any responsibility to the \n     Navajo Nation, including responsibilities that derive from \n     the trust relationship and from any treaties, Executive \n     Orders, or agreements between the United States and the \n     Navajo Nation, except as otherwise specifically provided in \n     this subsection.''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kyl today \nin introducing a bill to remove a major impediment to business \ndevelopment on the Navajo Nation. Our bill will accelerate the long and \narduous process now in place for obtaining a business site lease on the \nNavajo Nation. For years I have heard case after case of large and \nsmall businesses waiting from two years to four years, and longer, for \nsuch a lease. Delays occur in both the tribal and the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs (BIA) lease approval processes.\n  This dual process exists as a direct result of the U.S. Government's \ntrust responsibility for Indian reservation lands. In study after study \nfor the past three decades, the tediously slow and cumbersome land \nleasing process on the Navajo Nation has been identified as a major \nobstacle to attracting new private business ventures.\n  In our search for ways to encourage more private enterprise for \nNavajos, I encouraged and sponsored the Navajo Economic Summit in \nTohatchi, New Mexico in 1987. Again, many of our key speakers from the \nbusiness world reminded us that the Navajo Nation itself, and its \nprotective federal agency, the BIA, needed to find a better way to make \nland available for private enterprises.\n  Along another avenue of encouraging businesses to go to, or expand on \nthe Navajo Nation, I cosponsored legislation by Senators Inouye and \nMcCain that was incorporated into the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \nof 1993. In Sections 13321 and 13322 of that Act, we were able to enact \ngenerous wage tax credits and accelerated depreciation for businesses \nthat chose to locate or expand on America's Indian reservations. \nDespite the availability of a wage tax credit for every eligible Indian \nhired, many businesses still viewed the complexity of Indian courts and \nland allocation methods as comparable third world nations.\n  Business has not flocked to the Navajo Nation, although many tribes \naround the country have taken advantage of this wage tax credit. Our \nincentives allow a direct credit off-taxes\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nowed at the rate of 20 percent of the first $20,000 paid in wages and \nhealth insurance for every Indian hired. In addition, all investments \nfrom infrastructure to computers were given accelerated depreciation \nrates, about one-third faster than non-reservation investments.\n  The Navajo Nation is our Nation's largest Indian reservation in both \narea and population. About 200,000 Navajos live on a reservation that \nstraddles four States and is slightly larger than the entire state of \nWest Virginia. Unfortunately, the poverty rate is high, unemployment \nhovers around 40 percent year after year, and private sector jobs are \nall too rare. Sadly, the time lag for obtaining a new land lease also \nremains painstakingly slow.\n  I commend Navajo President Kelsey Begaye for his interest in \nencouraging a better system for making land available for businesses \nand other purposes. Although other incentives like access to State and \nFederal courts will still be needed, a faster land lease will go a long \nway to encourage more business activity.\n  Our bill will establish a streamlined process for the Navajo Nation \nto lease trust lands without having to obtain the approval of the \nInterior for individual leases. The exception is exploration, \ndevelopment, or extraction of any mineral resources. These types of \nleases will still require Secretarial approval.\n  The Secretary of Interior would be required to approve the \nregulations adopted by the Navajo Nation to implement this new leasing \nauthority. Once approved, the Navajo Nation would have regulatory \nauthority to finalize land leases that do not exceed 75 years. They \nwill be able to do this without having to be second guessed by the BIA \nin a follow-up process that always adds months, and sometimes years, to \nthe process.\n  The trust obligation of the Secretary of Interior would remain in \nplace. The Navajo Nation, would, in effect, be acting as an agent of \nthe Secretary. By eliminating the need for Secretarial (BIA) review of \nits land leasing decisions, however, our legislation will allow a more \nefficient land leasing system to be put in place.\n  I am confident that President Begaye's Administration will work hard \nto reduce the time the Navajo Nation itself now takes to issue a lease. \nWithout the follow-up review by the BIA, the potential business \napplicant will be able to open up months sooner.\n  Rather than getting caught in a blame game, a new lease applicant \nwill be able to focus on a single process for obtaining a land lease, \nand the Navajo Nation will be the responsible party for delays. Again, \nI admire the courage of President Begaye's Administration for its \nwillingness to accept this responsibility and to encourage more private \nsector business activity on the largest Indian reservation in our \ncountry.\n  I believe this initiative will encourage the Navajo Nation to be more \nbusiness friendly. I urge my colleagues to join us in allowing the \nNavajo Nation to fully accept the responsibility for creating a single \ntrack land leasing system in place of the dual system now required.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2666. A bill to secure the Federal voting rights of persons who \nhave fully served their sentences, including parole and probation, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    civic participation act of 2000\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Civic \nParticipation Act of 2000. This legislation would guarantee that \nindividuals who have fully served their sentences have the right to \nvote in Federal elections.\n  The right to vote in a democracy is the most basic act of \ncitizenship. It is a right that may not be abridged or denied by the \nUnited States, or any State, on account of race, color, gender or \nprevious condition of servitude. This fundamental right is truly the \nmost glaring example of a free society.\n  I can't help but think of Nelson Mandela's perspective on the right \nto vote. One would think that the most significant day in Mr. Mandela's \nlife would have been the day he walked out of a South African prison \nafter more than 27 years behind bars. Or perhaps, it might be the day \nhe assumed the Presidency of post-apartheid South Africa. In fact, Mr. \nMandela has said that the most important day in his life was the day he \nvoted for the first time.\n  Mr. President, I am troubled that many people in this country are \ndenied the right to vote, even when any sentence of imprisonment, \nparole or probation has been fully completed. Additionally, many \nindividuals who have fully served their sentences and wish to regain \ntheir right to vote, must petition a pardon board, their State \nGovernors, or even, in some States, must obtain a Presidential pardon. \nFew people have the financial or political resources needed to succeed \nin such efforts.\n  Furthermore, the denial of suffrage disproportionately affects ethnic \nminorities. Recent studies have indicated that an estimated thirteen \npercent of adult African-American males are unable to vote as a result \nof varying state disenfranchisement laws. This is even more troubling \nwhen we consider that voter turnout, especially among America's youth, \nis at a record low. As elected officials who have been given the \nprivilege to serve by our fellow Americans, we need to recognize that \nthe strength of a democracy depends upon the voluntary participation of \nits citizens.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. Criminal activity must be punished. \nStiff and appropriate sentences should be imposed upon those who \nviolate our laws. However, we should not be disenfranchising those \ncitizens who have fully completed their prescribed sentences, \nespecially when those citizens should be reintegrated into society and \nour citizen-dependent democracy.\n  I want to make it perfectly clear that this legislation, in no way, \nextends voting rights to prisoners. In fact, my colleagues in the \nSenate know that I have led the fight in this body against frivolous \nlawsuits filed by prisoners. Furthermore, this legislation does not \nextend voting rights to persons on parole or probation. This \nlegislation simply states that anyone who has successfully, and \ncompletely, served their entire sentence, including any parole and \nprobation, may not be denied the right to vote.\n  Finally, this legislation would apply only to Federal elections, \nthereby protecting the rights of individual States to establish voting \nprocedures for State elections.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to reiterate that this \nlegislation is narrowly drafted to guarantee one of the most \nfundamental rights of citizens of our democracy, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this worthy endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2667. A bill to designate the Washington Opera in Washington, \nD.C., as the National Opera; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n designating the washington opera in washington, d.c., as the national \n                                 opera\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday with Senator Kennedy, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Jeffords, and \nSenator Robb to designate the Washington Opera as the National Opera.\n  The Washington Opera has been an innovative leader in bringing to the \nmetropolitan Washington area exceptional performances since 1956. The \ncompany has enjoyed tremendous success in the community over the years. \nSince 1980, the company has grown from 16 performances of four operas \nto 80 performances of eight operas for the 2000 season.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is to recognize in our \nnation's capital an opera of national significance. Let me be clear to \nmy colleagues that this legislation does not extend any Federal \nresponsibilities or obligation for funding to the Washington Opera. It \nwould not become part of any Federal activity. Today, the Washington \nOpera enjoys a contractual relationship with the Kennedy Center for the \nPerforming Arts for use of its facilities. It is not affiliated with \nthe Kennedy Center in any way other than being named as the resident \nopera company. This is an honorary designation, but there is no \nfinancial support for the opera from the Kennedy Center.\n  The legislation is only intended as a means of recognition of opera \nin our Nation's capital and its mission to bring to the nation a forum \nto highlight our musical heritage. Under its\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nnew name, the National Opera will bring contained performances of \nAmerican opera to the stage.\n  The history of the Washington Opera and its commitment to bringing \nopera as an art form to the Washington area community is to be \ncommended. The Washington Opera's Education and Community Programs are \ndedicated to educating future audiences and making the experience of \nopera more available to residents of the region. Since 1992, over \n150,000 students have participated in these programs. Today, there are \nover 22 programs that provide performance experiences, curriculum \nactivities, in-school artist visits, professional development \nopportunities for teachers and young artists, and other activities that \nbring opera into our schools and communities.\n  Mr. President, with this national recognition comes the obligation \nfor the Washington Opera to undertake additional programs to serve a \nlarger national audience, expand community outreach for underprivileged \nyouth, and other missions that embody a larger national presence. I am \nconfident that the opera will enthusiastically accept this challenge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation appear in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2667\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Washington Opera, organized under the laws of the \n     District of Columbia, is designated as the ``National \n     Opera''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Washington Opera \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the ``National Opera''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2668. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nimprove procedures for the adjustment of status of aliens, to reduce \nthe backlog of family-sponsored aliens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       family, work and immigrant integration amendments of 2000\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nbipartisan immigration legislation that will have a tremendous impact \non thousands of families in the United States.\n  I am very pleased to be working with my colleague, Gordon Smith of \nOregon, on this effort.\n  There are several reasons for the introduction of this legislation.\n  1. It corrects past injustices.\n  Many of the immigrants helped by this legislation have been active, \nproductive, hard-working members of our community for many years.\n  For example, the majority of Central Americans helped by this \nlegislation have been in the United States since the early 1980s, when \nthey fled tyranny and turmoil in their home countries.\n  The were welcomed into our nation by President Ronald Reagan.\n  These Central American nationals were made retroactively deportable \nby the 1996 immigration bill.\n  This legislation provides a state option to help legal immigrant \nchildren get needed health care.\n  The 1996 welfare bill deprived vulnerable, legal children from \nbenefits.\n  This change is good public policy, from a health care perspective, an \nimmigration perspective and a humanitarian perspective.\n  2. It is pro-family.\n  This legislation will speed the process that reunites family members.\n  It has been over ten years since the limits on family immigration \nwere adjusted. This has resulted in waiting periods that could last \nyears to bring immediate family members together.\n  Spouses and children would have an easier time in obtaining visas to \nvisit their loved ones through this legislation.\n  In current practice, it is often very difficult to travel to visit \nlegal residents in the United States while their immigration documents \nare pending--our legislation would ease the bureaucracy to allow \nfamilies to be together for the events that shape their lives.\n  3. It is pro-business.\n  Congress has focused this session on increasing the number of high-\ntech workers for U.S. companies. I have long been supportive of that \nproposal.\n  Protections are in place for U.S. workers, and American business has \nthe resources needed to keep our economy booming.\n  This legislation is pro-business in two ways.\n  It builds the pool of legal workers available by swifter family \nreunification.\n  And it offers an avenue for those workers who are already here and \nworking to remain here.\n  They can stay here, and increase the productivity of our nation's \nbusinesses, or they can leave and work for foreign competitors.\n  I want them to stay.\n  Alan Greenspan agrees.\n  He has said during a House Banking and Financial Services Committee \nmeeting in July of last year:\n\n       Aggregated demand is putting very significant pressures on \n     an ever-decreasing supply of unemployed labor. The one \n     obvious means that we can use to offset that is expanding the \n     number of people we allow in. . . . I think in reviewing our \n     immigration laws in the context of the type of economy which \n     we will be enjoying in the decade ahead is clearly on the \n     table. . . .\n     4. Its omnibus nature allows groups to work together toward a \n         common goal\n  All sides win in this equation.\n  Families. Children. Business. Our economy\n  By combining forces, groups that care about these issues can work \ntogether toward a comprehensive, prudent, rational immigration policy.\n  These coalitions are already being built.\n  I would like to submit a letter from May 16, 2000 from Jack Kemp, \nHenry Cisneros, and a wide range of business, religious, labor and \nimmigrant advocacy groups endorsing components of this legislation.\n  This is a wonderful example of groups at the national and local level \ncoalescing together around pro-family, pro-business, pro-justice \nideals.\n  Our current immigration debates have had the negative effect of \npitting one segment of our society against another, and pitting one \nnationality against another.\n  In the past . . . the debate has been if businesses get more workers, \nfamily reunification will suffer.\n  Nicaraguans and Cubans receive a swifter and more generous \nimmigration status than similarly situated Central American and \nCaribbean nationals.\n  No one wins if these divides remain.\n  All of us win if we can work together and strengthen our nation by \ncorrecting past injustices, reuniting families and providing American \nbusinesses with the workers they desperately need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Since the bill covers many issues, I would like to submit a summary \nof the legislation for the Record along with the test and a supporting \nletter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2668\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Central American and Haitian Parity: provides for \n     adjustment of status for Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans \n     and Haitians on the same terms as that extended to Cubans and \n     Nicaraguans in 1997 under NACARA.\n       2. Extension of filing deadlines for applications for \n     adjustment of status of certain Cuban, Nicaraguan, and \n     Haitian nationals: extends the deadline to apply for \n     adjustment of status by one year after the date of issuance \n     of final NACARA regulations.\n       3. Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness: allows Liberian \n     refugees who have been continuously present in the US to \n     apply for adjustment of status.\n       4. Increased Flexibility in Employment-Based Immigration: \n     eliminates per country limitation if additional visas are \n     available, increases portability of H-1B visas, encourages \n     swifter adjudication of petitions, and allows unused visas \n     from one year to be used the following year.\n       5. Restoration of Section 245(i): restores the provision \n     permitting those who are out of status but otherwise eligible \n     for permanent residence to adjust their status in the United \n     States by paying a fine.\n       6. 1986 Registry Date: updates the current registry date \n     from 1972 to 1986 that allows adjustment of status to all \n     persons of good character who have resided in the United \n     States prior to 1986. The registry date would be moved up one \n     year each for the next five years to 1991 in FY 2006.\n       7. Backlog reduction for family-sponsored immigrants: would \n     provide additional visas for family members of citizens and \n     permanent residents to reduce backlogs in the family-based \n     immigration categories: 250,000 additional visas for three \n     years, 200,000 for two years and 150,000 permanently; per \n     country ceilings are raised proportionately.\n       8. Alien Child Protection Act: provides unaccompanied or \n     orphaned children in the jurisdiction of the INS with several \n     protections. Among other things, it states that if a child is \n     detained, it must be in a child-appropriate facility. They \n     can have access to a guardian ad litem or similar advocate to \n     navigate through the immigration process.\n       9. Benefits Restoration: restores modest benefits for legal \n     immigrants, including optional eligibility of certain \n     immigrants for Medicaid and optional eligibility of immigrant \n     children for SCHIP programs (state child health plans). \n     States would be given the option to provide Medicaid to all \n     children and pregnant women who are lawfully residing in the \n     US, regardless of when they arrived. Pregnant women would \n     remain eligible during the first 60 days after their \n     pregnancy. If a state elects the Medicaid option, it may also \n     provide all lawfully present children access to this CHIP \n     (state child health plan) program. Immigrant sponsors would \n     not be required to pay back assistance provided to children \n     or pregnant women.\n       10. Admission of spouses and children of certain \n     nonimmigrants: would allow spouses and children of permanent \n     residents who have green card applications pending to enter \n     the US with nonimmigrant student and/or visitor visas. \n     Hundreds of thousands can't get nonimmigrant student and/or \n     visitor visas now because of State Department interpretations \n     that if you have a green card application pending you are \n     presumed likely to overstay a temporary visa to visit the US \n     on a limited basis.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 16, 2000.\n       Dear Members of Congress. Today, as throughout American \n     history, immigrants have proven essential to the economic, \n     political and social development of our nation. Immigrants \n     make important contributions consistent with America's \n     fundamental values of family, work, justice and community.\n       It is important that our immigration policies reflect these \n     values and ensure that all persons enjoy equal protection and \n     due process under the Constitution and laws of the land. Our \n     immigration policies should also be responsive to economic \n     needs and ensure appropriate protections and opportunities \n     for citizens and immigrants.\n       Immigration reforms consistent with American values and \n     economic needs should be a high priority on the national \n     agenda this year.\n       Currently, there is wide support in Congress for \n     immigration reforms to address the need to better educate and \n     train citizens and lawful immigrants now here, and to \n     increase the number of H-B visas to admit more highly-skilled \n     immigrants so as to meet the economic needs of certain \n     industries experiencing shortages of workers with these \n     skills. While we may differ on specific provisions of \n     proposed bills, we agree that appropriate skilled immigrant \n     admissions contribute to economic growth and job creation.\n       The undersigned further believe that, in addition to \n     proposals on high skilled visas, the following issues \n     regarding persons already in the United States or awaiting \n     family reunification also warrant congressional\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\n     action as early as possible: 1) allow Salvadorans, \n     Guatemalans, Hondurans and Haitians to apply for adjustment \n     of status on the same terms as already provided to Cubans and \n     Nicaraguans in 1997; 2) allow adjustment of status to all \n     persons of good character who have resided in the United \n     States and established ties to American communities; 3) \n     restore the provision permitting those who are out of status \n     but otherwise eligible for permanent residence to adjust \n     their status in the United States; 4) reunite families by \n     establishing a program to provide additional visas for family \n     members of citizens and permanent residents so as to reduce \n     unacceptable backlogs and help stabilize the workforce.\n       Other immigration reforms also deserve congressional \n     action, which will be addressed in further correspondence. We \n     believe that there is a broad consensus now that Congress \n     should enact the proposals noted above on a priority basis in \n     the national interest.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                              Individuals\n\n     Henry Cisneros.\n     Richard Gilder.\n     Bill Ong Hing.\n     Jack Kemp.\n     Rick Swartz.\n\n\n                         national organizations\n\n       Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist, President\n       Center for Equal Opportunity, Linda Chavez, President\n       Club for Growth, Steve Moore, President\n       Empower America, J.T.

Con. Res. 118\n\n       Whereas 60 years ago, between April 3 and the end of May \n     1940, more than 22,000 Polish military officers, police \n     officers, judges, other government officials, and civilians \n     were executed by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD;\n       Whereas Joseph Stalin and other leaders of the Soviet \n     Union, following meeting of the Soviet Politburo on March 5, \n     1940, signed the decision to execute these Polish captives;\n       Whereas 14,537 of these Polish victims have been documented \n     at 3 sites, 4,406 in Katyn (now in Belarus), 6,311 in \n     Miednoye (now in Russia), and 3,820 in Kharkiv (now in \n     Ukraine);\n       Whereas the fate of approximately 7,000 other victims \n     remains unknown and their graves together with the graves of \n     other victims of communism, are scattered around the \n     territory of the former Soviet Union and are now impossible \n     to locate precisely;\n       Whereas on April 13, 1943, the German army announced the \n     discovery of the massive graves in the Katyn Forest, when \n     that area was under Nazi occupation;\n       Whereas on April 15, 1943, the Soviet Information Bureau \n     disavowed the executions and attempted to cover up the Soviet \n     Union's responsibility for these executions by declaring that \n     these Polish captives had been engaged in construction work \n     west of Smolensk and had fallen into the hands of the \n     Germans, who executed them;\n       Whereas on April 28-30, 1943, an international commission \n     of 12 medical experts visited Katyn at the invitation of the \n     German government and later reported unanimously that the \n     Polish officers had been shot three years earlier when the \n     Smolensk area was under Soviet administration;\n       Whereas until 1990 the Government of the Soviet Union \n     denied any responsibility for the massacres and claimed to \n     possess no information about the fate of the missing Polish \n     victims;\n       Whereas on April 13, 1990, Soviet President Mikhail \n     Gorbachev acknowledged the Soviet responsibility for the \n     Katyn executions;\n       Whereas this admission confirmed the 1951-52 extensive \n     investigation by the United States House of Representatives \n     Select Committee to Conduct an Investigation and Study of the \n     Facts, Evidence, and Circumstances of the Katyn Forest \n     Massacre and its Final Report (pursuant to House Resolution \n     H.R. 390 and H.R. 539, 82d Congress);\n       Whereas that committee's final report of December 22, 1952, \n     unanimously concluded that ``beyond any question of \n     reasonable doubt, that the Soviet NKVD (People's Commissariat \n     of Internal Affairs) committed the mass murders of the Polish \n     officers and intellectual leaders in the Katyn Forest near \n     Smolensk'' and that the Soviet Union ``is directly \n     responsible for the Katyn massacre''; and\n       Whereas that report also concluded that ``approximately \n     15,000 Polish prisoners were interned in three Soviet camps: \n     Kozielsk, Starobielsk, and Ostashkov in the winter of 1939-\n     40'' and, ``with the exception of 400 prisoners, these men \n     have not been heard from, seen, or found since the spring of \n     1940'': Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress hereby--\n       (1) remembers and honors those Polish officers, government \n     officials, and civilians who were murdered in April and May \n     1940 by the NKVD;\n       (2) recognizes all those scholars, researchers, and writers \n     from Poland, Russia, the United States and, elsewhere and, \n     particularly, those who worked under Soviet and communist \n     domination and who had the courage to tell the truth about \n     the crimes committed at Katyn, Miednoye, and Kharkiv; and\n       (3) urges all people to remember and honor these and other \n     victims of communism so that such crimes will never be \n     repeated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4489-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4489-S4491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 314--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING \n   THE VIOLENCE, BREAKDOWN OF RULE OF LAW, AND TROUBLED PRE-ELECTION \n                   PERIOD IN THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, Zimbabwe is in the midst of a political \ncrisis that threatens its future, and that is destabilizing its \nregional neighbors. I believe the Senate should go on record in support \nof Zimbabwe's democratic activists and against the authoritarian \ntactics of President Robert Mugabe, whose campaign of state-directed \nviolence and intimidation against opposition party members, farmers, \nand farm workers are devastating the nation he leads, impoverishing his \npeople and tarnishing his country's prospects.\n  As my colleagues know, in February, President Mugabe lost a \nreferendum he had called in expectation of victory to grant himself \nadditional constitutional powers. This historic loss, coupled with the \nemergence of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, signaled \nthat Mugabe's days as President were numbered.\n  But after twenty years in power, hopes that Mugabe would go quietly \ninto the night after founding and presiding over his nation for two \ndecades are demonstrably naive. Mugabe today is clearly doing \neverything in his power to avoid joining the tiny cadre of African \nleaders who have voluntarily transferred power following free and fair \nelections. On the contrary: Mugabe has incited a racial crisis over \nproperty rights and sent his army to fight a war in which Zimbabwe has \nno stake, all in the hopes of prolonging his hold on the power he \napparently regards as his birthright. But the average Zimbabwean, who \nis poorer by one-third than when Mugabe came to power twenty years ago \nand who currently suffers the effects of 50 percent unemployment and an \ninflation rate of 70 percent, would likely disagree with Mugabe's \nassessment of the continuing benefits of his rule.\n  President Mugabe has shamelessly encouraged the squatter occupation \nof Zimbabwe's commercial farms for political purposes. In doing so, he \nactively abandons the rule of law in favor of mob rule, in the process \ndestroying the nation's wealth. An internationally agreed-upon process \nof land redistribution funded by Britain, the United States, and other \npowers collapsed after it became clear that the only land \nredistribution Mugabe favored was that which transferred white-owned \nfarms intact to his political cronies.\n  As if economic collapse and politically motivated race-baiting \nweren't enough, Mugabe has dispatched 12,000 troops to fight in the \ncivil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, at a cost of millions of \ndollars to his government, while an AIDS crisis and economic stagnation \ngrow. Independent observers cannot discern any tangible Zimbabwean \nnational interest in Congo that merits a costly troop deployment, \nalthough such observers do note that Mugabe and his military allies \nhave profited handsomely from using the mission to exploit Congo's \nnatural resource base.\n  Facing heavy domestic and international pressure, Mugabe has finally \nscheduled elections for next month. Based on its level of popular \nsupport, the beleaguered Movement for Democratic Change should do very \nwell in the upcoming parliamentary elections, assuming they are not \nstolen by Mugabe and his ZANU-PF. The current rubber-stamp parliament, \nin which the ZANU-PF controls 147 of 150 seats, would likely change \nhands, altering the country's course and hopefully reinstating the rule \nof law and the democratic protections Zimbabwe's people deserve. Many \nobservers believe, however, that only intense and sustained \ninternational pressure can prevent an electoral outcome inconsistent \nwith the wishes of Zimbabwe's voters.\n  The level of election-related violence and intimidation against the \nopposition is made clear by a May 22, 2000, International Republican \nInstitute report, from which I quote:\n\n       The [Movement for Democratic Change] released on May 10 a \n     comprehensive report documenting more than 5,000 acts of \n     violence and intimidation throughout the country in the past \n     10 weeks. At least 15 black MDC members and supporters, four \n     white farmers, and a policeman have been killed since the \n     February constitutional referendum that marked ZANU-PF's \n     first defeat at the ballot box since taking power in 1980. At \n     least 300 people have been driven from rural homes that have \n     been wrecked or burned. Hundreds have been beaten and maimed. \n     At least eight women have been raped because of perceived \n     allegiance to opposition parties. In 92 percent of the cases, \n     the perpetrators of the violence were either known supporters \n     of the ruling party or government employees. Of the victims, \n     41 percent were MDC supporters and 51 percent were black farm \n     workers and suspected MDC sympathizers. Most observers agree \n     that land reform is not the real issue, but is being used as \n     a smokescreen to mask government efforts to crush political \n     opposition.\n\n  The International Republican Institute, which I chair, is deeply \ninvolved in pre-election security, training, and registration and will \nplay an important monitoring role throughout Zimbabwe's electoral \nprocess. IRI is sponsoring an audit of Zimbabwe's voter registration \nrolls, training 3,000 domestic poll monitors, conducting voter \neducation and public opinion polling, providing funding to support \nlegal challenges to electoral conditions inimical to a free and fair \nvote, sponsoring an election-related violence-monitoring unit, and \nfielding a bipartisan international election observation team to \nobserve and report on the electoral process in Zimbabwe. Both IRI and \nits counterpart, the National Democratic Institute, have indicated that \nthe conditions for credible democratic elections simply do not exist at \npresent.\n  In light of these grim pre-electoral assessments, and the heavy-\nhandedness of Mugabe's rule in the period preceding the vote, I believe \nthe Senate should clearly state its support for free and transparent \nelections in Zimbabwe, the rule of law, appropriate international \nassistance for a peaceful process of land reform, and the political \nactivists who brave Mugabe's wrath in the name of democratic rule. My \nresolution makes a series of findings concerning the violence, \nbreakdown of rule of law, and troubled pre-election period in Zimbabwe. \nThe resolution resolves that the Senate:\n  (1) extends its support to the vast majority of citizens of the \nRepublic of Zimbabwe who are committed to peace, economic prosperity, \nand an open, transparent parliamentary election process;\n\n  (2) strongly urges the Government of Zimbabwe to enforce the rule of \nlaw and fulfill its responsibility to protect the political and civil \nrights of all citizens;\n  (3) supports those international efforts to assist with land reform \nwhich are consistent with accepted principles of international law and \nwhich take place after the holding of free and fair parliamentary \nelections;\n  (4) condemns government-directed violence against farm workers, \nfarmers, and opposition party members;\n  (5) encourages the local media, civil society, and all political \nparties to work together toward a campaign environment conducive to \nfree, transparent and fair elections within the legally prescribed \nperiod;\n  (6) recommends international support for voter education, domestic \nand international election monitoring, and violence monitoring \nactivities;\n  (7) urges the United States to continue to monitor violence and \ncondemn brutality against law-abiding citizens;\n  (8) congratulates all the democratic reform activists in Zimbabwe for \ntheir resolve to bring about political change peacefully, even in the \nface of violence and intimidation; and\n  (9) desires a lasting, warm, and mutually beneficial relationship \nbetween the United States and a democratic, peaceful Zimbabwe.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing our strong support \nfor the democratic rights and freedoms of the\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\npeople of Zimbabwe.

Res. 315\n\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 of Sierra Leone's 5,200,000 \n     population are internally displaced and more than 500,000 are \n     refugees as a direct result of the civil war in Sierra Leone, \n     at least 50,000 people have been killed during the civil war, \n     untold numbers of people have been mutilated and disabled \n     largely by the Revolutionary United Front, and more than \n     20,000 individuals, including many children, are missing or \n     have been kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front;\n       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front continues to \n     terrorize the population of Sierra Leone by mutilating their \n     enemies and innocent civilians, including women and children, \n     by chopping off their ears, noses, hands, arms, and legs;\n       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front continues to \n     terrorize the population of Sierra Leone by decapitating \n     innocent victims, including children as young as 10 months \n     old and elderly men and women;\n       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front abducts women and \n     children for use as forced laborers, sex slaves, and as human \n     shields during skirmishes with government forces and the \n     forces of the Economic Community of West African States;\n       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front has kidnapped boys \n     as young as 6 or 7 years old and used them to kill and steal \n     and to become soldiers, and its forces have routinely raped \n     women and young girls as a terror tactic;\n       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front has abducted \n     civilians, missionaries, humanitarian aid workers, United \n     Nations peacekeepers, and journalists;\n       Whereas Charles Taylor, the President of Liberia, has \n     provided and continues to provide significant support and \n     direction to the Revolutionary United Front in exchange for \n     diamonds and other natural resources and is therefore \n     culpable for the abuses in Sierra Leone;\n       Whereas the Lome Peace Accords did not hold the \n     Revolutionary United Front accountable for their abuses and, \n     in fact, rewarded Foday Sankoh and other Revolutionary United \n     Front leaders with high government offices and control of \n     diamond mining throughout Sierra Leone;\n       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone is \n     not a legitimate political movement, entity, or party;\n       Whereas all sides in the civil war in Sierra Leone are \n     guilty of serious human rights abuses; and\n       Whereas the Revolutionary United Front led by Foday Sankoh \n     is responsible for breaking the Lome Peace Accords and for \n     the violent aftermath that has consumed Sierra Leone since \n     May 1, 2000: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should do all in its power \n     to help ensure that the Revolutionary United Front and its \n     leaders, as well as other groups committing human rights \n     abuses in Sierra Leone, are held accountable for the crimes \n     and abuses committed against the people of Sierra Leone;\n       (2) the United States Government should not condone, \n     support, or be a party to, any agreement that provides \n     amnesty to those responsible for the crimes and abuses in \n     Sierra Leone; and\n       (3) the United States Government should not provide \n     incentives of any kind to regional supporters of the \n     Revolutionary United Front until all support from them to the \n     Revolutionary United Front has ceased.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4491-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 316--HONORING SENIOR JUDGE DANIEL H.

Res. 316\n\n       Whereas Daniel H. Thomas devoted his life to the dedicated \n     and principled service of his country, his State, and his \n     community;\n       Whereas Daniel H. Thomas, a native of Prattville, Alabama, \n     was born August 25, 1906, to Judge C.E. Thomas and Augusta \n     Pratt.\n       Whereas Daniel H. Thomas obtained his law degree from the \n     University of Alabama in 1928, where his uncle, Daniel H. \n     Pratt, served as President pro tem of the Board of Trustees \n     of the University;\n       Whereas Daniel H. Thomas, having served his country with \n     distinction for 3 years as a Navy Lieutenant during World War \n     II, returned to Mobile, Alabama and continued in the practice \n     of law with Mr. Joseph C. Lyons and Sam Pipes in the law firm \n     of Lyons, Thomas and Pipes until he was elevated to the \n     Federal bench;\n       Whereas Daniel H. Thomas was appointed a United States \n     District Judge for the Southern District of Alabama by \n     President Truman in 1951, joining in distinguished judicial \n     service his father, C.E. Thomas, who was a probate judge of \n     Augusta County, Alabama, his uncle, William Thomas, who \n     served the State of Alabama as a Supreme Court Justice, and \n     his uncle, J. Render Thomas, who served many years as the \n     Clerk of the Supreme Court of Alabama;\n       Whereas 49 years of judicial service made Judge Thomas one \n     of the longest serving Federal judges in American history;\n       Whereas the years of distinguished judicial service by \n     Judge Thomas were characterized by unflinching integrity and \n     unquestioned legal ability;\n       Whereas in a time of great political and social turmoil, \n     Judge Thomas inspired continued respect for the rule of law \n     established under the Constitution of the United States, and \n     for the propositions that ``all men are created equal'' and \n     deserve ``equal protection of the laws'' by faithfully \n     adhering to the precedents of the United States Supreme \n     Court, even when such actions were not popular;\n       Whereas the depth of legal scholarship exhibited by Judge \n     Thomas led him to become one of the most respected experts in \n     the nation in the important field of Admiralty Law;\n       Whereas the reach of service by Judge Thomas to his country \n     extended beyond his courtroom to his community through his \n     active leadership as a founding trustee of the Ashland Place \n     Methodist Church in Mobile, Alabama, and to America's youth \n     through his efforts in support of the Boy Scouts of America;\n       Whereas Judge Thomas, a man who enjoyed the outdoors, being \n     an accomplished fisherman and quail hunter, exhibited great \n     common sense, had a vibrant sense of humor, and was extremely \n     friendly and thoughtful of others, thereby truly fitting the \n     description of a true ``southern gentleman'';\n       Whereas Judge Thomas truly was a great judge whose life was \n     the law, and who was loved and respected by members of the \n     bar and community to a degree seldom reached and never \n     surpassed;\n       Whereas Judge Thomas passed away at his home in Mobile, \n     Alabama, on Thursday, April 13, 2000;\n       Whereas the members of the Senate extend our deepest \n     sympathies to the wife of Judge Thomas, Catherine Miller \n     Thomas, his 2 sons, Daniel H.

SUPPORT BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FOR SERBIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) General Dragolub Ojdanic, Minister of Defense of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and an \n     indicted war criminal, visited Moscow from May 7 through May \n     12, 2000, as a guest of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation, attended the inauguration of President Vladimir \n     Putin, and held talks with Russian Defense Minister Igor \n     Sergeyev and Army Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin;\n       (2) General Ojdanic was military Chief of Staff of the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war and has \n     been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes against humanity and \n     violations of the laws\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\n     and customs of war for alleged atrocities against Albanians \n     in Kosovo;\n       (3) international warrants have been issued by the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for \n     General Ojdanic's arrest and extradition to the Hague;\n       (4) the Government of the Russian Federation, a permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council which \n     established the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia, has an obligation to arrest General \n     Ojdanic and extradite him to the Hague;\n       (5) on May 16, 2000, Russian Minister of Economics Andrei \n     Shapovalyants announced that his government has provided the \n     Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic $102,000,000 of a \n     $150,000,000 loan it had reactivated and will sell the \n     Government of Serbia $32,000,000 of oil despite the fact that \n     the international community has imposed economic sanctions \n     against the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     and the Government of Serbia;\n       (6) the Government of the Russian Federation is providing \n     the Milosevic regime such assistance while it is seeking debt \n     relief from the international community and loans from the \n     International Monetary Fund, and while it is receiving corn \n     and grain as food aid from the United States;\n       (7) the hospitality provided to General Ojdanic \n     demonstrates that the Government of the Russian Federation \n     rejects the indictments brought by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia against him and other \n     officials, including Slobodan Milosevic, for alleged \n     atrocities committed during the Kosovo war; and\n       (8) the relationship between the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Governments of the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia and Serbia only encourages the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic to foment instability in the Balkans and thereby \n     jeopardizes the safety and security of American military and \n     civilian personnel and raises questions about Russia's \n     commitment to its responsibilities as a member of the North \n     American Treaty Organization-led peacekeeping mission in \n     Kosovo.\n       (b) Actions.--\n       (1) Fifteen days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the President shall submit a report to Congress detailing all \n     loans, financial assistance, and energy sales the Government \n     of the Russian Federation or entities acting on its behalf \n     has provided since June 1999, and intends to provide to the \n     Government of Serbia or the government of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or any entities under the control of \n     the Governments of Serbia or the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia.\n       (2) If that report determines that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation or other entities acting on its behalf has \n     provided or intends to provide the governments of Serbia or \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or any entity under their \n     control any loans or economic assistance and oil sales, then \n     the following shall apply:\n       (A) The Secretary of State shall reduce assistance \n     obligated to the Russian Federation by an amount equal in \n     value to the loans, financial assistance, and energy sales \n     the Government of the Russian Federation has provided and \n     intends to provide to the Governments of Serbia and the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (B)(i) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the \n     United States executive directors of the international \n     financial institutions to oppose, and vote against, any \n     extension by those institutions of any financial assistance \n     (including any technical assistance or grant) of any kind to \n     the Government of the Russian Federation except for loans and \n     assistance that serve basic human needs.\n       (ii) In this subparagraph, the term ``international \n     financial institution'' includes the International Monetary \n     Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Development Association, the \n     International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral \n     Investment Guaranty Agency, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development.\n       (C) The United States shall suspend existing programs to \n     the Russia Federation provided by the Export-Import Bank and \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and any \n     consideration of any new loans, guarantees, and other forms \n     of assistance by the Export-Import Bank or Overseas Private \n     Investment Corporation to Russia.\n       (D) The President of the United States should instruct his \n     representatives to negotiations on Russia's international \n     debt to oppose further forgiveness, restructuring, and \n     rescheduling of that debt, including that being considered \n     under the ``Comprehensive'' Paris Club negotiations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4492-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n           subcommittee on forests and public land management\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, as you know, our colleagues in the House \npassed, by a vote of 237-197, legislation to establish permanent \nnormalized trade relations with China. The vote yesterday condensed \nmonths of intense debate over economics, foreign policy, and national \nsecurity concerns with regard to that relationship with China.\n  This is significant legislation, and I look forward to a thorough \nSenate debate on this matter. I will have more to say about this very \nimportant issue during that debate. There are very significant economic \nand trade concerns, but there are also some very significant national \nsecurity issues that must be discussed.\n  Over the last several months, the current administration has invested \nconsiderable time, energy, and resources to achieving House approval of \nwhat is essentially a bilateral agreement with China. While this issue \nis a very important one, I also believe we need to place it in its \nproper context and consider whether our overall trade policies have \nbeen successful.\n  I am concerned that over the last 4 years, the administration's \npursuit of a bilateral trade agreement with China has come at the \nexpense of missed bilateral and even multilateral trade agreements and \neconomic opportunities right here within our own hemisphere.\n  Regardless of what the potential economic benefits that PNTR with \nChina could offer, the bottom line is that stability and economic \nopportunity within our own hemisphere always must be a top priority. To \nthat extent, we, as a nation, stand to lose or gain, depending on the \neconomic health and security of our own neighbors. What that means is \nthat ultimately a strong and free and prosperous hemisphere means a \nstrong and free and prosperous United States.\n  The reality is that in 1997, we had an opportunity to move forward to \ngive the President greater authority to negotiate new trade agreements \nwith countries in our own hemisphere. Sadly, that did not happen. Now \nit will be up to our next President to pursue new markets in this \nhemisphere. If we as a country do not lead, other nations and their \nbusinesses will take our place. No country is waiting for us to act \nfirst.\n  In the end, the longer we wait to pursue more trade opportunities in \nour own hemisphere, the more we stand to lose.\n  Take, for example, my home State of Ohio. The future of Ohio's \neconomy is linked to our ability to send our products abroad. Given the \nchance, Ohio's businessmen and women and Ohio's farmers can and do \ncompete effectively on the world stage. For example, in most years, \none-third to one-half of Ohio's major cash crops--corn, wheat, and \nsoybeans--are found in markets and meals outside our country. In 1998, \nthe city of Cincinnati increased its exports by slightly more than $1 \nbillion. It was the fourth-biggest such increase in the country. \nColumbus, OH, boosted its exports by $92.5 million, ranking 36th in the \ncountry and second in the State in terms of percentage growth. Open \ntrade opportunities have allowed Ohio's and the Nation's economy to \ncontinue thriving.\n  This argument has been used to support granting permanent normal \ntrade relations with China. Much of the public debate has focused on \nthe potential of more than 1 billion Chinese consumers. Yet, we are \nignoring another very sizable market--the market within our own \nhemisphere. Right here in our hemisphere, with a combined gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of more than $10 trillion--a hemisphere \nencompassing 800 million people--trade with our hemispheric neighbors \nrepresents vast opportunities. These are opportunities that we must not \nignore.\n  Right now, Europe, Asia, and Canada are securing their economic \nfortunes throughout Latin America and Central America. Take the example \nof Brazil--the world's eighth largest economy. In 1997, the European \nUnion--the EU--exported to Brazil more than they did to any other \ncountry, and between 1990 and 1998, their exports grew 255 percent. \nAlso, although United States exports to Argentina are double that of \nAsia's, our growth rate is less than half of Asia's incredible 1664 \npercent increase from 1990 to 1998.\n  As my colleagues can see, other nations are riding the tides of \nchange--of free-market economics and openness--and integrating into the \nworld economy. The region's ``Mercosur'' or common market--which \nincludes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and associate member \nChile--is the world's\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\nlargest growing trading bloc, experiencing trade growth of 400 percent \nbetween 1990 and 1998. In 1990, they bought less than $7 billion worth \nof U.S. products. In 1997, their U.S. purchases had grown to $23 \nbillion.\n  The Europeans aren't asleep at the wheel either. As of now, the \nEuropean Union is the largest trading partner with the Mercosur \ncountries. Trade between the EU and the Mercosur countries totaled \n$42.7 billion in 1996 compared to $31 billion for the United States. \nAdditionally, between 1990 and 1998, the EU's market share of all \nMercosur imports increased from 23 percent to 27 percent. It is \nbecoming increasingly obvious that the European Union is not going to \nsit idly by and let the United States gain any market share in our own \nhemisphere, our own region. In fact, the EU recently has intensified \nnegotiations with the Mercosur toward consolidating the two regional \nblocs. Moves like this represent more than just a loss of export \nopportunities for our Nation--they represent a lack of leadership to \naggressively pursue new markets in our own hemisphere.\n  This is the hemisphere we live in. Those should be our markets. To \nlose them through neglect would be a truly shameful outcome for our \ncountry.\n  There is enough of a consciousness in Latin America of the benefits \nof economic liberalization that we will see more and more trade \nbarriers go down--to somebody's benefit. The question that remains is: \nWill we in the United States be in on that market, or not?\n  I am optimistic, though, that our Nation can capture a larger share \nof markets in our hemisphere now that the Senate passed and the \nPresident signed into law the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. \nThis act will bring tremendous benefits to the United States and to the \nCaribbean Basin. It will enhance our economic security, both by opening \nnew markets for American products and by strengthening the economies of \nour closest neighbors. And, it would create new hope for those left \njobless by Hurricanes Mitch and Georges.\n\n  The CBI law will extend duty-free treatment to apparel assembled in \nthe Carribean Basin--or assembled and cut in the region--using U.S. \nfabric made from U.S. yarn. This will help strengthen existing U.S.-CBI \npartnerships in the apparel industry, because the duty-free treatment \nwill help U.S. apparel manufacturers maintain their competitiveness \nwith the Asian market.\n  CBI is a good law. It is a good law that was long, long overdue. In \nthe context of our overall trade policy, it represents a modest step \nforward. To do more toward further expanding market opportunities \nabroad will require strong leadership both in the Congress and from the \nPresident.\n  Despite the success of CBI, plenty of unfinished business remains \nwith regard to our hemispheric trading partners and our hemispheric \ntrading policies, as well as our overall trading strategy. It will be \nincumbent upon our next President and this Congress to deal with this \nunfinished business of our country. I am hopeful that several important \ninitiatives will, in fact, be pursued. That is why I believe the next \nadministration and the next Congress needs to approve fast track \ntrading authority.\n  It is not a stretch to say that America's continued leadership in the \nglobal economy is fundamentally dependent on our ability to secure new \nmarkets abroad. By giving the President greater flexibility to \nnegotiate trade agreements, and by giving the President the ability to \nset the pace and the timing of many of our most important trade \nnegotiations, Congress would be giving the President the authority to \nnegotiate trade deals very quickly, but also the ability to assert and \nprotect the continued international economic supremacy of the United \nStates. And that--that is key to our economic future.\n  Finally, ultimately, our Nation's ability to aggressively promote \nfree and fair trade and enter into trade agreements with countries \nwithin our hemisphere is critical. The more we pursue economic \ninitiatives with our neighbors, the more we, as a nation, stand to gain \nand in ways that go beyond economic growth. In a region that is largely \nDemocratic, a hemispheric commitment to free and fair trade will \nstrengthen Democratic principles and the rule of law. Such pursuits are \ngood for the Caribbean Basin; they are good for Central America; they \nare good for Latin America; and they are good for agriculture and \nbusiness right here at home in the United States. Overall, it just \nmakes good sense.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, after long and difficult deliberation, I \nhave decided to vote for permanent normal trade relations with China. \nThe House of Representatives has now passed the bill and I expect the \nSenate to take it up next month, after the Memorial Day recess.\n  California is the leading state in world trade. Its location on the \nPacific Rim makes our relationship with Asia extremely important.\n  During my congressional career, I have supported some of the trade \nrelations proposals we have considered and opposed others. I believe \nthat each trade proposal should be considered on its own, and I do not \nhave an ideological bent on the issue of trade.\n  The decision on this bill--to grant permanent normal trade relations \nstatus to China--has been one of the hardest I have ever had to make, \nbecause the arguments on both sides have merit. I would like to review \nin this statement the excellent points made by both sides in the \ndebate.\n  First, with respect to human rights, those opposed to PNTR cite \nChina's continuing terrible human rights record. They argue that by not \nhaving annual review of China's trade status, we will lose our \nstrongest leverage to force China to change its behavior. It is also \nargued that by granting China permanent normal trade relations, we are \nrewarding and legitimizing the leaders who have such a bad human rights \nrecord. Finally, the argument that increased contact with China will \nimprove human rights conditions is undermined by the facts. According \nto the 1999 State Department Human Rights Report, the Chinese \ngovernment's human rights record has deteriorated over the past several \nyears, despite increased contacts between China and the United States.\n  But there are human rights advocates who support PNTR for China. They \nbelieve that isolating China will be bad for human rights, because the \nleaders will then be under no outside pressure to change their \nbehavior. They also argue that, over time, people to people contacts \nthrough the media, internet and travel will expose the Chinese people \nto international standards and values and will continue to gradually \nloosen rigid, authoritarian structures. This is why such esteemed human \nrights leaders as the Dalai Lama and Wang Dan, on of the Tiananmen \nSquare leaders, support PNTR for China.\n  The human rights concerns are why inclusion of the Levin amendment in \nthe House bill is so important to me. This regime to monitor human \nrights and worker rights in China will put these issues in sharp focus \nand will significantly increase our knowledge about whether the Chinese \npeople are making progress in these areas. I commend Congressman Levin \nfor his leadership in attaching this important safeguard to the \nlegislation.\n  Second, with respect to the impact of PNTR on American jobs, there \nare arguments on both sides. Opponents say that bringing China into the \nWorld Trade Organization and granting it permanent normal trade status \nwill result in the loss of more than 800,000 jobs in the United States. \nThey believe it will allow multinational corporations to move many \noperations into China, where worker wages and benefits are much lower, \nwages being as low as 13 cents an hour.\n  The principal argument in favor of PNTR is that we must pass it in \norder to get the benefits of the trade agreement negotiated by the \nClinton administration last year, which requires China to lower trade \nbarriers and open up the Chinese market to all kinds of American \nproducts and services, including many from my State of California. \nSupporters estimate that implementation of this agreement will increase \nexports of U.S. goods to China by more than $13 billion per year by \n2005. Supporters also argue that granting PNTR to China will give the \nU.S. the ability to force Chinese compliance with all terms of the \ntrade agreement,\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\nincluding with WTO-authorized sanctions if necessary. If PNTR is not \ngranted, the U.S. could not avail itself of WTO enforcement procedures.\n  So it is clear that there are strong arguments on both sides of the \nhuman rights and workforce/labor issues.\n  But the reason I have decided to vote in favor of permanent normal \ntrade relations status for China is because, first and foremost, I \nbelieve that it is my responsibility as a United States Senator to put \nthe national security of the United States above all other \nconsiderations. And on the national security question, in my opinion, \nthere is only one rational view.\n  I believe that through engagement with China we have the best \nopportunity to avoid a cold war type atmosphere, which hung like a \ncloud over this nation--indeed, the world--for 45 years after World War \nII.\n  A vote against PNTR would suggest that the U.S. views China as an \nadversary and would make it much more difficult to engage China to work \nwith us constructively in key strategic areas. Of particular concern to \nme is China's role in efforts to bring peace and stability to the \nKorean Peninsula. China encouraged North Korea's compliance with the \nU.S.-DPRK (North Korea) framework which halted the North's nuclear \nweapons program, and China will undoubtedly have to be part of any \nsolution that integrates North Korea into the international community.\n  China also plays a key role in the international community's response \nto the continuing conflict between India and Pakistan. China has in \nfact condemned both nations for conducting nuclear tests, and has urged \nthem both to conduct no more tests, to avoid deploying or testing \nmissiles, and to work to resolve their differences over Kashmir through \ndialogue, rather than military action.\n  Finally, China is playing an increasingly active and constructive \nrole in Asian security and stability. U.S. isolation of China would \nseriously undermine our ability to influence China's future \norientation, and would set us on a dangerous path of confrontation.\n  I am under no illusions that granting PNTR to China will make it our \nnew best friend. But failure to do so could well make it an adversary \nof the sort that we lived with for almost half a century until the fall \nof the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. That is \na risk we should not take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is fortuitous that the Senator from \nOhio would make his remarks before mine. I share and agree with most of \nwhat he has said with regard to trade.\n  I rise on a point that could be a troubling cloud that, even if the \nnext President and even if the next Congress were to take the \nsuggestions of the Senator from Ohio, and if certain events that are \nunfolding this very minute were to take a wrong turn, could \ndramatically and negatively affect these trade opportunities.\n  The Andean region--Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Panama, and \nVenezuela--is experiencing difficult times. I rise specifically today \nabout events that are under advisement this minute in Peru.\n  As those who follow events there know, very aggressive behavior by \nPresident Fujimori led to a constitutional override of a two-term \nlimitation on his Presidency, and he is seeking a third term. The \nelections on April 9 were viewed as flawed by the international \ncommunity. Severe questions occurred as to whether or not a fair \nelection had occurred. The OAS, the Carter Center, NDI, and other \ninternational observers have argued that the runoff election which will \noccur this Sunday, unless postponed, is in severe doubt and question. \nThe Organization of American States, along with others, has said that \nthe computer system--which is crucial to the vote count and crucial to \nmonitoring the election--is not in a condition for which a fair \nelection can occur and as a result they would not be able to accredit \nthe election. If an election occurs this Sunday, for which all national \nand international interests have said you cannot appropriately observe \nthe election, you can't tell whether it has been fair or not, if the \ngovernment proceeds with that, it will be a serious blow to the \ndemocratic countries that the Senator from Ohio alluded to and to \nconstitutional law and to the growth of democracy in our hemisphere.\n\n  Very recently, Senator Leahy from Vermont and I authored a joint \nresolution on this matter which reads: Resolved by the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \nassembled that it is the sense of the Congress that the President of \nthe United States should promptly convey to the President of Peru, if \nthe April 9, 2000, elections are deemed by the international community \nnot to have been free and fair, the United States will review and \nmodify as appropriate its political and economic and military relations \nwith Peru and will work with other democracies in the hemisphere and \nelsewhere towards restoration of democracy in Peru. This is passed by \nthe House. This is passed by the Senate. This is signed by the \nPresident of the United States and, therefore, this is the policy of \nthe United States with regard to these elections.\n  The situation has not improved. As I said, we have a computer system \nthat is flawed. We have the opposition candidate who has withdrawn from \nthe election. We have the Organization of American States saying we \nwill withdraw all observers. We are hours away from a very serious \nturnback and reversal in our hemisphere in the country of Peru. \nConstitutional law, the hemisphere of new democracies, will have \nsuffered a blow.\n  Supposedly, in the next 2 or 3 hours, their electoral commission will \nmake a statement as to whether they will listen to the world, listen to \nthe OAS, listen to the United States Congress, the President of the \nUnited States, and delay these elections or not.\n  I rise only for the purpose of saying that it will be an acknowledged \nblemish on so much progress that had been made in this last decade. It \nwill have dire and long-reaching consequences if the Government of Peru \ndoes not hear a world talking to it.\n  I can only pray that in the next hour or two, the government will \nrecognize that it must have an environment under which elections will \nbe fair and observers will have the ability to adjudicate this was a \nfair election or this was not. To my colleagues, I say, there are \nevents unfolding in this hemisphere to which we must pay far more \nattention. As the Senator from Ohio said, the vast majority of our \ntrade now is in this hemisphere. It exceeds Europe and it exceeds the \nPacific. It had better be a healthy place because it means a great deal \nto us and our fellow citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We do not, but we have Senators Jeffords, Stevens, Domenici, and \nothers--and maybe Senator Kennedy is on that amendment--plus a second \nKennedy amendment. What we have been trying to do is agree to another \ngrouping of amendments after that but preferably to go ahead and get \nagreement on a list of very important amendments on both sides of the \naisle that are related to elementary and secondary education and have \nvotes on those amendments and then come to a conclusion.\n  I wanted to see if we could make any progress in that regard and, \nhopefully, we can get agreement on this. If not, we will keep working \nto see if we can find a way to reach an agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nS. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act of 2000, the Stevens amendment \nNo. 3139 remain the pending amendment, and that the education-related \namendments which follow be the only first-degree amendments in order to \nbe offered; that they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; \nthat debate on all amendments, whether first or second degree, be \nlimited to 1 hour equally divided; and following the conclusion of \ndebate on or in relation to the first-degree amendments listed, the \nbill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on final \npassage.\n  I also ask consent that when the Senate receives the House companion \nmeasure, it proceed immediately to its consideration; that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate bill be \ninserted, the bill advanced to third reading and passed; that the \nSenate then insist on its amendments, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate, all without any intervening action or debate, and that S. 2 \nbe indefinitely postponed.\n  The remaining first-degree amendments in order to be offered to S. \n2--and I note again these will be 1 hour each equally divided--are:\n  An amendment by Senator Jeffords relating to high schools; an \namendment by Senator Stevens involving physical education programs; an \namendment by Senator Bingaman regarding accountability; an amendment by \nSenator Santorum which calls for full funding for IDEA; the Kennedy \namendment regarding teacher quality; a Hutchison amendment regarding \nsingle-sex schools; an amendment by Senator Dodd involving 21st century \nschools; an amendment by Senator Gregg involving 21st century schools; \nan amendment by Senators Harkin and Bingaman concerning school \nconstruction grant programs; an amendment by Senator Voinovich \nregarding IDEA funding options; an amendment by Senator Wellstone \nregarding fairness and accuracy in testing; an amendment by Senator \nGrams involving alternative testing; an amendment by Senator Reed \ninvolving parental involvement; an amendment by Senator Kyl which would \ndeal with parental opt-out for bilingual education; an amendment by \nSenator Mikulski involving community technology centers; an amendment \nby Senator Ashcroft involving IDEA discipline--an amendment, I might \nadd, he has been trying to get in the order for several weeks now, and \nwe have not been able to get it agreed to in the order, and I must say \nthat at one point he could have insisted on it but was agreeable to \nsetting it aside with the understanding he would get a shot at it later \non--a relevant amendment by Senator Lott; a relevant amendment by \nSenator Daschle; a relevant managers' amendment by Senator Jeffords; \nand a relevant managers' amendment by Senator Kennedy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me simply respond to the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  As he knows, in past debates on ESEA, there have been an average of \n22 Republican amendments that have been considered, an average. In some \ncases, that number has exceeded 30 amendments. The average number of\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\namendments in total considered during the ESEA debate has been 37 \namendments.\n  I have no objection at all to the amendment suggested by the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  I note with interest that the school safety amendment offered by \nSenator Lautenberg was not on his list.\n  I would ask that the Senate resume consideration of the ESEA bill, \nand following the two amendments previously ordered, the Senate \nconsider the following first-degree amendments subject to relevant \nsecond-degree amendments, and they be considered in alternating fashion \nas the sponsors become available: Senator Santorum, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Dodd, Senator Gregg, Senator Harkin, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Mikulski, Senator Stevens, Senator Wellstone, \nSenator Grams, Senator Reed, Senator Kyl, and Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, are all those \namendments on this list that I read, plus Senator Lautenberg? Is there \nan additional Wellstone amendment in that list?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I guess I would have to consult with the majority leader \nin greater detail to know whether each of these amendments is exactly \nreferenced in his unanimous consent list. As I understand it, this is \nthe list that our two sides have been building upon in reaching some \nagreement on proceeding to the next block of amendments. Obviously, \nthere are other amendments we would want to consider. But this is a \nblock of amendments for which there would be no opposition to \naddressing as the next block on this side.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, would \nthat list include the other language I had in my unanimous consent \nrequest that would take us to a conclusion? I believe I understood the \nminority leader was saying that it would not. Is that accurate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader is correct. We will be in a \nposition--and could be in a position in the not too distant future--to \nagree ultimately to a finite list of amendments. I was not aware that \nthe distinguished leader would be interested in pursuing this this \nafternoon. This is the first I heard of it. But we would be prepared at \nsome point certainly during the time these amendments are being \nconsidered to offer perhaps a final list that would bring us to closure \non the bill. I would be happy to work with the majority leader over the \nrecess in an effort to finalize that list, and proceed with that goal \nin mind.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would object to the request at this time. \nBut I am encouraged that we could get together and work to try to find \na way to develop a list that would complete this very important \neducation bill and bring it to final passage.\n  I think we should pursue this to see if we can develop the list. I \ndon't know how long it would be.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will in just a moment.\n  It sounded as if we had around 20 amendments, and it sounded as if \nthe minority leader added three or four that were not on our list. We \nare talking about as many as 24 amendments. We have taken up six. That \nwould put us at 30. I don't think that is necessarily an excessive list \non something that is this important.\n  But the point is, if we could at least pursue some finite list that \nwould get us to a conclusion, I would certainly like to do that.\n  I would be glad to yield to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could ask the majority leader, since \nprobably the first priority of American families--even beyond having \nsmall class sizes, well-trained teachers, modern schools and computers, \ndigital divide, afterschool programs, and safety and security in the \nschools--is the reduced opportunity for children to be able to have \naccess to guns prior to going to school, it is not going to make much \ndifference if we have small class sizes and guns are in the school.\n  I am asking the majority leader if he is unwilling to permit a vote \non the Senate floor of the Lautenberg amendment, which is really \ndirected towards safety and security in the schools, as part of the \nmeasure. I think this is enormously important because we want to see \nthe conclusion of the debate on ESEA. But I think it is important for \nMembers to know whether we are going to be denied an opportunity to \ndeal with what is the most important concern of parents; that is, \nsafety and security in schools.\n  I am wondering what the position of the majority leader is on that \nissue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond, this is about elementary \nand secondary education. Obviously, there is a lot we need to do to be \nof assistance to administrators, teachers, parents, and children at the \nelementary and secondary education level. Certainly, the local and \nState officials need to do more. We need to improve the quality of our \nschools, they need to be child centered, and they need to be safe and \ndrug free. But I think it is about elementary and secondary education, \nand amendments should be germane to this area.\n  I think it is a far stretch to say that a Lautenberg amendment which \nhas to do with gun shows relates to elementary and secondary education. \nI think we should be sensitive to that area. We should do what we can \nto provide safety for children, and to make sure children don't get \nguns, have access to them, or make use of them.\n\n  But I also think one of the things we can do that I supported, and \nwhich is in the juvenile justice bill that we passed earlier, and was \nin the making for 3 years--that included assistance for schools and \ndealing with these safety problems--for instance, funds would be \navailable for metal detectors. A lot of schools are now doing that. \nThey have a greater need for assistance. That is why I wanted to get \nthe juvenile justice bill through. While I still plan to urge the \njuvenile justice conference report be completed, and it be brought back \nto the Senate, that is the place where this issue or these issues \nshould be dealt with.\n  The direct answer to the Senator's question is it is not germane, and \nI think it would be a major problem with elementary and secondary \neducation legislation. Certainly, I would object to it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could briefly follow up, in 1994, the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, offered an amendment cosponsored by the Republican \nleader. There was no objection from that side of the aisle to that \nmeasure at that particular time. I don't know how the Senator voted at \nthat time, or whether he indicated it was appropriate to bring it up at \nthat time. But it was noted as the gun amendment. The Senate has \naddressed the gun issues. It was brought up by the Senator from Texas \nand was cosponsored by the majority leader at that time. I believe the \nSenator from Mississippi voted for it at that time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, without knowing exactly which Gramm \namendment the Senator is speaking of, the way he described it, I \nprobably voted for it and was supportive of it. But one of the problems \nI have, as suggested earlier, is that I understand, for instance, it \nleaves out the Ashcroft amendment. He has been very cooperative, to use \nthat famous word, in not insisting that he be included in the earlier \ngroupings. He at one point actually could have, within his rights, \nactually forced us to vote on it, and he didn't do it.\n  I would want to talk to both sides about including the Ashcroft \namendment. It doesn't include the two managers' amendments, or the two \nleaders' amendments, which I think surely we would be willing to do. \nAnd it doesn't bring the bill to third reading. I think we need to talk \nabout those issues, and I hope we can do that.\n  Mr. President, if I could proceed, I had indicated earlier this year \nthat we would go to the Defense authorization bill. I believe it was \nthis week. For a variety of reasons, we weren't able to go to Defense \nauthorization. Of course, the way we usually do these bills is we go to \nthe Defense authorization and complete that, and then go to the Defense \nappropriations bill and complete both of them.\n  Earlier there were objections to taking up the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. I might say now that I understand why it has not \nbeen completed by the House. We thought the House would act on \nAgriculture appropriations this week. They did not do that. We have in\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nthe past quite often gone to appropriations bills in the Senate and \ntook them up to the third reading but without actually completing them \nand waiting for the House to act.\n  Senator Daschle has indicated there are some points within the \nAgriculture bill in the Senate with which they have problems, and they \nwant to have, I guess, an option to remove provisions of the \nAgriculture appropriations bill using rule XVI.\n  It is obviously very important. Even though we took the emergency \nagriculture portion, $7.1 billion, out of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill and put it in the crop insurance bill that just \npassed, it still has some disaster money in it and some emergency \nmoneys, I believe, for North Carolina and other areas. I hope we can \nfind a way to get an agreement to go to that bill or to the DOD \nappropriations bill.\n  There we are. We have been unable to get an agreement to go to DOD \nauthorization. We have not yet been able to work out something on \nAgriculture or Defense. However, hopefully during this recess we can \nlook at the importance of these issues and see if we can get an \nagreement of how to proceed on one or two of these.\n  I think we are close to getting agreement on the e-commerce digital \nsignature bill and also very close on bankruptcy, and therefore perhaps \nthose two could be combined along with the satellite loan bill. That \nmay be available early in the week we come back. I hope it will be \nbecause I think there are only two or three points outstanding on the \nthree of them.\n  For now, I ask consent that the Senate turn to the DOD authorization \nbill, S. 2549, and only DOD-related amendments be in order during the \npendency of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object. I simply again indicate my \nreason for objecting is not because I don't want to go to DOD \nauthorization. I would love very much to work with our majority leader \nin attempting to proceed to that bill. I have no problem with calling \nit up and permitting the full Senate to work its will.\n  Again, he has proposed that it be done with only relevant amendments. \nI remind the majority leader, Senator Hutchinson offered a forced \nabortions in China amendment to DOD authorization just 2 years ago, and \nthere have been many Republican nonrelevant amendments offered.\n  I assume I am protecting the rights of Members on both sides of the \naisle in insisting we have the opportunity to offer amendments, and I \nwill work with the majority leader to see that we can take up this bill \nand work through his concern about amendments.\n  Until we can work that out, I object to moving to it.\n  Mr. LOTT. We had talked, Mr. President, about seeing if we could come \nto an agreement on how to proceed to the Defense appropriations bill, \nrealizing that the authorizers want to get their bill done because, \namong other things, it does authorize and make some changes in law. It \nis not just about spending. It does have some very important language \nin it with regard to health benefits for our military personnel and \ntheir families and retirees. So there is a need to get the \nauthorization bill done, and we need to find a way to get it done.\n  Another way to proceed would be to take up the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. I know Senator Stevens talked to Senator Byrd and \nSenator Daschle about going ahead to that, even though the House has \nnot acted, on the assumption that the House will act on that the week \nwe return and we would probably be able to take up that House bill or \nit would be here before we complete it. However, it is hard to say now \nif that will be accomplished or not. We don't know that the House will \nhave it done by Tuesday of next week or Wednesday of the week we come \nback.\n\n  I ask consent that we go to the Defense appropriations bill which was \nreported out of the Appropriations Committee on May 18 by unanimous \nvote of all the members of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object again for two reasons: First, \nthe bill is not here; and, second, because we have not taken up the \nauthorization bill and our colleagues have indicated that is a very \nimportant matter. We always attempt to deal with the authorization \nrequirements prior to the time we deal with the appropriations \nrequirements. This unanimous consent request does not allow for that.\n  I ask the majority leader what is wrong with taking up the one \nappropriations bill that has been sent here by the House. I note that \non May 22 the Transportation appropriations bill was received from the \nHouse. It is pending in the Senate.\n  I won't ask unanimous consent, but I ask the majority leader whether \nhis intention would be to take up the one House-passed bill that is \nhere. Clearly, we would have no objections to doing that. It is \nimportant we make the most use of our time. Because the House-passed \nappropriations bill having to do with transportation is already here, I \nam curious as to why we have chosen not to take it up until now and why \nwe wouldn't take it up just as soon as we come back.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly agree. I think we should take it \nup as soon as we can. It has come over from the House, but it has not \nbeen reported, I don't believe, from the subcommittee or the full \ncommittee here.\n  I asked the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, why that is \nthe case--and, by the way, immediately urged him to do it as quickly as \nhe can--and I understand it was because Senator Lautenberg of New \nJersey had wanted another hearing at the subcommittee level before they \nmarked it up, and that they were going to need, in the next few days, \nto get it done.\n  Hopefully, they will report that bill out by Wednesday or Thursday of \nthe week we return and we will be able to go to that; either if we got \nit Thursday, we could do it Thursday or Friday, or we could go do it \nthe first thing next week. I am pushing the committee to act on it. I \ndon't know what the outstanding issue is, but I understand they wanted \nto have one more committee hearing for some reason.\n  Let me provide a little incentive to all sides to work together on \nthe Defense appropriations bill. I will not now move to proceed to it, \nbut I will move to proceed to that bill when we reconvene after the \nrecess, and have a vote, if necessary, on proceeding to the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  But over the next 10 days, we have time to work between the \nauthorizers and the appropriators and everybody who has a concern about \nthat bill, and hopefully something can be worked out so we can proceed \non the authorization bill, and then, of course, immediately go to the \nappropriations bill after that.\n  If we cannot get something worked out over the recess period or agree \non some sort of schedule, I will have no alternative at that point but \nto move to proceed to the DOD appropriations bill. I prefer to have \nsomething we have worked out between the authorizers and the \nappropriators and the Democratic leadership and the Republican \nleadership so we can make good use of our time.\n  We do have 4 weeks in the month of June when we come back. We have a \nlot of work we need to do. We need to move at least half a dozen \nappropriations bills during the month of June. We need to take a look \nat the House-passed China trade status bill, see how much time we would \nneed on the floor, and try to get some idea of what amendments might be \noffered.\n  It would not be my intent to try to limit amendments on the China \npermanent trade status bill. I think we should say right from the \nbeginning if we add any new material to it, any new amendments or \nlanguage, it would have to go back to conference with the House and \nthen vote again in the House and Senate. That may be OK, but I want to \ntake a little time when we come back and see if we can work through the \ntime that would be required, when would be the first time to take it \nup, and what amendments might be in the offing from both sides of the \naisle. Our staffs will be working on that during the recess. Plus, we \ncould have other issues.\n  I mentioned the conference report and other bills that are pending, \nso we are going to have to have a full month in June. I also remind my \ncolleagues that in July--I was looking at the calendar last night and \nwas really a little\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\nbit chagrined to realize we only will have 3 weeks between the Fourth \nof July recess and the conventions in August.\n  I had really thought we would have four; if we could do five or six \nappropriations bills in that window. So we really are under pressure, \nwith the 7 weeks we have in the summer, to move 11 appropriations \nbills. That is going to be a monumental task, and it is going to take \nwork with each other on both sides of the aisle. I know that. We cannot \nmove it without everybody giving it a shot. But it makes it awfully \nhard for us to be doing other issues, other than the China trade bill, \nwhich we hope to get worked in there at some point.\n  With that, I think we have talked enough about schedule. I hope we \ncan come to some agreements over the next 10 days as to exactly how we \nwill proceed the first week we are back.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4499-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMEMORATING FREE ELECTIONS IN CROATIA\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, Senators \nFeingold, Hutchison, Abraham, and Lieberman, who will introduce a \nresolution congratulating the people of Croatia on their successful \nparliamentary and presidential elections, the peaceful transition of \npower, and new initiatives for reform. In addition to congratulating \nthe people of Croatia, the resolution expresses U.S. support for their \nprogress and encourages Croatian participation in the NATO Partnership \nfor Peace. One day, I hope that we will be expressing our support for \nCroatia, and other nations with similar democratic inclination, as \nmembers of NATO itself.\n  The Balkan nations embracing democracy must be supported at every \nopportunity available became the government could so easily have taken \nthe other path. The leaders of Croatia could have chosen to repress \npopular involvement and other fundamental rights of democracy, but \ninstead have chosen the harder but correct path of working through \ndiscourse, debate, and democracy. Because we have also been through \nthese trials as a nation, I hope that the American people will watch \nclosely the progress of the Croatian people and will support their path \nto freedom, stability, and peace.\n  The most important benefit to come out of this election will be the \nresolution of Croatia's domestic difficulties. Through the successful \nelection, the Croatian people have taken the reins of control. In \naddition to the power instilled by this self-determination, the \nCroatian people are now spurred to take up the mission of reform that \nshould further improve their government. Among the stated goals of \nPresident Mesic are the reintroduction of Serbian refugees to the homes \nthey left behind, reform of the privatization system that has faced \nserious corruption allegations, and support for the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. These improvements would \ncertainly go far to legitimize the new Administration in the view of \nthe international community, but more importantly, in the eyes of the \nCroatian people. President Mesic's continued efforts on these fronts \nwill show its people that their new government takes seriously the need \nfor honesty and accountability.\n  As the government wins the support of its people, I am also \nencouraged by the efforts of the new Administration to get involved \nwith the European community. In such a volatile region, a nation \nuniting the many groups will be the key to fostering a stable political \nand economic atmosphere. Part of the victory of democracy in Croatia \nhas been the new spirit of regional harmony that I hope will spread to \nits neighbors. Peace in the Balkan nations will only come with honest \nattempts to live with differences, and Croatia will be a leader in the \nefforts for peace there.\n  In addition to better conditions in the Balkans, democracy will \nencourage the involvement of other foreign nations. Just two weeks ago, \nCroatian President Stipe Mesic met with French President Jacques Chirac \nto discuss an agreement on stabilization and association, as well as \nthe Croatian entrance to the NATO Partnership for Peace. The resolution \nI am supporting today suggests U.S. support for the addition of Croatia \nin the partnership, and I am happy to inform my colleagues that the \nnations of NATO have announced that Croatia will become a full member \nof the Partnership for Peace program today. This is truly a great \naccomplishment, and it affirms the commitment of all NATO allies to \nhelp Croatia in its chosen path.\n  In addition to my appreciation for the democratic and international \nprogress of the Croatian people, I would also like to take this \nopportunity to thank the work of the Croatian American Association in \nbringing this subject to my attention and to the attention of the \nAmerican people. The Croatian American community has worked tirelessly \nto create bonds of friendship between our two nations, and I hope that \nas Croatia becomes more democratic and involved in worldwide political \naffairs that we, as Americans, will continue to support them.\n  I hope that this resolution will be an additional bond between two \nnations that democratic tenets have already joined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 315, submitted \nearlier by Senator Helms for himself and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 315) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the crimes and abuses committed against the \n     people of Sierra Leone by the Revolutionary United Front, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Sierra Leone is a failed state and merely \nhoping that a few new Bangladeshi or Indian peacekeepers will turn the \nsituation around is irresponsible. The President should bear this in \nmind as he decides U.S. policy in Sierra Leone--especially the extent \nof U.S. military involvement there or support for a U.N. or regional \npeacekeeping or peacemaking operation.\n  All of us--100 Senators--must remind ourselves that the rebels in \nSierra Leone--the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)--cannot be dealt \nwith as if it were a political party. The Revolutionary United Front \nhas terrorized the population of Sierra Leone by mutilating their \nenemies--and innocent civilians, including women and children--by \nchopping off their ears, noses, hands, arms, and legs.\n  At some point the downtrodden people of Sierra Leone must find a way \nto hold their own leadership responsible. But it's impossible to \noverlook the fact that Liberian President Charles Taylor provides \nsuccor to the sadistic Revolutionary United Front.\n  Taylor (with enthusiastic participation of regional leaders, \nincluding Maummar Qadhafi) provides leadership, weapons and safe haven \nwhile the RUF digs diamonds using slave labor in payment for services \nrendered.\n  It's shameful that President Clinton's hand-picked emissary hugs the \ngodfather of the RUF like a brother and contemplates negotiating with \nhis henchmen. Or had it not been for certain Congressional objections, \nthe U.S. Government would be shoveling foreign aid to Charles Taylor.\n  Mr. President, the Resolution I offer, along with Senators Biden, \nFrist, and Feingold, speaks for itself. The Administration should take \nnote, as it attempts to formulate U.S. policy, that at this stage of \nthe game there is bipartisan ``concern'' (and I use that world in the \nmost understated diplomatic fashion) about the policy of the United \nStates and the sorry performance of the United Nations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the showdown in Sierra Leone between the \nRevolutionary United Front (RUF) and the United Nations peacekeepers \nthey have taken hostage, robbed, killed and humiliated has enormous \nimplications for the future of the United Nations. It is a sort of \nMidway Island for UN peacekeeping: a loss there could doom future \noperations across the continent, and possibly further afield. However, \na frantic effort to salvage the UN operation there by reinstating the \nunjust peace accord may win the battle for peace keeping operations in \nthe short run, but it could be devastating for the UN and for Sierra \nLeone in the long run.\n  The Clinton administration and the United Nations have staked an \nunusual amount of capital on a successful UN mission in Sierra Leone. \nAfter the UN's shocking withdrawal from Rwanda in the days before the \ngenocide began, a success in African peacekeeping became a must for the \nembattled Kofi Annan, who oversaw that withdrawal and later became \nSecretary-General.\n  The Clinton administration's motives for backing a massive UN \npeacekeeping operation agreement is harder to understand beyond a \nhistory of making multilateralization itself a foreign policy goal. \nWith an almost mantra-like regularity, they have touted ``African \nsolutions for African problems.'' Yet two ``African solutions'' to the \nconflict in Sierra Leone were abandoned. In 1995-96, 300 South African \nmercenaries drove rebels from the capital and the major diamond fields, \nbrought them to the negotiating table and set the stage for elections. \nPredictably, under donor pressure, they were forced to leave and the \nwar resumed. Later, Nigeria led a West African intervention force and \nagain restored peace by aggressively pursuing the sadistic but cowardly \nRUF.\n  Both of these ``African solutions'' were dropped because they \nconflicted with the dreamy notion that says a UN mission can end a war \nof unspeakable barbarity without getting its hands dirty. The West \nAfrican regional force cost a fraction of the UN mission and actually \nbrought a modicum of peace to Sierra Leone, yet the administration \nnever even requested from Congress the $25 million needed to continue \ntheir presence. Instead, the Nigerians were given blue helmets and \nimpotent rules of engagement then ``reinforced'' with Kenyan, Indian \nand Zambian troops that have been robbed of their weapons and taken \nhostage. The U.S. portion of the price tag for this disaster soared to \n$118 million for next fiscal year alone.\n  The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone and the \nfrantic effort to salvage it now would be defensible if the Lome accord \nhad ever been a viable peace. The agreement rewarded the rape, \nmutilation, forced conscription of children and killing campaign of the \nRUF with the vice-presidency, cabinet positions and exclusive domain \nover the diamond fields. Literally the only portion of the agreement \nimplemented since it was signed in July of last year is the most \noutrageous and inexplicable: recognition of the RUF as a political \nparty and a part of the government.\n  With the Lome accord the RUF was given the privilege of reaping both \nthe benefits of peace and the benefits of war simultaneously. It was a \ntragic and shameful contradiction that was obvious from the beginning. \nBecause a successful UN peace agreement and peacekeeping operation had \nitself become the goal, rather than stability for Sierra Leone and \ndefeat of the RUF, the contradiction was ignored. It was this self-\ndelusion that was the West's greatest disservice to Sierra Leone, far \nexceeding our refusal to send our own troops.\n  Because the potential failure of the UN in Sierra Leone has made it \nhigh noon for all peacekeeping in Africa, including Congo, we may be in \nthe process of repeating the mistakes of Lome simply to win a short \nterm battle for multilateralism. Making a deal with the devil once is \nunwise, making it twice is unforgivable. Trying to force the reality of \nthe brutality and recidivism of the RUF and the failure of the Lome \naccord to conform to our sense of order and to our desire for ``clean \nhands'' verges on international sociopathy.\n  I am not suggesting that we end the peace mission in Sierra Leone, \nbut we cannot repeat the mistakes of the Lome accord by again rewarding \nthe RUF. To do so would set up a repeat of the current tragedy for \nSierra Leone and indignity for the UN. Whether under the auspice of the \nUN or Nigeria, the rules of engagement in Sierra Leone must be \nrealistic and aggressive. Most of all, we must seek accountability for \nthe horrific war crimes committed there. It will be bloody and hard to \nwatch, but not as horrific as the RUF has proven to be. For the sake of \nthe suffering Sierra Leoneans we are supposed to be helping, \naccountability\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\nfor criminals and justice for their victims cannot again be sacrificed \nto our own intellectual impulses.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 4489, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4489) to amend section 110 of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I support the passage of H.R. 4489, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act \nof 2000, which makes very important revisions to section 110 of the \n1996 Immigration Act. I, along with many of my colleagues, introduced \nan identical Senate companion to this bill, S. 2599, late last week.\n  As originally enacted, section 110 of the 1996 law mandated that an \nautomated system be established to record the entry and exit of all \naliens as a means to provide more information on individuals who \n``overstay'' their visas. In the opinion of many, it became clear that \nthis well-intentioned measure, if implemented, could have an unforeseen \nimpact. Today, when INS or Customs officials inspect people at land \nborders, they examine papers as necessary and make quick \ndeterminations, using their discretion on when to solicit more \ninformation. Section 110, however, was being understood to require \nrevisions to that system that would have greatly complicated travel \nacross the land border by mandating that every single passenger of \nevery single vehicle be required to provide detailed information in a \nform that could be entered into a computer on the spot. According to \nDan Stamper, president of the Detroit International Bridge Company, \neven assuming an incredibly quick 30 seconds per individual, the \ntraffic delays could exceed 20 hours in numerous jurisdictions at the \nnorthern border. This would obviously create extraordinary economic and \nenvironmental harm. Moreover, it would divert scarce law enforcement \nresources away from more effective measures.\n  Out of concern for its harmful impact on Michigan and law \nenforcement, I passed legislation in 1998 to delay implementation of \nsection 110 from its original start date of September 30, 1998, until \nMarch 30, 2001. But it remained clear that a delay could not \nsufficiently satisfy concerns that the INS might develop a system that \nwould prove harmful to the people of Michigan and other states.\n  Fred Upton showed great leadership in the House on this issue and \nserved his constituents extraordinarily well in helping to forge this \ncompromise. Lamar Smith deserves great credit for working closely with \nus and his other House colleagues in making an agreement that meets the \neconomic and security interests of all sides on this issue. And John \nLaFalce also provided important assistance in this effort.\n  This is a great victory for the people of Michigan. This agreement \nstrikes the right balance in enhancing our security and immigration \nenforcement needs while ensuring that we preserve the jobs and the \nother economic benefits Michigan receives from our close relationship \nwith Canada.\n  This product of the agreement with the House replaces the current \nrequirement that by March 30, 2001, a record of arrival and departure \nbe collected for every alien at all ports of entry, with a more \nachievable requirement that the\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service develop an ``integrated entry \nand exit data system'' that focuses on data INS already regularly \ncollects at ports of entry.\n  The goal of section 110 has been to track individuals who overstay \ntheir allowable stay in the United States. That goal is redirected into \na more achievable direction. INS will be directed to put in electronic \nand retrievable form the information already collected at ports of \nentry and pursue other measured step to improve enforcement of U.S. \nimmigration laws. It is also directed to prepare a report on unmatched \nentry and departure data. That report is required to contain not only \nnumbers of unmatched records, but an analysis of those numbers. The \npurpose of the latter requirement is to make sure that sufficient \ncontext for the data is provided to ensure that readers of the report \nare able to understand to what extent unmatched records reflect actual \noverstays, versus to what extent they are simply a function of data \nweakness (such as a lag time between the acquisition of the data and \nthe entry of the data into the system). This will allow those charged \nwith assessing the system to be in a better position to recommend its \nproper use and recommend ways of improving it. To that end, and to the \nend of otherwise improving implementation of the section, a task force \nchaired by the Attorney General that will include representatives of \nother government agencies and the private sector is established to \nexamine the effectiveness of the system, ways of improving it, and the \nneed for and costs of any additional measures, including security \nimprovements. The bill also calls for increased international \ncooperation in securing the land borders.\n  In essence, the agreement substitutes this approach in place of a \nmandate that a system be developed that would have required that all \nforeign travelers or U.S. permanent residents be individually recorded \ninto a system at ports of entry and exit, thereby likely bringing \ntraffic to a halt on the northern border for miles, trapping U.S. \ntravelers in the process and costing potentially tens of thousands of \njobs in manufacturing, tourism and other industries. The agreement also \nmaintains the status quo in preventing new documentary requirements on \nCanadian travelers.\n  The bottom line is that we will have a system that enhances law \nenforcement capabilities and will not impose new or onerous \nrequirements on travelers that would damage Americans or the American \neconomy.\n  I thank the cosponsors of S. 2599, who have been so important in \nachieving success in this long 3-year effort: Senators Leahy, Grams, \nKennedy, Snowe, Collins, Craig, Gorton, Jeffords, Schumer, Graham, \nLevin, DeWine, Murray, Moynihan, and Voinovich. I also thank Majority \nLeader Lott for his strong support on this issue and for recognizing \nthe impact on northern border states if we did not solve this problem. \nSenator Gorton also played an important role in this successful effort. \nI thank Senator Helms and his staff, who permitted an amendment related \nto section 110 to be part of the State Department authorization bill \nlast year, which I think elevated the awareness of this issue and \ncontributed to the solution we see today. Senator Biden and his staff \nwere also supportive of this effort. And, of course, Senator Grams and \nhis leadership were essential for the outcome today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bill accomplishes the important goal \nof eliminating the existing section 110 of the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigration Responsibility Act, IIRIRA. I am an original \ncosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000.\n  Section 110 would mandate that the Immigration and Naturalization \nService (INS) establish an automated system to record the entry and \nexit of all aliens. If implemented, such a provision would have \nterrible consequences for States all across our Northern Border. Its \nrepeal will help protect America's economy and reinforce our excellent \nrelationship with Canada.\n  To implement and maintain an automated system for monitoring the \nentry and exit of ``all aliens,'' INS and Customs agents would have to \nstop each vehicle or individual entering or exiting the United States \nat all ports of entry. Canadians, U.S. permanent residents, and many \nothers who are not currently required to show documentation of their \nstatus would likely either have to carry some form of identification or \nfill out paperwork at the points of entry.\n  This sort of tracking system would be extraordinarily costly to \nimplement along the Northern Border, especially since there is no \ncurrent system or infrastructure to track the departure of citizens and \nothers leaving the United States.\n  Section 110 would also lead to excessive and costly traffic delays \nfor those living and working near the border. These delays would surely \nhave a negative impact on the $2.4 billion in goods and services \nshipped annually from Vermont to Canada and would likely reduce the \n$120 million per year that Canadians spend in Vermont.\n  This legislation would replace the existing section 110 with a new \nprovision that requires the Attorney General to implement an \n``integrated entry and exit data system.'' This system would simply \nintegrate the arrival and departure data which already is authorized or \nrequired to be collected under current law, and which is in electronic \nformat within databases held by the Justice and State Departments. The \nINS would not be required to take new steps to collect information from \nthose entering and leaving the country, meaning that Canadians will \nhave the same ability to enter the United States as they do today.\n  This bill will ensure that tourists continue to freely cross the \nborder, without additional documentation requirements. This bill will \nalso guarantee that more than $1 billion in daily cross-border trade is \nnot hindered in any way. Just as importantly, Vermonters and others who \ncross our nation's land borders on a daily basis to work or visit with \nfamily or friends should be able to continue doing so without \nadditional border delays.\n  The interconnection between Canada and the United States may be \ndemonstrated most clearly by a store in Derby Line, Vermont. Actually, \nonly part of the store is located in Derby Line--the other side of it \nis in Rock Island, Quebec. The U.S.-Canadian border runs down the \nmiddle of the store, and a white stripe is painted there to mark it. \nWould the integrated entry and exit data system called for under \nsection 110 have had to monitor the clerks who move from one side of \nthe store to the other collecting goods? This is just one of many \nexamples that would make the implementation of section 110 a \ndestructive folly for Vermont, and I am sure that Senators from other \nStates along the Northern Border can tell similar stories about their \nStates.\n  This is an issue that I have worked on ever since section 110 was \noriginally adopted in 1996. In 1997, along with Senator Abraham and \nothers, I introduced the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of \n1997. Among other things, that legislation would have (1) specifically \nexempted Canadians from any new documentation or paperwork requirements \nwhen crossing the border into the United States; (2) required the \nAttorney General to discuss the development of ``reciprocal \nagreements'' with the Secretary of State and the governments of \ncontiguous countries to collect the data on visa overstayers; and (3) \nrequired the Attorney General to increase the number of INS inspectors \nby 300 per year and the number of Customs inspectors by 150 per year \nfor the next three years, with at least half of those inspectors being \nassigned to the Northern Border.\n  I also worked with Senator Kennedy, Senator Abraham, and other \nSenators to obtain postponements in the implementation date for the \nautomated system mandated by section 110. We were successful in those \nattempts, delaying implementation until March 30, 2001. But delays are \nby nature only a temporary solution; in the legislation we vote on \ntoday, I believe we have found a permanent solution that allows us to \nkeep track of the flow of foreign nationals entering and leaving the \nUnited States without crippling commerce or our important relationship \nwith Canada. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation, and why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it today.\n  The Immigration mistakes of 1996: I fought against the adoption of \nsection\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n110 in 1996, when this Congress passed the IIRIRA. It was wrong at the \ntime, it is wrong today, and I am relieved that we are prepared to do \naway with it. But our job of rectifying the wrongs of our 1996 \nimmigration legislation is far from over; indeed, it has hardly begun. \nI would like to use this occasion to draw my colleagues' attention to \nwhat I believe our next priorities should be in the immigration area.\n  Expedited removal: First, in the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act (AEDPA), a bill ostensibly about terrorism, Congress \ninstituted an immigration measure called expedited removal. Under \nexpedited removal, low-level INS officers with cursory supervision have \nthe authority to summarily remove people who arrive at our border \nwithout proper documentation, or with facially valid documentation that \nthe officer simply suspects is invalid. No review--administrative or \njudicial--is available of the INS officer's decision, which is rendered \nafter a so-called secondary inspection interview. Expedited removal was \nwidely critized at the time as ignoring the realities of political \npersecution, since people being tortured by their government are quite \nlikely to have difficulties obtaining valid travel documents from that \ngovernment. Its adoption was viewed by many--including a majority of \nthis body--as an abandonment of our historical commitment to refugees \nand a misplaced reaction to our legitimate fears of terrorism.\n\n  When we debated the IIRIRA later the same year, I offered an \namendment with Senator DeWine to restrict the use of expedited removal \nto times of immigration emergencies, which would be certified by the \nAttorney General. This more limited authority was all that the \nAdministration had requested in the first place, and it was far more in \nline with our international and historical commitments. This amendment \npassed the Senate with bipartisan support, but it was removed in one of \nthe most partisan conference committees I have ever witnessed. As a \nresult, the extreme version of expedited removal contained in AEDPA \nbecame law, and was implemented in 1997. Ever since, I have attempted \nto raise consciousness about the problems with expedited removal.\n  Last year, I introduced the Refugee Protection Act (S. 1940) with \nSenator Brownback and five other Senators of both parties. The bill is \nmodeled closely on the 1996 amendment that passed the Senate, and I was \noptimistic that it too would be supported by a broad coalition of \nSenators. It allows expedited removal only in times of immigration \nemergencies, and it provides due process rights and elemental fairness \nfor those arriving at our borders without sacrificing security \nconcerns. But even as the Refugee Protection Act has gained additional \ncosponsors, it has been ignored by the Senate leadership. Indeed, the \nbill has not even received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, \ndespite my request.\n  Meanwhile, in the little more than three years that expedited removal \nhas been in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum \nseekers who were forced to leave our country without the opportunity to \nconvince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their \nnative lands. To provide just one example, ``Dem,'' a Kosovar Albanian, \nwas summarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had \nalready made the front pages of America's newspapers. During his \ninterview with the INS inspector who had unreviewable discretion over \nhis fate, he was provided with a Serbian translator who did not speak \nAlbanian, rendering the interview a farce. Instead of being embraced as \na political refugee, he was put on the next plane back to where his \nflight had originated. We only know about his story at all because he \nwas dogged enough to make it back to the United States. On this second \ntrip, he was found to have a credible fear of persecution and he is \ncurrently in the midst of the asylum process.\n  Perhaps the most distressing part of expedited removal is that there \nis no way for us to know how many deserving refugees have been \nexcluded. Because secondary inspection interviews are conducted in \nsecret, we typically only learn about mistakes when refugees manage to \nmake it back to the United States a second time, like Dem, or when they \nare deported to a third country they passed through on their way to the \nUnited States. This uncertainty should lead us to be especially wary of \ncontinuing this failed experiment.\n\n  Unjust deportation: Another injustice in the 1996 legislation that we \nmust address is its drastically expanded definition of what makes a \nlegal resident deportable. First, the IIRIRA defined the term \n``aggravated felony'' in such a way as to make numerous misdemeanors \ndeportable offenses. Then it applied this new standard retroactively, \nso that people who had committed crimes in the past that were so minor \nthey did not even serve jail time were now subject to automatic \ndeportation--including people who pleaded guilty to those crimes \nwithout any reason to believe there would be immigration consequences \nfor that plea. The effects of this change have been unfair to numerous \nmen and women, and their families, who have worked hard for years to \nturn their lives around, and have paid taxes, contributed their labor \nto the American economy, and raised children who are American citizens. \nI applaud the efforts of those in the House who are working to do away \nwith retroactivity altogether.\n  I have chosen to take a narrower approach to this issue, focusing on \nthe effect that this punitive policy has had on decorated war veterans \nwho are being deported without any administrative or judicial \nconsideration of the equities. I have introduced the Fairness to \nImmigrant Veterans Act, S. 871, which would ensure that veterans of our \nArmed Forces who have committed ``aggravated felonies'' have the \nopportunity to go before an immigration judge and plead their case to \nstay in the United States. It would also give veterans the right to \nfederal court review of the immigration judges' decisions, and allow \nthem to be released from detention while their claim is pending. If \nthis bill becomes law, we will still be able to deport people who have \ncommitted serious crimes and present a danger to the community, \nregardless of their service record. But we will give veterans every \nopportunity to show that they and their families deserve a second \nchance, a chance they have earned through the sacrifices they made for \nour country.\n  Veterans groups have been very supportive of this legislation, with \nthe American Legion, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America, and the \nBlinded American Veterans all endorsing the bill. Despite these \nendorsements and my efforts to promote this legislation, however, the \nmajority has failed even to hold a hearing on this bill.\n  Restoring basic benefits: Unfortunately, the IIRIRA and the AEDPA \nwere not the only 1996 laws that distorted our immigration policy and \nharmed immigrants. The welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility \nand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, added to that year's \nanti-immigration chorus, unreasonably restricting the eligibility of \nlegal immigrants for social safety net provisions. It barred many legal \nimmigrants from receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), food \nstamps, and Medicaid coverage, even as Congress sought to ensure that \nMedicaid be preserved for those who were leaving welfare. It has \nprevented the children of legal immigrants from eligibility under the \nnew Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Under this statute, if \nlegal immigrants (or their children) become sick, or lose their job, \nthey are simply out of luck. These punitive restrictions were aimed not \nat illegal immigrants--who already were ineligible for most benefits--\nbut at legal immigrants, people who were invited to come here and work, \npeople who paid taxes and contributed to our society in myriad ways.\n\n  Senators Moynihan and Graham have introduced S. 792, the Fairness for \nLegal Immigrants Act, to rectify this injustice, and I am a proud \ncosponsor of their bill. Among other things, the bill would:\n  Permit States to cover all eligible legal immigrant pregnant women \nand children under Medicaid immediately;\n  Permit states to cover all legal immigrant children under CHIP;\n  Restore SSI eligibility for legal immigrants who arrived here before \nAugust 1996 and who are elderly and poor but not disabled by SSI \nstandards;\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\n  Restore SSI eligibility for legal immigrants who arrived here after \nAugust 1996 and become disabled after entering the country; and\n  Restore food stamp eligibility for all pre-August 1996 legal \nimmigrants.\n  This is a vital bill, but the majority has declined even to hold a \nhearing on it since it was introduced in April 1999. It is difficult to \ntell whether this inaction results from indifference to the plight of \nthese legal immigrants, or from a belief on the majority's part that \nimmigrants come here to take advantage of the social safety net that \nour country offers. If it is the latter, I would recommend to my \ncolleagues to remarks made by former Housing and Urban Development \nSecretary and Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Jack Kemp at a \nrecent press conference designed to highlight the need for Congress to \ntake action on a variety of immigration legislation. Mr. Kemp said that \nimmigrants do not come to the United States because of its welfare \nsystem--they come here because they want to make a better life for \nthemselves through hard work. I would add, and I'm sure that Jack Kemp \nwould agree, that they often come here to experience political freedom \nthey cannot obtain in their own countries.\n  Detention: The IIRIRA made the detention of asylum seekers who arrive \nwithout proper documents mandatory until they establish a credible fear \nof persecution. It allowed the INS no discretion, even where asylum \napplicants had relatives willing to take them in and spare the \ngovernment the cost of detaining them, or even where the asylum \napplicants were children. It took this step even though the INS had \nalready issued regulations that prevented asylum applicants from \nworking while their applications were pending--a step that had \ndrastically reduced the filing of frivolous applications.\n  This detention mandate has created serious strains for the INS and \nhas led to often inhumane conditions for people who are fleeing \npersecution. For example, in October 1998, the Miami Herald reported \nthat the INS--under the pressures created by the 1996 law--\nhad Warehoused some of its detainees to a local jail in the Florida \nPanhandle. The jailers there constructed an ``electric blanket'' that \nit ``placed over detainees, who [were] then subjected to intense \nelectric shocks.'' These asylum seekers were forced to remain under the \nblanket ``for hours, worried about repeated shocks, and when refused \nbathroom privileges, they often soiled themselves. . . . They [also] \nendured broken bones, racial slurs, and attacks with Mace and pepper \nspray.''\n\n  The Refugee Protection Act, which I talked about earlier, also \naddresses the detention issue. It clarifies that the Attorney General \nis not obligated to detain asylum seekers while their claims are being \nprocesed--the bill preserves the Attorney General's ability to do so, \nbut does not encourage detention. Asylum seekers are not criminals and \nthey do not deserve to be imprisoned or detained without cause. \nDetention may be appropriate in rare cases, but it should be used \nsparingly. Detention is also extraordinarily costly for the taxpayers; \nindeed, the Department of Justice has projected that by the year 2001 \nit will need bed space for 24,000 INS detainees. The current policy is \na humanitarian and fiscal failure, and we must reform it.\n  Conclusion: Although I am proud of the legislation we pass today, we \nhave equally necessary and more challenging tasks ahead of us if we \ntruly want to address the damage done by the laws passed in 1996. I \nurge my colleagues to focus on these issues and to work during the time \nwe have remaining in this Congress to create sensible immigration laws. \nLet us not leave it to another Congress to fix the mistakes the \nmajority made 4 years ago.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Robert J. Natter, 0000.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Reed, who is in the Chamber, has \npersonal knowledge of one of these nominees. He wants to make a \nstatement at this time.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the majority leader for his kindness.\n  Mr. President, I am fortunate enough to know both of these gentlemen: \nAdm. Bob Natter, an extraordinary naval officer who has been confirmed \nas a four-star admiral; and, most particularly, I am pleased that my \ncolleagues have confirmed the nomination of Col. Daniel Kaufman to be a \nbrigadier general in the U.S. Army and dean of the Academic Board at \nWest Point.\n  I have known Dan Kaufman for over 30 years. I was a plebe at West \nPoint in Company C-2 when he was a first classman in the summer 1967. \nHe is an extraordinary individual, a great soldier, a distinguished \nscholar.\n  I also recognize the gentleman whom he is succeeding, Gen. Fletcher \nLamkin, who is the current dean. General Lamkin has done an outstanding \njob at West Point. I thank him for his service.\n  But I am delighted to be able to stand here in the well of the Senate \nto commend Dan Kaufman. He is a soldier first, a soldier of war above \neverything else.\n  After graduating from West Point in 1968, he volunteered for training \nas an Army ranger. He sought an assignment as an armor officer. He was \na platoon leader with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Vietnam.\n  He received a Bronze Star for valor in action and received two Purple \nHearts leading his platoon in Vietnam.\n  He returned to the Army in the United States and pursued his graduate \neducation at the Kennedy School at Harvard, and once again Dan Kaufman \nand I were together. After he received his master's degree at Harvard, \nand subsequent service with the 82nd Airborne Division, he received a \nPh.D. in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology.\n  He combines these two virtues and values: A soldier's soldier and a \nscholar's scholar.\n  He is the ideal choice for the deanship at West Point today, for a \nschool in transformation, for an Army in transformation. As a soldier, \nhe has seen war. He understands that one of the greatest privileges an \nAmerican can ever have is the privilege of leading American soldiers. \nAlso, one of the greatest honors an American can have is to lead those \nsoldiers well. He has won such an honor.\n  He is also someone who is in touch with the greater Army. He is \nsomeone that has been actively involved in numerous issues that deal \nwith the Army, not just academically but very much in its day-to-day \nactivities.\n  He is not an ivory tower scholar. He is an actively engaged soldier. \nHe will instill in the cadets vital skills: the ability to analyze a \nchanging world; and a zest to learn throughout their careers, and to \nhelp the Army and move it forward.\n  He is also a family man. His wife Kathryn, his son David, his \ndaughter Emily--they all serve too, and serve the Army extraordinarily \nwell.\n  The mission at West Point is to train young men and women of \ncharacter for a career of selfless service to the Army and the Nation.\n  Dan Kaufman will expand that mission and move it forward for a \ngeneration of West Point cadets who will enter our Army and will do so \nbetter prepared, as soldiers who are able to lead as thoughtful members \nof our military forces.\n  And something else. Because of his example, because of the choices he \nwill make, their hearts and their lives will march to a very simple but \nprofound cadence: Duty, honor, country.\n  I thank the majority leader and yield back my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/25/senate-section/article/S4505-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
