The Sergeant at Arms will make the proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, it is my understanding that the House \nmanagers intend to extend their presentation until approximately 3 \np.m., with a lunch break at approximately 12:40 or 12:45.\n  I remind all Senators to remain standing at their desk each time the \nChief Justice enters and departs the Chamber. We want to maintain the \nvery best decorum.\n  One other point. We had been scheduled to go from 10:05 straight \nthrough until 12:40, but we will probably take a very short 10-minute \nbreak after the presentation by Manager Graham. It will be very \nimportant that Members tend to business and return promptly to the \nChamber so that we can complete activity as early as possible this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, the managers for \nthe House of Representatives have 15 hours 37 minutes remaining to make \nthe presentation of their case. The Senate will now hear you. The \nPresiding Officer recognizes Mr. Manager Buyer.\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I thank the \nSenators, the counsel for the President.\n  I am Steve Buyer, the House manager from the Fifth District of \nIndiana. I thank all of you for your attention the past several days. \nIt has not been easy for the House managers to argue from a dry record. \nI ask for your patience. The House managers are prepared to call \nwitnesses and offer to develop the evidence as the trial proceeds.\n  This morning, the managers on the part of the House are going to \npresent why the offenses you have been hearing over the course of the \nlast several days require the President's removal from office. I will \ndiscuss why the offenses attack the judicial system which is a core \nfunction of the Government, and how perjury and obstruction of justice \nare not private acts. These are public crimes and therefore \nquintessential impeachable offenses, for the President's premeditated \nassault on the administration of justice must be interpreted as a \nthreat to our system of Government.\n  I will be followed by Mr. Manager Graham of South Carolina who will \ndiscuss the precedents in impeachment cases, and then he will be \nfollowed by Mr. Manager Canady. He will discuss how the felonies \nconstitute high crimes and misdemeanors as envisioned by the Founding \nFathers and why they warrant his removal from office.\n  While this is day 3 of our presentation, it is important for the \nSenate to be fully informed as to the facts, the law and the \nconsequences. Please indulge me for a quick reiteration of the facts.\n  On May 27, 1997, nine Justices of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates unanimously ruled that Ms. Jones could pursue her Federal civil \nrights actions against William Jefferson Clinton. On December 11, 1997, \nU.S. District\n\n[[Page S282]]\n\nCourt Judge Susan Webber Wright ordered President Clinton to provide \nMs. Jones with answers to certain routine questions relevant to the \nlawsuit.\n  Acting under the authority of these court orders, Ms. Jones exercised \nher rights, rights every litigant has under our system of justice. She \nsought answers from President Clinton to help prove her case against \nhim, just as President Clinton sought and received answers from her. \nPresident Clinton used numerous means, then, to prevent her from \ngetting fruitful answers.\n  On December 17, 1997, President Clinton encouraged a witness to file \na false affidavit in the case and to testify falsely if she were called \nto testify in this case. Why? Because her truthful testimony would have \nhelped Ms. Jones and hurt his case.\n  On December 23, 1997, he provided under oath false written answers to \nMs. Jones' questions. On December 18, 1997, President Clinton began an \neffort to get the witnesses to conceal evidence that would have helped \nMs. Jones. Throughout this period, he intensified efforts to provide \nthe witness with help in getting a job to ensure that she carried out \nhis designs.\n  On January 17, 1998, President Clinton provided under oath numerous \nfalse answers to Ms. Jones' questions during that deposition in the \ncivil case. In the days immediately following the deposition, President \nClinton provided a false and misleading account to another witness, his \nsecretary, Betty Currie, in hopes that she would substantiate the false \ntestimony he gave in the deposition.\n  All of these unlawful actions denied Ms. Jones her rights as a \nlitigant, subverted the fundamental truth-seeking function of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and violated \nPresident Clinton's constitutional oath to ``preserve, protect, and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.'' And, further, it \nviolated his constitutional duty to ``take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.''\n  Beginning shortly after his deposition, President Clinton became \naware that the Federal grand jury impaneled by the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia was investigating his unlawful actions \nbefore and during his civil deposition was the scope of inquiry. \nPresident Clinton made numerous false statements to potential grand \njury witnesses in hopes that they would repeat these statements to the \ngrand jury.\n  On August 17, 1998, President Clinton appeared before the grand jury \nby video under oath and he provided numerous false answers to questions \nasked. These actions impeded the grand jury's investigation, it \nsubverted the fundamental truth-seeking function of the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia, and they also violated President \nClinton's constitutional oath to ``preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States'' and his constitutional duty as the \nChief Executive Officer to ``take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted.''\n  Now, you will hear next week, perhaps from the President's lawyers, \nthat the offenses charged by the House are not impeachable; in other \nwords, that even if the allegations as set forth in the articles of \nimpeachment are true, so what? See, the House managers have begun to \nrefer to this as the ``so what\" defense. I am not offended by the ``so \nwhat'' defense, because if that is all you have, then try it. You see, \nthere are only a few basic ways that you can actually defend a case. \nYou can defend a case on the facts, you can defend a case on the law, \nyou can defend a case on the facts and the law.\n  Now, here we hear in this case--we hear very often--that the facts \nare indefensible. And you also hear that if you are not going to call \nwitnesses on the facts, then I guess you better argue on the law. So, \nthen, what is the argument on the law? What you do, then, in the \ndefending of a case, is you argue procedure, you attack the prosecutor, \nyou attempt to confuse those who sit in judgment on the laws so you \ndon't follow your precedent. You go out and obtain, from your political \nallies and friends in the academic world, signatures on a letter saying \nthat the offenses as alleged in the articles of impeachment do not rise \nto the level of an impeachable offense. You see, this ``rise to the \nlevel'' has somehow become the legal cliche of this case. You have all \nso often heard it and you have even--some have even spoken it.\n  You see, the House managers chose not to go out into the academic \nworld and obtain signatures on our own letter that would have said why \nthe offenses are impeachable. And then we would have had this war of \ndueling academics. They have a letter of 400 signatures. We get a \nletter of 400 signatures. They add 500 to it; now they have 900. We go \nout and get 1,000. We chose not to do that. Do you know why? Because \nthe House managers have the precedents of the Senate on our side. We \nhave the precedents of the Senate. Mr. Manager Graham will discuss \nthose precedents.\n  Now, if I am prosecuting a defendant of perjury and obstruction of \njustice in White County Superior Court before Judge Bob Mrzlack in \nMonticello, IN, and I have this perjury and obstruction of justice case \non a Thursday, and I know that the judge has three other cases--he has \ngot a case on Monday, he has got a case on Tuesday, and he has got a \ncase on Wednesday --so I am watching what the judge is going to do \nbecause I am curious with regard to the precedent.\n\n  So, on Monday of that week Judge Mrzlack tries a case of a public \nofficial for perjury and I watch what he does. He convicts him for \nperjury. On Tuesday he tries a public official for obstruction of \njustice and he convicts him. On Wednesday, Judge Mrzlack tries a public \nofficial for grand jury perjury and he convicts him. My case now comes \nup on Thursday, for a public official for obstruction of justice and \ngrand jury perjury and perjury on top of perjury. I would say that, \nbased on the precedents, it is not looking good for the defendant that \nI am about to prosecute.\n  The White House lawyers are hoping that those of you who have voted--\nthose of you in this Chamber who have voted to remove Federal judges \nfor similar offenses in the past--that you have a feigned memory. And \nif you don't have a feigned memory, then we will try to confuse you--\nthey will attempt to confuse you on the law.\n  So, when I hear the ``so what,'' well, it is the position of the \nHouse that what the President did does matter; that by his actions, the \nPresident did commit high crimes and misdemeanors. The House is \nprepared to establish that the President, William Jefferson Clinton, \nwillfully and repeatedly violated the rule of law and abused the trust \nplaced upon him by the American people.\n  Now, let me address how the offenses charged in the articles of \nimpeachment attack the judicial system. The offenses as charged in the \narticles of impeachment against our system of government are the core \nof the concept of high crimes and misdemeanors. You see, perjury and \nobstruction of justice are, therefore, quintessential impeachable \noffenses. Indeed, it is precisely their public nature that makes them \noffenses. Acts that are not crimes when committed outside the judicial \nrealm become crimes when they enter the judicial realm. Lying to one's \nspouse about an extramarital affair is not a crime; it is a private \nmatter. But telling that same lie under oath before a Federal judge, as \na defendant in a civil rights sexual harassment lawsuit, is a crime \nagainst the state and is therefore a public matter.\n  Hiding gifts given to conceal the affair is not a crime; it is a \nprivate matter. But when those gifts are the subject of a court-ordered \nsubpoena in a sexual harassment lawsuit, the act of hiding the gifts \nbecomes a crime against the state called obstruction of justice and is, \ntherefore, a public matter. Our law has consistently recognized that \nperjury subverts the judicial process. It strikes at our Nation's most \nfundamental value, the rule of law.\n  In ``Commentaries on the Laws of England,'' Sir William Blackstone \ndifferentiated between crimes that ``more directly infringe the rights \nof a public or commonwealth taken in its collective capacity, and those \nwhich, in a more peculiar manner, injure individuals or private \nsubjects.'' This book was widely recognized by the Founding Fathers, \nsuch as James Madison. He described Blackstone's work at the time as \n``a book which is in every man's hand.'' Blackstone's private category \ncontained crimes such as murder, burglary, and arson. In the public \ncategory, however, he cataloged crimes that could be understood as an \nassault\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\nupon the state. Within a subcategory denominated ``offenses against \npublic justice,'' Blackstone included the crimes of perjury and \nbribery. In fact, in his catalog of public justice offenses, Blackstone \nplaced perjury and bribery side by side.\n  Now, in the Constitution, article II, section 4, when you read the \nimpeachment clause, ``The President, Vice President and all Civil \nOfficers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on \nImpeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors''--so, what did they mean when they thought \n``other high crimes''? I would submit to you that perjury, obstruction \nof justice, fit in this category of ``other high crimes.'' Perjury and \nbribery are side by side.\n  You know, hypothetically--hypothetically, if, when William Jefferson \nClinton sat at the table in the civil deposition in the Jones v. \nClinton case, and as alleged in the record that he perjured himself, \nspeaking hypothetically, if he had then offered Judge Susan Webber \nWright a cash bribe, there would be no question in this body what we \nmust--what you must do. But what I am saying unto all of you is that \nthere is no difference here, and that is the pain of this case. There \nis no difference between a cash bribe or sitting before a Federal judge \nand perjuring one's self. Whether it be in the underlying civil \ndeposition or, in fact, in the grand jury perjury. Perjury and bribery \nare side by side. Mr. Manager Canady will develop that further.\n\n  The Constitution also recognizes that truth-telling under oath is \ncentral to the maintenance of our Republic.\n  We are all familiar with the Constitution. This is in its handwritten \nglory. The founders took such pride in the oath that it is mentioned in \nthe Constitution on five separate occasions, not the least of which is \nthe President's own oath to defend the Constitution. Article I, section \n3, sets forth the requirement that the Senate be under oath when trying \ncases of impeachment, and I witnessed as that occurred. Article II, \nsection 1, specifically prescribes the oath which must be taken before \nour President enter on the execution of his office.\n  The right against self-incrimination under the Constitution derives \nin some measure from the Republic's interest in preserving the truth-\ntelling oath. You see, forced testimony is forbidden because it might \nlead many to violate their most solemn obligations and, over time, \nweaken the essential civic norm of the fidelity to that oath--fidelity.\n  The framers took significance of the oath very, very seriously. The \ncrime of perjury was among the few offenses that the first Congress \noutlawed by statute as they met, and that affirms the framers' view of \nthe seriousness. In 1790, in a statute entitled ``An Act for the \nPunishment of Certain Crimes Against the United States,'' Congress made \nthe crime of perjury punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years, a \nfine of up to $800, disqualification from giving future testimony and \n``stand[ing] in the pillory for one hour.'' Now, today, we don't force \nindividuals convicted of perjury to stand in the pillory for up to 1 \nhour.\n  Today, perjury is punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment in a \nFederal penitentiary if you perjure yourself in a Federal jurisdiction. \nLikewise, the Supreme Court has repeatedly noted the extent to which \nperjury subverts the judicial process and, thus, the rule of law. For \nexample, in 1976, in a case of United States v. Mandujano, the Supreme \nCourt emphasized:\n\n       Perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to \n     the basic concepts of judicial proceedings. Effective \n     restraints against this type of egregious offense are, \n     therefore, imperative. Hence, Congress has made the giving of \n     false answers a criminal act punishable by severe penalties. \n     In no other way can criminal conduct be flushed into the open \n     where law can deal with it.\n\n  Moreover, it is obvious that any testimony given to a grand jury must \nbe truthful, for the grand jury process is, in fact, the truth-seeking \nprocess of our criminal justice system. As the Supreme Court stated in \n1911 in the case of Glickstein v. the United States:\n\n       It cannot be conceived that there is power to compel the \n     giving of testimony where no right exists to require that the \n     testimony shall be given under such circumstances and \n     safeguards as to compel it to be truthful.\n\n  Indeed, giving false material testimony to a grand jury, perjuring \none's self, totally destroys the value of one's testimony and \ninterferes with the ability of a grand jury to accomplish its mission \nwhich, again, is to find the truth. Perjury before a grand jury is a \ncrime against our system of Government and the American people, and in \nthe case before us, this is a case of perjury upon perjury.\n\n  Before the grand jury, President Clinton testified that the testimony \nthat he gave in the underlying civil case of Jones versus Clinton in a \ncivil deposition, that it was truthful. We submit that that is a lie. \nSo what we have is perjury on perjury.\n  You may hear the President's lawyers remark that the view of the \nfounders is quaint, not really applicable to these settings today. \nLet's look at a few very recent examples to see if the view of the \nseriousness of telling the truth under oath, as envisioned by the \nFounding Fathers, has changed any here today.\n  In the case of the United States v. Landi in the Eastern District of \nVirginia in 1997, the defendant was convicted on two counts of perjury: \none for lying in a declaration she made during a civil forfeiture case, \nand the other for lying to the grand jury in a related criminal \ninvestigation. Here is what the judge said in this case:\n\n       . . .the defendant committed perjury on two separate \n     occasions. There can be no question of it being done by \n     mistake, and perjury is perhaps one of the most serious \n     offenses that can be committed against the court itself. And \n     the court does not believe that it's appropriate to consider \n     probation in the case of somebody who's been convicted of \n     perjury.\n\n  In a second case, United States v. Vincent Bono in the District of \nNew Hampshire in 1998, the defendant was found guilty of lying before a \ngrand jury in trying to cover his stepson's involvement in a robbery \nthat the grand jury was investigating. Here is what the judge had to \nsay about lying before a grand jury:\n\n       As a [matter of policy], they--\n\n  Meaning Congress--\n\n     they don't want people lying to grand juries. They \n     particularly don't want people lying to grand juries about \n     criminal offenses. They particularly don't want people lying \n     to grand juries about criminal offenses that are being \n     investigated. They don't like that. And Congress has said we \n     as a people are going to tell you if you do that, you're \n     going to jail and you're going to jail for a long time. And \n     if you don't get the message, we'll send you to jail again. \n     Maybe others will. But we're not going to have people coming \n     to grand juries and telling lies because of their children or \n     their mothers or fathers or themselves. It's just not \n     acceptable. The system can't work that way.\n\n  In another case in United States v. Ronald Blackley in the District \nof Columbia in 1998, the defendant was the former chief of staff to the \nSecretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The defendant was \nfound guilty at trial on three counts of making false statements to the \ngrand jury in connection with his official duties. Here is what the \njudge had to say in this case:\n\n       In my view, providing a false statement under oath is a \n     serious offense. The fact that the proceeding is civil or \n     administrative does not make the crime less serious. We \n     cannot fairly administer any kind of system of justice in \n     this country if we do not penalize those who lie under oath.\n       The defendant stands before me as a high-ranking Government \n     official convicted of making false statements under oath. \n     This is such a serious crime that it demands an even longer \n     term of imprisonment in this court's view. This court has a \n     duty to send a message to other high-level Government \n     officials that there is a severe penalty to be paid for \n     providing false information under oath. There is a strong \n     reason to deter such conduct and to dispel all of the \n     nonsense that's being publicly discussed and debated about \n     the seriousness of lying under oath by Government officials. \n     A democracy like ours depends on people having trust in our \n     Government and its officials.\n\n  See, there are many other cases, and you can go to your Lexis and \nWestlaw and you can research them. These three cases make it very clear \nthat lying under oath is as serious today in the 106th Congress as it \nwas in 1790 in the first Congress when it enacted the perjury \nstatute. The first Congress recognized the seriousness of perjury and \nits attack on the judicial system.\n\n  Now, I would like to discuss article II, which is the obstruction of \njustice, and how it is an attack on our judicial system. In either a \ncriminal or a civil case, obstruction undermines the judicial system's \nability to vindicate legal\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nrights. If it is allowed to go unchecked, then the system will become a \nfarce and ultimately a test of which side is better at using \nunderhanded methods. Accordingly, Federal courts have called the \nFederal obstruction of justice statute ``one of the most important laws \never adopted'' in that it prevents the ``miscarriage of justice.''\n  This is ``Black's Law Dictionary.'' ``Black's Law Dictionary\" defines \n``obstruction of justice'' as ``[i]mpeding or obstructing those who \nseek justice in a court, or those who have duties or powers of \nadministering justice therein.'' It is very clear. Not only is \nobstruction of justice, on its own, a crime in the Federal Code, but, \nin addition, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines--the Federal Sentencing \nGuidelines--increase the sentence of a convicted defendant who has \n``willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, \nthe administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or \nsentencing'' of his offense. The commentary on the Guidelines \nspecifically lists as examples of obstruction actions the House alleges \nthat President Clinton has committed, including ``committing, \nsuborning, or attempting to suborn perjury'' and ``destroying or \nconcealing or directing or procuring another person to destroy or \nconceal evidence that is material to an official investigation or \njudicial proceeding. . . .''\n  Yesterday, you learned from Mr. Manager McCollum of Florida, when he \ndiscussed, that perjury and obstruction of justice is punished more \nseverely in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines than bribery. As I stated \nearlier, Blackstone put bribery and perjury side by side.\n  At a hearing on the background and history of impeachment as part of \nthe House impeachment inquiry, we were privileged to have the testimony \nof Judge Griffin Bell, an individual who has highly distinguished \nhimself in public service. Judge Bell was appointed to the Federal \nbench by President John Kennedy, and he served as the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral under President Carter. Judge Bell said that, ``I have thought \nabout this a great deal. This is a serious matter. Trifling with the \nFederal courts is serious. And I guess I am biased because I used to be \na Federal judge. But I cannot imagine that it wouldn't be a serious \ncrime to lie in a Federal grand jury or to lie before a Federal judge, \nand that is where I come down.''\n  Judge Bell went on to say, ``And all the civil rights cases that I \nwas in in the South depended on the integrity of the Federal court and \nthe Federal court orders and people telling the truth and fairness. \nTruth and fairness are the two essential elements in a justice system, \nand all of these statutes I mentioned, perjury, tampering with a \nwitness, obstruction of justice, all deal in the interests of truth. If \nwe don't have truth in the judicial process and in the court system in \nour country, we don't have anything. We don't have a system.''\n  As you can see, according to Judge Bell, ``truth and fairness'' are \nthe two cornerstones of our judicial system. President Clinton violated \nboth of these bedrock principles.\n  Finally, Judge Bell spoke to the issue, if a President ever was \nconvicted of a felony. Judge Bell stated: ``If the President were \nindicted and convicted of a felony, such as perjury or obstruction of \njustice or witness tampering, before impeachment proceedings began, \nwould anyone argue that he should continue to be President? I don't \nthink so. If the President were subsequently indicted and convicted of \na felony, which [Judge Bell believes] the Constitution clearly allows, \n[he went on to say] would anyone argue that he should continue to be \nPresident? I don't think so.'' He stated this: He said, ``A President \ncannot faithfully execute the laws if he himself is breaking them.''\n\n  Judge Bell hit it right on the head. Judge Bell said: ``A President \ncannot faithfully execute the laws if he himself is breaking them. The \nstatutes against perjury, obstruction of justice and witness tampering \nrest on vouchsafing the element of truth in judicial proceedings--civil \nand criminal--and particularly in the grand jury. Allegations of this \nkind are grave indeed.''\n  To borrow the words of constitutional scholar Charles J. Cooper, \n``The crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, like the crimes of \ntreason and bribery, are quintessentially offenses against our system \nof government, visiting injury immediately on society itself, whether \nor not committed in connection with the exercise of official government \npowers.'' I believe all of you should have these charts at your table. \n``In a society governed by the rule of law, perjury and obstruction of \njustice simply cannot be tolerated because these crimes subvert the \nvery judicial processes on which the rule of law so vitally depends.''\n  It is no exaggeration to say that our Constitution and the American \npeople entrust to the President singular responsibility for the \nenforcing of the rule of law. Perjury and obstruction of justice strike \nat the heart of the rule of law. A President who has committed these \ncrimes has plainly and directly violated the most important executive \nduty. The core of the President's constitutional responsibilities is \nhis duty to ``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' And \nbecause perjury and obstruction of justice strike at the rule of law \nitself, it is difficult to imagine crimes that more clearly or directly \nviolate this core Presidential constitutional duty.\n  When President Clinton had the opportunity to personally uphold the \nrule of law, to uphold the truth-seeking function of the courts, to \nuphold the fairness in a judicial proceeding, he failed. Far from \ntaking care that the laws be faithfully executed, if a President is \nguilty of perjury and obstruction of justice, he has himself \nfaithlessly subverted the very law that the rest of us are called upon \nto obey.\n  You may hear arguments that perjury and obstruction don't really have \nmuch consequence in this case because it was a private matter and, \ntherefore, not really a serious offense. I would like to arm you with \nthe facts. The courts do not trivialize perjury and obstruction of \njustice.\n  According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in 1997, 182 Americans \nwere sentenced in Federal court for committing perjury. Also in 1997, \n144 Americans were sentenced in Federal court for obstruction and \nwitness tampering.\n  States in State jurisdictions all across the country, they take the \nmatter very seriously. I have chosen one State, the State of \nCalifornia, which brought 4,318 perjury prosecutions in 1997. There are \nnow at least 115 persons serving sentences for perjury in Federal \nprisons. Where is the fairness to these Americans if they stay in jail \nand the President stays in the Oval Office?\n\n  If the allegations in the independent counsel's referral were made \nagainst a sitting Federal judge, would not the Senate convict? If \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton were a sitting judge instead of the \nPresident, would not the Senate convict? While my colleague, Mr. \nManager Graham, will look into this further, let's look briefly at \nprecedent for the moment. When we bring up the issues regarding the \nimpeachment of former Federal judges Mr. Claiborne and Mr. Nixon, one \nstandard was used: high crimes and misdemeanors. The Senate said the \none standard that applies to the President and Vice President will also \napply to these Federal judges and other civil officers.\n  You see, in the defense of Judges Claiborne and Nixon, the defense \nlawyers at the time in the trial here in the Senate argued that Federal \njudges should be treated differently from the President, that they \ncould not be impeached for private misbehavior because it was \nextrajudicial. The Senate rejected that proposition as incompatible \nwith common sense and the orderly conduct of government. You rejected \nthat argument, the very same argument that we are about to hear, \nperhaps, from the White House defense team. And I believe this Senate \nwill uphold your precedent, the precedent that Federal judges and the \nPresident should be treated by the same standard--impeachment for high \ncrimes and misdemeanors.\n  Also, do not be tempted to believe the argument that lying under oath \nabout sex doesn't matter, that it is private. I covered that earlier, \nbut I want to bring it to your attention as some of the House managers \ndid yesterday regarding American law. It makes rape a crime, domestic \nviolence a crime, sexual harassment a civil rights violation, libel, a \ncompensable offense. Without\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\n the protections of perjury and obstruction, none of the rights of the \nvictims of such cases could be vindicated. That is why the courts take \nthese matters so seriously.\n  If the President's lawyers try to tell you that this case is simply \nabout an illicit affair, I believe that it demeans our civil rights \nlaws. If, indeed, the President is successful in trying to make \neveryone believe that this case is only about an illicit affair, what \nwill the message be from those in this hollowed body who have in the \npast been passionate advocates of our civil rights laws, whether it be \nby race, gender, religion, or disability? If the evidence-gathering \nprocess is unimportant in Federal civil rights sexual harassment \nlawsuits--remember, that was the underlying basis of this case--what \nmessage does that send to women in America?\n  There are some important questions we need to ask. Are sexual \nharassment lawsuits, which were designed to vindicate legitimate and \nserious civil rights grievances of women across America, now somewhat \nless important than other civil rights? Which of our civil rights laws \nwill fall next? Will we soon decide that the evidence-gathering process \nis unimportant with respect to vindicating the rights of the disabled \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act? Will the evidence-gathering \nprocess become unimportant with respect to vindicating the voting \nrights of those discriminated against based on race or national origin? \nWho will tell the hundreds of Federal judges across the Nation that the \nevidence-gathering process in these cases is now unimportant?\n\n  Consider postal worker Diane Parker who was convicted of perjury and \nsentenced to 13 months in prison for making a false material \ndeclaration during the discovery deposition in a sexual harassment \nlawsuit. Judge Lacey Collier said: ``One of the most troubling things \nin our society today is people who raise their hands, take the oath to \ntell the truth, and then fail to do that. . . . This, I hope, is \nsufficient punishment for you,'' the judge stated. The judge went on to \nsay, ``But more importantly, I hope that it is a deterrence to others. \nSo your story can be taken far and wide to demonstrate to others the \nseriousness of the responsibility of telling the truth in court \nproceedings.''\n  The Senate must now determine whether it is acceptable or whether it \nis appropriate to set a precedent to have an individual serve as \nPresident of the United States when that individual has committed, is \nalleged to have committed, serious offenses against our system of \ngovernment while holding that office.\n  While we have been discussing how perjury and obstruction of justice \nare attacks on our judicial system, we must recognize how the judicial \nsystem is a core function of the government. When Mr. Manager Henry \nHyde speaks of the rule of law protecting us from the knock on the door \nat 3 a.m., what, exactly, was he referring to? Well, in totalitarian \nsocieties, rulers may drag the ruled off to prison at any time for any \nreason. Our system differs because we require our leaders to go through \na judicial procedure before they put someone in prison or otherwise \nviolate their individual rights. The President's offenses assault the \nadministration of this judicial procedure. As such, they constitute an \nassault on the core function of the government and repudiate our most \nbasic social contract. A core function of the government derives its \nrole from the social contract that our civilized society has under \nwhich the fundamental exchange of rights takes place between those of \nus as individuals and unto the government.\n  We give up our individual rights to exercise brute force to settle \nour personal disputes. That is a situation where chaos reigns and the \nstrongest most often prevails. Instead, we submit to the power \ndelegated to the State under which the individual then submits to the \ngovernmental processes as part of the social contract. Indeed, when \nconflict arises in our society, we as individuals are compelled via the \nsocial contract to take disputes to our third branch of government--the \ncourts. The judicial branch then peacefully decides which party is \nentitled to judgment in their favor after a full presentation of the \ntruthful evidence.\n  Now, implicit in the social contract that we enter as a civilized \nsociety is the principle that the weak are equally entitled as the \nstrong to equal justice under the law. Despite the tumbling tides of \npolitics, ours is a government of laws, not of men. It was the inspired \nvision of our Founding Fathers that the judicial, legislative, and \nexecutive branch of government would work together to preserve the rule \nof law. The U.S. Constitution requires the judicial branch to apply the \nlaw equally and fairly to both the weak and the strong.\n  Once we as a society--and particularly our leaders--no longer submit \nto the social contract and no longer pay deference to the third branch \nof government, which is equally as important as the legislative and \nexecutive branches of government, we then begin to erode the rule of \nlaw and begin to erode the social contract of the great American \nexperiment.\n  That, I believe, is why Judge Bell stated, ``A President cannot \nfaithfully execute the laws if he himself is breaking them.''\n  The administration of justice is a core function of the Government \nprecisely because of the importance we place on the fair resolution of \ndisputes and on whom and for how long a person will be denied liberty \nfor violating our criminal laws. Any assault on the administration of \njustice must be interpreted as a threat to our system of Government. \nOur President, who is our chief executive and chief law enforcement \nofficer, and who alone is delegated the task under our Constitution to \n``take care that the laws be faithfully executed,'' cannot and must not \nbe permitted to engage in such an assault on the administration of \njustice.\n  The articles of impeachment adopted by the House of Representatives \nestablish an abuse of public trust and a betrayal of the social \ncontract in that the President is alleged to have repeatedly placed his \npersonal interests above the public interest and violated his \nconstitutional duties. For if he is allowed to escape conviction by the \nSenate, we would allow the President to set the example for \nlawlessness. We would allow our President to serve as an example of the \nerosion of the concept of the social contract embraced and embodied in \nour Constitution. I don't believe the Senate will allow that to happen.\n  As you undertake your examination of the facts, the law, and your \nprecedents, the Senate must weigh carefully its judgment, for the \nconsequences are deeply profound, not for the moment but for the ages. \nShould the Senate choose to acquit, it must be prepared to accept a \nlower standard, a bad precedent, and a double standard. However, should \nthe Senate choose to convict, it would be reinforcing high standards \nfor high office, maintaining existing precedents, and upholding the \nprinciple of equal justice under the law.\n  I think it is important to pause here and reflect upon the \nconstitutional duties of the President of the United States. I agree \nwith the defense argument that this has not been alleged as a \ndereliction of the President's exercise of executive powers. So let me \ntalk about his executive duties.\n  The President is reposed with a special trust by the American people. \nThe President is a physical embodiment of America and the hope and \nfreedom for which she stands. When the President goes abroad, he is \nhonored as the head of a sovereign nation; our Nation is acknowledged, \nnot just the individual who occupies the Office of the Presidency. When \nhe walks into a room and receives a standing ovation, the ovation is \nnot that of the individual, it is for the Nation for whom he \nrepresents.\n  The President has a constitutional role as Commander in Chief. The \nPresident plays a unique and indispensable role in the chain of \ncommand. In Federalist 74, Alexander Hamilton stated that, ``Of all the \ncares or concerns of government, the direction of war most peculiarly \ndemands those qualities, which distinguish the exercise of power by a \nsingle hand.''\n  It is universally agreed that the President, in his role as Commander \nin Chief, is not an actual member of the military. However, as the \n``single hand'' that guides the actions of the armed services, it is \nincumbent that the President exhibit sound, responsible leadership and \nset a proper example when acting as Commander in Chief.\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\n  That leadership is also at the core of the issue before us. In order \nto be an effective leader, an effective military leader, the President \nmust exhibit the traits that inspire those who must risk their lives at \nhis command. These traits include honor, integrity and accountability.\n  Admiral Thomas Moorer, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, submitted testimony to the House impeachment inquiry. Admiral \nMoorer stated it this way:\n\n       Military leaders also serve as role models for honorable \n     and virtuous conduct.\n\n  You see, veracity and truthfulness are important components of a \nleader's character. In order to have the trust of their subordinates, \nmilitary leaders must have honor and be truthful in all things. That \ntrust, that bond between the leaders and the led, is an essential \nelement of any successful military organization.\n  The President's own self-inflicted wounds have called his credibility \ninto question. While a President's decisions are always critiqued, a \nPresident receives the benefit of the doubt in the decisionmaking \nprocess that he always places the interests of the Nation above his \nown. But by William Jefferson Clinton's present diminished veracity, he \nhas now forfeited that benefit and has invited doubt into the \ndecisionmaking process.\n  The lack of trust in the President's motives, his veracity and his \njudgment is inherently corrosive and can only have a detrimental effect \non our military credibility overseas. This corrosion is difficult to \nmeasure, for it cannot be quantified easily in a readiness report or \ntraining exercise. But in squadbays and wardrooms around the world, and \nat bases in the United States, there can be heard whispers and \nconversations of those who know that had they merely been accused of \nthe same offense, their careers would have ended long ago.\n  This is the intangible effect that the President's actions have had \non our military. We cannot ignore the fact that the Commander in \nChief's conduct sets a poor example to the men and women in the \nmilitary. Worse, we cannot ignore the idea that to acquit the President \nwould create a double standard.\n\n  The Constitution directs this body to provide advice and consent to \nthe President's nominations for military officers. It is your singular \nresponsibility to set high standards of conduct for these officers, and \nyou have done that. The Senate has in the past--and you will likely \nagain do so in the future--rejected those whose moral and legal \nmisconduct makes them unsuitable to be officers in the military.\n  Let me indulge in a hypothetical. An officer is nominated by the \nPresident for promotion to the rank of major. After the list is \nsubmitted, but before the Senate's confirmation, an investigation of \nthe individual's background results in a report that mirrors the \nallegations in the Office of Independent Counsel's referral. After a \nvery careful review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, this \ncaptain, after having committed similar offenses as are in the Office \nof Independent Counsel's referral, could be charged with article 105, \nfalse swearing, and face up to 3 years; he could be charged in article \n107, false official statement, facing up to 5 years; he could be \ncharged with article 131, perjury--probably several times--and face up \nto 5 years; he could be charged with article 133, conduct unbecoming an \nofficer; he could be charged with article 134, prevent seizure of \nproperty, and face up to 1 year imprisonment; he could be charged with \narticle 134, soliciting another to commit an offense, with a penalty of \nup to 5 years; he could be charged with article 134, subornation of \nperjury, and face confinement up to 5 years; he could be charged with \narticle 134 again, obstructing justice, and face 5 years. I could \nprobably come up with about four others, but I won't get into the \nsalacious details.\n  You see, needless to say, the Senate would insist on this \nhypothetical officer's removal from the promotion list. You would do \nthat. The Service would certainly relieve him of his duties.\n  In every warship, every squadbay, and every headquarters building \nthroughout the U.S. military, those of you who have traveled to \nmilitary bases have seen the picture of the Commander in Chief that \nhangs in the apex of the pyramid that is the military chain of command.\n  You should also know that all over the world military personnel look \nat the current picture and know that, if accused of the same offenses \nas their Commander in Chief, they would no longer be deserving of the \nprivilege of serving in the military.\n  Some would say that what I just talked about doesn't matter--that in \nthe military they live under different standards--they live under these \nhigh standards. They say words like ``duty,'' ``honor,'' ``country.'' \nThey are instilled with core values and core virtues--that really \ndoesn't matter in this case--that the President really doesn't have to \nfollow those types of high standards--that it elevates some form of \nhigh standards, if he stands accused of high crimes--it really is not \nhigh crimes; it was about a private matter--that they don't rise to the \nlevel needed to remove the President from office.\n  I would like to remind you of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. In his farewell \naddress at West Point, Gen. Douglas MacArthur stated, when he \nreferenced the words I spoke of, ``duty'' and ``honor'' and \n``country,'' and the high principles:\n\n       The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, \n     but a flamboyant phrase. Every pedant, every demagogue, every \n     cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to \n     say, some others of an entirely different character, will try \n     to downgrade them to the extent of mockery and ridicule.\n\n  The ideal object must be held high even though we recognize that as \nhumans we are not perfect. No matter how great we aspire, we are human \nand we will occasionally fail. But there must be the pursuit of such \nhigh ideals. We cannot degrade our standards as a people. By a \nconviction in the Senate of the President of the United States you will \nbe upholding a high and lofty standard, not only for America, but in \nparticular for those military leaders, rather than setting low \nstandards for the President and a high lofty standard for military \nleaders.\n  Let me turn to the President's responsibility to see that ``the laws \nare faithfully executed.'' According to scholar Philip B. Kurland, it \nwas probably George Washington rather than the Constitution that is \nresponsible for our hierarchy of Cabinet officers that have been taken \nfor granted over the years. And we have heard of the Presidents as the \nchief law enforcement officers of the land, and we can find it in the \nConstitution. So we have to give credit to George Washington and how he \nput together the Cabinet. And we have accepted it over time. So it has \nbeen accepted by custom, practice, and legislation that the executive \nbranch is an entity for which the President is responsible both to \nCongress and to the public.\n  Mr. Kurland stated:\n\n       The whole of the executive branch acts subordinately to the \n     command of the President in the administration of Federal \n     laws, so long as they act within the terms of those laws. \n     Their offices confer no right to violate the laws, whether \n     they take the form of constitution, statute, or treaty.\n\n  The President's Departments of Treasury and Justice seek to bring to \naccount those who disturb our ``domestic tranquility.'' And those who \nseek to disturb our ``domestic tranquility,'' whether it be the \ndrugpushers, or unabombers, gangsters, mobsters, church arsonists, \nviolators of individual rights, dedicated men and women of the FBI, \nDEA, Customs, Secret Service, BATF, INS, the U.S. Marshals Office; they \nall pursue them methodically, thoughtfully, firmly, doggedly, applying \nthe law while risking their lives to uphold the rule of law for our \npeace and security. They seek to ensure equal justice under the law for \neveryone.\n  In the book, ``The Imperial Presidency,'' Professor Arthur \nSchlesinger, Jr. states:\n\n       The continuation of a lawbreaker as chief magistrate would \n     be a strange way to exemplify law and order at home or to \n     demonstrate American probity before the world.\n\n  By a conviction, the Senate will be upholding the high calling of law \nenforcement in protecting the rule of law and equal justice under the \nlaw.\n  ``Equal justice under law''--that principle so embodies the American \nconstitutional order that we have carved it in stone on the front of \nthe Supreme Court building right across the street. The carving across \nthe street shines like a beacon from the highest sanctum across to us \nhere in\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nthe Capitol, the home of the legislative branch, and it shines right \ndown Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, the home of the executive \nbranch. It illuminates our national life and reminds those other \nbranches that despite the tumbling tides of politics, ours is a \ngovernment of laws and not of men. It was the inspired vision of our \nfounders and framers, again, that the judicial, legislative, and \nexecutive branches would work together to preserve the rule of law.\n  But ``equal justice under law'' accounts for much more than a stone \ncarving. Although we can't see it or hear it, this living, breathing \nforce has very real consequences in the lives of every citizen every \nday in America. It allows Americans to claim the assistance of the \ngovernment when someone has wronged us--even if the person is stronger \nor wealthier or more popular than we are. In America, unlike other \ncountries, when an average citizen sues the Chief Executive of our \nNation, they stand equal before the bar of justice. The Constitution \nrequires the judicial branch of our government to apply the law equally \nto both. That is the living consequence of ``equal justice under law'' \nthat shines brightly across our country.\n\n  The President of the United States must work with the judicial and \nthe legislative branches to sustain that force. He is the temporary \ntrustee of that office. But, unfortunately and sadly, William Jefferson \nClinton worked to defeat it and to bring darkness upon that grand \nillumination. When he stood before the bar of justice, he acted without \nauthority to award himself. Even if he believed in his heart that the \ncase against him was politically motivated, he simply assumed unto \nhimself that he had by virtue of his power special privileges that he \ncould be clever, create his own definitions of words in his own mind--\ncreate what C.S. Lewis called ``verbicide.'' He murdered the plain \nspoken English slang so he could come up with these definitions in his \nown mind, state them, and then say, ``Well, I never committed perjury \nbecause this is what I meant by this word,'' even though it fails the \nreasonableness test, and it is absurd that no one would believe his own \ndefinitions. He assumed these special privileges, and then lied and \nobstructed justice to gain advantage in a Federal civil rights action \nin the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. And he \ndid so then again when a Federal grand jury began to investigate that \nlawlessness. And he did it before the grand jury in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia. His resistance brings us to this \nmost unfortunate juncture for which you sit in judgment.\n\n  So ``equal justice under law'' lies at the heart of this matter. It \nrests on three essential pillars: an impartial judiciary, an ethical \nbar, and a sacred oath. If litigants profane the sanctity of the oath, \n``equal justice under law'' loses its protective force.\n  The House, as does the Senate, has the responsibility to uphold the \nConstitution. We have all taken our oaths to defend the Constitution. \nThe Founding Fathers created a system of checks and balances, a system \nof accountability between the functions of Government. See, I believe, \nas I am sure you do, that the Founding Fathers knew the nature of the \nhuman heart. Sometimes, as much as we try, we fail, in that the human \nheart does in fact struggle at times between good and evil. We \nrecognize that no person has perfect virtue and that we each have our \nhuman failings. And the founders could foresee a time when corruption \ncould invade the institutions of Government, and they provided the \nmeans to address it. The impeachment proceeding is one such means. We \nare seeking to defend the rule of law.\n  America, again, is a Government of laws, not of men. What protects us \nfrom that knock on the door in the middle of the night is the law. What \nensures the rights of the weak and the powerless against the powerful \nis the law. What provides the rights to the poor against the rich is \nthe law. What upholds the rightness of the minority view against the \npopular but wrong is the law. As former President Andrew Jackson wrote, \n``The great can protect themselves, but the poor and the humble require \nthe arm and shield of the law.''\n  When our Nation began its journey in history over 200 years ago, the \nUnited States was nearly unique in depending on the rule of law as \nopposed to, at that time, the rule of kings and czars and chieftains \nand monarchs. Now that our unique, grand American experiment has proved \nunto the rest of the world a success, others now seek to follow us. \nThey seek to follow. And we have seen in the crumbling of the Soviet \nUnion that the former Soviet nations, now infant republics, look and \nturn to us. They turn to us, a Government ruled by law.\n  For the sake of ourselves and the sake of generations yet unborn, we, \nand in particular you who sit in judgment in the Senate, must preserve \nthe rule of law.\n  I will leave you with the words of the first President of the Senate \nand the second President of our Nation, John Adams. He said:\n\n       Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, \n     our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they \n     cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\n\n  I believe John Adams was right. Facts and evidence. Facts are \nstubborn things. You can color the facts. You can shade the facts. You \ncan misrepresent the facts. You can hide the facts. But the truthful \nfacts are stubborn; they won't go away. Like the telltale heart, they \nkeep pounding, and they keep coming, and they won't go away. What is \nalso stubborn is the precedents of the Senate.\n  I will now yield the floor for Manager Graham of South Carolina to \ndiscuss the precedents of the Senate.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Graham.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I sense the need for a 10-minute break, but, my colleagues, \nplease tend to your business and return promptly so that we can get \nstarted with the proper decorum.\n  There being no objection, at 11:15 a.m., the Senate recessed until \n11:29 a.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we are ready to begin with \nManager Graham. I have been asked about any changes in the schedule. It \nwould depend on how things move forward. I would ask for consent to \nchange it, depending on how things developed from this point, Mr. Chief \nJustice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Graham\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think I broke the \ncode there. When I hear stomachs growling, I know it will be time to \nwrap this up.\n  This is an unbelievable occasion for all of us. I am Lindsey Graham \nfrom South Carolina. We talk about civil rights. I am a child of the \nSouth and I will give you my views on civil rights and how we \nprogressed in this country, but I am going to talk to you a bit about \nsome decisions this body has made regarding the crime of perjury and \nobstruction of justice and the impeachment clause in the Constitution \nas it applies to Federal judges. I am not so presumptuous to tell you I \nknow more about what you did than you did. I am going to try to \nhighlight some of the things that you did that I think served this \ncountry well in this area. But before we get there, a couple of \nobservations.\n\n  As I was walking over through the Rotunda today, there was a group of \nJapanese tourists there, and I stopped and talked. My dad, who is now \ndeceased, was a World War II veteran, and it struck me, 50 years plus, \nhow resilient this world is. My dad's generation I don't think would \nhave ever envisioned 50 years ago that his son, one, would be a \nCongressman, which is a great thing about this country, would be \nstopping and talking to Japanese tourists in the Capitol of the United \nStates.\n  So when we talk about the consequences of this case, no matter what \nyou decide, in my opinion, this country will survive. If you acquit the \nPresident, we will survive. If you convict him, it will be traumatic, \nand if you remove him, it will be traumatic, but we will survive.\n  This has been billed as a constitutional drama, by some of the \npundits, that is called a snoozer. I can understand that a little bit. \nI am the 12th\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\nlawyer you have had to listen to, and I think my colleagues have done a \nvery good job. But it is a very long and tedious process in many ways. \nIt is hard to sit here and listen to 12 lawyers talk to you. But you \nhave done a wonderful job, I think. I am very proud of the U.S. Senate. \nYou have paid great attention.\n  But the fact that people call this boring is not a bad thing to me. I \nthink it shows the confidence we have achieved in 200 years as a \nRepublic that people can go on about their business, and they are \nupset. I know my phone rings a lot, and your phone rings a lot, about \nwhat to do. But there is a calmness in this country in the midst of \nsomething so important like this that tells me we have done it right \nfor a long time.\n  How many countries would love the chance to be bored when their \ngovernment is in action? How many countries fear that the government \nwon't work for them; that to get it right, you have to pick up a gun? \nThat happens every day throughout this world. And the fact that we can \ncome together and talk about something so important and the country can \ngo on and people not be so anxious about their personal lives and their \nfreedoms and their properties and their jobs is a compliment to every \ngeneration who has ever served this Republic.\n  Tom Brokaw has a book out called ``The Greatest Generation,'' and I \nrecommend it to you to read, because we will be talking about that in a \nmoment. But let's talk about some of this country's imperfections. Mr. \nBuyer talked about, very eloquently, the rule of law and how it makes \nus so different and how it is something that people literally do die \nfor and have died for.\n  But let me tell you, as a lawyer, it is not a perfect legal system. \nIf you are a poor person and you are charged with a crime, you are \nlikely to get a public defender right out of law school and, hopefully, \nthat public defender will do the best he can or she can. But it is not \na perfect system. Don't ever think it is.\n  Civil rights have been advanced a lot in my lifetime, but we have a \nlong way to go in South Carolina. I think we have a long way to go in \nthis Nation. In my lifetime, I started school with no black person in \nmy class. By the sixth grade--I think it was the sixth grade--\nintegration hit in my area, and I can remember my mom and dad being \nscared to death about what it would do and what it would mean. But we \nmade it, and we are better off as a country.\n  We are here to judge our President. We are here to say whether or not \nhe is guilty, to begin with, of some serious offenses that are colored \nby sex, and there is absolutely no way to get around that, and I know \nit is uncomfortable to listen to.\n\n  My father and mother owned a restaurant, a beer joint, I guess is \nwhat we would say in South Carolina. I can remember that if you were \nblack, you came and you had to buy the beer and you had to go because \nyou couldn't drink it there. That is just the way it was, is what my \ndad said. I always never quite understood that. My dad and mom were \ngood people, but that is just the way it was. That is not the way it is \nnow, and we are better off for that.\n  In sexual harassment cases, it is always uncomfortable to listen to. \nThat is just the way it is. It used to be in this country, not long \nago, there was really no recourse if you were sexually harassed. We \nhave changed things for the better.\n  The reason we are here today is not because somebody wanted to look \ninto the personal life of the President for no good reason. We are here \ntoday because somebody accused him when he was Governor of picking them \nout of a crowd, asking her to come to a hotel room, and if you believe \nher, did something very crude and rude that you wouldn't want to happen \nto anybody in your family. Now only God knows what happened there. That \ncase has been settled. The parties know and God knows. We will never \nknow.\n  Let me just say this. I am proud of my country where you, as a low-\nlevel employee, can sue the Governor of your State and if that Governor \nbecomes President, you can still sue.\n  The Supreme Court said 9 to 0--a shutout legally--``Mr. President, \nyou will stand subject to this suit.'' We are going to talk about is \nthis private or public conduct; does this go to the heart of being \nPresident, or is this just some private matter he could be prosecuted \nfor after he gets out of office? Is this really a big deal about being \nPresident?\n  I contend, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, it became a big deal \nabout being President when he raised the defense, ``You can't sue me \nnow because I am the President, I am a busy man, I have a lot going \non.'' He used his office, or tried to, to avoid the day in court, but \nthe Supreme Court said, ``No, sir, you will stand subject to suit under \nsome reasonable accommodation.'' And we are here today.\n  If I had been on the Supreme Court, I don't know if I would have \nruled that way. There is not much chance of that happening any time \nsoon, if you are worried about that. I don't think that is going to be \nin my future. [Laughter.]\n  I may not have ruled that way, and we in Congress, if we don't like \nthe way all this has come out, we can change that law, we can change \nthat ruling by law. But it is the law of the land, because the Chief \nJustice and his colleagues said so.\n  What did our President do? He tried to say, ``You can't sue me \nbecause I am President.'' He participated in that lawsuit because he \nwas told to, and I would argue, ladies and gentlemen, that we all \nassumed he would play fair. Now isn't there a lot of doubt about that?\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, what if he had not shown up? What \nif he refused to answer any court order? What if he had said, ``I am \nnot going to play, that is it; I am not going to listen to you, \njudicial branch?'' You know the remedy we have to resolve problems like \nthat when Presidential conduct gets out of bounds. Do you know where \nthat remedy lies? It lies with us, the U.S. Congress. When a President \ngets out of bounds and doesn't do as he or she should do \nconstitutionally--and I would argue that every President and every \ncitizen has a constitutional duty not to cheat another citizen, \nespecially the President--and they get out of bounds, it is up to us to \nput them back in bounds or declare it illegal.\n  And how do we do that? How do we regulate Presidential misconduct \nwhen it is done in a Presidential fashion? Through the laws and powers \nof impeachment. That is why we are here today.\n  It is going to take team work on our part to get this right, because \nI will argue to you in a moment that the President of the United \nStates, through his conduct, flouted judicial authority and \ndecisionmaking over him. When he chose to lie, when he chose to \nmanipulate the evidence to witnesses against him and get his friends to \ngo lie for him, he, in fact, I think, vetoed that decision.\n  It's worse than if he had not shown up at all. Is that out of bounds? \nThat is what we are going to be talking about today. And we have some \nguidance as to what really is in or out of bounds for high Government \nofficials. What is a high crime? How about if an important person hurts \nsomebody of low means? It is not very scholarly, but I think it is the \ntruth. I think that is what they meant by ``high crimes.'' It doesn't \nhave to be a crime. It is just when you start using your office and you \nare acting in a way that hurts people, you have committed a high crime.\n  When you decide that a course of conduct meets the high crimes \nstandard under our Constitution for the President, what are we doing to \nthe Presidency? I think we are putting a burden on the Presidency. And \nyou should consider it that way, that if you determine that the conduct \nand the crimes in this case are high crimes, you need to do so knowing \nthat you are placing a burden on every future occupant of that office \nand the office itself. So do so cautiously, because one branch of the \nGovernment should never put a burden on another branch of the \nGovernment that's not fair and they can't bear.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, if you decide, from the conduct \nof this President, that henceforth any officeholder who occupies the \noffice of President will have this burden to bear--let me tell you what \nit is: don't lie under oath to a Federal grand jury when many in the \ncountry are begging you not to--can the occupant bear that burden?\n  I voted against article 2 in the House, which was the deposition \nperjury allegations against the President standing\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\nalone. I think many of us may have thought that he didn't know about \nthe tapes, that he and Ms. Lewinsky thought they had a story that was \ngoing to work, and he got caught off guard, and he started telling a \nbunch of lies that maybe I would have lied about, maybe you would have \nlied about, because it is personal to have to talk about intimate \nthings; and our human nature is to protect ourselves, our family; that \nis just human nature.\n  But, ladies and gentlemen, what he stands charged of in this Senate \nhappened 8 months later, after some Members of this body said, ``Mr. \nPresident, square yourself by the law. Mr. President, if you go into \nthat Federal grand jury and you lie again, you're risking your \nPresidency.'' People in this body said that. Legal commentators said \nthat. Professor Dershowitz and I probably don't agree on a lot. I think \nhe would probably agree with that statement. That would be one thing we \nwould agree on. He said --and he is a very smart, passionate man; and I \nlike passionate people even if I don't agree with them--even he said \nthat if you go to a grand jury and you lie as President, that ought to \nbe a high crime.\n  So the context in which you are going to decide this case has to \nunderstand human failings, because if you don't do that, you are not \nbeing fair. And I know you want to be fair.\n  Human failings exist in all of us. Only when it gets to be so \npremeditated, so calculated, so much ``my interest over anybody else'' \nor ``the public be damned,'' should you really, really start getting \nserious about what to do. That happened in August, in my opinion, \nladies and gentlemen. After being begged not to lie to the grand jury \nand end this matter, he chose to lie.\n  That is the burden you will be placing on the next President: ``Don't \ndo that. Don't lie under oath when you are a defendant in a lawsuit \nagainst an average citizen. Have the courage to apply the law in a fair \nmanner to yourself.''\n\n  Mr. Buyer talked about values and courage. Let me say something about \nPresident Clinton that I believe. I believe he does embrace civil \nrights for our citizens. I believe he has been an articulate spokesman \nfor the civil rights for our citizens. I believe that may be one of the \nhallmarks of his Presidency. And I am not here to tell you that he \ndoesn't. I am here to tell you that when it was his case, when those \nrights had to be applied to him, he failed miserably.\n  It is always easy to talk about what other people ought to do. The \ntest of character is the way you judge people you disagree with: Don't \ncheat in a lawsuit by manipulating the testimony of others. Don't send \npublic officials and friends to tell your lies before a Federal grand \njury to avoid your legal responsibilities. Don't put your legal and \npolitical interests ahead of the rule of law and common decency.\n  If you find that these are high crimes, that is the burden you are \nplacing on the next officeholder. If they can't meet that burden, this \ncountry has a serious problem. I don't want my country to be the \ncountry of great equivocators and compartmentalizers for the next \ncentury. And that is what this case is about, equivocation and \ncompartmentalizing.\n  What I have described to you as the conduct of the President being a \nhigh crime I think is just his job description. We are asking no more \nof him than to be the chief law enforcement officer of the land--follow \nyour job description. A determination that this conduct is a high crime \nis no burden that cannot be borne in a reasonable fashion by future \noccupants.\n  Now, why did I talk about constitutional teamwork? I am a child of \nthe South. The civil rights litigation in matters that came about in \nthe sixties was threefold: There was legislation passed in Congress, \nthere were judicial decisions that were rendered, and the executive \nbranch came in to help out. Remember when Governor Wallace was standing \nin the door of the University of Alabama? Remember how he was told to \nget aside?\n  What went on? It was a constitutional dance of magnificent \nproportions. You had litigation that was resolved for the individual \ncitizen so they could go in and acquire the rights, full benefits, of a \ncitizen of that State; you had legislation coming out of this body; and \nyou had defiance against the Federal Government from the State level; \nand you had the President and the executive branch federalizing the \nNational Guard. And Governor Wallace: ``Step aside.''\n  When it was 9 to nothing that Bill Clinton had to be a participant in \nthe lawsuit and he chose to cheat in every manner you can cheat in a \nlawsuit, his conduct needs to be regulated, and it needs to be brought \nto bear under the Constitution. If you put him in jail after his \noffice, that would not solve the constitutional problem he created. The \nconstitutional conduct exhibited by the Executive, when he was told by \nthe judicial branch, ``You've got to participate in a lawsuit,'' was so \nfar afield of what is fair, what is decent, that it became a high \ncrime, and it happened to be against a little person.\n  The Senate has spoken before about perjury and obstruction of justice \nand how it applies to high Government officials. And those Government \nofficials were judges.\n  Before we start this analysis, it is important to know--and some of \nyou know this better than I will ever hope to know, the history of this \nSenate, the history of this body and how it works and why it works--\nthat when a judge is impeached in the United States of America, the \nsame legal standard--treason, bribery, or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors--is applied to that judge's conduct as it is to any high \nofficial, just like the President. So we are comparing apples to \napples.\n  Now, in Judge Claiborne's trial they seized upon the language, \n``Judges shall hold their office during good behavior.'' And the \ndefense was trying to say, unlike the President and other Government \nofficials, high Government officials, the impeachment standard for \njudges is ``good behavior.'' That is the term. It's a different \nimpeachment standard. You know these cases better than I know these \ncases. And you said ``Wrong.'' The good behavior standard doesn't apply \nto why you will be removed. It is just a reference to how long you will \nhave your job.\n\n  Our President is two terms. A judge is for life, conditioned on good \nbehavior. What gets you out of office is whether or not you violate the \nconstitutional standard for impeachment, which is treason, bribery, or \nother high crimes and misdemeanors.\n  So as I talk to you about these cases and what you as a body did, \nunderstand we are using the same legal standard, not because I said so, \nbut because you said so. Judge Claiborne, convicted and removed from \noffice by the Senate, 90-7. For what? Filing a false income tax return \nunder penalties of perjury. One thing they said in that case was, ``I'm \na judge and filing false income tax returns has nothing to do with me \nbeing a judge and I ought not lose my job unless you can show me or \nprove that I did something wrong as a judge.'' They were saying \ncheating on taxes has nothing to do with being a judge.\n  You know what the Senate said? It has everything to do with being a \njudge. And the reason you said that is because you didn't buy into this \nidea that the only way you can lose your job as a high Government \nofficial under the Constitution is to engage in some type of public \nconduct directly related to what you do every day. You took a little \nbroader view, and I am certainly glad you did, because this is not a \ncountry of high officials who are technicians. This is a country based \non character, this is a country based on having to set a standard that \nothers will follow with that.\n  This is Manager Fish:\n\n       Judge Claiborne's actions raise fundamental questions about \n     public confidence in, and the public's perception of, the \n     Federal court system. They serve to undermine the confidence \n     of the American people in our judicial system . . . Judge \n     Claiborne is more than a mere embarrassment. He is a \n     disgrace--an affront--to the judicial office and to the \n     judicial branch he was appointed to serve.\n\n  That is very strong language. Apparently, you agreed with that \nconcept because 90 of you voted to throw him out. What did he do? He \ncheated on his taxes by making false statements under oath.\n  Now we will talk more about public versus private. Senator Mathias, \nabout this idea of public versus private:\n\n       It is my opinion . . . that the impeachment power is not as \n     narrow as Judge Claiborne suggests. There is neither \n     historical nor logical reason to believe that Framers of the \n     Constitution sought to prohibit the House\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\n     from impeaching . . . an officer of the United States who had \n     committed treason or bribery or any other high crime or \n     misdemeanor which is a serious offense against the government \n     of the United States and which indicates that the official is \n     unfit to exercise public responsibilities, but which is an \n     offense which is technically unrelated to the officer's \n     particular job responsibilities.''\n\n  This hits it head on:\n\n       Impeachable conduct does not have to occur in the course of \n     the performance of an officer's official duties. Evidence of \n     misconduct, misbehavior, high crimes, and misdemeanors can be \n     justified upon one's private dealings as well as one's \n     exercise of public office. That, of course, is the situation \n     in this case.\n       It would be absurd to conclude that a judge who had \n     committed murder, mayhem, rape or perhaps espionage in his \n     private life, could not be removed from office by the U.S. \n     Senate.\n\n  The point you made so well was that we are not buying this. If you \nare a Federal judge and you cheat on your taxes and you lie under \noath--it is true that it had nothing to do with your courtroom in a \ntechnical sense, but you are going to be judging others and they are \ngoing to come before you with their fate in your hands, and we don't \nwant somebody like you running a courtroom because people won't trust \nthe results.\n  Judge Walter Nixon, convicted and removed from office for what? \nPerjury before a grand jury. What was that about? He tried to fix a \ncase for a business partner's son in State court. He went to the \nprosecutor who was in State court and tried to fix the case. When they \ninvestigated the matter, he lied about meeting with the prosecutor. He \nlied about doing anything related to trying to manipulate the results. \nHe was convicted and he was thrown out of office by the U.S. Senate.\n  I guess you could say, what has that got to do with being a Federal \njudge? It wasn't even in his court? It has everything to do with being \na high public official because if he stays in office, what signal are \nyou sending anybody else that you send to his courtroom or anybody \nelse's courtroom?\n  The question becomes, if a Federal judge could be thrown out of \noffice for lying and trying to fix a friend's son's case, can the \nPresident of the United States be removed from office for trying to fix \nhis case? That is not a scholarly work but that is what happened. He \ntried to fix his case. He tried to turn the judicial system upside \ndown, every way but loose. He sent his friends to lie for him. He lied \nfor himself. Any time any relevant question came up, instead of taking \nthe honorable way out, he lied and dug a hole, and we are all here \ntoday because of that.\n\n  I am not going to go over the facts again because you have been \nbombarded with the facts. If you believe he committed perjury and if \nyou believe he obstructed justice, the reason he did it was to fix his \ncase. And you have some records to rely upon to see what you should do \nwith somebody like that.\n  Judge Hastings: this Federal judge was convicted and removed from \noffice by the U.S. Senate. But do you know what is interesting about \nthis case to me? He was acquitted before he got here. He was accused of \nconspiring with another person to take money to fix results in his own \ncourt. He gave testimony on his own behavior. The conspirator was \nconvicted but he was acquitted.\n  You know what the U.S. Senate and House said? We believe your conduct \nis out of bounds and we are not bound by that acquittal. We want to get \nto the truth and we don't want Federal judges that we have a strong \nsuspicion or reasonable belief about that are trying to fix cases in \ntheir court.\n  So the point I am trying to make, you don't even have to be convicted \nof a crime to lose your job in this constitutional Republic if this \nbody determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out \nof bounds in your role. Thank God you did that, because impeachment is \nnot about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. \nImpeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office. The \nremedy of prosecuting William Jefferson Clinton has no effect on the \nproblem you are facing here today, in my opinion.\n  Now, every case was tried before it got here with different results. \nTwo of them were convicted; one of them was acquitted. You had a \nfactual record to go upon. I urge you, ladies and gentlemen of the U.S. \nSenate, that that cannot happen in this case unless we have a trial in \nthe true sense of the word. The evidence is compelling and \noverwhelming, but it has only been half told. The learned counsel for \nthe President will have their chance, and they are excellent lawyers.\n  If this were a football game, we would be almost at half time. \nPlease, please wait, because I have sat where they are sitting, dying \nto say something. I know there are things they want to tell you about \nwhat we have said that may put this in a different light. That is \ncoming, and it ought to come.\n  But there is another thing that you will have to decide: Has the \nfactual record been developed enough that I can acquit with good \nconscience or that I can convict and remove with good conscience? In \nthese judge cases, there was a full-blown trial. Because we can't \nprosecute the President criminally, we can't do the things that \nhappened in the judge cases, so we don't have that record. I just \nsubmit that to you for your wisdom. None of this matters unless you \nbelieve he committed the offense. And I am not going to go over that \nagain.\n  You know the facts pretty well. If there is any doubt, let's call \nwitnesses and let's develop them fully, and leave no doubt on the \ntable, and make sure that history will judge us well. Everybody, the \nHouse and the President, will have a fair shot at proving their case, \nthat these things occurred, the high crimes.\n  I don't believe, ladies and gentlemen, that when you look at the \ntotality of what the President did and prior precedents of the Senate, \nthe fact that he was told by the Supreme Court to go into this \nlitigation matter and he cheated so badly, you would consider these not \nto be high crimes. Because you are not placing a burden on this office \nthat the office can't bear, I think that will be resolved, I hope and \npray, in a bipartisan fashion.\n  If we can do nothing else for this country, let us state clearly that \nthis conduct is unacceptable by any President. These are in fact high \ncrimes. They go to the core of why we are all here as a Nation and to \nthe rule of law, the rules of litigation. He cheated, and you have to \nput him back in bounds, remove him. Determining this as a high crime \nputs it back into bounds.\n  This is a hard question. I am not going to tell you it is not. I do \nnot want to be where you are sitting. I think the evidence will be \npersuasive that he is guilty. The logic of your past rulings and just \nfundamental fairness and decency, and helping the Supreme Court enforce \ntheir rules, if nothing else, will lead you to a high crime \ndetermination.\n  But we are asking you to remove a popular President. I don't know why \nall this occurred. And we have a popular President. I know this. The \nAmerican people are fundamentally fair, and they have an impression \nabout this case from just tons and tons and tons of talk, tons and tons \nand tons of speaking. One in five, they tell me, are paying close \nattention to this. The question you must ask is: If every American were \nrequired to do what I have to do, sit in silence and listen to the \nevidence, would it be different? You are their representatives; they \nwill trust you. This is a cynical age, but I am optimistic that \nwhatever you do, this country will get up and go to work the next day, \nand they will feel good, no matter what it is.\n  To set aside an election is a very scary thought in a democracy. I do \nnot agree with this President on most major policy initiatives. I did \nnot vote for this President. But he won; he won twice. To undo that \nelection is tough.\n  Let me give you some of my thoughts. How many times have you had to \ngo to a child, a grandchild, or somebody who works for you, and give \nthem a lecture that goes along the lines:  Don't do as I do, do as I \nsay? Isn't that a miserable experience? The problem with keeping this \nPresident in office, in my opinion, is that these crimes can't be \nignored by anybody who looks at the evidence. They can be explained \naway, they can be excused; but they have far-reaching consequences for \nthe law. And in his role as chief law enforcement officer of the land, \nhow can we say to our fellow citizens that this will not be 20 months \nof\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\n``don't do as I do, do as I say.'' What effect will that have? I think \nit would be devastating.\n\n  This case is the butt of a thousand jokes. This case is requiring \nparents and teachers to sit down and explain what lying is all about. \nThis case is creating confusion. This case is hitting America far \nharder than America knows it has been hit. It is tempting to let the \nclock tick, but I want to suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen of the \nSenate, if you believe he is a perjurer, that he obstructed justice in \na civil rights lawsuit, the question is not, Should he stay? It is, \nwhat if he stays? If you believe this President committed perjury \nbefore a grand jury when he was begged not to, and people in this body \ntold him, ``Don't do it, because your political career is at stake,'' \nand if you believe he obstructed justice in a civil rights lawsuit, \ndon't move the bar anymore. We have moved the bar for this case a \nthousand times.\n  Remember how you felt when you knew you had a perjurer as a judge, \nwhen you knew you had somebody who had fundamentally run over the law \nthat they were responsible for upholding. Remember how you felt when \nyou knew that judge got so out of bounds that you could not put him \nback in court, even though it was unrelated to his court, because you \nwould be doing a disservice to the citizens who would come before him. \nA judge has a duty to take care of the individuals fairly who come \nbefore the court. The President, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, \nhas a duty to see that the law applies to everyone fairly--a higher \nduty, a higher duty in the Constitution. You could not live with \nyourself, knowing that you were going to leave a perjurer as a judge on \nthe bench.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, as hard as it may be, for the same reasons, \ncleanse this office. The Vice President will be waiting outside the \ndoors of this Chamber. Our constitutional system is simple and it is \ngenius all at the same time. If that Vice President is asked to come in \nand assume the mantle of Chief Executive Officer of the land and chief \nlaw enforcement officer of the land, it will be tough, it will be \npainful, but we will survive and we will be better for it.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Canady.\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished counsel, ladies \nand gentlemen of the Senate, I am Representative Charles Canady of the \n12th District of Florida, and I rise now to conclude the argument that \nmy two fellow managers have begun and to address the fundamental \nquestion now before the Senate:  Do the offenses charged against the \nPresident rise to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' under \nthe Constitution?\n\n  Are these crimes--perjury before a federal grand jury and obstruction \nof justice--offenses for which the President has properly been \nimpeached by the House of Representatives and for which he may now \nproperly be convicted by the Senate? Or are these serious felonies \noffenses for which a Chief Executive may not constitutionally be called \nto account by either the House or the Senate?\n  To properly answer these questions, it must be understood, as my \nfellow manager Mr. Buyer has argued, that perjury and obstruction of \njustice are serious offenses against the system of justice. To properly \nanswer these questions, it must also be understood--as my fellow \nmanager Mr. Graham has discussed--that the Senate has already \ndetermined that as a serious offense against the system of justice, \nperjury is proper grounds for removal from office.\n  There are several additional points that I now ask you to consider as \nyou deliberate on the momentous issue you must decide.\n  First, I will argue that restricting the impeachment process to \ncrimes involving the abuse of Presidential power is contrary to common \nsense. This is a key point in this case. The President's defense hinges \nto a large extent on his claim that the offenses charged against him do \nnot involve official misconduct.\n  I will then review the history and purpose of the impeachment process \nto show that its fundamental object is to maintain the supremacy of law \nagainst the misconduct of public officials. After reviewing the \nbackground of the impeachment process, I will briefly discuss the \nprevailing views on the seriousness of perjury at the time the \nConstitution was adopted, and show that perjury and obstruction of \njustice are akin to bribery in their purpose and effect.\n  To conclude, I will discuss the proper role of the Senate in \nexercising the removal power--emphasizing three essential points:\n  First, that the removal power is designed to preserve, protect, and \nstrengthen our Constitution by setting a standard of conduct for public \nofficers.\n  Second, that the Senate should not establish a lower standard of \nintegrity for the President than the standard it has already \nestablished for federal judges.\n  Third, that the Senate should not allow a President who has violated \nhis constitutional duty and oath of office, and made himself a \nnotorious example of lawlessness to remain in office.\n  The President's lawyers have argued that the ``Constitution requires \nproof of official misconduct'' for impeachment and conviction, and that \nremoval from office is not proper for crimes that do not involve an \nabuse of the power of office. This view is endorsed by various \nacademics who have signed a letter in support of the President. The \nSenate must now decide if this is a proper interpretation of the \nConstitution.\n  In deciding this question you should be guided by common sense and \ngood judgment. It is by no means an abstruse and mysterious matter of \nconstitutional law.\n  Nor is it a new question before the Senate. It has been decided in \nthe recent judicial impeachments which Mr. Graham has discussed. And it \nis a question which arose 200 years ago in the course of the first \nimpeachment trial conducted by the Senate.\n  At that trial in January of 1799, as the Senate met in Philadelphia, \nan argument was made by counsel for the respondent, Senator Blount of \nTennessee, that the impeachment power was properly exercised only with \nrespect to ``official offenses.'' Although Senator Blount escaped \nconviction on other grounds, the response to his claim that only \nofficial misconduct could justify impeachment and removal remains \nnoteworthy. Robert Goodloe Harper of South Carolina, one of the House \nmanagers--and who, incidentally, subsequently served as a Member of \nthis Senate representing the State of Maryland--refuted that claim by \nasking a simple question:\n  ``Suppose a Judge of the United States were to commit a theft or \nperjury; would the learned counsel say that he should not be impeached \nfor it? If so, he must remain in office with all his infamy * * * .''\n  Two hundred years to the month after Robert Goodloe Harper posed that \nquestion to the Senate, a very similar question is before the Senate \ntoday. Shall a President--if found guilty of perjury and obstruction of \njustice--be removed, or must he ``remain in office with all his \ninfamy''?\n  Although a judge who commits crimes may be subjected to criminal \npenalties and prevented from discharging judicial functions, he can be \ndivested of his office only by impeachment and removal. The tenure of a \nPresident will necessarily expire with the passage of time, but most \nscholars of constitutional law agree that while he remains in office he \nis immune from the processes of the criminal law. So long as he is \nPresident, the only mechanism available to hold him accountable for his \ncrimes is the power of impeachment and removal. Unless that power is \nexercised, no matter what crime he has committed, he must ``remain in \noffice with all his infamy.''\n\n  The argument of the President's lawyers that no criminal act by the \nPresident subjects him to removal from office unless the crime involves \nthe abuse of his power is an argument entailing consequences which--\nupon a moment's reflection--this body should be unwilling to accept.\n  Would a President guilty of murder be immune from the constitutional \nprocess of impeachment and removal so long as his crime involved no \nmisuse of official power? Would a President guilty of sexual assault or \nchild molesting remain secure in office because his crime did not \ninvolve an abuse of office?\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\n  In support of their position, the President's lawyers have vigorously \nargued that a President who committed tax fraud--a felony offense not \ninvolving official misconduct--would not be subject to impeachment and \nremoval. They erroneously cite the decision of the House Judiciary \nCommittee rejecting an article of impeachment against President Nixon \nfor tax fraud. The record of the House proceedings establishes that the \ntax fraud article against President Nixon was rejected due to \ninsufficient evidence that he was in fact guilty of tax fraud. The \nHouse Judiciary Committee never determined that tax fraud by a \nPresident would not be grounds for impeachment.\n  But, leaving aside the inaccurate characterization of the House \nJudiciary Committee's action, the claim of the President's lawyers that \na President could commit tax fraud and remain immune from impeachment \nand removal is quite telling. It reveals a great deal about the sort of \nstandard they would set for the conduct of the President of the United \nStates.\n  The claim that tax fraud--a felony--does not rise to the level of a \nhigh crime or misdemeanor was, as you have heard, unequivocally \nrejected by the Senate in 1986 in the case of Judge Harry Claiborne, \nwho was removed from office for filing false income tax returns.\n  Then-Senator Albert Gore, Jr., summarized the judgment of the Senate \nthat Judge Claiborne should be removed from office. The comments of \nSenator Gore bear repeating:\n\n       It is incumbent upon the Senate to fulfill its \n     constitutional responsibility and strip this man of his \n     title. An individual who has knowingly falsified tax returns \n     has no business receiving a salary derived from the tax \n     dollars of honest citizens.\n\n  Of course, the rationale expressed by Senator Gore for the conviction \nof Judge Claiborne for his criminal tax offenses applies with equal--if \nnot greater--force to similar offenses committed by the President of \nthe United States. Professor Charles Black, Jr., in his essay on the \nlaw of impeachment, recognized the appropriate application of these \nprinciples to the office of the Presidency. Professor Black said, ``A \nlarge-scale tax cheat is not a viable chief magistrate.''\n  I would respectfully submit to the Senate that the argument of the \nPresident's lawyers concerning tax fraud by a President is not a viable \nargument.\n  Who can seriously argue that our Constitution requires that a \nPresident guilty of crimes such as murder, sexual assault, or tax fraud \nremain in his office undisturbed? Who is willing to set such a standard \nfor the conduct of the President of the United States? Who can in good \nconscience accept the consequences for our system of government that \nwould necessarily follow? Could our Constitution possibly contemplate \nsuch a result? What other crimes of a President will we be told do not \nrise to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors?'' These are grave \nquestions that must be addressed by this Senate. The President's \ndefense requires that these questions be asked and answered.\n  Contrary to the claims of the President's lawyers, there is not a \nbright line separating official misconduct by a President from other \nmisconduct of which the President is guilty. Some offenses will involve \nthe direct and affirmative misuse of governmental power. Other offenses \nmay involve a more subtle use of the prestige, status and position of \nthe President to further a course of wrongdoing. There are still other \noffenses in which a President may not misuse the power of his office, \nbut in which he violates a duty imposed on him under the Constitution.\n  Such a breach of constitutional duty--even though it does not \nconstitute an affirmative misuse of governmental power--may be a very \nserious matter. It does violence to the English language to assert that \na President who has violated a duty entrusted to him by the \nConstitution is not guilty of official misconduct. Common sense \nindicates that official misconduct has indeed occurred whenever a \nPresident breaches any of the duties of his office.\n  As we have been reminded repeatedly, the Constitution imposes on the \nPresident the duty to ``take care that the laws be faithfully \nexecuted.'' The charges against the President involve multiple \nviolations of that duty. A President who commits a calculated and \nsustained series of criminal offenses has--by his personal violations \nof the law--failed in the most immediate, direct, and culpable manner \nto do his duty under the Constitution.\n  In their defense of the President, his lawyers in essence contend \nthat a President may be removed for misusing governmental power, but \nnot for corruptly interfering with the proper exercise of governmental \npower. This argument exalts form over substance. It unduly focuses on \nthe manner in which wrongdoing is carried out and neglects to consider \nthe actual impact of that wrongdoing on our system of government. \nWhether the President misuses the power vested in him as President or \nwrongfully interferes with the proper exercise of the power vested in \nother parts of the government, the result is the same: the due \nfunctioning of our system of government is in some respect hindered or \ndefeated.\n  There is no principled basis for contending that a President who \ninterferes with the proper exercise of governmental power--as he \nclearly does when he commits perjury and obstruction of justice--is \nconstitutionally less blameworthy than a President who misuses the \npower of his office. A President who lies to a federal grand jury in \norder to impede the investigation of crimes is no less culpable than a \nPresident who wrongfully orders a prosecutor to suspend an \ninvestigation of crimes that have been committed. The purpose and \neffect of the personal perjury and of the wrongful official command are \nthe same: the laws of the United States are not properly enforced.\n  Although neither the Senate nor the House has ever adopted a fixed \ndefinition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' there is much in the \nbackground and history of the impeachment process that contradicts the \nnarrow view of the removal power advanced by the President's lawyers.\n  There is no convincing evidence that those who framed and ratified \nour Constitution intended to limit the impeachment and removal power to \nacts involving the abuse of official power.\n  The key phrase defining the offenses for which the President, Vice \nPresident and other civil officers of the United States may be \nremoved--``treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors''--\nsimply does not limit the removal power in the way suggested by the \nPresident's lawyers.\n  The truth is as we have heard already today, that treason and bribery \nmay be committed by an official who does not abuse the power of his \noffice in the commission of the offense. A President might, for \nexample, pay a bribe to a judge presiding over a case to which the \nPresident is an individual party. Or a judge might commit an act of \ntreason without exercising any of the powers of his office in doing so. \nBy the express terms of the Constitution those offenses would be \nimpeachable. And there is no reason to impose a restriction on the \nscope of ``other high crimes and misdemeanors'' that is not imposed on \ntreason and bribery.\n  Although having a means for the removal of officials guilty of \nabusing their power was no doubt very much in the minds of the framers, \nthe purpose of the removal power was not restricted to that object.\n  To properly understand the purpose impeachment process under our \nConstitution, consideration must be given to use of impeachment by the \nEnglish Parliament. Impeachment in the English system did not require \nan indictable crime, but the proceeding was nevertheless of a criminal \nnature: punishment upon conviction could extend to imprisonment and \neven death. It was a mechanism used by the Parliament to check \nabsolutism and to establish the supremacy of the Parliament. Through \nimpeachment, Parliament acted to curb the abuses of exalted persons who \nwould otherwise have free reign. Impeachment was used by the Parliament \nto punish a wide range of offenses: misapplication of funds; abuse of \nofficial power; neglect of duty; corruption; encroachment on the \nprerogatives of the Parliament; and giving harmful advice to the Crown. \nIn the English practice, ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' included all \nof these.\n  During the impeachment of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield in 1725, \nSerjeant Pengelly summed up the purpose of impeachment. It was, he \nsaid,\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\nfor the ``punishment of offenses of a public nature which may affect \nthe nation.'' He went on to say that impeachment was also for use in \n``instances where the inferior courts have no power to punish the \ncrimes committed by ordinary rules of justice . . . or in cases . . . \nwhere the person offending is by his degree raised above the \napprehension of danger from a prosecution carried on in the usual \ncourse of justice; and whose exalted station requires the united \naccusation of all the Commons.''\n  In the case of Warren Hastings--which was proceeding at the time the \nConstitution was framed--Edmund Burke described the impeachment process \nas ``. . . a grave and important proceeding essential to the \nestablishment of the national character for justice and equity.''\n  As the British legal historian Holdsworth has written, the \nimpeachment process was a mechanism in service of the ``ideal . . . \n[of] government in accordance with law.'' It was a means by which ``the \ngreatest ministers of state could be made responsible, like humble \nofficials, to the law.'' According to Holdsworth:\n  ``. . . [T]he greatest services rendered by this procedure to the \ncause of constitutional government have been, firstly, the \nestablishment of the doctrine of ministerial responsibility to the law, \nsecondly, its application to all ministers of the crown, and thirdly \nand consequently the maintenance of the supremacy of the law over \nall.''\n  Thus the fundamental purpose of the impeachment process in England \nwas ``the maintenance of the supremacy of the law over all.'' Those who \nwere impeached and called to account for ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' were those who by their conduct threatened to undermine \nthe rule of law.\n  This English understanding of the purpose of impeachment serves as a \nbackdrop for the work of the Framers of our Constitution. Despite some \nimportant differences in the functioning of impeachment in England and \nthe United States, the fundamental purpose of impeachment remained the \nsame: defending the rule of law.\n  The records of the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention also \nshed light on the meaning of ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' and the \nunderlying purpose of the impeachment mechanism. The primary focus of \nthe relevant discussions at the Convention was on the need for some \nmeans of removing the President. Early in the proceedings with respect \nto impeachment, the Committee of the Whole agreed to make the President \nremovable ``on impeachment and conviction of malpractice or neglect of \nduty,'' although concerns were expressed that impeachment would give \nthe legislative branch undue control over the executive, and violate \nthe separation of powers.\n  In the course of the proceedings, James Madison stated that ``some \nprovision was needed to defend the community against the President if \nhe became corrupt, incapacitated, or perverted his administration into \na scheme of peculation or oppression.''\n  Arguing for a means of removing the President, George Mason said, \n``No point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment \nshould be continued. Shall any man be above Justice? Above all shall \nthat man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?''\n  Before the Convention settled on the language that was ultimately \nadopted, a proposal was considered that would have limited impeachable \noffenses to treason and bribery. An effort was made to broaden this \nproposal by including ``maladministration'' as an impeachable offense. \nMadison objected. He objected that the inclusion of a term as ``vague'' \nas maladministration would result in the President having tenure during \nthe pleasure of the Senate. As a compromise, the term \n``maladministration'' was dropped and ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' \nwas substituted. From this course of proceedings it can reasonably be \nconcluded that poor administration--at least if it does not involve \ncorrupt motives--is not a sufficient ground for impeachment.\n  In the debate concerning the Constitution in the various state \nratification conventions, the grounds for impeachment were with some \nfrequency said to include abuse or betrayal of trust and abuse of \npower. ``Making a bad treaty'' was also frequently mentioned as \njustifying impeachment. At the Virginia Convention, Governor Randolph \nspoke of ``misbehavior'' and ``dishonesty,'' and James Madison gave two \nexamples of impeachable conduct: pardoning a criminal with whom the \nPresident was in collusion, and summoning only a few Senators to \napprove a treaty.\n\n  One of the most extensive recorded discussions of impeachment \noccurred at the North Carolina ratification convention in remarks made \nby James Iredell. Iredell, who later served as a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt, spoke of the supremacy of the law under the system of government \nproposed by the Constitution. He said:\n\n       No man has an authority to injure another with impunity. No \n     man is better than his fellow-citizens, nor can pretend to \n     any superiority over the meanest man in the country. If the \n     President does a single act, by which the people are \n     prejudiced, he is punishable himself. . . . If he commits any \n     misdemeanor in office, he is impeachable . . .\n\n  Iredell also expressed the view that impeachment may be used only in \ncases where there is some corrupt motive. He said:\n\n       . . . [W]hen any man is impeached, it must be for an error \n     of the heart, and not of the head. . . . Whatever mistake a \n     man may make, he ought not to be punished for it, nor his \n     posterity rendered infamous. But if a man be a villain, and \n     wilfully abuse his trust, he is to be held up as a public \n     offender, and ignominiously punished. . . . According to \n     these principles, I suppose the only instances in which the \n     President would be liable to impeachment, would be where he \n     had received a bribe, or acted from some corrupt motive or \n     other.\n\n  Iredell's comments buttress the view that impeachment is not to be \nused as a political weapon to resolve differences of policy between the \nlegislative branch and the executive branch. Impeachment is not an \nappropriate remedy for errors--even serious errors--in the \nadministration of government.\n  To justify impeachment, there must be ``some corrupt motive,'' a \nwillful ``abuse of trust,'' an ``error of the heart.'' You will note \nthere is nothing in Iredell's comments to suggest that a President who \nengaged in a corrupt course of conduct by obstructing justice and \ncommitting perjury would be immune from impeachment and removal.\n  Another major discussion of impeachment during the debate over \nratification occurs in the Federalist number 65, to which reference has \nalready been made in those proceedings, where Alexander Hamilton \ndescribes the impeachment process as ``a method of national inquest \ninto the conduct of public men'' and discusses the powers of the Senate \n``in their judicial character as a court for the trial of \nimpeachments.''\n  Now, before I discuss his views of impeachment, I would like to say a \nword in defense of Alexander Hamilton--who is a widely acknowledged \nchampion of our Constitution, widely acknowledged as one of the most \neloquent expositors and defenders of the Constitution. Unfortunately, \nthe reputation of Hamilton has in recent days been traduced. It is \nunjust to the memory of this great man to compare his personal sins \nwith the crimes of President Clinton. When Hamilton was questioned \nabout his affair he told the truth. He took responsibility for his \nconduct. There is no evidence that he ever engaged in acts of \ncorruption. He never lied under oath. He never obstructed justice. \nNotwithstanding the efforts of his lawyers, President Clinton by no \nmeans benefits from a comparison with Hamilton.\n  In the Federalist Hamilton writes of the Senate:\n\n       The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which \n     proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words \n     from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of \n     a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated \n     political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done \n     immediately to the society itself.\n\n  Hamilton recognized that the focus of the impeachment power is on the \n``misconduct of public men'' or the ``abuse or violation of some public \ntrust.'' Impeachment is a remedy against officials for ``injuries done \n. . . to the society itself.''\n  Despite the claims of the President's lawyers, the comments of \nHamilton do not support the view that a President can be impeached and \nremoved only for an abuse of power. The ``misconduct of public men,'' \nand ``the abuse or violation of some public trust'' to which\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\nHamilton refers are not restricted to offenses involving the misuse of \nofficial power. The ``misconduct of public men'' encompasses a whole \nrange of wrongful deeds committed by those who hold office when those \noffenses are committed. The ``public trust'' is violated whenever a \npublic officer breaches any duty he has to the public. ``Injuries done \n. . . to the society itself'' similarly may occur as the result of \nmisconduct that does not involve the misuse of the powers of office.\n  Now, I would submit to the Senate that the English precedents, the \nrecords of the Constitutional Convention debates, and the general \nprinciples set forth by Hamilton, Iredell, and others in the debate \nover ratification do not provide a definitive list of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. But they do provide broad guidance concerning the scope \nof the impeachment power. The theme running through all these \nbackground sources is that the impeachment process is designed to \nprovide a remedy for the corrupt and lawless acts of public officials.\n  Not surprisingly, those who have been on the receiving end of \nimpeachment proceedings have been quick to argue for a restrictive \nmeaning of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' President Clinton's \nlawyers follow in that well-established tradition.\n  They attempt to minimize the significance of the charges of perjury \nand obstruction of justice against the President. In essence, they \nargue that treason and bribery are the prototypical high crimes and \nmisdemeanors, and that the crimes charged against the President are \ninsufficiently similar in both their nature and seriousness to treason \nand bribery.\n  But, as the comments of my fellow manager, Mr. Buyer, have made \nclear, the crimes set forth in the articles of impeachment are indeed \nserious offenses against our system of justice. They were certainly \nviewed as serious offenses by those who drafted and ratified the \nConstitution.\n  As Mr. Buyer has mentioned, in his discussion of ``offenses against \nthe public justice,'' Sir William Blackstone--whose work James Madison \nsaid was in ``every man's hand'' during the creation of the \nConstitution--listed the offenses of perjury and bribery side-by-side, \nimmediately after he listed treason. In 1790, the First Congress \nadopted a statute entitled ``An Act for the punishment of certain \ncrimes against the United States'' making perjury a crime punishable as \na felony. Nothing could be clearer: perjury is a crime against the \nUnited States; it is not a private matter.\n  As Mr. Chabot noted yesterday, John Jay, the first Chief Justice of \nthe United States, said that ``there is no crime more extensively \npernicious to Society'' than perjury. According to Jay, perjury \n``discolors and poisons the Streams of Justice, and by substituting \nFalsehood for Truth, saps the Foundations of personal and public \nRights. . . . [I]f oaths should cease to be held sacred, our dearest \nand most valuable Rights would become insecure.'' Given this \nunderstanding that was current at the time the Constitution was \nadopted, it is impossible to support the conclusion that perjury and \nthe related offense of obstruction of justice are somehow trivial \noffenses that do not rise to the same level as the offense of bribery \nwhich is enumerated in the Constitution.\n  Moreover, perjury and obstruction of justice are by their very nature \nakin to bribery. When the crime of bribery is committed, money is given \nand received to corruptly alter the course of official action. When \njustice is obstructed, action is undertaken to corruptly thwart the due \nadministration of justice. When perjury occurs, false testimony is \ngiven in order to deceive judges and juries and to prevent the just \ndetermination of causes pending in the courts. The fundamental purpose \nand the fundamental effect of each of these offenses--perjury, \nobstruction of justice and bribery alike--is to defeat the proper \nadministration of government. They all are crimes of corruption aimed \nat substituting private advantage for the public interest. They all \nundermine the integrity of the functions of government.\n  The use of the impeachment process against misconduct which \nundermines the integrity of government is a central focus of two \nreports prepared in 1974 on the background and history of impeachment, \nand I would humbly bring these reports to your attention. I commend \nthem to you for your consideration. One of the reports was prepared by \nthe staff of the Nixon impeachment inquiry. The other was produced by \nthe Bar of the City of New York. Both of these reports have gained \nbipartisan respect over the last 25 years for their balanced and \njudicious approach. They provide a well-informed analysis of the key \nissues related to impeachments. In doing so they stand in stark \ncontrast to the recent pronouncements by some academics which \nsubstitute political opinion for scholarly analysis.\n  A review of these two important documents from 1974 supports the \nconclusion that the articles before the Senate set forth compelling \ngrounds for the conviction and removal of President Clinton.\n  There has been a great deal of comment on the report on \n``Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment'' prepared in \nFebruary 1974 by the staff of the Nixon impeachment inquiry. Those who \nassert that the charges against the President do not rise to the level \nof ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' have pulled some phrases from that \nreport out of context to support their position. In fact, the general \nprinciples concerning grounds for impeachment and removal set forth in \nthat report indicate that perjury and obstruction of justice are high \ncrimes and misdemeanors.\n\n  Consider this key language from the staff report describing the type \nof conduct which gives rise to the proper use of the impeachment and \nremoval power:\n  In the report, they said:\n\n       The emphasis has been on the significant effects of the \n     conduct--undermining the integrity of office, disregard of \n     constitutional duties and oath of office, arrogation of \n     power, abuse of the governmental process, adverse impact on \n     the system of government.\n\n  The report goes on to state:\n\n       Because impeachment of a President is a grave step for the \n     nation, it is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously \n     incompatible with either the constitutional form and \n     principles of our government or the proper performance of \n     constitutional duties of the presidential office.\n\n  Perjury and obstruction of justice, I submit to you, clearly \n``undermine the integrity of office.'' I ask you, if these offenses do \nnot undermine the integrity of office, what offenses would?\n  Their unavoidable consequence is to erode respect for the office of \nthe President and to interfere with the integrity of the administration \nof justice. Such offenses are ``seriously incompatible'' with the \nPresident's ``constitutional duties and oath of office,'' and with the \nprinciples of our government establishing the rule of law. Moreover, \nthey are offenses which have a direct and serious ``adverse impact on \nthe system of government.'' Obstruction of justice is by definition an \nassault on the due administration of justice--which is a core function \nof our system of government. Perjury has the same purpose and effect.\n  The second report, to which I have referred, the thoughtful report on \n``The Law of Presidential Impeachment'' prepared by the Association of \nthe Bar of the City of New York in January of 1974 also places a great \ndeal of emphasis on the corrosive impact of presidential misconduct on \nthe integrity of government. The report summarizes the proper basis for \nimpeachment and removal in this way. It says:\n\n       It is our conclusion, in summary, that the grounds for \n     impeachment are not limited to or synonymous with crimes. . . \n     . Rather, we believe that acts which undermine the integrity \n     of government are appropriate grounds whether or not they \n     happen to constitute offenses under the general criminal law. \n     In our view, the essential nexus to damaging the integrity of \n     government may be found in acts which constitute corruption \n     in, or flagrant abuse of the powers of, official position. It \n     may also be found in acts which, without directly affecting \n     governmental processes, undermine that degree of public \n     confidence in the probity of executive and judicial officers \n     that is essential to the effectiveness of government in a \n     free society.\n\n  Perjury and obstruction of justice--serious felony offenses against \nthe United States--by a President are acts of corruption which without \ndoubt ``undermine that degree of public confidence in the probity of \nthe [the President] that is essential to the effectiveness of \ngovernment in a free society.''\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nSuch acts are ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' because they inevitably \nsubvert the respect for law which is essential to the well-being of our \nconstitutional system.\n  A similar point is made by a contemporary commentator who has argued:\n\n       . . . [T]here are certain statutory crimes that, if \n     committed by public officials, reflect such lapses of \n     judgment, such disregard for the welfare of the state, and \n     such lack of respect for the law and the office held that the \n     occupants may be impeached and removed, for lacking the \n     minimal level of integrity and judgment sufficient to \n     discharge the responsibilities of office.\n\n  Such a lack of the minimal level of integrity necessary for the \nproper discharge of the duties of the Presidency is evidenced by the \ncommission of the statutory crimes of perjury and obstruction of \njustice.\n  Contrary to the claim that has been made by some, the issue before \nthe Senate is not whether the offenses of this President will destroy \nour Constitution. We all know that our system of government will not \ncome tumbling down because of the corrupt conduct of William Jefferson \nClinton. Our Republic will survive the crimes of this President. No one \ndoubts that. Of course, the same could be said of all the other federal \nofficials who have been impeached and removed from office. And the same \nmight be said of the crimes--serious as they were--of President Richard \nNixon.\n  But the removal power is not restricted to offenses that would \ndirectly destroy our Constitution or system of government. The removal \npower is not so limited that it can be brought into play only when the \nimmediate destruction of our institutions is threatened.\n  On the contrary, the removal power should be understood as a positive \ngrant of authority to the Senate to preserve, protect and strengthen \nour constitutional system against the misconduct of federal officials \nwhen that misconduct would subvert, undermine, or weaken the \ninstitutions of our government. It is a power that has the positive \npurpose of maintaining the health and well-being of our system of \ngovernment.\n  This power--the awesome power of removal vested in the Senate--\ncarries with it an awesome responsibility. This power imposes on the \nSenate the responsibility to exercise its judgment in establishing the \nstandards of conduct that are necessary to preserve, protect, and \nstrengthen the Constitution which has served the people of the United \nStates so well for more than two centuries.\n  Thus, the crucial issue before the Senate is what standard will be \nset for the conduct of the President of the United States. In this \ncase, the Senate necessarily will establish such a standard. And make \nno mistake about it: the choice the Senate makes in this case will have \nconsequences reverberating far into the future of our Republic. Will a \nPresident who has committed serious offenses against the system of \njustice be called to account for his crimes, or will his offenses be \nregarded as of no constitutional consequence? Will a standard be \nestablished that such crimes by a President will not be tolerated, or \nwill the standard be that--at least in some cases--a President may \n``remain in office with all his infamy'' after lying under oath and \nobstructing justice?\n  Regardless of the choice the Senate makes--whether it acquits or \nconvicts the President--a standard will be established, and that \nstandard will become an important part of our constitutional law of \nthis Nation. The institutions of our Government will either be \nstrengthened or weakened as a result. And if the Senate acquits this \nPresident, the conduct of future Presidents will inevitably be affected \nin ways that we cannot now confidently predict.\n  I would now like to take a very few minutes to examine some of the \nother specific arguments that have been made that this is not a proper \ncase for use of the removal power.\n  Some have suggested that in setting a standard in this case the \nSenate should be guided by the popularity of the President. It is urged \nthat a popular President--regardless of the offenses he may have \ncommitted--should not be removed from office. Such a view finds no \nsupport however, in our Constitution. On the contrary, the framers \nunderstood that a popular President might be guilty of crimes requiring \nhis removal from office.\n  That is why they included the power of impeachment and removal in the \nConstitution. And that, no doubt, is why they specifically provided \nthat an impeached official who was convicted and removed might also be \nperpetually disqualified ``to hold and enjoy any office of honor, \ntrust, or profit under the United States.''\n  The potential threat posed to our institutions by Presidential \nmisconduct would, in fact, be heightened by the popularity of the \noffending President. The harmful influence and example of a popular \nPresident would pose a far greater danger to the well-being of our \nGovernment than the influence and example of an unpopular President.\n  Moreover, the very framework of our Constitution establishing a \nrepresentative democracy is at odds with the notion that the \ninstitutions of our Government should respond mechanically to the \nchanging tides of public opinion. The Senate, in particular, was \ndesigned to act on the basis of the long-term best interests of the \nNation rather than short-term political considerations.\n  When he was tried by the Senate 130 years ago, President Andrew \nJohnson was overwhelmingly unpopular. If the Senate had used \nPresidential popularity as a guide in the Johnson case, there is no \ndoubt that he would have been convicted and removed from office. Yet \ntoday there is widespread agreement that such action by the Senate \nwould have been an abuse of the constitutional process, and those who \nrefused to use Presidential popularity as their guide are hailed as \ngreat statesmen and heroes. Those Senators who then stood against the \ntide of public sentiment today are revered as champions of \nconstitutional government.\n  A popular President guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors should no \nmore remain in office than an unpopular President innocent of \nwrongdoing should be removed from office. Under the standards of the \nConstitution, popularity is not a sufficient guide.\n  Nor should the Senate be swayed by the claims that setting a standard \nadverse to this President will weaken the institution of the \nPresidency. Describing the role of impeachment under our Constitution, \nArthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.--who I will candidly admit takes a different \nview of the matter today--wisely observed that:\n\n       The genius of impeachment lay in the fact that it could \n     punish the man without punishing the office. For, in the \n     Presidency as elsewhere, power was ambiguous: the power to do \n     good meant also the power to do harm, the power to serve the \n     republic also the power to demean and defile it.\n\n  Rather than weakening the Presidency, the removal from office of a \nPresident who has violated his constitutional duty and oath of office \nwill reestablish the integrity of the Presidency. Setting a standard \nagainst the acts of perjury and obstruction of justice committed by \nPresident Clinton will reaffirm the dignity and the honor of the office \nof Chief Executive under our Constitution. That will strengthen--not \nweaken--the institution of the Presidency.\n  It has even been argued that the impeachment and removal of President \nClinton would result in the virtual alteration of our system of \ngovernment. It is contended that following the constitutional process \nin this case would move us toward a transformation of our Constitution: \na quasi-parliamentary system, with the President serving at the \npleasure of the  legislative branch, would replace the framework based \non the separation of powers.\n\n  I am, frankly, reluctant to dignify this argument by responding to \nit. President Nixon was driven from office for his crimes under threat \nof impeachment and removal. The disruption of the framework of our \nGovernment did not ensue. President Clinton may be removed from office \nfor his crimes. The constitutional system will remain sound.\n  Who has so little confidence in the durability of the institutions of \nour Government that he would allow a President guilty of perjury and \nobstruction of justice to remain in office simply on the basis of a \nfanciful and irrational fear of the supposed consequences of his \nremoval?\n  The Constitution contains wise safeguards against the misuse of the \nimpeachment and removal power. As a\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\npractical matter, as we all know, the requirement of a two-thirds vote \nfor conviction virtually ensures that a President will only be removed \nwhen a compelling case for removal has been made. And the periodic \naccountability to the people of Members of both the House and the \nSenate serves as a check on the improvident use of the impeachment \npower for unworthy or insubstantial reasons. Those who would abuse the \npower of impeachment and removal will be deterred by the certain \nknowledge that they ultimately must answer to the people.\n  But, of course, the ultimate safeguard against the abuse of this \npower is in the sober deliberation and sound judgment of the Senate \nitself. The framers of the Constitution vested the removal power and \nresponsibility in the Senate because, as Hamilton observed, they \n``thought the Senate the most fit depositary of this important trust.'' \nThe Senate was, in the view of the framers, uniquely qualified to \nexercise the ``awful discretion, which a court of impeachment must \nnecessarily have.'' As Hamilton explained:\n\n       Where else, than in the Senate could have been found a \n     tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? \n     What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in \n     its own situation, to preserve unawed and uninfluenced the \n     necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the \n     representatives of the people, his accusers.\n\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, this is the great trust which the \nConstitution has reposed in you. It is a trust you exercise not only \nfor those who elected you but for all other Americans, including \ngenerations yet unborn.\n  As you carry out this trust, we do not suggest that you hold this \nPresident or any President to a standard of perfection. We do not \nassert that this President or any President be called to account before \nthe Senate for his personal failings or his sins. We will leave the \nPresident's sins to his family and to God. Nor do we suggest that this \nPresident or any President should be removed from office for offenses \nthat are not serious and grave.\n  But we do submit that when this President, or any President, has \ncommitted serious offenses against the system of justice--offenses \ninvolving the stubborn and calculated choice to place personal interest \nahead of the public interest--he must not be allowed to act with \nimpunity.\n  Mr. Manager Graham has reviewed the recent precedents of the Senate, \nestablishing that offenses such as those committed by this President \nare grounds for removal from office. Those precedents, which were set \nin the impeachment trials of Federal judges, are rejected as totally \nirrelevant by the President's lawyers. They urge that a lower standard \nof integrity be established in this case for the President of the \nUnited States than the standard which the Senate has already \nestablished for Federal judges.\n\n  But the Constitution contains a single standard for the exercise of \nthe impeachment and removal power. You have heard it before, but I will \nrepeat. Article II, section 4, provides:\n\n       The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the \n     United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\n  And there is nothing in the Constitution suggesting that criminal \noffenses which constitute high crimes and misdemeanors if committed by \none Federal official will not be high crimes and misdemeanors if \ncommitted by another Federal official. There is nothing in the \nConstitution to suggest that the President should be especially \ninsulated from the just consequences of his criminal conduct.\n  Justice Joseph Story warned long ago against countenancing ``so \nabsolute a despotism of opinion and practice, which might make that a \ncrime at one time, or in one person, which would be deemed innocent at \nanother time, or in another person.''\n  The Senate should heed the warning of Justice Story and refuse to \narbitrarily establish a different standard for judging William \nJefferson Clinton than the standard it has imposed already on others \nbrought before the bar of the Senate sitting as a Court of Impeachment.\n  The Senate has never accepted the view that a separate standard \napplies to the impeachment and removal of Federal judges. Indeed, the \nSenate has specifically rejected attempts to establish such a separate \nstandard for judicial officers. Every judge who has been impeached and \nremoved from office has been found guilty of treason, bribery, or other \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors.\n  Contrary to the argument advanced by some, the constitutional \nprovision that judges ``shall hold their offices during good \nBehaviour'' does not establish any authority to remove a judge for \nmisconduct other than for those offenses involving treason, bribery, or \nother high crimes and misdemeanors. Rather than establishing a standard \nfor removal, the ``good behavior'' clause simply provides for life \ntenure for all article III judges. To accept the ``good behavior'' \nclause, I would caution you to accept it as a separate basis for the \nremoval of Federal judges would pose a serious threat to the \nindependence of the judiciary under our Constitution.\n\n  Members of the Senate, the integrity of the administration of justice \ndepends not only on the integrity of judges, but also on the integrity \nof the President. A President who has committed perjury and obstruction \nof justice is hardly fit to oversee the enforcement of the laws of the \nUnited States. As Professor Jonathan Turley has pointed out:\n\n       As Chief Executive the President stands as the ultimate \n     authority over the Justice Department and the \n     Administration's enforcement policies. It is unclear how \n     prosecutors can legitimately threaten, let alone prosecute, \n     citizens who have committed perjury or obstruction of justice \n     under circumstances nearly identical to the President's. Such \n     inherent conflict will be even greater in the military cases \n     and the President's role as Commander-in-Chief.\n\n  It would indeed be anomalous for the Senate to now hold the President \nof the United States to a lower standard of integrity than the standard \napplied to members of the judiciary. There is no sensible \nconstitutional rationale for such a lower standard.\n  Who could successfully defend the view that in the framework \nestablished by our Constitution the integrity of the Chief Executive is \nof less importance than the integrity of any one of the hundreds of \nfederal judicial officers? It is the President who appoints Justices of \nthe Supreme Court and all other federal judges. It is the President who \nappoints the Attorney General. It is the President who appoints the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is the President \nwho has the unreviewable power to grant pardons.\n  The power of the President far surpasses the power of any other \nindividual under our Constitution. The authority and discretion vested \nin him under the Constitution and laws is great and wide-ranging. The \nrequirement that he act with integrity and that he be a person of \nintegrity is essential to the integrity of our system of government.\n  Soon after the adoption of the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton wrote \nthat ``an inviolable respect for the Constitution and the Laws'' is the \n``most sacred duty and the greatest source of security in a Republic.'' \nHamilton understood that respect for the Constitution itself grows out \nof a general respect for the law. And he understood the essential \nconnection between respect for law and the maintenance of liberty in a \nRepublic. Without respect for the law, the foundation of our \nConstitution is not secure. Without respect for the law, our freedom is \nat risk. Thus, according to Hamilton, those who ``set examples which \nundermine or subvert the authority of the laws lead us from freedom to \nslavery. . . .''\n  Early in this century, Justice Brandeis spoke of the harm to our \nsystem of government which occurs when officials of the government act \nin a lawless manner. Justice Brandeis said:\n\n       Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government \n     officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct \n     that are commands to the citizens. In a government of laws, \n     existence of the government will be imperilled if it fails to \n     observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, \n     the omnipresent teacher. For good or ill, it teaches the \n     whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the \n     Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; \n     it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites \n     anarchy.\n\n  To conclude, I would observe in the case before it now, the Senate \nmust decide if William Jefferson Clinton as President will be \n``subjected to the\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\nsame rules of conduct that are commands to the citizens.'' It is no \nanswer that he may one day after leaving office perhaps be called to \naccount in a criminal court proceeding somewhere. Justice delayed is \njustice denied. Because he has taken and violated the oath as \nPresident, William Jefferson Clinton is answerable for his crimes to \nthe Senate here and now.\n  Will he as President be vindicated by the Senate in the face of \ncrimes for which other citizens are adjudicated felons and sent to \nprison? Or will this Senate acting in accordance with the provisions of \nthe Constitution bring him as President into submission to the commands \nof the law? Will the Senate give force to the constitutional provision \nfor impeachment and removal which Justice Story said ``compels the \nchief magistrate, as well as the humblest citizen, to bend to the \nmajesty of the laws''?\n  ``For good or ill'' William Jefferson Clinton ``teaches the whole \npeople by [his] example'' as President. The President is not only the \nhead of government but also the head of State. As President he has a \nunique ability to command the attention of the whole nation. In his \nwords and his deeds he represents the American people and the system of \ngovernment in a way that no other American can. Great honor and respect \naccrue to him by virtue of the high office he holds. The influence of \nhis example is far-reaching and profound.\n  By his conduct President William Jefferson Clinton has set an example \nthe Senate cannot ignore. By his example he has set a dangerous and \nsubversive standard of conduct. His calculated and stubbornly \npersistent misconduct while serving as President of the United States \nhe has set a pernicious example of lawlessness --an example which by \nits very nature subverts respect for the law. His perverse example has \nthe inevitable effect of undermining the integrity of both the office \nof President and the administration of justice.\n  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Senate, I humbly submit to you that his \nharmful example as President must not stand. The maintenance in office \nof a President guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice is \ninconsistent with the maintenance of the rule of law.\n  In light of the historic purpose of impeachment, the offenses charged \nagainst the President demand that the Senate convict and remove him. He \nmust not ``remain in office with all his infamy.'' Our Constitution \nrequires that this President who has shown such disrespect for the \ntruth, such disrespect for the law, and such disrespect for the dignity \nof his high office be brought to justice for his high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, if there is no objection, I ask \nunanimous consent that the court of impeachment proceedings stand in \nrecess for one hour. We will return at 2:10 p.m.\n  There being no objection, at 1:08 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n2:11 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we are ready to proceed now \nwith the next manager. I believe it is Mr. Manager Gekas.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Gekas.\n  Mr. Manager GEKAS. Mr. Chief Justice, the President's counsel, \nMembers of the House who form our group of managers, and Members of the \nSenate, we bring you to what now may be the culmination of the work and \neffort of the managers and of the House of Representatives for, and \nwhat is fast closing in to be, your final consideration. And that is \ntrue--the moment of truth is fast approaching.\n  That moment of truth will swoop down on you at some point in the near \nfuture, at which time the millions of words that have been spoken thus \nfar, the thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of exhibits, and \ndozens of individuals who have been involved in the preparation, \nannotation, and accumulation of all the data and evidence--all of that \nwill be funneled into that last moment you will have right before you \ncast that final vote. That is an awesome moment in the history of this \nChamber, in the personal history of your own careers in public service, \nand of your own life, as well, your personal life, your surroundings, \nyour family, all that means anything and everything to you. That moment \nof truth encompasses all of that in one fell swoop at that final time \nthat is upon us.\n  We would not have even had to contemplate this, nor would you have \nhad to, if very early on in the factual situation that arose in this \ncase President Clinton had faced his moment of truth. As I pointed out \nyesterday, that first moment of truth that faced the President in the \nlegal proceedings that were to engulf him at a later point was his \nanswers, the answers that affixed to that first set of interrogatories \nunder oath. The moment of truth was staring him right in the face, and \nif he would have acknowledged it at that moment, had paid faith and \nallegiance to that moment, we would not be arguing here today, nor \nwould we have even heard of a possible impeachment inquiry. But the \nPresident chose to sweep away that moment of truth that was at hand and \nproceeded down the course that has led us to this moment.\n  In the words of our colleagues who made magnificent presentations of \nthe facts and law to you, the words ``truth'' and ``fairness'' were \nsome of the strongest and most profound that we heard in various \ndegrees in touching upon various subjects that were important to our \npresentation. When I heard my colleagues emphasize those words, it \ndawned on me that the element of fairness is something which I submit \nto you and certify to you that these managers, the members of the \ncommittee who prepared this case, exalted in making certain would apply \nto their endeavors and to all that we would present to you--fairness.\n  When the record of the independent counsel, the referral, reached our \ndoorsteps back in September of 1997 and we first read the details and \nallegations contained therein, we did not, as some people began to \naccuse and to orate, adopt 100 percent of what the independent counsel \nsaid were the allegations and accept them as fact, and then move on and \nskip from September to this moment, not having used our intellect, our \nsympathies, our sense of right, our sense of wrong, our sense of \nfairness, our elements of truth, our experience, our own intellect, and \nour own consciences. We didn't set all of those aside and take \nthe referral of Kenneth Starr and make that the final moment that \nprecedes your moment of truth. Everyone should know that. But it is not \nrecognized. We have been pilloried many times over the course of these \nproceedings on the notion that we simply adopted that referral and \nwalked with it into the Senate Chamber.\n\n  One thing has to be said right at the outset. When I saw one \nallegation of the independent counsel that was encompassed around the \nquestion of executive privilege, an allegation that the assertion by \nPresident Clinton of executive privilege in the context of all that had \ntranspired in this case constituted an abuse of power, I must tell you \nthat that hit me right between the eyes. I could not, by even just \nreading it, accept it at face value. From that moment until this, I had \nserious, grave doubts that we should embark upon a course in which we \nwould somehow denigrate the issue and privilege known as ``executive \nprivilege.''\n  As I worried about this and as I moved on through the process, trying \nto do my duty, along with everyone else, there came a time in the \ndeliberations of our committee, our managers group, that we felt--and \nwe acted on that feeling--that executive privilege is something that is \nowed to the President, and that we cannot fairly strip that away from \nhim or in any way diminish the power and the usability of executive \nprivilege. We felt that that was a trapping and a power of the \nExecutive, of the President of the United States, which, no matter how \nit is exerted, or thereafter possibly set aside by the court, which is \nalways a possibility, and history has shown that it has occurred.\n  Nevertheless, the exertion of it, the assertion of it, the use of it, \nthe feel for it that the President of the United States must have and \nshould have in the first instance, to assert it, should not be a part \nof our criticism, our projection of this case.\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\n  We felt pretty strongly about it, and we took action on that front by \ndeciding among ourselves that one of the proposed articles--and that \nwas bound to reach you if we had not acted as we did--we decided that \nwe were going to remove that from the allegations in any of the \narticles of impeachment and not refer to it, except in the context in \nwhich I am referring to it, which is reporting to you what happened \nwith that particular issue.\n  We did that in the face of the knowledge that in all our readings, in \nall our literature, we noted that when President Nixon attempted to use \nexecutive privilege, it was soundly criticized, and part of the \nimpeachment process carried his alleged abuse of executive privilege as \none of the tenets of that proceeding. And the report shows executive \nprivilege as being ill-used by President Nixon.\n  But here is the point. The managers and I and every Member of the \nSenate, every individual who is with us here today reveres the office \nof the Presidency. We respect the office of the Presidency. The \nPresidency is we. The Presidency is America. The Presidency is the \nbanner under which we all work and live and strive in this Nation. We \nrevere the Presidency. Any innuendo, or any kind of impulse that anyone \nhas to attribute any kind of motivation on the part of these men of \nhonor who have prepared this case for you today on any whim on their \npart other than to do their constitutional duty should be rebuffed at \nevery conversation, at every meeting, at every writing that will \nultimately flow from the proceedings that we have embarked upon. We \nrevere the Presidency. As a matter of fact, when next week we face the \nprospect of the President of the United States entering the House of \nRepresentatives to deliver his State of the Union message, we will \ngreet the President. We will accord him the respect for the office \nwhich he holds. He is our President. He occupies the Presidency. And we \nwill honor that. And so should we all.\n  But we are capable of and must, in the face of the solemn duty that \nwe have, compartmentalize in the purest sense in greeting the President \nand applauding his entrance into the State of the Union message. As we \nwill accord him that privilege, we do not set aside the impeachment \ninquiry. We do not set aside the serious charges that are hoisted \nagainst him at that juncture, because we will resume the consideration \nof them in due course. But in the meantime, we compartmentalize \nourselves as Americans recognizing that he holds the most powerful, \nmost respected, and most admired office on the face of the globe. That \nis part of our duty, as it is our duty to impart our knowledge and our \nwork, our theories, and our analysis to the impeachment proceedings \nwhich are at hand.\n  ``These are times that try men's souls,'' someone said. It was not my \nmother. And it is true. But anyone who can feel that the final votes \nthat will take place on the part of each individual Member of the \nSenate, that a vote for conviction is based on a distaste for Bill \nClinton, hatred of Bill Clinton--that kind of vote for conviction \nshould never be recognized or countenanced, and history will condemn \nany individual who does that. And if the votes at the last moment, at \nthis moment of truth, are based on an admiration of President Clinton, \nof friendship with President Clinton, a deep tie to and with the \nPresident, on family and community and national matters, a vote of \nacquittal should not be based on that. But only the Senate and each \nindividual conscience will determine how that final vote is cast.\n  We cannot account for the friendship or enmity that might exist with \nand for President Clinton. All we can do is to do the job that was \nthrust upon us, that was placed in our hands by a statute that this \nCongress created--that independent counsel statute. The Congress said \nthat we had to listen to the referral, to accept the referral. The \nCongress said that we must look towards whatever recommendations might \nbe contained in that. It was the Congress, our Congress--many of you \nwho voted for that statute--which mandated that we consider all of \nthis. We did not simply walk around one day and seize upon a moment of \ndeep thought and say let's impeach the President; let's find something \nupon which we can base a full 6 months inquiry into the President's \nactions in front of a court.\n\n  This was a duty, much as it is your duty to stay here and listen to \nwhat I am saying. The duty that I have of presenting it to you and \nspeaking to you is born of the same statute and of the same process and \nof the same constitutional background that we all share.\n  So it worries me and us that any awkward motivation would be \nattributed to any one of us or collectively to us. And once you render \nyour vote, I am not going to question whether it was done out of blind \nloyalty or enmity or friendship with the President, or enmity with the \nPresident; I am going to judge it as an American citizen, a Member of \nthe House of Representatives, a Member of Congress, an interested \ncommunity leader, and, last but not least, as a pure American citizen \neager to do one's duty.\n  As the moment of truth approaches, there is only one speaker left for \nus in the Senate Chamber here to contemplate, and that is the summation \nto be given by the esteemed chairman of our committee. You should know, \nas we all feel, that the most stringent duty that he ever performed, \nthe gentleman from Illinois, was to manage the managers. But he did \nthat just as well and as profoundly as he has approached every single \nfacet of this case. For as he sums up, know for a certainty that he \nbrings to the podium our collective thoughts, our collective emotions, \nour passions for our work and our duty, and with an eye towards serving \nyou, as we serve our constituents, as we serve the Congress, as we \nserve America. We are 20 minutes closer now to that moment of truth. \nKeep in mind your own histories, the history of your relationship with \nyour colleagues in the Congress, and above all, the duty to the United \nStates.\n  Mr. Hyde.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manager Hyde.\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, counsel for the President, \ndistinguished Members of the Senate, 136 years ago, at a small military \ncemetery in Pennsylvania, one of Illinois' most illustrious sons asked \na haunting question--whether a nation conceived in liberty and \ndedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal can long \nendure. America is an experiment never finished. It is a work in \nprogress. And so that question has to be answered by each generation \nfor itself, just as we will have to answer whether this Nation can long \nendure.\n  This controversy began with the fact that the President of the United \nStates took an oath to tell the truth in his testimony before the grand \njury, just as he had on two prior occasions sworn a solemn oath to \npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and to faithfully \nexecute the laws of the United States.\n  One of the most memorable aspects of this proceeding was the solemn \noccasion wherein every Senator in this Chamber took an oath to do \nimpartial justice under the Constitution.\n  But I must say, despite massive and relentless efforts to change the \nsubject, the case before you Senators is not about sexual misconduct, \ninfidelity or adultery--those are private acts and none of our \nbusiness. It is not even a question of lying about sex. The matter \nbefore this body is a question of lying under oath. This is a public \nact.\n  The matter before you is a question of the willful, premeditated \ndeliberate corruption of the Nation's system of justice, through \nperjury and obstruction of justice. These are public acts, and when \ncommitted by the chief law enforcement officer of the land, the one who \nappoints every United States district attorney, every Federal judge, \nevery member of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General--they do become \nthe concern of Congress.\n  That is why your judgment, respectfully, should rise above politics, \nabove partisanship, above polling data. This case is a test of whether \nwhat the Founding Fathers described as ``sacred honor'' still has \nmeaning in our time: two hundred twenty-two years after those two \nwords--sacred honor--were inscribed in our country's birth certificate, \nour national charter of freedom, our Declaration of Independence.\n  Every school child in the United States has an intuitive sense of the \n``sacred honor'' that is one of the foundation stones of the American \nhouse of freedom. For every day, in every classroom in America, our \nchildren and\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\ngrandchildren pledge allegiance to a nation, ``under God.'' That \nstatement, is not a prideful or arrogant claim. It is a statement of \nhumility: all of us, as individuals, stand under the judgment of God, \nor the transcendent truths by which we hope, finally, to be judged.\n  So does our country.\n  The Presidency is an office of trust. Every public office is a public \ntrust, but the Office of President is a very special public trust. The \nPresident is the trustee of the national conscience. No one owns the \nOffice of President, the people do. The President is elected by the \npeople and their representatives in the electoral college. And in \naccepting the burdens of that great office, the President, in his \ninaugural oath, enters into a covenant--a binding agreement of mutual \ntrust and obligation--with the American people.\n  Shortly after his election and during his first months in office, \nPresident Clinton spoke with some frequency about a ``new covenant'' in \nAmerica. In this instance, let us take the President at his word: that \nhis office is a covenant--a solemn pact of mutual trust and \nobligation--with the American people. Let us take the President \nseriously when he speaks of covenants: because a covenant is about \npromise-making and promise-keeping. For it is because the President has \ndefaulted on the promises he made--it is because he has violated the \noaths he has sworn--that he has been impeached.\n\n  The debate about impeachment during the Constitutional Convention of \n1787 makes it clear that the Framers of the Constitution regarded \nimpeachment and removal from office on conviction as a remedy for a \nfundamental betrayal of trust by the President. The Framers had \ninvested the Presidential office with great powers. They knew that \nthose powers could be--and would be--abused if any President were to \nviolate, in a fundamental way, the oath he had sworn to faithfully \nexecute the Nation's laws.\n  For if the President did so violate his oath of office, the covenant \nof trust between himself and the American people would be broken.\n  Today, we see something else: that the fundamental trust between \nAmerica and the world can be broken, if a Presidential Perjurer \nrepresents our country in world affairs. If the President calculatedly \nand repeatedly violates his oath, if the President breaks the covenant \nof trust he has made with the American people, he can no longer be \ntrusted. And, because the executive plays so large a role in \nrepresenting the country to the world, America can no longer be \ntrusted.\n  It is often said that we live in an age of increasing \ninterdependence. If that is true, and the evidence for it is all around \nus, then the future will require an even stronger bond of trust between \nthe President and the Nation: because with increasing interdependence \ncomes an increased necessity of trust.\n  This is one of the basic lessons of life. Parents and children know \nthis. Husbands and wives know it. Teachers and students know it, as do \ndoctors and patients, suppliers and customers, lawyers and clients, \nclergy and parishioners: the greater the interdependence, the greater \nthe necessity of trust; the greater the interdependence, the greater \nthe imperative of promise-keeping.\n  Trust, not what James Madison called the ``parchment barriers'' of \nlaws, is the fundamental bond between the people and their elected \nrepresentatives, between those who govern and those who are governed. \nTrust is the mortar that secures the foundations of the American house \nof freedom. And the Senate of the United States, sitting in judgment in \nthis impeachment trial, should not ignore, or minimize, or dismiss the \nfact that the bond of trust has been broken, because the President has \nviolated both his oaths of office and the oath he took before his grand \njury testimony.\n  In recent months, it has often been asked--so what? What is the harm \ndone by this lying under oath, by this perjury? Well, what is an oath? \nAn oath is an asking almighty God to witness to the truth of what you \nare saying. Truth telling--truth telling is the heart and soul of our \njustice system.\n  I think the answer would have been clear to those who once pledged \ntheir sacred honor to the cause of liberty. The answer would have been \nclear to those who crafted the world's most enduring written \nconstitution.\n  No greater harm can be done than breaking the covenant of trust \nbetween the President and the people; among the three branches of our \ngovernment; and between the country and the world.\n  For to break that covenant of trust is to dissolve the mortar that \nbinds the foundation stones of our freedom into a secure and solid \nedifice. And to break that covenant of trust by violating one's oath is \nto do grave damage to the rule of law among us.\n  That none of us is above the law is a bedrock principle of democracy. \nTo erode that bedrock is to risk even further injustice. To erode that \nbedrock is to subscribe, to a ``divine right of kings'' theory of \ngovernance, in which those who govern are absolved from adhering to the \nbasic moral standards to which the governed are accountable. We must \nnever tolerate one law for the ruler, and another for the ruled. If we \ndo, we break faith with our ancestors from Bunker Hill, Lexington and \nConcord to Flanders Field, Normandy, Iwo Jima, Panmunjom, Saigon and \nDesert Storm.\n  Let us be clear: The vote that you are asked to cast is, in the final \nanalysis, a vote about the rule of law.\n  The rule of law is one of the great achievements of our civilization. \nFor the alternative to the rule of law is the rule of raw power. We \nhere today are the heirs of three thousand years of history in which \nhumanity slowly, painfully and at great cost, evolved a form of \npolitics in which law, not brute force, is the arbiter of our public \ndestinies.\n  We are the heirs of the Ten Commandments and the Mosaic law: a moral \ncode for a free people who, having been liberated from bondage, saw in \nlaw a means to avoid falling back into the habit of slaves. We are the \nheirs of Roman law: the first legal system by which peoples of \ndifferent cultures, languages, races, and religions came to live \ntogether in a form of political community. We are the heirs of the \nMagna Carta, by which the freeman of England began to break the \narbitrary and unchecked power of royal absolutism. We are the heirs of \na long tradition of parliamentary development, in which the rule of law \ngradually came to replace royal prerogative as the means for governing \na society of free men and women. Yes, we are the heirs of 1776, and of \nan epic moment in human affairs when the founders of this Republic \npledged their lives, fortunes and, yes, their sacred honor, to the \ndefense of the rule of law. We are the heirs of a tragic civil war, \nwhich vindicated the rule of law over the appetites of some for owning \nothers. We are the heirs of the 20th century's great struggles against \ntotalitarianism, in which the rule of law was defended at immense cost \nagainst the worst tyrannies in human history. The ``rule of law'' is no \npious aspiration from a civics textbook. The rule of law is what stands \nbetween all of us and the arbitrary exercise of power by the state. The \nrule of law is the safeguard of our liberties. The rule of law is what \nallows us to live our freedom in ways that honor the freedom of others \nwhile strengthening the common good.\n  Lying under oath is an abuse of freedom. Obstruction of justice is a \ndegradation of law. There are people in prison for just such offenses. \nWhat in the world do we say to them about equal justice if we overlook \nthis conduct in the President?\n  Some may say, as many have said in recent months, that this is to \npitch the matter too high. The President's lie, it is said, was about a \n``trivial matter;'' it was a lie to spare embarrassment about \nmisconduct on a ``private occasion.''\n  The confusing of what is essentially a private matter, and none of \nour business, with lying under oath to a court and a grand jury has \nbeen only one of the distractions we have had to deal with.\n  Senators, as men and women with a serious experience of public \naffairs, we can all imagine, a situation in which a President might \nshade the truth when a great issue of the national interest or the \nnational security was at stake. We have all been over that terrain. We \nknow the thin ice on which any of us skates when blurring the edges of \nthe truth for what we consider a compelling, demanding public purpose.\n  Morally serious men and women can imagine circumstances, at the far \nedge of the morally permissible, when, with the gravest matters of \nnational interest at stake, a President could shade the truth in order \nto serve the common\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\ngood. But under oath, for a private pleasure?\n  In doing this, the Office of President of the United States has been \ndebased and the justice system jeopardized.\n  In doing this, he has broken his covenant of trust with the American \npeople.\n  The framers also knew that the Office of President of the United \nStates could be gravely damaged if it continued to be unworthily \noccupied. That is why they devised the process of impeachment by the \nHouse and trial by the Senate. It is, in truth, a direct process. If, \non impeachment, the President is convicted, he is removed from office--\nand the office itself suffers no permanent damage. If, on impeachment, \nthe President is acquitted, the issue is resolved once and for all, and \nthe office is similarly protected from permanent damage.\n  But if, on impeachment, the President is not convicted and removed \nfrom office despite the fact that numerous Senators are convinced that \nhe has, in the words of one proposed resolution of censure, \n``egregiously failed'' the test of his oath of office, ``violated the \ntrust of the American people,'' and ``dishonored the office which they \nentrusted to him,'' then the Office of the Presidency has been deeply, \nand perhaps permanently damaged.\n  And that is a further reason why President Clinton must be convicted \nof the charges brought before you by the House and removed from office. \nTo fail to do so, while conceding that the President has engaged in \negregious and dishonorable behavior that has broken the covenant of \ntrust between himself and the American people, is to diminish the \nOffice of President of the United States in an unprecedented and \nunacceptable way.\n  Senators, please permit me a word on my own behalf and on behalf of \nmy colleagues of the House. It is necessary to clarify an important \npoint.\n  None of us comes to this Chamber today without a profound sense of \nour own responsibilities in life, and of the many ways in which we have \nfailed to meet those responsibilities, to one degree or another. None \nof us comes before you claiming to be a perfect man or a perfect \ncitizen, just as none of you imagines yourself perfect. All of us, \nMembers of the House and Senate, know that we come to this difficult \ntask as flawed human beings, under judgment.\n  That is the way of this world: flawed human beings must, according to \nthe rule of law, judge other flawed human beings.\n  But the issue before the Senate of the United States is not the \nquestion of its own Members' personal moral condition. Nor is the issue \nbefore the Senate the question of the personal moral condition of the \nmembers of the House of Representatives. The issue here is whether the \nPresident has violated the rule of law and thereby broken his covenant \nof trust with the American people. This is a public issue, involving \nthe gravest matter of the public interest. And it is not effected, one \nway or another, by the personal moral condition of any member of either \nHouse of Congress, or by whatever expressions of personal chagrin the \nPresident has managed to express.\n\n  Senators, we of the House do not come before you today lightly. And, \nif you will permit me, it is a disservice to the House to suggest that \nit has brought these articles of impeachment before you in a mean-\nspirited or irresponsible way. That is not true.\n  We have brought these articles of impeachment because we are \nconvinced, in conscience, that the President of the United States lied \nunder oath; that the President committed perjury on several occasions \nbefore a Federal grand jury. We have brought these articles of \nimpeachment because we are convinced, in conscience, that the President \nwillfully obstructed justice and thereby threatened the legal system he \nswore a solemn oath to protect and defend.\n  These are not trivial matters. These are not partisan matters. These \nare matters of justice, the justice that each of you has taken a solemn \noath to serve in this trial.\n  Some of us have been called ``Clinton-haters.'' I must tell you, \ndistinguished Senators, that this impeachment is not, for those of us \nfrom the House, a question of hating anyone. This is not a question of \nwho we hate. It is a question of what we love. And among the things we \nlove are the rule of law, equal justice before the law, and honor in \nour public life. All of us are trying as hard as we can to do our duty \nas we see it--no more and no less.\n  Senators, this trial is being watched around the world. Some of those \nwatching, thinking themselves superior in their cynicism, wonder what \nit is all about. But others know.\n  Political prisoners know that this is about the rule of law--the \ngreat alternative to arbitrary and unchecked state power.\n  The families of executed dissidents know that this is about the rule \nof law--the great alternative to the lethal abuse of power by the \nstate.\n  Those yearning for freedom know that this is about the rule of law--\nthe hard-won structure by which men and women can live by their God-\ngiven dignity and secure their God-given rights in ways that serve the \ncommon good.\n  If they know this, can we not know it?\n  If, across the river in Arlington Cemetery, there are American heroes \nwho died in defense of the rule of law, can we give less than the full \nmeasure of our devotion to that great cause?\n  I wish to read you a letter I recently received that expresses my \nfeelings far better than my poor words:\n\n       Dear Chairman Hyde: My name is William Preston Summers. How \n     are you doing? I am a third grader in room 504 at Chase \n     elementary School in Chicago. I am writing this letter \n     because I have something to tell you. I have thought of a \n     punishment for the president of the United states of America. \n     The punishment should be that he should write a 100 word \n     essay by hand. I have to write an essay when I lie. It is bad \n     to lie because it just gets you in more trouble. I hate \n     getting in trouble.\n       It is just like the boy who cried wolf, and the wolf ate \n     the boy. It is important to tell the truth. I like to tell \n     the truth because it gets you in less trouble. If you do not \n     tell the truth people do not believe you.\n       It is important to believe the president because he is a \n     important person. If you can not believe the president who \n     can you believe. If you have to no one believe in then how do \n     you run your life. I do not believe the president tells the \n     truth anymore right now. After he writes the essay and tells \n     the truth, I will believe him again.\n                                                  William Summers.\n\n  Then there is a P.S. from his dad:\n\n       Dear Representative Hyde: I made my son William either \n     write you a letter or an essay as a punishment for lying. \n     Part of his defense for his lying was the President lied. He \n     is still having difficulty understanding why the President \n     can lie and not be punished.\n                                                    Bobby Summers.\n\n  Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, on June 6, 1994, it was the 50th \nanniversary of the Americans landing at Normandy. I went ashore at \nNormandy, walked up to the cemetery area, where as far as the eye could \nsee there were white crosses, Stars of David. And the British had a \nbagpipe band scattered among the crucifixes, the crosses, playing \n``Amazing Grace'' with that peaceful, mournful sound that only the \nbagpipe can make. If you could keep your eyes dry you were better than \nI.\n  But I walked to one of these crosses marking a grave because I wanted \nto personalize the experience. I was looking for a name but there was \nno name. It said, ``Here lies in Honored Glory a Comrade in Arms Known \nbut to God.''\n  How do we keep faith with that comrade in arms? Well, go to the \nVietnam Memorial on the National Mall and press your hands against a \nfew of the 58,000 names carved into that wall, and ask yourself, How \ncan we redeem the debt we owe all those who purchased our freedom with \ntheir lives? How do we keep faith with them? I think I know. We work to \nmake this country the kind of America they were willing to die for. \nThat is an America where the idea of sacred honor still has the power \nto stir men's souls.\n  My solitary--solitary--hope is that 100 years from today people will \nlook back at what we have done and say, ``They kept the faith.''\n  I'm done.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/16/senate-section/article/S281-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S300-S301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
