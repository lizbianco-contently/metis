The Senate will now resume consideration of \nthe conference report to accompany S. 900 which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany S. 900, the Financial \n     Services Modernization Act of 1990.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before I start, since my remarks will be critical and \nhard hitting, and, I believe, will marshal considerable evidence for my \npoint of view about this financial modernization act--and I rise to \nspeak in strong opposition to S. 900--I congratulate Senator Gramm for \nhis political skill. I do not mean this in a cynical way. Cynicism is \nnot my style; it is not the way I approach public service. He has been \nvery skillful in his work, and as a Senator, I pay my respects to his \nconsiderable ability.\n  I rise in strong opposition to S. 900, the Financial Services \nModernization Act of 1999. S. 900 would aggravate a trend towards \neconomic concentration that endangers not only our economy, but also \nour democracy.\n  S. 900 would make it easier for banks, securities firms, and \ninsurance companies to merge into gigantic new conglomerates that would \ndominate the U.S. financial industry and the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. President, this is the wrong kind of modernization at the wrong \ntime. Modernization of the existing confusing patchwork of laws, \nregulations, and regulatory authorities would be a good thing, but \nthat's not what this legislation is about. S. 900 is really about \naccelerating the trend towards massive consolidation of the financial \nsector.\n  This is the wrong kind of modernization because it fails to put in \nplace adequate regulatory safeguards for these new financial giants the \nfailure of which could jeopardize the entire economy. It's the wrong \nkind of modernization because taxpayers could be stuck with the bill if \nthese conglomerates become ``too big to fail.''\n  This is the wrong kind of modernization because it fails to protect \nconsumers. It allows banks, insurance companies and brokerage houses to\n\n[[Page S13872]]\n\nshare personal information about consumers' credit history, \ninvestments, health treatments, and buying habits. It weakens \nrequirements for banks to invest in their own communities. It will \nresult in higher fees for many customers and price gouging of the \nunwary. And it will squeeze credit for small businesses and rural \nAmerica.\n  Most importantly, this is the wrong kind of modernization because it \nencourages the concentration of more and more economic power in the \nhands of fewer and fewer people. This concentration will wall off \nenormous areas of economic decision-making from any kind of democratic \ninput or accountability.\n  I don't think there's any doubt that S. 900 will set in motion a \ntidal wave of big-money mergers. That's the whole point of the bill, \nreally. The Washington Post quotes industry officials as saying that \n``the point of reform is to make it as easy as possible for financial \nservices companies to merge with one another and share customer names, \naddresses, and account data.''\n  S. 900 will prompt other banks to start courting insurance and \nsecurities firms, and it will put increasing pressure on banks of every \nsize to find new partners. According to the Post, ``Analysts say it's \nlikely to set off a spate of mergers over the next few years . . . and \nwill cause consolidation of much of the industry into a handful of \nfinancial conglomerates.''\n  Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has acknowledged that this kind of \nconsolidation poses dangers for the stability of our financial system. \nIn a speech on October 11, 1999, Mr. Greenspan said, ``We face the \nreality that the megabanks being formed by growth and consolidation are \nincreasingly complex entities that create the potential for unusually \nlarge systemic risks in the national and international economy should \nthey fail.''\n  Last week Jeffrey Garten, an investment banker who served as Under \nSecretary of Commerce in the Clinton administration, issued a similar \nwarning on the opinion page of the New York Times. ``Megabanks like \nCitigroup or the new Bank of America have become too big to fail. Were \nthey to falter, they could take the entire global financial system down \nwith them.''\n  The question we have to ask, then, is whether there's any danger that \nthese financial goliaths could actually falter. Well, if we listen to \nAlan Greenspan, maybe there is. In an October 14 speech, the Fed \nChairman warned that financial institutions may be underestimating the \nrisk of a ``sharp reversal of confidence'' in the stock market. Mr. \nGreenspan was talking about not just a ``correction'' or a ``bubble'' \nin the market, but a much deeper loss of confidence like the one that \noccurred last year after Russia defaulted on part of its debt. The \nresult could be ``panic reactions'' that cause financial markets to \n``seize up.''\n  Something doesn't add up here. If Alan Greenspan is right that we \nneed to be on guard against a ``sharp reversal of confidence'' that \ncould cause financial markets to ``seize up''; and if the Fed Chairman \nis right that financial consolidation creates the potential for \nunusually large ``systemic risks'' should these conglomerates fail; and \nif Jeffrey Garten is right that their failure could bring the entire \nglobal financial system tumbling down; then it doesn't seem to make a \nwhole lot of sense to increase those systemic risks by fostering even \nmore concentration. Yet that is precisely what S. 900 does.\n\n  The problem with S. 900 is that its regulatory reach does not match \nthe size of the new conglomerates. S. 900 does set up firewalls to \nprotect banks from failures of their insurance and securities \naffiliates. But even Alan Greenspan has admitted that these firewalls \nwould be weak. Earlier this year, economists Robert Auerbach and James \nGalbraith warned that ``the firewalls may be little more than placing \npotted plants between the desks of huge holding companies.''\n  And as the Chairwoman of the FDIC has testified, ``In times of \nstress, firewalls tend to weaken.'' Regulators will have little desire \nto stop violations of these firewalls if they think a holding company \nis ``too big to fail.'' In his New York Times article, former Under \nSecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten concluded, ``The seesaw of private \nand public power is seriously unbalanced.''\n  We seem determined to unlearn the lessons from our past mistakes. \nScores of banks failed in the Great Depression as a result of unsound \nbanking practices, and their failure only deepened the crisis. Glass-\nSteagall was intended to protect our financial system by insulating \ncommercial banking from other forms of risk. It was one of several \nstabilizers designed to keep a similar tragedy from recurring. Now \nCongress is about to repeal that stabilizer without putting any \ncomparable safeguard in its place.\n  In a stinging attack on S. 900, conservative columnist William Safire \nwrote earlier this week,\n\n       Global financiers are given the green light for ever-\n     greater concentration of power. Few remember the reason for \n     those firewalls: to curtail the spread of the sort of panic \n     from one financial segment to another that helped lead to the \n     Great Depression. But today's lust for global giantism has \n     swept aside the voices of prudence.\n\n  And what about the lessons of the Savings and Loan Crisis? The Garn-\nSt Germain Act of 1982 allowed thrifts to expand their services beyond \nbasic home loans. Only seven years later taxpayers were tapped for a \nmultibillion dollar bailout.\n  I'm afraid we're running the same kind of risks with S. 900. These \nfinancial conglomerates may well be tempted to run greater risks, \nknowing that taxpayers will come to their rescue if things go bad. In a \nletter to me earlier this week, Professor Bob Auerbach of the LBJ \nSchool wrote, ``Taxpayers should be notified that [S. 900] \nsubstantially increases their risk on the $2.8 trillion in federally \ninsured deposits for which they are liable.''\n  And what about the lessons of the Asian crisis? Just recently, the \nfinancial press was crowing about the inadequacies of Asian banking \nsystems. Now we're considering a bill that would make our banking \nsystem more like theirs. The much-maligned cozy relationships between \nAsian banks, brokers, insurance companies and commercial firms are \nprecisely the kind of ``crony capitalism'' that S. 900 would promote.\n  If we want to locate the causes of the Asian crisis, I think we have \nto look at the reckless liberalization of capital markets that led to \nunbalanced development and made these economies so vulnerable to \ninvestor panic in the first place. The IMF and other multilateral \nfinancial institutions failed to understand how dangerous and \ndestabilizing financial deregulation can be without first putting \nappropriate safeguards in place.\n  World Bank Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote last year about the \nAsian crisis: ``The rapid growth and large influx of foreign investment \ncreated economic strain. In addition, heavy foreign investment combined \nwith weak financial regulation to allow lenders in many Southeast Asian \ncountries to rapidly expand credit, often to risky borrowers, making \nthe financial system more vulnerable. Inadequate oversight, not over-\nregulation, caused these problems. Consequently, our emphasis should \nnot be on deregulation, but on finding the right regulatory regime to \nreestablish stability and confidence.'' We claim to have learned our \nlessons from the crisis in Asia, but I'm not so sure we have.\n  So why on Earth are we doing this? And why now? For whose benefit is \nthis legislation being passed? Financial services firms argue that \nconsolidation is necessary for their survival. They claim they need to \nbe as large and diversified as foreign firms in order to compete in the \nglobal marketplace. But the U.S. financial industry is already dominant \nacross the globe, and in recent years has been quite profitable. I see \nno crisis of competitiveness.\n  Financial firms also argue that consolidation will produce \nefficiencies that can be passed on to consumers. But there is little \nevidence that big mergers translate into more efficiency or better \nservice. In fact, studies by the Federal Reserve indicate just the \nopposite: there's no convincing evidence that mergers produce greater \neconomic efficiencies. On the contrary, they often lead to higher \nbanking fees and charges for small businesses, farmers, and other \ncustomers.\n  A recent Fed study showed that bigger banks tend to charge higher \nfees for ATM machines and other services. Bigger banks offer fewer \nloans for small businesses, and other Fed studies have shown that the \nconcentration of banking squeezes out community banking.\n\n[[Page S13873]]\n\n  In the long debate over passage of this legislation, there has been a \nlot of talk about the conflicting interests of bankers, insurance \ncompanies, and brokers. There has been a lot of talk about the \njurisdictional battles between the Federal Reserve and the Office of \nthe Comptroller of the Currency, the OCC. But there has been precious \nlittle discussion in this debate of the public interest.\n  What about the interests of ordinary consumers? An earlier version of \nthis legislation contained a provision to ensure that people with lower \nincomes have access to basic banking services. The problem is that \nbanking services are increasingly beyond the reach of millions of \nAmericans. According to U.S. PIRG, the average cost of a checking \naccount is $217 per year, a major obstacle for opening up a bank \naccount for lower-income families. These families have to rely, \ninstead, on usurious check cashing operations and money order services. \nNevertheless, this ``basic banking'' provision was stripped out of the \nbill.\n  I don't see very much protection for consumers in S. 900, either. \nBanks that have always offered safe, federally insured deposits will \nhave every incentive to lure their customers into riskier investments. \nLast year, for example, NationsBank paid $7 million to settle charges \nthat it misled bank customers into investing in risky bonds through a \nsecurities affiliate that it set up with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. S. \n900 makes nominal attempts to address these problems, but in the end I \nam afraid this legislation is an invitation to fraud and abuse.\n  One of the most objectionable aspects of S. 900 is the absence of \nprotection for consumer privacy. The conference report will allow the \nvarious affiliates of a financial conglomerate to share sensitive \nconfidential information about their customers.\n  William Safire writes:\n\n       As for financial privacy, [S. 900] makes your bank account \n     everyone's business. Without your consent, the private \n     information you write on your mortgage application, with your \n     tax return attached, goes to your insurance company, which \n     already has your health information, and its snoops can also \n     see your investment behavior and what you have been buying \n     with your credit card. Under [S. 900], giant financial \n     conglomerates, using other surveillance to protect against \n     fraud, will know more about your money, your habits, your \n     assets, your disease, and your genetic makeup than your \n     spouse does, and probably more than you do.\n\n  I will tell you something. It is a little disconcerting to read \ncolumns such as this about the real potential for abuse and serious \ninvasion of citizens' privacy. We need to have much, much more \ndiscussion about the implications of this bill for citizens' privacy in \nMinnesota and all across the country.\n  I am going to repeat the last part of this quote:\n\n       Under S. 900, giant financial conglomerates, using other \n     surveillance to protect against fraud, will know more about \n     your money, your habits, your assets, your diseases, and your \n     genetic makeup than your spouse does, and probably more than \n     you do.\n\n  Law Professor Joel Reidenberg of Fordham University concludes:\n\n       This is an astounding loss of privacy for the American \n     citizens.\n\n  I want to shout from the floor of the Senate that this is an \nastounding loss of privacy for American citizens.\n  The impact of S. 900 on the Community Reinvestment Act, CRA, is \nanother cause for real concern. When the Senate considered S. 900 \nearlier this year, I argued that if we were serious about modernizing \nthe financial sector of our country, we should be serious about \nmodernizing CRA along with it. There have been few financial tools \navailable to families and communities that have been as effective and \nhave had as great an impact--positive impact--as CRA. An estimated $1 \ntrillion has been reinvested in our towns and cities, thanks to this \nCRA legislation.\n\n  Under the S. 900 conference report, communities, consumers, and \npublic interest organizations will see their opportunities for public \ncomment limited. They will not have a chance to comment on mergers when \nbanks that have received a satisfactory CRA rating are applying to \nbecome financial holding companies. To me, this looks more like a \nrollback than it does modernization.\n  Finally, under the S. 900 conference report, smaller banks that \nreceive a satisfactory CRA rating will be reviewed every 4 years \ninstead of every 2. Smaller banks that receive an excellent CRA rating \nwill be reviewed every 5 years. Since an estimated 97 percent of all \nsmall banks currently receive a satisfactory or better CRA rating, S. \n900 will essentially remove the majority of banks from the regular CRA \nreview process. There are a number of reasons why banks must be \nreviewed by regulators, but it is only with regard to CRA that we are \ncutting back on the requirements for review.\n  In reality, S. 900 reflects the same priority of interests as \nfinancial consolidation itself. It offers a little something for \neverybody in the financial services industry. It is a Santa's wish list \nfor the big banks. It gives enough to securities firms and the \ninsurance industry to keep them on board. But it basically has nothing \nto offer for low-income families, nothing for rural and minority \ncommunities, and very little for consumers.\n  This should not be surprising. I don't think it is a mere coincidence \nthat finance, insurance, and real estate spend more than any other \nindustries on congressional campaigns and lobbying on Capitol Hill. \nThis is a reformer's dream issue. There is no one-to-one correlation, \nof course; their influence is felt at a systemic level. And I have \ncongratulated some of my colleagues on their political skill. But I do \nnot think it is a coincidence that the finance, insurance, and real \nestate interests spend more than any other industries on congressional \ncampaigns and on lobbying Capitol Hill. Last year, they shelled out \nmore than $200 million on lobbying activities, according to the Center \nfor Responsive Politics, and they have made more than $150 million in \ncampaign contributions since 1996.\n  As William Safire wrote on November 1:\n\n       Generous financial lobbies have persuaded our leaders that \n     in enormous size there is strength.\n\n  Generous lobbies have been making the same case in other industries \nas well, with equal success. Similar consolidation is occurring in \nagriculture, the media, entertainment, health care, airlines, \ntelecommunications, you name it. Teddy Roosevelt, where are you when we \nneed you? Who is going to take on these monopolies?\n  Who is going to call for some serious antitrust action? When are we \ngoing to be on the side of people and consumers?\n  In fact, we are witnessing the biggest wave of mergers and economic \nconcentration since the late 1800s.\n  There were 4,728 reportable mergers in 1998, compared to 3,087 in \n1993, 1,521 in 1991, and a mere 804 in 1980.\n  As Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, \npointed out, the value of last year's mergers equals the combined value \nof all mergers from 1999 to 1996--put together.\n  What is in store for us if we allow this trend to continue? Pretty \nsoon we are going to have three financial service firms in this \ncountry, four airlines, two media conglomerates, and five energy \ngiants.\n  Huge financial conglomerates the size of Citigroup will truly be \n``too big to fail.'' Government officials and Members of the Congress \nwill be prone to confuse Citigroup's interests with the public \ninterest, if they don't already.\n  What happens, for example, when one of these colossal conglomerates \ndecides it might like to turn a profit by privatizing Social Security? \nWho is going to stand in their way? That is a trick question, of \ncourse, because we already face that dilemma today. But I contend that \nthe economic concentration resulting from the passage of S. 900 would \nonly make that problem worse.\n  The bigger these financial conglomerates get, the more influence they \nhave over public policy choices. The bigger they get, the more money \nthey will have to spend on political campaigns. The bigger they get, \nthe more lobbyists they will be able to amass on Capitol Hill. And the \nbigger they get, the more weight they will carry in the media.\n  I am going to repeat that.\n  The bigger these financial conglomerates get, the more influence they \nare going to have over public policy choices. The bigger they get, the \nmore money they will have to spend on political campaigns. The bigger \nthey get, the more lobbyists they will have to amass on Capitol Hill. \nAnd the bigger\n\n[[Page S13874]]\n\nthey get, the more weight they will carry with the media.\n  It is a vicious cycle. These financial conglomerates used their \npolitical clout to shape public policy that helped them grow so big in \nthe first place. Now their overwhelming size makes it easier for them \nto dictate policies that will help them get even bigger. It is a \nvicious cycle.\n  Jeffrey Garten's remarkable October 26th column in the New York Times \ncalled attention to this problem. ``Many megacompanies may be beyond \nthe law,'' Garten said.\n\n       Their deep pockets can buy teams of lawyers that can stymie \n     prosecutors for years. And if they lose in court, they can \n     afford to pay huge fines without damaging their operations.\n       Moreover, no one should be surprised that mega-companies \n     navigate our scandalously porous campaign financing system to \n     influence tax policy, environmental standards, Social \n     Security financing, and other issues of national policy. Yes, \n     companies have always lobbied, but these huge corporations \n     often have more pull. Because there are fewer of them, their \n     influence can be more focused and, in some cases, the country \n     may be highly dependent on their survival.\n       For example, corporate giants can have enormous leverage \n     when they focus on America's foreign and trade policy. \n     Defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, itself a result of \n     a merger of two big firms, were able to exert extraordinarily \n     powerful force to influence legislation that approved \n     enlarging NATO, a move that opened up new markets for \n     American weapons sales to Poland and the Czech Republic.\n       Companies like Boeing, which not long ago acquired \n     McDonnell Douglas, have expanded their already formidable \n     influence on trade policy toward countries like China. Boeing \n     is now the only American commercial aircraft manufacturer.\n       Corporations like Exxon-Mobil will negotiate with oil-\n     producing countries almost as equals, conducting the most \n     powerful private diplomacy since the 19th century, when the \n     British East India Company wielded near-sovereign influence \n     in Asia.\n       As long as the economy remains strong, the rise of \n     corporate power with inadequate public oversight will not be \n     high on the national agenda. But sooner or later--perhaps \n     starting with the next serious economic downturn--the United \n     States will have to confront one of the great challenges of \n     our times: How does a sovereign nation govern itself \n     effectively when politics are national and business is \n     global?\n       When the answers start coming, they could be as radical and \n     as prolonged as the backlash against unbridled corporate \n     power that took place during the first 40 years of this \n     century.\n\n  Indeed, we've been through this before. At the end of the 19th \ncentury, industrial concentration accelerated at an alarming pace. \nVarious observers--including the columnist and author E.J. Dionne, \nformer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and the philosopher Michael \nSandel--have noted the similarities between that era and our own.\n  In the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Progressive Era of the \nearly 1900s, the danger of concentrated economic power was widely \nrecognized and hotly debated. And this speech on the floor of the \nSenate I give with a sense of history because I believe this will \nbecome a front-burner issue in America politics. Many Americans deeply \nbelieved that a free and democratic society could not prosper with such \nconcentration of power and inequalities of wealth. As the great Supreme \nCourt Justice Louis Brandeis said, ``We can have democracy in this \ncountry, or we can have wealth in the hands of a few. We can't have \nboth.''\n\n  The idea that concentrations of wealth, of economic power--which is \nexactly what S. 900 is all about--and of political power are unhealthy \nfor our democracy is a theme that runs throughout American history, \nfrom Thomas Jefferson to Andrew Jackson to the Progressive Era to the \nNew Deal. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson warned not only against \nconcentration of political power, but also against concentration of \neconomic power.\n  We should not, Senators, let that debate die out. That is why I come \nto the floor of the Senate today. That debate is a vital part of our \ndemocratic--with a small ``d''--heritage. It is a heritage that teaches \nus that ordinary people should have more say about the economic \ndecisions that affect their lives.\n  Weakening CRA isn't going to give them that. No amount of anti-\ngovernment rhetoric is going to give them that. But enforcing some \nmeaningful consumer protections certainly would. So would protecting \nthe privacy of sensitive personal information. And so would putting a \nstop to mergers that crowd out community banking, squeeze credit for \nsmall businesses, and open the door to higher fees and more gouging of \nconsumers.\n  A lot of banks don't like the CRA. A lot of financial service firms \ndon't want to be bothered with regulations to protect individual \nprivacy. They denounce them as ``big government'' and \n``overregulation.'' But for most people, which is the greater danger in \nthese situations--concentration of political power in the Government, \nor concentration of economic power? I don't think it is a close call.\n  When I go to the Town Talk Cafe in Willmar, MN, or any cafe in MN, \nand I talk and listen to people over a cup of coffee or two, I find \npeople have what I describe as a healthy distrust of big government, a \nhealthy distrust of overly centralized and overly bureaucratized public \npolicy.\n  I love it when people say, get us some capital, let us make things \nhappen at the neighborhood and community level. I love the idea of \nhomegrown economies. I prefer that small business people living in the \ncommunity be the ones who make the capital investment decisions that \ndetermine whether or not our communities are going to do well, rather \nthan some multinational financial services conglomerate folks halfway \nacross the world or halfway across the country making the capital \ninvestment decisions that determine whether our communities live or \ndie. I want the decisionmaking to be in the communities. I appreciate \nthat focus on local development, on more self-reliant, self-sufficient \npeople and more self-reliant, self-sufficient communities.\n  The people in the Town Talk Cafe in Willmar, or any other cafe I have \nvisited, also have a very healthy skepticism, distrust, and--I don't \nthink this is too strong a term--dislike of the concentration that is \ntaking place in the financial sector and other areas of the economy. \nThey do not like the big insurance companies. They do not like these \nbig telecommunication companies. They are still waiting, since the \ntelecommunications bill passed in 1996 and all of the mergers and \nacquisitions since then, for cable rates to go down. They are still \nwaiting for more diversity of viewpoints to be offered in the media. \nFarmers do not like the big meat packers. They don't like the big grain \ncompanies. People certainly don't like the big oil companies. With \nconsiderable justification, they certainly don't like the big banks. \nAnd with considerable justification they have reached the conclusion \nthat too much of the legislation we pass in Congress works to the \nadvantage of folks who have the capital, who have the wealth, who have \nthe access, and who have the influence.\n  And they've reached the conclusion that, as rural citizens or low-\nincome citizens or minority communities or family farmers or just \nregular plain ordinary citizens and consumers, they get the short end \nof the stick.\n  S. 900 is legislation that goes in the direction of giving more power \nto the privileged few and giving ordinary citizens less say in the \neconomic decisions that affect their lives. S. 900 is bad for \nconsumers, it is bad for low-income families, it is bad for rural \ncommunities, it creates potentially enormous risks for the economy, and \nit exposes taxpayers--please remember the S debacle--to tremendous \nliability.\n  I believe S. 900 is bad legislation that as a nation we will soon \nregret.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no time is yielded, the time will be reduced from the time of all \nSenators proportionately.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nWellstone has about 15 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 20 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have spoken to the Senator, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat time be divided between Senator Sarbanes and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes or as much time \nas I may consume.\n\n[[Page S13875]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent fellows on my \nstaff, Julie Roling and Erin Barry, be allowed the privilege of the \nfloor during the remainder of this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, when I first came to Congress in 1987, \nefforts at financial services modernization had already been undertaken \nand failed many times. Last year, we came as close as Congress has ever \ncome to achieving this critical goal. This year, as a member of the \nconference committee, I am pleased to say, we will finally accomplish \nthis historic goal.\n  That we are here is a testament to the leadership of many, many \nparticipants. Much credit goes to Chairman Leach, who tirelessly \nshepared this bill over his five years as chairman of the House Banking \nCommittee and chairman of this conference. Senator Gramm, chairman of \nthe Senate Banking Committee relentlessly promoted his agenda, yet was \nwilling to compromise on critical issues in a manner that resulted \nultimately in bipartisan support of this bill.\n  My ranking member on the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, made \ninvaluable contributions to the process. His tenaciousness, in depth \nunderstanding of the many highly complex issues, and ability to work \nwithin the caucus made this success possible. Of course, the ranking \nmember on the House Banking Committee, Representative LaFalce, and our \nfriends from the House Commerce Committee, Chairman Bliley and \nRepresentative Dingell, made critical contributions to this process as \nwell. Finally, I would note the active involvement of two Secretaries \nof the Treasury, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers. Bob has moved on to other \nthings, but the role he forged in this process has been seamlessly \nfilled by Secretary Summers.\n  There are many highlights to this bill. By eliminating the Glass-\nSteagall restrictions, we free our financial services industry to \nmaintain its place as the world leader. The benefits of one-stop \nshopping will make financial services more accessible to all Americans. \nThese reasons alone are sufficient to support this legislation. There \nare several other provisions to this bill that merit discussion, and \nthey strengthen this legislation. First, the unitary thrift loophole is \nclosed. I am pleased to have offered this critical amendment which \ncloses the loophole that permits a dangerous combination of banking and \ncommerce. While we tear down firewalls within financial services, we \nstrengthen them around financial services.\n  Under current law, commercial firms can own and operate unitary \nthrifts. That is the only breach of the banking and commerce firewalls \ncurrently allowed under our financial services law. Of course, the \nGlass-Steagall repeal and other components of this legislation will \nopen a range of financial activities to each other. However, the bill \nis carefully structured to prevent the mixing of banking and commerce. \nThis single loophole remains where banking and commerce can mix. The \nconference report does not interfere with current ownership of thrifts. \nAny commercial firms that currently own a unitary thrift charter will \nbe able to continue to own and operate their institutions without \nrestriction. Their current status would be undisturbed.\n  The only limitation this amendment would impose involves the \ntransferability of that charter. The charter would not be transferable \nto another commercial entity. Any bank, insurance company or security \nfirm that wanted to acquire the charter could do so. A new entity could \nbe created to operate the thrift. Included in title IV of the bill \nbefore us are provisions prohibiting new unitary thrift holding company \napplications filed after May 4, 1999, and prohibiting transfer of \nexisting unitaries to commercial firms. In the context of comprehensive \nfinancial modernization legislation, these provisions achieve the \nintent of this Congress to block the inappropriate mixing of banking \nand commerce, even in the limited scope authorized for the thrift \nindustry for the past several decades. The provisions in title IV \nprotect granfathered companies but do not allow existing unitary \ncompanies to be acquired by commercial firms. By adopting my amendment \nin this conference report, it is the intent of Congress that the thrift \nregulator strictly enforce this provision and related laws which \ncarefully define which companies qualify as unitary holding companies \nand which companies are grandfathered in this legislation. Only the \ncurrent, limited universe of legitimate unitaries should be allowed to \nexercise powers granted them in the Home Owners Loan Act, and transfer \nof unitaries to commercial firms will no longer threaten American \ntaxpayers.\n\n  This provision will further the goals of financial modernization by \nleveling the playing field between banks and thrifts. It will also \nremove a dangerous threat to further weakening of the walls between \nbanking and commerce. This bipartisan effort had the support of \nSecretary Summers and Chairman Greenspan. It overwhelmingly passed the \nfull Senate. Representative Largent shepherded it through the House \nCommerce Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous Material. Our joint \nefforts helped make this protection part of the conference report. We \nalso improve the Federal Home Loan Bank System, creating greater access \nto wholesale capital markets for small banks and their customers. The \nimprovements to the Home Loan Bank System will directly help South \nDakota financial institutions and South Dakota consumers by making it \neasier for our institutions to join the Federal Home Loan Bank System. \nThis portion of the bill recognizes the importance of small community \nbanks and the role they plan in our towns and communities. With the \nmassive shift of savings and investment to Wall Street and other \nnontraditional vehicles, small community banks are finding it more \ndifficult to attract deposits at reasonable rates, and lack ready \naccess to wholesale capital markets.\n  This bill will give them that access by making it easier for small \nbanks to join the Federal Home Loan Bank System. That system gives \nsmall banks greater access to cheaper funds through wholesale capital \nrates. That access, in turn, will lead to more loans at lower rates to \nour small businesses, ranchers and farmers. It makes running a farm or \nranch, running a business, expanding a business, buying a car, sending \nchildren to college--all of these endeavors more affordable for all \nSouth Dakotans, for all Americans. By enabling more affordable loans, \nthis provision will help infuse the rural economy with capital in \nparticular. This section of financial services modernization \nlegislation is critical to keeping our community banks competitive as \nwe move to tear down traditional firewalls and create new financial \nservices giants within the realm of the financial service industries.\n  I want to briefly address the issue of financial privacy. With the \nexplosive growth of the Internet, we are finding information can be \naccumulated and acquired with greater ease than previously imaginable. \nWe must address this important consumer protection issue of financial \nprivacy. I joined my colleagues, Senators Bryan and Shelby, in \nsupporting an ``opt-out'' provision that would allow customers to \nprohibit their financial institutions from sharing their personal \ninformation. That effort failed and I am disappointed. We do add some \nnew standards, including mandated disclosure of privacy policies and \nprotection of certain critical information in the bill. I believe we \ncan do better. I am pleased that we allow states to enact tougher \nprivacy laws, establishing a minimum federal standard of financial \nprivacy, but we can do better. Despite my disappointment, I am pleased \nwe took the first steps in addressing financial privacy, and I believe \nCongress will revisit the privacy issue in the future.\n  It is critical as we move toward repeal of depression-era limitations \nthat we recognize the vital role of community banks in rural areas. \nThis legislation successfully frees our dominant providers to compete \nglobally while strengthening the role of our community banks directly \nresponsive to our small towns. It is that successful balancing that \nprompted me to sign the conference report, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in passing this historic legislation.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank my staff, Paul Nash, \nfor his tireless work on this legislation. His\n\n[[Page S13876]]\n\ndedication to this effort helped make the final product the balanced \nresult which we will pass today.\n  I yield back such time as may remain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to yield to Senator \nHagel--why don't I yield him 10 minutes. If he needs more time, I will \nyield more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\n  I rise this morning in strong support of the conference report to \naccompany S. 900. This landmark legislation before the Senate today is \nespecially important for the future, not only of our financial \ninstitutions' competitiveness and our consumer-based economy but for \nmany reasons.\n  I begin my remarks this morning by commending the chairman of the \nSenate Banking Committee, Senator Gramm, for his leadership and \nextraordinary efforts to complete this legislation, as well as our \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Sarbanes from Maryland. Both they \nand their staffs and all who worked so hard in accomplishing this \nrather remarkable feat deserve our thanks.\n  I also recognize, as did my friend and colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota, the House leadership involved in this \neffort, as well as our current distinguished Secretary of Treasury, \nSecretary Summers, and the former Secretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin, \nfor their leadership.\n  This is truly a historic occasion. In 1933, the United States was \nmired in the Great Depression. The stock market had collapsed. Populist \nsegments of society blamed that collapse on commercial banks' \ninvolvement in securities underwriting. Responding to this sentiment, \nSenator Carter Glass of Virginia helped push through legislation that \ncreated artificial barriers between banking and securities \nunderwriting. Later, amendments included a separation of banking and \ninsurance activities.\n  One year later, in 1934, Senator Glass realized he had gone too far \nand tried to repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, his own bill. \nSince 1934, many attempts have been made in Congress to repeal Glass-\nSteagall. For a variety of reasons, these attempts have failed.\n  This Congress is about to send the President a bill that accomplishes \nwhat we have failed to achieve over many years. However, it should be \nnoted that we have also built on these many years of efforts.\n  I am proud to have served on the conference committee for this \nlegislation. This legislation will benefit consumers in two significant \nways. First, it will lead to lower costs and higher savings for \nconsumers by allowing competition among banks, securities firms, and \ninsurance companies.\n  In 1995, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that if financial \nmodernization were to reduce costs to consumers by only 1 percent, that \nwould represent a savings of $3 billion a year to consumers. That is \nreal money to real people.\n  These savings would come from increased competition which, among \nothers things, would provide incentives for firms to reduce fees.\n  Second, this competition will strengthen our financial services firms \nwhich are integral to the health of the national and international \neconomy.\n  As is true with manufactured goods and commodities, exports of \nfinancial services have become increasingly important to the growth of \nour Nation's economy. This month, the U.S. and its trading partners \nwill meet in Seattle to begin a new round of WTO negotiations. The \nfinancial services sector will again be a major topic of discussion \nduring these talks. In fact, our Trade Representative, Ambassador \nBarshefsky, appeared before the Senate Banking Committee this week and \ntalked in some detail about the financial services sector being top on \nthe agenda for these WTO talks.\n\n  It is important that Congress help tear down barriers to competition \nwithin our own domestic financial markets as we work with our allies \nand other nations to lower trade barriers in the international \nfinancial markets.\n  I will now briefly address how this bill will affect small community \nbanks.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Bayh and I introduced legislation to \nmodernize the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The major provisions of \nthat legislation were included in this financial modernization \nconference report. These provisions will strengthen local community \nbanks that are vital to the economic growth and viability of America's \ncommunities.\n  The Federal Home Loan Bank provisions will ensure that in an era of \nbanking megamergers, smaller banks are able to compete effectively and \ncontinue to serve their customers' needs.\n  Community banks are finding that, for a variety of reasons, their \nfunding sources are shrinking. This makes it more difficult to fund the \nloan demands of their communities. During the 1980s in my State of \nNebraska, and especially in the case of the Presiding Officer's State \nof Kansas, all across America many community banks and thrifts closed. \nAs local credit dried up, local economies stagnated. Small businesses, \nour greatest engines of job growth and innovation, were the first to \nfeel the crunch.\n  The Federal Home Loan Bank provisions in this legislation will \nstrengthen community banks to help avoid a repeat of the 1980s. By \nbroadening access to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, we will help \nensure the viability of the community bank and thrift.\n  This legislation will help keep credit flowing to small businesses, \nfarmers, and potential homeowners, and help our local communities \nprosper as we enter the 21st century. This is especially important to \nmy State of Nebraska where many rural communities depend upon the local \nbank or thrift for their credit needs.\n  The conferees worked hard to craft legislation that responds to the \nneeds of all financial institutions, including small financial \ninstitutions.\n  Another topic important to average Americans is financial privacy--\nhow customers control the flow of their private financial information.\n  For the first time, this bill sets up a framework for protecting the \nprivacy of customers' financial information. Customers will be able to \nprohibit the sharing of their financial information with outside \nparties. Financial institutions would be required to disclose their \nprivacy policies to their customers on a timely basis. If customers do \nnot believe adequate protections exist at their institution, they can \ntake their business elsewhere.\n  Some wanted stronger privacy protections. In my opinion, to have gone \nfurther at this time may well have invited the law of unintended \nconsequences. I believe some of the privacy protections that were \nproposed and rejected during the conference would have been \ndetrimental, not helpful, to financial institutions and their \ncustomers. Some of these limitations would have led to fewer products \nand services being offered to customers.\n\n  I want to highlight a particular concern. The legislation contains a \nprohibition on the sharing of customer account numbers or credit card \nnumbers with third parties for the purposes of marketing. This language \ncould be a disadvantage to small banks and insurance agencies that \npartner with third parties to market new products to customers.\n  Equally important, a customer should have the option to decide \nwhether this information can be or should be shared. This legislation \nshould not take away that choice.\n  The report language clarifies that when regulations are written to \nimplement S. 900, they may exempt the sharing of encrypted credit card \nnumbers and account numbers only where the financial institution has \nreceived express permission from the customer.\n  As vice chairman of the Banking Committee's Financial Institution \nSubcommittee, I intend to conduct oversight during the rulemaking \nprocess implementing this legislation.\n  The regulators should exercise this exemption authority. The \nconferees did not intend to hurt legitimate business practices that \nsafeguard customer information.\n  I end by again expressing my strong support for this conference \nreport. This\n\n[[Page S13877]]\n\nlegislation, a well-balanced approach to financial services \nmodernization, is long overdue. It does not pick winners and losers. It \nprovides important consumer protections while expanding the choices \navailable to consumers.\n  The conferees worked hard to craft a bill that will guide our \nfinancial services industries into the next century. This is a bill of \nwhich we can be proud, and I again congratulate Chairman Gramm, Senator \nSarbanes, and all who provided leadership and hard work to accomplish \nthis rather significant effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the financial modernization \nconference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield to me for just a moment?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank our dear colleague from Nebraska for his \nleadership on this bill. We have dramatically changed the Federal Home \nLoan Bank system in this bill, and no one has had more to do with that \ndramatic change than the Senator from Nebraska. I personally thank him \nfor the leadership he provided on that and many other issues in this \nbill.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am grateful for the chairman's generous \ncomments. After the Texas A and Nebraska game on Saturday, I may \nnever hear another generous comment from him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  With no Senator yielding time, time will be taken from the time \nreserved by all Senators who have reserved time on a proportionate \nbasis.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I begin by thanking Senator Allard for his \nleadership on this bill, for his strong support, in committee, on the \nfloor, and in conference. I think we have a good, strong bill that is \nwhat it is advertised as being, that is a bill which promotes \ncompetition and benefits consumers, in large part because of the \nsupport Senator Allard provided throughout the process and the \nleadership he provided.\n  I yield 10 minutes to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his very gracious remarks. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him on this particular issue. He is \nextremely knowledgeable, and it is because of his knowledge and \npersistence on this particular issue that I think we will pass such a \ngood bill. I compliment the chairman in a public manner for the \nyeoman's work he has done and the great leadership he has shown on this \nparticular issue. It has been a particular pleasure for me to be able \nto serve with him on the conference committee.\n  In regard to the conference report that is before the Senate, I think \nits provisions will be good for consumers and good for businesses. In \nregard to the consumers, it provides increased competition in financial \nservices. That is good. It will increase choice for consumers. There is \nmore convenience for consumers, and it will lower prices. Specific \nprovisions in the bill also give consumers more information to better \nenable them to make educated choices.\n  The conference report, as I mentioned, is also good for business. It \nrewrites the outdated laws that have governed the financial services \nindustry since the Depression. Gramm-Leach-Bliley eliminates the \nbarriers between banks, insurance companies, security firms, and other \nfinancial institutions. This will increase efficiency, reduce costs, \nand increase innovation. American financial institutions will be better \nable to compete internationally under the new structures contained in \nthe conference report.\n  Through the passage of this bill, Congress will rightly reclaim the \nauthority to govern the structure of the financial services industry. \nFor a number of years, various regulators have been easing the \nstatutory restrictions between banking and commerce through regulation. \nBy passing a comprehensive bill addressing the appropriate relationship \namong banking, insurance, and securities, Congress will ensure that the \nentire financial services industry is updated in a safe--and I would \nadd that safe is very important to me and other members of the \ncommittee --and a consistent manner as compared to a patchwork of \nregulations.\n  Congress has struggled for many years with the best way in which to \nupdate the laws governing the financial services industry. One reason \nwe are finally poised to modernize the financial services laws is the \nspirit of compromise and inclusiveness embodied in the conference \nreport. Chairman Gramm, and others, made a particular effort to listen \nto the concerns of the many industries involved and worked closely with \nthe administration. The conference report does a good job of balancing \nthe many interests involved.\n  I will now talk briefly about the structure within the bill.\n  The structure of the new financial services regime is based on a \ncompromise between the Federal Reserve and Treasury. Bank holding \ncompanies will be able to engage in activities that are financial in \nnature, including insurance and securities underwriting and merchant \nbanking. Well capitalized and well maintained national banks and \ninsured State banks will be able to engage in certain financial \nactivities. Provisions will be enacted to ensure that the new \nactivities are undertaken in a prudent manner.\n\n  The Federal Reserve is established as the umbrella regulator with \nstrong functional regulation in all areas. This will allow consistent \noversight by the Fed, while also allowing the individual regulators to \nexercise their expertise in the day-to-day operations of the affiliates \nthat they traditionally regulate. The bill respects the rights of \nStates through strong functional regulation and maintenance of non-\ndiscriminatory State laws.\n  Unitary thrifts prior to May 4, 1999, are grandfathered in under this \nbill. Existing unitary thrift companies may only be sold to financial \ncompanies.\n  Privacy is important to many consumers, and the conference report \ntakes important steps to protect the privacy of Americans. Financial \ninstitutions must disclose to the consumer their privacy policy \nregarding the sharing of non-public personal information with both \naffiliates and third parties. The disclosure will take place when a \nconsumer initially opens an account and annually thereafter. This is an \nimportant tool for consumers to make an informed decision as to which \nfinancial institutions they wish to patronize. Just as some consumers \nchoose a bank based on the hours they are open or the branch locations, \nthose consumers for whom privacy is a key issue can make an informed \ndecision based on a bank's privacy policy.\n  Financial institutions cannot share account numbers or access \nnumbers, except as required for consumer reporting agencies, for \nexample, credit bureaus. Consumers will receive an opportunity to opt-\nout of information sharing programs. This means that generally \nconsumers can prohibit a bank from sharing their non-public personal \ninformation with non-affiliated third parties. If any State law or \nregulation provides greater consumer privacy protections, then it shall \nremain in effect for that state. This is an important provision.\n  Changes to the Federal Home Loan Bank system will update their \ncapital structure and expand access for small banks. This will be \nparticularly beneficial to the many small banks in Colorado and other \nStates.\n  One of the most controversial aspects of the bill has been the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The bill clearly does not repeal \nany part of the existing CRA law, in fact it explicitly states that \nfact in the conference report.\n  The sunshine provision will finally bring some oversight to CRA \nagreements. For the first time ever, CRA agreements will be made \npublic. The parties to the CRA agreement will also have to disclose \nannually what happened to the cash and other resources that were part \nof the CRA agreement. Congress decided that community reinvestment was \na priority when it passed the initial CRA laws. This provision takes \nthe next logical step and ensures that the cash and resources received \nby a nongovernmental person or entity are in fact used for community \nreinvestment.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill makes several modifications to the CRA \nexamination schedule in order to provide\n\n[[Page S13878]]\n\nregulatory relief for small banks. It is important to note, though, \nthat the banks must still meet the same CRA standards--this only \nchanges the examination schedule. A small bank that received an \noutstanding rating in its last CRA exam will not receive another CRA \nexam for five years. A small bank that received a satisfactory rating \nwill not receive another CRA exam for four years. This relief is \nimportant for small banks, as the cost of regulatory compliance is \ndisproportionately high for them. The relatively high cost to small \nbanks for CRA compliance actually leaves them with fewer resources to \ninvest in their communities. The examination schedule also makes sense \nbecause it will allow CRA compliance officers to focus time and \nresources on those banks with compliance problems, rather than the \nbanks that are already doing a good job.\n  The conference report also contains a provision important for small \nbanks--a GAO study on changes to the S Corporation rules for small \nbanks. Subchapter S corporations do not pay corporate income taxes--\nearnings are passed through to the shareholders where income taxes are \npaid, eliminating the double taxation of corporations. Congress \npreviously made small banks eligible for S Corporation status, however, \nmany of the current rules make it difficult for them to qualify. I \nstrongly support efforts to change the laws so that small banks are \nbetter able to qualify for S Corporation status. I am hopeful that this \nGAO study will highlight the need for such changes.\n  I will continue to push for those changes in future Congresses. I \nhave introduced legislation in that regard. This is not under the \njurisdiction of the Banking Committee, but the Finance Committee. I \nthink it will be a key part in allowing small banks to move forward \nwith their modernization efforts, in addition to this particular bill.\n  I stand in strong support of this conference report. I stand in \nsupport of the bill. I think it is going to be a key piece of \nlegislation passed in this particular Congress.\n  I thank the chairman for allowing me to participate in the process as \nmuch as he did. I congratulate him on a job well done and encourage \nMembers of the Senate to vote for this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Allard for his leadership \nand his kind remarks.\n  In recognizing Senator Bunning, let me say that he has played a very \nbig role in this bill. He, in another era and another profession, \nunderstood the meaning of hard ball, when it came time to throw the \nhard ball and to stand fast. We had many of those moments with this \nbill. As I noted yesterday, when the House, to satisfy almost any \nconstituency, threw an amendment out to us that could have dramatically \nchanged, complicated, or contradicted the basic logic of this bill, \nSenator Bunning stood like a rock in opposition to making those \nchanges. With his help and leadership, we were successful. I yield \nSenator Bunning 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank Chairman Gramm.\n  Mr. President, this is an historic occasion, and I am very happy to \nbe a part of it. Today we are going to finally, at long last, pass \nfinancial modernization legislation that brings the financial industry \ninto the 20th century and prepares it for the 21st century. When I \nfirst came to Congress nearly 13 years ago, this was one of the first \nmajor issues I worked on. I served on the Banking Committee in the \nHouse back then, and in 1988, we passed out of committee a financial \nmodernization bill. But that bill never made it to the House floor. So \nit has been a long process getting to this point.\n  There have been many times when I did not believe we would ever make \nit. But I am very happy to see this day come, and I am very proud to be \na part of it. Those of us who served on this Conference Committee have \nlabored to bring a good bill to the floor today-- a conference report \nthat knocks down barriers, gives consumers more options and cheaper \nservices, protects the little guys, and provides regulatory relief. We \nhave achieved all these goals in this measure. There has never been a \nquestion about the need to modernize our depression-era financial laws. \nIf we expect our financial industries to be able to compete in the \nworld market in the next century, modernization of our laws is \nessential. I think everyone has recognized that all along. It was \nsimply a question of finding a suitable blueprint for the modernization \nprocess that everyone could find acceptable, and I think we \naccomplished that with this measure. Admittedly, along the way this \nyear, we had some big differences to work out. For instances, I was \nvery happy the Federal Reserve and the Department of Treasury were able \nto work out a compromise on the Op-sub issue. I believe this compromise \nwas essential to getting an agreement on the final bill and allowing us \nto finally repeal Glass-Steagall.\n  We also wrestled long and hard on the Community Reinvestment Act \nprovisions. In this bill today we bring much-needed sunshine to the CRA \nprocess and ensure that the money which banks are sending to groups for \nlow-income housing development, goes for just that, low-income housing.\n  We also give some much-needed regulatory relief to small banks on \nCRA. These banks are already involved in their communities. If they did \nnot lend in their neighborhoods, they would not survive. With this \nprovision, small bankers will spend less time doing Federal paper work \nand more time lending in their neighborhoods, both rural and urban. I \nwould have liked to do more to reduce the CRA burden on small banks but \nwe did the best we could. We were also able to ensure that we protected \nthe small-town insurance salesmen and stockbrokers. We make sure that \nthey have a level playing field and will be able to offer their \ncustomers more services at better prices. And we also dealt with a new \nissue that emerged in recent months--the issue of privacy. I know some \nof my colleagues believe this bill is inadequate as far as the \nprovisions on financial privacy go.\n  I certainly understand their concerns but this bill does give \nconsumers federal privacy protection that they have not previously \nenjoyed. Under provisions of this bill, consumers will be able to opt-\nout of disclosure of their financial information to third parties. This \nbill does not go as far as some would like,--but it is a start and it \ndoes recognize the importance of the privacy issue. Overall, I believe \nwe came to an agreement on a balanced bill that creates a level playing \nfield and enhances competition for the financial industries. It \nprotects the safety and soundness of our financial institutions and \ngives consumers better products at lower prices.\n  It is crucial that we do pass this measure as we prepare to enter the \nnew millennium. In this new age of the global marketplace our financial \nfirms must be able to compete. This bill will go a long way toward \nallowing them to compete, but not at the expense of our local bankers, \nbrokers, agents, and customers. I urge my colleagues to vote for it--it \nis a good bill.\n  Finally, I would like to commend Chairman Gramm and his fine staff \nfor all of their hard work. We certainly would not have this bill \nwithout Chairman Gramm's tireless efforts. He and his staff spent \ncountless hours completing this bill which I believe will be passed \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support and will be signed by the \nPresident.\n  Chairman Gramm did an outstanding job, and I thank everybody else on \nthe conference committee and in the Senate. I urge support of this bill \nand its passage today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bunning for his kind \ncomments. I will soon yield to Senator Enzi. I thank him for his \nleadership, for all he did in helping us put together a good bill to \nbegin with, for the work he did in understanding the bill and what we \nwere trying to achieve.\n  I have always believed that conviction is born of knowledge. It is \nhard to be committed to something that you don't understand. I think \none of the reasons we held together so well in getting this bill \nthrough committee and to\n\n[[Page S13879]]\n\nthe floor--through conference and finally here today, as we reach the \ngoal line--is all of those endless meetings we had in January and \nFebruary to talk about what it was we wanted to do and why it was \nimportant. If there is any person who didn't miss a single one of those \nmeetings, it is Mike Enzi. Mike Enzi is a real doer. When you have a \nhard job to do, you want to give it to him. I like giving him jobs \nbecause he always does them.\n  I yield the Senator from Wyoming 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his extra kind \ncomments.\n  I do rise to speak in favor of the conference report that accompanies \nS. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which is also \ncalled the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. I think there is good reason for it \nbeing so titled. Senator Gramm has certainly taken the lead on this. He \nis one of the most focused individuals I have ever run into in my \nlifetime. When it comes to working a problem, he has a tremendous \nmemory of not only the things he has been involved in but the things he \nhas read and studied up on for it, and he can recall those almost \ninstantaneously. He has provided tremendous leadership. I am convinced \nthat without that leadership we would not be at this point on this \nbill.\n  The senior Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, \ncertainly deserves that first spot for his name at the successful \ncompletion of this bill. Some of that credit, of course, has to go to \nhis very capable staff as well. He did line up some experts who had \nsome tremendous capabilities, knowledge, background, and ability to \nexpress themselves, to explain to others, and the ability to sell the \nprogram to each of the staffs who were involved in it, too. Without \ntheir dedication and involvement, and the hours they spent on it also, \nwe would not be at this point.\n  Of course, we have been through the conference process. I have been \nin the Senate 3 years now, and this has been the most complete \nconference process that I have seen. Part of the reason for that is \nprobably because of the makeup of that conference. The bill on the \nHouse side was assigned to two committees, and those committees had a \ndeep desire to be involved in the process. So we went through the House \nhaving, first, 42 conferees, plus the entire Senate Banking Committee; \nand then there was an imbalance that had to be corrected. I thank the \nHouse for correcting that. They did that by appointing four more people \nto the conference. So we wound up with 66 people on the conference. I \ncame from the Wyoming State Legislature, and our whole House in Wyoming \ndoesn't have that many people in it. When they do a conference \ncommittee, it is much smaller. Small committees get more done. So it \nwas an incredibly huge, impossible task.\n\n  Again, with the leadership of the chairman, Senator Gramm, there was \nsome definite action taken that broke the deadlock of daily, deadly, \nexternal, lengthy comment sessions that didn't resolve anything. After \na few days of that, he again took charge of the process and said we \nwere going to get a small working group of three people, and we were \ngoing to put together a compromise bill. I particularly congratulate \nhim for the compromise that was put in at that point. There were a lot \nof people who were nervous and tense about having the three Republican \nchairmen involved get together and put together a compromise. There was \nworry about how much compromise there would be. I think everybody was \npleasantly surprised at the way it came out of that rewrite, and that \nrewrite turned out to be a tremendous key to the process. Without that, \nwe would never be at this point.\n  I have to say this is the first time in over 20 years that the House \nand the Senate passed a bill in the same session. So it is the first \nreal opportunity that there has been to conference it. Then we had this \nhuge conference committee. The deadlock on that committee was broken by \nthe chairman taking the focus and arranging this group and being \nextremely careful to include the different views in it, and then having \na process where we could debate from that standpoint, taking things out \nand putting things back in; and, again, there were more committee \nmeetings, more amendments suggested, more decisions made than I have \never seen in a conference committee.\n  I also have to compliment the chairman because I remember sometimes \nwhere he was negotiating some critical additional amendments to this \nthing, and he would leave the room and go work with people to get some \nchanges or to explain why changes should not be made. That is a very \nimportant part of the process, too, because we were still working on a \ncritical amendment in the committee. He would be able to come back in \nfrom that external negotiation, step right in, and debate the reasons \nwe needed to deal with or shouldn't deal with the issue that was still \non the table. It is an incredible challenge. He did it extremely well. \nHe kept the debate focused and moving forward so that we are at a point \nwhere we have this conference report.\n\n  I am pleased that the White House made the comments publicly about \nthis bill and where it is because it shows their understanding of the \nprocess and the dedication that was put into the bill as well.\n  I congratulate Senator Sarbanes. He has a very quiet negotiating \nstyle, a very unique one. It forces people to do maybe a little bit \nmore than what they would have done if they really understood where he \nwas coming from. He has played a critical role in this bill as well. I \nappreciate all the effort he has put into it.\n  We are at a point now where we have this conference report. I am \nconvinced that it will be overwhelmingly adopted. I appreciate all the \npeople who have put time and effort into it.\n  This bill breaks down the barriers between banks, insurance, and \nsecurities firms. It allows them to affiliate and engage in each \nother's activities.\n  It is fitting that our financial system be allowed to modernize as we \nenter the next century.\n  As I mentioned, for over 20 years Congress has attempted to repeal \nthese statutory barriers. These barriers have only limited the ability \nof financial institutions to offer a variety of services that their \ncustomers demand. Financial services modernization will allow one-stop \nshopping for consumers wanting a variety of financial services--\nbanking, insurance, and securities--a sort of shopping mall for \nfinancial needs. This will increase efficiency and increase competition \nwhich translates into more choices and lower prices for American \nconsumers.\n  This isn't a big deregulation. This is an opportunity for people to \ncompete evenly on the playing field.\n  Some opposed to the bill have said they don't believe it goes far \nenough to ensure the privacy of a person's individual financial \ninformation. I have to say this bill will provide the strongest privacy \nprotection ever for Americans. It requires the financial institution to \nclearly disclose their privacy policies. The disclosure will guarantee \ncustomers the ability to see clearly the privacy policies of the \ninstitutions allowing them to take their business to another financial \ninstitution if they don't approve of the way that they could be or have \nbeen treated. It allows the market to adapt to the demands of the \nconsumers instead of the market adapting to government regulations.\n  The market allows for changes in consumer preferences and behavior, \nwhile rigid government regulations can easily cause unintended \nconsequences.\n  I have to say that in every committee in the Senate in which we are \ninvolved, privacy is the big issue now. We are debating that in every \none of them. I am on the health subcommittee of Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions. We have been trying to resolve the privacy issues \nthere.\n  It is amazing how complicated and difficult that can be. There are \nthings we as consumers anticipate others working in that business or in \na business that we think is part of the business will know about us to \nexpedite the work that we are expecting.\n  Consumer choice is the key. The privacy provisions in this bill also \nrequire that any bank that is considering sharing your information with \nan outside company--a third party--allows you the ability to say no to \nthat activity. This opt-out provision also gives the consumer power and \nchoice.\n  I want to tell you, this bill benefits the small community financial \ninstitutions. Coming from Wyoming, I have a\n\n[[Page S13880]]\n\nparticular interest in that. We have small community financial \ninstitutions that are the heart of our financial industry. It protects \nthem just as it benefits the large financial institutions. It grants \nsmall banks the same expanded authority granted to the larger \ninstitutions. It requires the Federal banking agencies to use plain \nlanguage. This will be one of the biggest things in the bill in their \nrulemaking used to implement the bill.\n  This plain language provision was included to ensure that small banks \nwill not have to hire several lawyers to interpret the new rules \nresulting from this legislation.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows small banks to access advances from \nthe Federal Home Loan Bank System. These advances could be used for \nsmall business and small farm lending, in addition to housing. This \nwill enable small banks to serve their communities comprehensively and \nprovides them the liquidity they need to remain competitive. Another \npriority of small banks that has been included in the report is the \nprohibition on the chartering of new unitary thrifts for commercial \nfirms. The bill even prohibits commercial firms that do not currently \ncontrol a thrift from buying an existing thrift. Additionally, S. 900 \nprovides further regulatory relief of the Community Reinvestment Act of \n1977 for small banks. Those small banks under $250 million in assets \nwith an outstanding CRA rating will be examined for compliance only \nevery 5 years, while those with a satisfactory rating will be examined \nevery four years. Most agree that CRA is more of a paperwork burden for \nsmall banks than it is for large banks. I believe that small banks and \nthrifts, by their very nature, must be responsive to the needs of the \nentire communities they serve or they will not remain in business. That \nis the sole source of their customers.\n  I am also pleased that the bill does not dismantle the dual banking \nsystem--the Federal system--that has served us so well over the years. \nThis competitive regulatory system has many times created innovations \nwhich were later allowed by the national banking regulators. Under the \ndual banking system, state legislatures determine the powers allowed to \ntheir state institutions. These powers are tailored to meet the \neconomic needs of the states. An empowered state banking system is \nelemental to state economic development. Included in the bill is a \nclarification that the FDIC's authority and the State bank regulator's \nauthority with respect to operating subsidiary powers is not rolled \nback.\n  I recognize that this report is a collection of compromises. These \ncompromises have not been easily achieved. Some of these compromises \nrelate to the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA). I do have \nconcerns about this compromise on CRA. However, I am more willing to \naccept what I consider an expansion of CRA since the sunshine provision \nhas been included. Since some groups are using the name of a federal \nlaw, the Community Reinvestment Act, to receive monies from insured \nfinancial institutions, it is only appropriate that the Congress is \nable to see how that law is being used. In sum, I believe this an \nacceptable compromise at this time.\n  I am pleased to support this conference report and congratulate all \nwho have participated in it and encourage my other colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I reserve the remainder of any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Gramm, Senator Sarbanes, \nChairman Leach, Representative Bliley, and all of my colleagues who \nhave worked so long and hard on this legislation, with particular \nthanks to Senators Dodd and Edwards who worked with us in the late \nnight hours to come up with a compromise that eventually helped get \nthis bill passed.\n  Mr. President, this is a historic moment. We have been working \ntowards it for 18 years. It has taken 18 years for Congress to pass \nthis bill.\n  When I first came to Congress, the issue was a narrow one: revenue \nbonds. Could banks underwrite revenue bonds? With technological change \nand globalization, the issue has expanded far beyond revenue bonds to \nan issue where the future of America's dominance as the financial \ncenter of the world is at stake.\n  This bill is vital for the future of our country. If we don't pass \nthis bill, we could find London or Frankfurt or, years down the road, \nShanghai becoming the financial capital of the world. That has grave \nimplications for all of America where financial services is one of the \nareas where jobs are growing the most quickly, where our technology is \nway ahead of everyone else, where our capital dominates the world. It \nwould be a shame if, because Congress had been unable to act, all those \nadvantages were frittered away, as they well could be, in a global \nworld by our failure to realize the problems our existing antiquated \nlaws cause.\n  There are many reasons for this bill. First and foremost is to ensure \nthat U.S. financial firms remain competitive. As their international \ncompetitors, U.S. firms will be able to offer financial services to \ncomplement their business models. Had we not done this, 3 years from \nnow, with new technology, we could find major U.S. companies leaving \nthe United States and locating in other countries that had laws \nallowing these things.\n  I don't know what the marketplace will yield. Will people want to buy \nall their financial services from one company? Will it be online or \nwith individuals? We don't know. We do know that to close off one \navenue of competition is the death knell for the future of a country in \nthat area--in this case, financial services. It is essential we pass \nthis bill.\n  The first issue is jobs, plain and simple, hundreds of thousands--\nyes, millions--of high-paying jobs. I need not tell the Senate how \nimportant this bill has been to the financial capital of the world, New \nYork.\n  Second, it is important to consumers. The years have shown the more \ncompetition, the better. This bill allows more competition by allowing \nmany more firms to compete over similar product lines. When a bank \ndecides to go into the securities industry or a securities firm decides \nto sell insurance, they are looking for a competitive edge. They may \nwell find it, they may not. However, the ability to have more \ncompetition--which this bill creates--is vital to consumers. This is a \nproconsumer bill. It is proconsumer for the same reason our system has \npredominated over all the others--competition.\n\n  Jobs are an important reason for this bill; consumer interests and \ncompetition are an important reason for this bill.\n  Third, we have to keep up with changing markets. When Glass-Steagall \nwas passed, commercial banks dominated the financial landscape with 57 \npercent of all financial assets. Today they have less than 25 percent. \nTo look at the world through that antiquated spyglass and say we must \nkeep commercial banks from other areas because they may dominate is to \nlook at a world that is 50 years old. Many argue commercial banks are \namong the weakest competitors when they are put against not only \nsecurities firms and electronic firms but mutual funds and pension \nfunds. The third issue: We have to move this bill to keep up with \nchanging markets.\n  Finally, we had to do it because otherwise the regulators were going \ntopsy-turvy. We all know it does not make good policy to have \nindividual regulatory decisions make policy. That has been what has \nhappened. Because of the necessities of technology and globalization, \nbecause of the changes in financial markets, individual companies were \ngoing to the regulators and asking for special permission to do A, B, \nand C, and regulators were granting it. Now we have an overall fabric. \nWe have a law that will treat all companies equally, that will allow \nbusinesses, either new or existing, to plan for the future, and will \ncreate a level playing field.\n  There are many reasons to pass this bill. My goal, which I stated at \nthe outset, was to modernize financial services but not take one step \nbackward on CRA. We have done that. The CRA provisions in the bill do \nnot move things forward, but they do not take a single step backward. \nIn fact, as I have argued to the groups in my State, they will benefit \nfrom this legislation because their leverage in the CRA process has \nalways been when there are new mergers or new products that a bank\n\n[[Page S13881]]\n\ndecides to add. This is going to increase 10, 20 times. Every time the \ngroups are interested in CRA--one of the most successful banking laws \nwe have passed--they will have that leverage. Instead of two or three \nopportunities a year, they will probably have two or three a month. I \nargue CRA groups are going to be so busy with all the new mergers and \nall the new services that they may not have time to keep up.\n  We accomplished a great deal. I thank the Senator from Maryland as \nwell as the administration for making sure we did not take a single \nstep backward on CRA.\n  Sunshine provisions are in the bill. It is very hard to argue against \nthem. If I am for sunshine for business and for political people, \nincluding myself, how can we not be for sunshine even for groups we \nsupport and believe in? I have no problem with the sunshine provision.\n  We succeeded in CRA. We also succeeded in helping the consumer in \nterms of protections.\n  Regarding ATM fees, I am proud banks will be required to disclose any \nand all charges for using an ATM before a customer makes a decision to \nwithdraw funds. I fought for years for this provision, first in the \nHouse with Representative Roukema, and now in the Senate. It is in the \nbill. In addition, there are privacy protections in the bill.\n\n  Does the bill go as far as I wish on privacy? No. But privacy is a \nlarge and complicated issue. We don't know what the balance ought to be \nbetween the ability of businesses to share information and the right of \nthe consumer to protect his or her information. In the Senate, we did \nnot have a single hearing on privacy. To restructure all of privacy \nwith huge numbers of unknown consequences on this bill made no sense. \nMy goal, again, was, can we move forward? We have. Not as far as I \nprefer or many prefer but certainly not enough to sink a bill that has \nso many necessities.\n  Finally, safety and soundness. The one thing that has dominated my \nthinking in this area is that we not repeat an S crisis, and we not \nallow insured deposits to be used for risky activities. I am proud to \nsay the compromise between Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the \nstructure of the bill makes sure that when insured dollars are used for \nanything that might be slightly risky, the capital requirements and \nfirewalls will make virtually certain we will not repeat the kind of \nS crisis we have had in the past.\n  In conclusion, this is a historic day. It is a historic day for my \nState of New York, which I am proud to say is the financial capital of \nthe world and, with this bill, has a much greater likelihood of \nremaining so. It is a historic day for modernizing one of the most \nimportant industries in America where we are technologically and \nentrepreneurially ahead of the rest of the world. This will help \nmaintain our lead. And it is a historic day for those who have argued \nthat we need to keep CRA strong and keep consumer protections in the \nbill.\n  From Glass-Steagall to Gramm-Leach, from the Great Depression to the \nGolden Age, from isolationist to internationalist, from underdogs to \nchampions, this bill is an American success story for our economy, for \nour financial institutions, for our communities and consumers, and for \nmy State of New York. I was proud to have played a role with so many \nothers in ensuring its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New York for \nhis statement. I underscore the positive and constructive role he \nplayed with respect to this legislation throughout, and thank him for \nhis contribution to this effort.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, this is a historic day for America, for \nthe Senate, for the citizens of Rhode Island, and for the family of the \nlate Senator John Chafee. I ask unanimous consent now--and I am joined \nin this unanimous-consent request by Senator Lincoln Chafee, who was \njust sworn in as United States Senator for the State of Rhode Island--\nthat remarks given at his funeral by Senator Chafee's son, Zechariah \nChafee, entitled ``The Service of Thanksgiving for the Life of John \nChafee,'' October 30, 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Reflection of Zechariah Chafee\n\n(A Service of Thanksgiving for the Life of John Hubbard Chafee, October \n                              30th, 1999)\n\n       What a man! What a life!\n       Come with me. Let us look at how he lived, and what he was \n     made of. John Chafee said at times that the great shapers of \n     his life were his parents, the Boy Scouts, his wrestling, the \n     United States Marine Corps, the U.S. Senate, and above all, \n     his own family.\n       From his parents, an upright Yankee, a vivacious Scot, he \n     without a doubt drew his graciousness toward me, women and \n     children of all walks of life. From them as well came his \n     decency and keen sense of the difference between right and \n     wrong.\n       As for the scouts, not only was he an industrious member of \n     a Providence troop as a boy, but it seems he kept a scout \n     handbook in his Senate office! Examining Article 8 of the \n     Scout law of his day, one finds this stricture: A scout \n     smiles and whistles under all difficulties! Is this how he \n     came by his trademark good cheer?\n       I must say though that his skeptical children had some \n     problem reconciling the cautionary scout motto ``be \n     prepared,'' with my father's brisk assertion. ``It will all \n     work out, stick with me--here we go!''\n       But with him in charge, it usually did work out--and even \n     if it did not, it was still fun!\n\n[[Page S13882]]\n\n       At the Providence Country Day school, he began his \n     wrestling career, which he furthered at Yale when he \n     captained the freshmen team. Wrestling called forth the \n     qualities, so many of you have come to know. The tenacity, \n     the willingness to give it his all.\n       The sheer love of the contest. The will to victory and the \n     confidence that goes with it. Remember, that on the wrestling \n     mat, it's one man's struggle with another. There are no \n     excuses. But just as important to note--there was a team--and \n     he was the captain. The man to who others looked--the \n     inspirer, the leader.\n       Following Yale, he went on to wrestle AAU. Now, some time \n     when you're riffling through your back issues of ``Body \n     Builder'' magazine, circa 1948, you might look up his \n     citation as an All-American wrestler. And when you next pass \n     through Stillwater, Oklahoma, drop in at the National \n     Wrestling Hall of Fame. You'll find his picture on the wall.\n       It has been said that as a boy, Johnny Chafee had a poster \n     in his room featuring a jut-jawed marine on the move, rifle \n     in hand and bearing the legend ``US Marines--First to \n     Fight.''\n       December 7th, 1941 gave Chafee that chance. He left Yale \n     and headed for Parris Island. As the new recruits arrived and \n     stepped down a company street in the soft southern night, \n     from the windows of the surrounding barracks came the jeering \n     call--``You'll be sorry! You'll be sorry!''\n       But he never was.\n       Look at a globe someday. Run your finger northeast from the \n     upper shoulder of Australia in the Solomon Island chain and \n     you'll find the Island of Guadalcanal.\n       Here on August 7th, 1942, 19 year old private first class \n     John Chafee waded to shore with the first marine division. It \n     was America's first step on the long, lethal ladder that \n     would lead to Tokyo. You recalled the story of the battle--\n     how the Navy fleet, supporting Marines, weighed anchor and \n     sailed over the horizon, leaving the division alone in far \n     off hostile seas.\n       The world watched an wondered about the fate of the \n     Marines. The world need not have doubted, as my father once \n     explained, ``In the foxholes at night, on the jungle patrols \n     and in the roar of battle, what bound these men together--\n     what drove them on, was not patriotic zeal, but rather the \n     confidence that they were all Marines. That the man to the \n     left, the man to the right was a U.S. Marine. My father said \n     that in that far perimeter, far from any help, he had no \n     doubt that the Marines would prevail, come what may. That was \n     that famous ``esprit de corps''--and he would carry it with \n     him for the rest of his life.\n       He lived by the teachings of the Corps. Leadership by \n     example. Self-discipline. The knowledge that success often \n     requires audacity and risk. The conviction that when given a \n     mission--no matter how disagreeable--one doesn't complain or \n     delay, but gets started and presses on 'til the end.\n       There are other qualities as well. With John Chafee the \n     phrase ``Gung-Ho'' leaps to mind. My dictionary defines this \n     as extremely enthusiastic and dedicated, but goes on to note \n     that this World War II Marine Corps motto derives from a \n     Chinese word meaning ``work together''.\n       Work together.\n       Wasn't that motto a guiding light for my father's entire \n     public service?\n       Once a Marine always a Marine.\n       In a few minutes, as John Chafee's mortal remains are \n     carried from this church, the organ will sound the triumphant \n     cords of the Marine Corps Hymn.\n       From heaven . . . he will be listening.\n       I know he'll hear it! At war's end, my father completed his \n     studies at Yale Law and went off to Harvard Law. About that \n     time, a cousin described for him, a trio of lovely sisters \n     from Long Island's north shore. The Coates girls!\n       ``Save one for me,'' he urged.\n       It took a bit of a chase, but in November of 1950, Ginny \n     Coates, in white veil and gown, stepped toward him down the \n     church's aisle. She has been the beating heart of our family, \n     the sustainer of her man and her children ever since.\n       My father found legal practice in Providence stifling. So \n     in 1951 there came a telegram from the Corps, recalling him \n     to combat duty in Korea. He kicked his heels together and \n     whooped! It was as Commanding Officer of Dog Company, 2nd \n     Battalion, 7th Marines that Chafee came into his own. Lt. \n     James Brady in his memoirs. The Coldest War, had this to say.\n       ``You learned from men like Chafee, a Yalie with a law \n     degree from Harvard, who came from money, a handsome, \n     patrician man, physically courageous and tireless. From all \n     that could have come arrogance, snobbery. He possessed \n     neither of those traits; he was only calm and vigorous, and \n     efficient, usually cheerful, decent and humane, a good man, a \n     fine officer.''\n       Following combat in Korea, Chafee jumped into Rhode Island \n     politics and won a seat in the Rhode Island legislature. Also \n     in the space of the next 10 years, he fathered six children. \n     Now one might observe that for a Protestant with political \n     hopes in the most heavily Catholic state in the country, it \n     did not hurt to ``get with the program.''\n       In 1962, and at age 39, he pitched his hat in the ring for \n     Governor, running as a Republican in a state with the highest \n     percentage of Democrats in the nation. Now that's optimism!\n       See if you recognize some familiar qualities in the \n     Providence Sunday Journal endorsement of John Chafee for \n     governor 37 years ago.\n       ``He has been demonstrating an awareness that government \n     belongs to the people--not the politicians. He has been \n     modest in his claims. He has been careful and honest in \n     taking positions. He has brought fresh thinking to old \n     problems. He has been unassuming in his presentations, in \n     that he neither hectors nor lectures.''\n       Some things never change.\n       If they missed anything, it was his cyclonic energy and his \n     political courage. Those qualities would be quickly revealed.\n       Chafee would win his race by a mere 398 votes out a total \n     of 327,506 votes cast. Now, at the Duke of Wellington once \n     confided after the battle of Waterloo, ``It was a damn close \n     run thing.''\n       John Chafee hit the Governor's office with the force of a \n     gale.\n       He saw government as a way we work together, to meet the \n     needs and solve the problems of our common lives. And he was \n     only too happy to lead the way.\n       In the many tributes of the last few days, you've read and \n     heard of his achievements. He loved the job and made it great \n     fund for those around him of all ages. He governed \n     exuberantly. For instance, he delighted in directing his \n     pilot to give visiting school children rides in the official \n     state helicopter. This lead to complaints by a scrooge in \n     state government. There then appeared in the paper a cartoon, \n     which hangs today on my parents wall at home.\n       In it, the angry official shakes his hand skyward, where a \n     helicopter buzzes merry children hanging from skids and \n     doors, and a gleeful John Chafee--big chin magnified--happily \n     manning the controls.\n       Before we lay him to rest, I know my father would love it \n     if I just described a few scenes from his family's life \n     together.\n       Stand beside him in the crowd, at the fence of the horse \n     show ring, as my sister Tribbie canters in on her lovely \n     pony, Puck. Girl and pony flow round the ring and ripple over \n     the jumps. They'll take the state championship that day.\n       Now see him at the helm of Windway as she runs before a \n     slight southwesterly off Beavertail. He tosses a long line \n     astern. His children dive and clutch it, shooting along \n     behind the boat like mini torpedoes.\n       Have a seat now at the big dinner table at Stonecroft, his \n     summer house on the coast of Maine. Listen, as he polls the \n     table, questioning one by one his happy guests on the issues \n     of the day.\n       ``What's your position on the flag burning amendment? \n     Should we give up the Pananama Canal?'' And more recently, \n     ``what would you do with the budget surplus?''\n       Doesn't he make you think?\n       It's a summer morn' in Maine. The day's still cool from the \n     night before. There he is over by the flagpole, the banner in \n     his hand. See that cluster of small children by his side--\n     some towheaded, some dark? His grandchildren! Little hands \n     reach up to tug the line--little faces look aloft. It's up! \n     The Stars and Stripes float on the morning air!\n       See him now on the summer deck of the two room cabin with \n     the wood stove, where he and mother live when they're back in \n     Rhode Island.\n       It's evening, the sun sweeps low over the meadows on the \n     far side of the river. The air is still, the tide is high. \n     Egrets hunt along the marshy shallows. Ginny has brought \n     cheese and crackers to the table. A bourbon glows amber in \n     his glass.\n       They speak easily together, bound by the love of nearly \n     fifty years.\n       In closing, as I look out on our President and upon John \n     Chafee's many Senate friends, I recall a large color \n     photograph on my father's office wall. In it, Senator Dole, \n     eyes twinkling, cracks a joke as President Reagan, John \n     Chafee and Senator Alan Simpson bend an ear, amusement alight \n     on their faces.\n       After the event, my father obtained a copy of the photo, \n     and at a later meeting with the President, slid it down the \n     table towards him and asked him if he'd sign it.\n       Without missing a beat, Reagan penned a line and slid it \n     back.\n       It read simply, ``John--Some time it is fun, isn't it?''\n       Some time it is fun, isn't it?\n       Dad, when you were around, it sure was.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to read the first paragraph of the \nstatement given by Zechariah Chafee:\n\n       What a man. What a life. Come with me. Let us look at how \n     he lived and what he was made of. John Chafee said at times \n     that the great shapers of his life were his parents, the Boy \n     Scouts, his wrestling, the United States Marine Corps, the \n     United States Senate and, above all, his own family.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. May I be recognized for 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank and commend the Senator from \nVirginia for his very thoughtful introduction of those remarks. Like so \nmany in our body, we were in that church. Zech Chafee's words rang so \ntrue--the clarion call about his father, his service to this great \nNation.\n\n[[Page S13883]]\n\n  Also, I join Senator Warner in saying this is a very proud day for \nthe Chafee family. They are proud of the accomplishments of Senator \nJohn H. Chafee and proud of the commitment to public service of Lincoln \nChafee. I am pleased and proud to join my colleague from Virginia in \nthis request. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13883-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13883-S13917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me just take a moment at this time, if \nthe Senator would allow me.\n  When the history is written of this session of Congress, it will \nprobably identify this piece of legislation as the single biggest \nachievement. I have heard this financial services modernization issue \ndiscussed for my entire career in the Congress, which is now up to 27 \nyears. It has been tried by Republicans, by Democrats in the Congress, \nHouse and Senate, administrations of both parties. It never quite \noccurred.\n  I think it is appropriate we commend all of those who have been \ninvolved in this process for bringing us to this moment. This \nlegislation is going to pass overwhelmingly. It is going to bring us \ninto the modern era of financial services. It is going to allow us to \nbe more equally competitive around the world.\n  I think we should properly note what has happened. If today's papers \nare any indication, we passed major trade legislation yesterday and it \ndidn't even make the first section of one of the papers in this city; \nit wound up in the business section. It was hardly noted, the effort \nthat was put into passing that major free trade legislation. I hope \nthat will not be the case with this major legislation.\n  So for all those involved--I won't begin at the top and go to the \nbottom--obviously Secretary Rubin was involved in earlier discussions; \nAlan Greenspan was involved; Secretary Summers has been involved. The \nadministration did stay engaged when they could have said we are not \ngoing to talk anymore. Leaders in both the House and the Senate, the \nelected leadership, Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the \naisle, on both sides of the Capitol worked to make this happen.\n  Let me say for the record--I know, because I watched it very \ncarefully and had some meetings which, I think, helped give it some \nmomentum, some impetus--it would not be where it is today, it would not \nhave been achieved, without the leadership of the senior Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm. He has done a masterful job. Many people said: It \nwon't happen. Many people said: He will kill it. I kept saying: No; you \nwait. He will make this happen through thick or thin. It will get done.\n\n  It is being done. To take nothing away from all those involved--\nincluding the ranking member of the committee, Senator Sarbanes of \nMaryland, who was actively involved--I have to note, with a lot of \nappreciation and gratitude, the tremendous leadership of the Senator \nfrom Texas. I don't think he can probably ever replicate this effort \nagain. So I think that at this time we should express our appreciation \nbecause it is a monumental achievement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I know it is going to \ncost me something big, but I am very grateful for it. As I said last \nnight, one of the reasons we were successful, one of the reasons this \nbill is as good as it is, is that I have had the very strong support of \nTrent Lott and our leadership. Having their support is like having a \nstone wall to your back in a gun fight: You can still get killed, but \nnobody is going to shoot you in the back. That has been very \nbeneficial. Trent Lott's willingness to say we are going to follow this \npath, whether it leads us to success or failure, is really what has led \nus to success.\n  I appreciate those kind comments and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, are we back on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are back on the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 10 minutes of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley Act. This legislation is of critical importance to America \nand will benefit our nation's financial services companies and American \nconsumers. Quite simply, I believe it helps pave the way to our \ncontinued economic prosperity.\n  This legislation will ensure stronger consumer protections in the \nrapidly changing and consolidating world of financial services. The \nlegislation is important to consumers, because the industry is already \nchanging dramatically, but through regulatory backdoors and without \nmuch-needed consumer protections. Banks, securities firms, and \ninsurance companies--historically separated from one another--have \nalready started engaging in each others' business, and there have been \nno affirmative protections in place for the nation's consumers. This \nlaw rectifies that situation.\n  I do have some concerns with certain sections regarding federal \npreemption of state laws that I hope to clarify. Throughout \nconsideration of this legislation--S. 900, H.R. 10, and the chairmen's \nmark--I have worked with my colleagues to make sure that the final \nlanguage of the bill does not adversely affect recently passed consumer \nprotection legislation in my home state of North Carolina.\n  North Carolina is a leading state in the financial services world on \nseveral fronts. We are home to some of the largest banks in the \ncountry. We are home to some of the strongest and most innovative \ncommunity development groups in the country. We see, every day, how \nwell these players work with one another to provide convenient banking \nservices to all North Carolinians.\n  North Carolina is also a leader in consumer protections. Our state \nGeneral Assembly recently passed two important pieces of consumer \nlegislation that had broad support. First, the General Assembly passed \nlegislation that will require Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North \nCarolina--a non-profit--to create a public trust to help fund public \nhealth expenses in the event it converts to for-profit status. Its \nrationale was simple. A company should not be able to use its not-for-\nprofit status--a government granted exemption from taxation--to build \nmarket dominance and then convert to for-profit status. In that \nsituation, the not-for-profit status would have acted as a government \nsubsidy, and conversion should not be allowed without some form of \nassessment for the subsidy. This legislation had bipartisan support and \nwas agreed to by all parties.\n  Throughout consideration of financial modernization legislation, I \nhave steadfastly supported language that will protect this law from \npossible federal preemption. The conference report accompanying the \nlegislation indicates that this type of law is not of the sort for \nwhich federal preemption would come into play. Specifically, the report \nnoted that ``[t]he House receded on its provision specifically \naddressing a North Carolina Blue Cross-Blue Shield organization, as the \nState laws governing those types of entities would not be preempted so \nlong as the State laws do not discriminate . . .''. Because the North \nCarolina law places a requirement on Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North \nCarolina regardless of any possible affiliation, it treats identically \nall interested parties seeking to affiliate or acquire. A bank that \nmight want to acquire Blue Cross/Blue Shield must comply with the law \nin the same way as a car dealership, or any other potential acquirer, \nwould. Therefore, it is impossible to argue that the law is in any way \ndiscriminatory.\n  The other critical piece of legislation is a recently passed law that \nprohibits the financing of products like credit insurance in home \nmortgages. In recent years, including credit insurance costs in the \nmortgage was a favorite tactic of some predatory institutions--a tactic \nthat ultimately cost consumers thousands of dollars. North Carolina is \na leader in making sure its residents are protected from predatory \nlending and financing practice, predominant over what may be weaker \nfederal standards or laws.\n\n[[Page S13884]]\n\n  The State of North Carolina enacted this law on July 22, 1999. The \nlaw, among other things, regulates mortgage financing and what non-\nhousing products may be included. For example, it bars the lump sum \nfinancing of credit insurance premiums in consumer home loans. The \nlaw was intended to regulate mortgages and to prevent a potentially \nmisleading form of home lending. It does not prevent credit insurance \nfrom being provided for home loans on a monthly basis, but merely cuts \noff financing the premiums up-front since the state General Assembly \ndetermined that such financing is fundamentally unfair. Congress does \nnot intend to preempt this law in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\n  I believe that this North Carolina law regulates mortgage financing \nand does not target the ability of an insured depository to sell \ninsurance products. The focus of my state's legislature was on \nmortgages and efforts to shoehorn other products into the cost of the \nmortgage. The legislature would have acted the same way if mortgage \nlenders had been attempting to include lump sum financing of moving \nexpenses or a new TV. However, if it were determined that the law \nconcerns insurance sales activities, this Act still would not preempt \nthe North Carolina provision. At most, the North Carolina law regulates \nhow credit insurance is sold--the prohibition on financing credit \ninsurance premiums cuts off one avenue of sale while leaving all other \navenues open. As Section 104(d)(2) of the Act states, such laws are not \npreempted unless they ``prevent or significantly interfere with the \nactivities of depository institutions or their affiliates.'' The North \nCarolina law does neither. Banks may still sell credit insurance in \nconnection with mortgages, only one sale technique is foreclosed.\n  In addition to the two consumer protection matters I just mentioned, \nI wanted to say a few words about the privacy provisions in this \nlegislation. A great deal of debate centered on personal financial \ninformation and the way banks, securities firms and insurance companies \nmay use that information. Privacy in financial services is an extremely \ncomplex issue because what one person may view as an invasion of \nprivacy, another might appreciate as a timely and appropriate offering \nof a much-needed service. I think it is important to realize that the \nissue of protecting personal privacy is not limited to the financial \nservices world. In our meetings, we also spoke of privacy of medical \ninformation. The news is full of stories of other companies--grocery \nstores, toy makers, appliance stores, telephone companies and others--\nthat are creating massive databases of customer information to be used \nfor marketing products and services.\n  In this legislation, we have given customers the opportunity to \ndecide whether or not they want to let their financial institution \nshare their personal information with a third party. We require \nfinancial institutions to have a privacy policy--and we require that \nthis policy is explained to all the institution's customers. We also \nincluded an important provision that makes it a Federal crime--\npunishable by up to 5 years in prison--to obtain customer information \nthrough fraudulent or deceptive means. I myself would have supported \neven more privacy protection. I am confident that in the next few \nyears, we will be forced to deal with this problem more \ncomprehensively.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few things about the Community \nReinvestment Act. I struggled long and hard with the CRA provisions \nincluded in this law, because CRA is so important to North Carolina and \nto me personally. I wanted to be able to support this bill, but I would \nhave refused to do so if I believed that CRA was undermined. I have \nseen first hand the amazing benefits--to banks and to consumers--that \nhave resulted from CRA.\n  North Carolina banks represent some of the biggest and best CRA \nsuccess stories, and I know from talking to bankers that they work well \nwith community groups to make sure all neighborhoods are served. I \nspoke with several North Carolina community group leaders about the \ncompromise we worked out, and while I know it wasn't their ideal, I \nbelieve that they recognize how much effort went into protecting CRA. \nMost importantly, I want to make sure that everyone knows that before a \nbank can even benefit from the new powers under this legislation, it \nmust have at least a ``satisfactory'' CRA record. And, if it doesn't \nmaintain at least a ``satisfactory'' rating, that bank can't buy any \nother financial firm until it gets its rating back up. What this means \nfor CRA, and for those who actively support its goals, is that the \ncommitments banks make to serving their communities will continue to be \nof paramount importance to their daily business.\n  However, I do worry about some of the reporting burdens being imposed \non CRA groups by this measure. In the last few days, these reporting \nrequirements have been the subject of numerous talks between committee \nmembers and the Treasury Department. Because these requirements are a \nnew idea--the provision was added to S. 900 during floor debate--we \nhave been careful to make sure that the language is clear that the \nprovision will not impose undue burdens on community groups. I fear \nthat unless provisions of this bill are narrowly interpreted, they \ncould provoke a kind of regulatory witch hunt. But I am confident that \nthe spirit of this bill is to diminish regulatory burdens and that all \nprovisions in this law must be interpreted in that light.\n  And so we find ourselves at a truly historic moment. We are about to \npass legislation that will modernize our nation's financial laws, \nincrease competition, increase options for consumers, decrease costs, \nprotect personal financial information and ensure the continued \napplication of the Community Reinvestment Act. We have a good bill \nhere, and I strongly support it.\n  To elaborate, this is a bill that has been long overdue. There are \nthose who have been toiling in the vineyards with respect to this bill \nfor a very long time.\n  Financial services modernization is well recognized throughout the \nSenate as something that is desperately needed. If done the right way, \nwhich I believe this bill accomplished, it is helpful to consumers. It \nwill provide a more competitive market, greater competition, and one-\nstop shopping for consumers of financial services. It will also help \nprovide a coherent legal framework for the operation of the financial \nservices industry in this country.\n  A lot of the things we are doing officially and legally through this \nbill have been done through the back door for years because of the fact \nthat the financial services industry has changed so much in this \ncountry over the last 20 to 30 years. The one position we, on my side, \nfelt most strongly about was, while we believed in financial services \nmodernization and supported it--and I wholeheartedly held that belief--\nit was critical that we be able to maintain the provisions of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, or CRA, because CRA has done so much good \nin this country. It has done so much good in my home State of North \nCarolina to help revitalize chronically economically disadvantaged \nareas, turned neighborhoods around that were crime infested. It has \nbeen an extraordinarily positive thing, something the banks in my State \nof North Carolina strongly support, always have supported, and continue \nto support.\n  The one other issue is that of privacy. We made some positive steps \nwith respect to privacy. Since essentially there was very little \nregulation of people's personal privacy in existing law, we made a \npositive step in that direction. But there is probably still additional \nwork to do in that area.\n  Let me talk, again, about the Community Reinvestment Act, which is \nthe foundation for us being able to get a bill. The Community \nReinvestment Act has had such an extraordinarily positive impact on \nareas of our country that desperately needed financial support. The \nbedrock principle in our negotiations on this legislation was that no \nbank should be allowed to take advantage of the expanded services \navailable under this bill unless they had a satisfactory CRA rating. As \na result of much discussion and negotiation between the parties \ninvolved in this bill, we have been able to accomplish that. I believe \nwe have done what needed to be done to maintain the fundamental \nprinciple of CRA.\n  In addition, we have been able to provide that no bank can acquire or \nmerge with another institution unless it has at least a satisfactory \nCRA rating. We worked very hard to make sure that\n\n[[Page S13885]]\n\nprinciple remained in place. After much discussion and negotiation, \nafter the bill passed the Senate over the objection of a number of us \nbecause we believed it weakened CRA, in the conference committee and in \nthe discussions we were able to get this principle reinstated. We have \ndone the most fundamental thing that had to be done in order to get a \nbill, which is to make sure CRA was in place, that it remained vibrant \nand strong, and that no bank could take advantage of the provisions of \nthese expanded services available under this bill unless they had a \nsatisfactory CRA rating.\n  I believe in CRA. I think it is an extraordinarily positive thing for \nthe country. The banks in my State believe in it. They have done a \nwonderful job complying with the provisions of CRA. We have been able, \nthrough hard work and negotiation, to maintain those critical \nprovisions of CRA in this bill.\n  This bill also contains some positive steps in the area of privacy. \nWe had, as I indicated earlier, very little protection for people's \npersonal financial records in banking and financial institutions prior \nto the enactment of this bill. Assuming we are able to pass this \nconference report today, there will be some positive steps in that \ndirection. The reality is, though, there are a number of us, myself \nincluded, who believe we need to go further, that there is more that \nneeds to be done to protect people's privacy.\n  Folks have a fundamental right to know what is happening with their \npersonal financial information and to know it is not being used in \ninappropriate ways.\n  This bill takes a positive step in that direction. I think for that \nreason it makes sense to support the bill. However, I believe there is \nmore work that needs to be done in this area. Many of us on our side, \nincluding the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, believe there is more \nto be done in this area.\n  Financial modernization, as contained in this bill, will also help \nensure continued economic growth in this country. The reason for that \nis that now our banks, our financial institutions in this country, will \nbe able to compete in the global marketplace because our financial \ninstitutions have operated for many years now under rules that were \nantiquated, which in this environment and marketplace made no sense, \nand with which foreign competitors, who also do business in the United \nStates, didn't have to comply. With continued prosperity and growth so \nimportant in our country, it was important that we be able to have \nmodernization in the financial services industry. This bill \naccomplishes that.\n  It will be good, as I indicated, not only for domestic competition, \nto allow banks to compete with one another and, as a result, lower \ncosts for consumers, but it also allows our banks to compete \ninternationally, which is critically important.\n  Finally, I thank those who worked so long and hard on this bill. \nThere are many who worked long and tirelessly on this bill: First, \nSenator Sarbanes, our ranking member, who has been one of my mentors in \nmy 10 months here in the Senate, who is a remarkable leader; he has \nshown remarkable leadership and guidance on this bill. Also, Senator \nSarbanes' extraordinary staff, Steve Harris and Marty Gruenberg, who \nare both wonderful, have worked with us throughout this process. This \ncould not have been done without their work and guidance. Also, my \nfriends, Senator Dodd, Senator Schumer, and Senator Reid, who, along \nwith Senator Sarbanes, were in that small room with me late into the \nevening negotiating the provisions of the CRA, which eventually were \ncontained in this legislation and without which there would be no bill. \nThey all worked tirelessly--Senators Dodd, Schumer, Reid, and \nSarbanes--late into the evening, and we were able, finally, to reach a \nreasonable compromise. But it could not have been done without the \nleadership of all of those Senators.\n  Senators Shelby and Bryan worked very hard on the issue of privacy. \nPhilosophically, and in my heart, I am with them on that issue. I think \nwe have made positive steps in the area of privacy. Senators Shelby and \nBryan are fundamentally right that the American people deserve and \nbelieve they deserve the right to have their personal financial \ninformation protected. They showed great leadership in that area. \nSenators Johnson, Kerrey, and Bayh, throughout this process, have \nworked with us very long and hard, and without their support this \nlegislation would not have been possible.\n  Finally, I mention our chairman, Senator Gramm, beside whom I had \noccasion to sit for many hours on that Thursday night and Friday \nmorning when we were able to finally reach agreement on this bill. \nWithout his hard work and leadership and willingness to compromise and \nnegotiate, ultimately, this bill would not exist. The majority leader \nis right in that respect. So I applaud him for his work on this bill, \nand I applaud him particularly for his willingness to compromise, to \nnegotiate, and to have a back-and-forth discussion with those of us who \nhad somewhat different views on issues such as CRA privacy.\n  Finally, to Chairmen Leach and Bliley and ranking members LaFalce and \nDingell, who did great work throughout this process, including that \nlate-evening meeting that went to 2:30 or 3 o'clock in the morning; and \nSecretary Summers and members of the Treasury Department who were in \nthat room working tirelessly with us, particularly to iron out some of \nthe details associated with the compromises that were reached that \nnight.\n\n  I do believe this is a historic piece of legislation. I think it is a \npiece of legislation that benefits consumers; it will increase \ncompetition in this country; it will lower prices. I believe it will \nallow for one-stop shopping for folks who want to go to one place and \nhave all their financial services provided, and it makes positive steps \nin the area of privacy, although there is still work left to be done.\n  Also, most fundamentally, it protects the critical principles of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, which has been such a positive law in this \ncountry and has had such an extraordinarily positive impact on my home \nState. I have seen neighborhoods that have literally been turned around \nby CRA, the Community Reinvestment Act. Because of the work and \nnegotiation that went into this legislation, I believe we have \nsatisfied the fundamental principles of CRA.\n  Mr. President, I urge colleagues to support and vote for this \nconference report. It is the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of \npeople and a lot of compromises.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, before yielding to the Senator from \nConnecticut, I acknowledge and express my deep appreciation to the \nSenator from North Carolina for his very positive and constructive \ncontributions throughout the process of developing this legislation. He \nreally made a very important difference in helping to get us through \nsome satisfactory resolutions of some difficult questions. I am very \nappreciative to him.\n  Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague \nand ranking member of the Banking Committee.\n  I rise today, as well, in strong support of this very historic \nconference report accompanying S. 900, which I believe will receive \nstrong bipartisan support by Members of this body as well as in the \nHouse and will be signed into law by President Clinton.\n  Nearly 70 years ago, the Glass-Steagall Act, which provided the \nfoundation for separating domestic banking, securities, and insurance \nactivities, was enacted into law. Advances in technology, the change in \nour Nation's capital markets, and the very fast-growing globalization \nof financial services have demanded that we as a legislative body \nexamine and make some changes to our financial laws to accommodate and \nto take into consideration these dramatic changes that have occurred. \nMaking these changes has not been easy. The task of creating a new \nregulatory framework that strengthens consumer protections and, at the \nsame time, fosters market efficiencies and industry innovations has \nbeen extremely difficult. Endless hours, days, weeks, and years of \nnegotiations have been spent to craft legislation to allow our Nation's \nfinancial services industries to remain leaders in the global \nmarketplace.\n\n[[Page S13886]]\n\n  I have been a member of the Senate Banking Committee since the first \nday I was sworn into the Senate, almost 19 years ago. I think this \neffort dates to about 1967 or 1968, more than 30 years ago. This has \nbeen an ongoing debate and issue on the part of the Banking Committees \nof the Senate and the House, the Commerce Committee, and numerous \nefforts at the executive branch level. But certainly over the last 20 \nyears, on numerous occasions, this body has enacted reforms to \nfinancial services only to watch the legislation die either in \nconference or be unable to reach a final consideration on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n\n  So I speak today on behalf of a lot of people who have come before \nus. I think of people such as Senator Don Riegle of Michigan, who \nworked very hard on this; Senator Jake Garn; William Proxmire, the \nfirst chairman I served under on the Banking Committee. They all \nlabored hard to try to come up with a means by which we might modernize \nthese services. Certainly, those who predated those Members I mentioned \nworked diligently over the years to try to see if they could modernize \nthese financial services to accommodate the efficiencies and demands of \nthe end of the 20th century. We begin, in about 60 days, a new \nmillennium, where already the ability to transact financial business on \na global basis can be done in nanoseconds around the globe--a far cry \nfrom where we were 3 years ago when this effort first began to try to \naddress some of the realities that had overtaken the Glass-Steagall \nAct, as sound a piece of legislation as it was, which was adopted so \nmany years ago.\n  So today I speak not only on behalf of the conference report that I \nthink accomplishes the task so many who came before us labored to \nachieve, but this landmark legislation dramatically modernizes our \nfinancial laws to allow banks, securities firms, and insurance \ncompanies to affiliate and provide a rational process for these \naffiliations to take place--not one done by court decision or simply by \nregulation, but, as the legislative body in this country, we have now \nauthorized regulation through the deliberate process of hearings, \nmarkup of bills, consideration on the floor of the Senate, and a \nconference report. While it is laborious, rather, to go through that, \nand difficult, it is far better, in my view, to establish these laws on \nthat basis than to be relying strictly on the courts and regulators to \ndo so.\n  I welcome this day as a day of success and triumph for the \nlegislative body exercising its responsibilities to put its strong \nimprint on how this process ought to work.\n  As we enter the 21st century, S. 900 will help, in my view, to \ncontinue our Nation's financial services leadership in the global \nmarketplace--that is a critical issue--remaining competitive abroad but \nhelping to continue to create new jobs and new opportunities for \nliterally millions of people here at home.\n  This legislation also provides significant benefits and protections \nto investors and financial services consumers who will not only benefit \nfrom the competition of these diversified firms, but who will also \nbenefit from standardized and comprehensive protections for the sale of \nfinancial products.\n  There are a number of aspects of this conference report that I would \nlike to touch upon very briefly.\n  Critical to my support--and I think many others--of any financial \nservices modernization legislation was ensuring that banks continue to \ninvest in the communities in which they serve.\n  I have often stated that if the price of modernizing our financial \nservices industry would be to deny fair access of credit to those who \nneed it the most, I was not willing to pay that price, nor do I think \nmany others would.\n  This legislation before us not only preserves current investment in \nour communities, but it actually strengthens both the intent and the \npractical effect of the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  Under this legislation, CRA will continue to apply to all banks \nregardless of size or location, without exception.\n  Additionally, this legislation will guarantee that no bank with an \nunsatisfactory CRA rating can engage in any new financial activities of \ninsurance or securities.\n\n  This is fundamentally an important change. For the first time, a \nbank's CRA rating will be a consideration if it attempts to engage in \nnew financial activities. That is a major triumph.\n  Some legitimate concerns have been raised over the potential burden \non community groups and banks imposed by reporting requirements. I have \nworked hard, as have others, to make sure that no undue burden is \nplaced on community groups and that the appropriate Federal banking \nregulations will have adequate discretion to ensure that result.\n  We are going to need to watch this and see to it that it doesn't \noccur over the coming weeks and months. But I am confident that with \nthe provisions in this bill any efforts to try to become punitive or \noverreaching when it comes to regulations will be met with responsible \nregulatory action. So we will be monitoring that action very carefully.\n  S. 900 reaffirms that the State regulation of insurance codified by \nMcCarran-Ferguson remains intact, a very important provision. It \nfurther provides an orderly process for resolving differences between \nStates and Federal regulators on bank insurance activities.\n  This legislation reinforces further the essential concept that \ninvestors need protection regardless of whether they purchase \nsecurities from a broker, bank, or other entity.\n  S. 900 ensures that in creating this new financial structure the \nintegrity of our markets is maintained and that investor protections \nare enhanced.\n  With the rapid change in our financial markets, this legislation \nensures that investors remain protected, which is fundamentally a \ncritical area to all of us.\n  Another area that needs improvement is the protection of consumer \nprivacy. We did not go far enough, in my view, in this bill in doing \nthat. There were some steps made that are certainly an improvement over \nthe status quo. But I believe far more action is necessary in this area \nthan incorporated in this bill.\n  This legislation contains some important privacy protections. For the \nfirst time, financial institutions must disclose to consumers their \nintent to share or sell personal financial information to anyone. \nAlthough stronger provisions which I have supported along with many \nothers were not approved by the conference, I believe that we have sent \na strong signal to the industry about the use of sensitive consumer \ninformation. I happen to believe that consumers not only have the right \nto know, but also have a right to say no to the sharing of their \npersonal financial information with anybody. This erosion of the \nprivacy of our most personal, sensitive financial information can and \nmust be stopped.\n  I hope the privacy provisions contained in this bill will be an \nimportant first step to ensuring and addressing this critically \nimportant issue.\n  I am a coauthor along with the ranking Democrat of this committee, \nSenator Sarbanes, and others of the Financial Information Privacy Act, \nS. 187, that was introduced in this Congress. We welcome further \ncosponsors of this bill. This is a matter that people care about \nregardless of place in the country, ideology, or financial status.\n  It is unsettling to people to know that when a merger or acquisition \noccurs, while you shared certain financial information with those with \nwhom you initially negotiated, all of a sudden there is a new entity \ninvolved, and somehow that information you shared with a company is \ngoing to become the product of another industry that you didn't \nanticipate when you shared the initial information.\n\n  Certainly, people are finding it unsettling. They know it goes on. \nThe unsolicited inquiries they receive by telephone and mail certainly \nindicate that financial services information that people thought was \nbeing held private is becoming far too public.\n  This is an issue on which we have to spend more time. It needs to be \naddressed. I am aware of the concern of the industry. But consumer \ndemands in this area are not going to go away.\n  Further, let me say it isn't just a question of banks. Customers \nwould be given, under this proposal, the important opportunity to \nprevent banks and securities firms from disclosing or selling this \ninformation to affiliates before banks and security firms could \ndisclose or sell information to a third party.\n\n[[Page S13887]]\n\n They would be required to give notice to the consumer and obtain the \nexpress written permission of the consumer before making any such \ndisclosure.\n  I will continue to press for even greater privacy protections than \nare presently included in this bill.\n  This is a good bill, as I said at the outset. There are a lot of \npeople who can rightfully claim credit for having been significant \nplayers in producing this product. No single individual was responsible \nfor this result.\n  As I mentioned, there are the people who are no longer in public \nlife, some of whom have even passed away, who can literally be called \ninheritors of this product and responsible in some ways for the success \nwe are announcing today.\n  I mention the previous chairmen of the Banking Committee in the \nSenate, certainly previous banking chairs of the House side, former \nSecretaries of the Treasury, and different administrations must feel \nsome sense of accomplishment today as we achieve this result. They were \na part of that historic journey which began so many years ago.\n  There were 66 conferees, an unwieldy number. Twelve percent of the \nU.S. Congress were members of this conference. Certainly, each and \nevery one of them were involved to one degree or another. Though the \nnumber was unwieldy, I think all of the members played an important and \nconstructive role from time to time.\n  I commend Senator Al D'Amato, our former colleague from New York, who \nis no longer a member of this body but was chairman of this committee \nlast year. He crafted a good bill, H.R. 10. It wasn't adopted into law. \nBut a lot of what we have in front of us today was part of that bill \nlast year. He did a good job. While we are of different parties and \ndifferent political persuasions on many matters, Al D'Amato is a friend \nof mine. I have always thought of him to be such, and he deserves some \nrecognition today as we talk about the accomplishments of this bill.\n  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who I have served with on the Banking \nCommittee now for many years--I have worked with him on numerous pieces \nof legislation but nothing quite of the import of this bill--is a tough \nnegotiator. He is knowledgeable and he is smart. He worked hard on this \nbill and deserves credit as chairman of the committee for the final \nresult and for pulling the pieces together.\n  It has been mentioned by my good friend, Senator John Edwards of \nNorth Carolina. I see my colleague from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, who \nwas there that evening. Rod Grams, who is on the floor at this moment, \nwas in the room. That was quite an evening.\n  I suppose history books will expand the size of the number of people \nwho were in that room that night as oftentimes happens. It wasn't that \nbig a room. There were not that many people in the room. But I have \nsaid to the chairman of the committee that I admired his stamina that \nnight. He was there pretty much taking arrows and glances from the \nFederal Reserve Board, the Treasury, House Democrats, and Senate \nDemocrats. While we fought hard, I admired his stamina, his stick-to-\nitiveness, his willingness to stay in the room to get the job done.\n\n  I begin by commending Senator Gramm for his fine work. Obviously, our \nranking Democrat, Senator Sarbanes, with whom I have sat next to on \nthis committee for almost 20 years, without his leadership I don't \nbelieve we would have achieved the result we have today. I commend him \nfor his fine work not only in this bill but over the years for the job \nhe has done paying detailed attention to critical pieces of \nlegislation, a sense of patience when others wanted to rush to a quick \nresult.\n  More often than not, when Senator Sarbanes suggests we slow down, it \nis not for idle reasons. He is as knowledgeable as any individual I \nknow, and he pays attention to the details. Too often we don't pay \ncareful enough attention to the details and they can come back to haunt \nMembers of Congress. I commend him for his terrific work.\n  Also, I commend Congressman Leach, the chairman of the House Banking \nCommittee, John LaFalce, Chairman Bliley, and Chairman Dingell, all \nwith whom I have served over the years in the House. John LaFalce and I \nwere elected to Congress on the same day: 25 years ago Tuesday night we \nwere elected to Congress the first time. Today, he is the ranking \nDemocrat on that committee. And Jim Leach, Chairman Bliley, and John \nDingell all did a very fine job in working on this.\n  I thank the Banking Committee staff, both the minority and the \nmajority, for the work they have done on this legislation. I begin with \nAlex Sternhell, who is my staff person who has worked so hard on this \nlegislation. Again, like Alex who has worked hard going back 19 years, \nit began with Ed Silverman of my office, who was on the Banking \nCommittee, along with a series of terrific staff members who have \ntraveled this road on financial services modernization. Ed Silverman, \nMarti Cochran, Peter Kinzler, Michael Stein, Paul Hannah, Courtney \nWard, and Andrew Lowenthal should be commended for all of their help. \nAlex did a great job on this. I thank him. Steve Harris, Marty \nGruenberg and the wonderful job of working so many years, Patience \nSingleton, Dean Shahinian, and others on the minority side have been \nintegral to this process, including Wayne Abernathy, Linda Lord, Geoff \nGray, Dina Ellis, and others have made tremendously valuable \ncontributions. I want the record to reflect my appreciation and \nadmiration for their work.\n  The administration has remained firm in their commitment to passage \nof this legislation. John Podesta, Gene Sperling, and others have \nplayed critical roles during this process and were very involved on \nThursday night and Friday morning working out the final version of the \nbill.\n  We should not forget that former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who \npushed very hard for the legislation, did a terrific job on it and \nplayed a pivotal role in drafting the legislation. Larry Summers, his \nsuccessor, deserves great credit for his contributions as well, and the \nwhole team at the Treasury--Alan Greenspan and his capable staff; \nArthur Levitt, Chairman of the SEC, for his contribution to the \nfinancial services modernization, particularly the critical pieces that \naffect the securities industry and investor protections. This would not \nhave been adopted if not for his fine work.\n  Lastly, of course, the members of our committee. Jack Reed was there \nthat night and did a terrific job. I want the record to reflect that \nthe Boy Scouts of America, particularly, owe Jack Reed a debt of \ngratitude. He discovered what could have been a very significant \nloophole in this bill and used the example that the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica could be adversely affected. While it is not so named in the \nbill, that provision will be known by those in the room that night as \nthe Jack Reed Boy Scout amendment. They got a good deal of support on \nbehalf of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n  John Edwards and Chuck Schumer, new members of the committee, were \nthere, along with Jack Reed, and did a terrific job as new members of \nthe committee, wading right in and making a significant contribution; \nalso, John Kerry and Dick Bryan, who cared so much about privacy issues \nand fought hard. We did not get all we needed, but we had a tremendous \nvoice in those efforts. Evan Bayh and Tim Johnson played critical \nroles, as well.\n  I have often said over the years of trying to achieve financial \nmodernization I am reminded of the mythical figure Sisyphus who rolled \nthe rock up the hill only to have it roll back down the hill when he \ngot near the top. I have a painting of Sisyphus that I cherish. Today, \nI can report that the rock is at the top of the hill and I think it \nwill stay there.\n  To all who have been involved in this, my sincere thanks for their \ntremendous efforts. The industry people and outside groups who make \nvaluable contributions deserve recognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from \nConnecticut for his very fine remarks and also acknowledge the very \npositive and constructive role he played throughout this process that \nhelped the Senate get a product that we can bring back and recommend to \nour colleagues in the Senate, after having it initially in the Senate \non a very divided vote. There were a number of very difficult issues to \nwork out and the Senator from Connecticut was intimately involved with\n\n[[Page S13888]]\n\nall or most of those issues. We are very appreciative of him for the \ninstructive contribution that was made.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for his kind words and \nhis great leadership, along with Senator Sarbanes.\n  I rise to support the conference report on S. 900, the Financial \nServices Modernization Act of 1999. We are on the verge of a historic \ntransformation of the financial services industry that will take it \nfrom the Depression-era laws of Glass-Steagall and position it to meet \nthe challenges of the next century.\n  Some may argue this legislation is a ratification of what the market \nhas already done, but it is an important ratification because it will \nallow our financial institutions to be more efficient and more \neffective. I think it will accomplish two fundamental and very \nimportant goals. First, it will provide more efficient access to \nfinancial services which will directly benefit consumers in terms of \nbetter service and lower cost. Second, it will make our financial \ninstitutions much more competitive in a world of globalized financial \ntransactions. These two goals have been achieved in this legislation. I \nam proud to support the legislation.\n  It is also incumbent upon us to understand and underscore some of the \nconcerns that still remain after this legislation is passed. Again, let \nme emphasize this legislation will increase the efficiency and \neffectiveness of our financial services industry and will benefit the \nAmerican consumer. As we tear down the walls between banks and \ninsurance companies and securities firms and open up many \npossibilities, we also open many potential pitfalls. I think we should \nbe concerned about those, also.\n  As we celebrate passage today, we should also underscore and point \nout areas that bear close watching. Fundamental changes as we are \nproposing today include consequences which may have adverse effects if \nthey are not anticipated and watched carefully. Among those is the \nissue of the consolidation of our financial services industry. We are \nwitnessing the megamergers that are transforming our financial services \nindustry from small multiple providers to large providers that are very \nfew in number. We run the risk of the doctrine ``too big to fail;'' \nthat the financial institutions will become so large we will have to \nsave them even if they are unwise and foolish in their policies. We \nhave seen this before. We have to be very careful about this.\n  The legislation does not require any market policing requirements \nwith regard to this issue. It does mandate the Federal Reserve, within \n18 months of passage of this bill, will review the impact of potential \nmergers and consolidations in the financial services industry. I think \nthat is appropriate, and I look forward to the report of the Federal \nReserve. Again, this is another issue of which we have to be terribly \nconscious because with this legislation we are allowing a huge \nconcentration across different functional areas of financial activities \nin the United States. Again, I believe it is justified and warranted by \nthe changing conditions of our economy, but we should be careful as we \ngo forward.\n  Another issue that has been mentioned several times before is the \nissue of privacy. The legislation before us is taking a first step in \nprotecting the financial information of the consumers of America, but \nit is just a first step. There are many more steps we must and should \ntake. They will be demanded of us by our constituents, the consumers of \nfinancial services throughout the United States. With the growth of \ncomputer technology and the ability to store and disseminate large \nvolumes of information instantaneously, we will continue to wrestle \nwith these issues of privacy, not just in financial services but in \nevery area of endeavor throughout our economy.\n  We took a first step. We have instructed companies, if they wish to \nshare a customer's private information, they must give that customer \nthe option to say no to that activity. We have also tried to curtail \nsome of the more egregious predatory activities we have witnessed in \nthe last few years with respect to the abuse of consumer information by \nfinancial institutions. As I said before, we are moving ahead with this \nfirst step. We must not only contemplate but also be prepared to take \nother steps in the future to protect the privacy of the American \npeople. This legislation has laid a foundation, but that foundation \nalone will not protect the privacy of the American people.\n\n  There is another issue I would like to comment upon, which has been \ncommented upon by my colleagues also, and that is the issue of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act is not just \na device to allocate resources in poor neighborhoods; it is a \ncommitment by this Government, through the banking industry, to ensure \nthat all Americans have a fair opportunity to participate in the \neconomy and do so in a way that they can benefit themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  Community Reinvestment has been a powerful success over the decade \nsince its passage because it has, for the first time, given many \ncommunities which before were ignored, which before were denied access \nto credit and financial services, those very financial services and \ncredit. As a result, not only did they get the money but they got \nsomething else: They got a feeling of participation and connection to \nthis economy and to this country. That perception, that feeling, is \njust as important as any of the specific programs funded by CRA.\n  What we have done in this legislation is protect the fundamental \nessence of what I think CRA should be about. We have said that if any \nfinancial institution wants to partake of these new, enhanced, expanded \npowers, they must by law have a satisfactory CRA rating. If they do not \nhave a satisfactory CRA rating, they will not be able to take advantage \nof this legislation.\n  I believe the dynamics of the financial industry are such that the \nopportunity to participate in these new powers will be a positive \nforce, ensuring through competition in the marketplace that CRA is not \nneglected, that CRA is still a strong, vital part of any financial \ninstitution. If that is not the case, then we have to be prepared to \nact once again because we cannot abandon the Community Reinvestment \nAct. To do so would be to abandon scores and scores of our fellow \ncitizens. We cannot do that. We should not do that.\n  This legislation with respect to CRA has been improved immensely from \nthe Senate version. As you recall, the original provisions sent forward \nby Chairman Gramm had potentially severe effects on CRA. There was a \ntotal exemption of small banks from any CRA requirements. That would \nrepresent 38 percent of the banks in this country. They would be exempt \ntotally from any recognition of CRA responsibility. That has been \neliminated from this conference report.\n  What we have done is allowed small banks that have satisfactory or \nbetter CRA records to have a longer interval between their inspections. \nBut we have also required and provided that the regulators at any time \ncan conduct a CRA inspection if they have reasonable cause to believe \nthe CRA program is not being followed by that financial institution. \nThese are steps which have strengthened CRA, particularly in contrast \nto the legislation we considered on this floor several months ago.\n  There is another aspect I believe deserves comment, and that is the \nissue of functional regulation. I am very pleased that functional \nregulation has become the order of the day, that the Securities and \nExchange Commission will look at securities activities, banking \nregulators look at banking activities, and the Federal Reserve will \nhave enhanced powers to look at financial holding companies and other \nmajor financial institutions. But I believe we have to recognize we are \ngiving these regulatory authorities new powers, some of which are \nsomewhat novel. They have to have the capacity, both institutionally \nand financially, with resources, to be much more perceptive and much \nmore thorough in their regulatory process-- again hearkening back to \nthe point of the huge potential concentration in these financial \ninstitutions.\n\n  We also understand with respect to this legislation that, in this \narena of functional regulation, there might be some potential \nstalemates.\n  Mr. President, one of the potential roadblocks or stalemates is that \nState\n\n[[Page S13889]]\n\ninsurance commissioners still play an extremely important role. In some \nrespects, unless they are fully integrated through this Federal \nfinancial regulatory structure, we might in fact have problems. That is \nanother issue that bears close watching.\n  There is, I believe, something else we should comment upon, and that \nis the success we have had in allowing the financial services industry \nto choose the mode of operation which best suits their unique situation \nfor an individual company. What I am specifically referring to is the \nlanguage with respect to operating subsidiaries. I know my colleague, \nSenator Shelby of Alabama, has worked long and hard on this. I, too, \nhave worked long and hard on it. We now have a situation where national \nbanks can choose to operate a certain limited spectrum of activities in \na subsidiary or in the holding company. I believe this is sensible. It \nalso gives the Treasury Department a significant role in the regulatory \nprocess since they, too, will be able to regulate some of these new \nactivities. That is important also.\n  One last point I believe bears repeating. We are entering in some \nrespects, a brave new world. The old walls have come down. We have new \nopportunities; new financial vistas have to be explored. It behooves us \nto be very watchful, very careful, and to insist on and ensure that the \nregulators are careful and also that they have the resources to do this \njob. We will all rue the day, this day, if years from now or months \nfrom now we discover that, because of this new flexibility, there are \nmore complicated problems facing us. I think we should go forward but \ngo forward with the notion that we, in fact, are going to regulate well \nand wisely these new powers we are giving financial institutions.\n  Let me conclude by saying this has been the work of many hands. I \nthank Chairman Gramm for his persistent efforts. Our ranking member, \nSenator Sarbanes, has done a remarkable job leading us carefully, \nthoroughly, and thoughtfully. Senator Dodd has been especially \nimportant in this process, bringing us together in moments when we did \nnot think we could come together for final resolution. Senator Schumer, \nmy colleague from New York, was very active throughout this process; \nSenator Edwards, and many others--all of the conferees played critical \nroles. In the other body, Chairman Leach and ranking member LaFalce, \nChairman Dingell and Chairman Bliley, all were very effective.\n  I reserve special words for two members of the administration with \nwhom I have worked over the last several years: Bob Rubin, the former \nSecretary, and John Hawke, the former Comptroller of the Currency.\n  Finally, on my staff, I thank Jonathan Berger and Kevin Davis for \ntheir great work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield to me for a second?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nthank the Senator from Rhode Island for his extraordinary contributions \nthroughout the process of developing this conference report. He has \nmade an extremely valuable contribution to a successful result. I am \ndeeply appreciative.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of \nthis very important legislation that balances the interests of \nindividual consumers with the needs of America's financial services \nindustries.\n  I know names have been mentioned and accolades have gone out, and \nvery well-deserved, to those who need to be thanked for their hard \nwork. I start the list with Senator Phil Gramm who worked very hard \nover this last year. By the way, it was a year ago today following the \nelections that we began consideration of getting this bill back on the \nfloor again. Also, of course, I thank the ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes, who worked very hard as well over these years, and especially \nover the last 12 months, in crafting this bill and making sure of its \nsuccess.\n  I also thank former Treasury Secretary Rubin and the latter \ncontributions by Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Chairman Greenspan \nof the Federal Reserve and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, of course, were \nvery instrumental in this. I thank our colleagues on the House side, \nChairman Leach and Congressman Bliley, for their work and efforts.\n  I could go on. When one does this, they always run the risk of not \nmentioning somebody. There were so many hands in this.\n  Alan Brubaker appears on the list to be commended. Alan is on my \nstaff, and I have to compliment him as well on all the hours he has put \nin on this bill, working very hard staff to staff. Alan has done a \ntremendous job, and I compliment him on his efforts.\n  In testimony before the House Banking Committee, then-Secretary of \nthe Treasury, Robert Rubin, testified that the administration estimated \nenactment of financial modernization legislation will result in annual \nsavings of $15 billion. The important part of this is those savings \nwill end up in the pockets of consumers because in a competitive world, \npeople are going to find the cheapest way in an expanded array of \nfinancial services. The consumers, under this bill, are going to be the \nbiggest benefactors--$15 billion in annual savings in financial \nmodernization.\n  This package of reforms has been under consideration, as we heard, in \none form or another for over two decades. I am proud to be a member of \nthe committee and the Senate that has taken the handoff from those who \ncame before us and carried the ball across the goal line. As Senator \nDodd mentioned, former Senator Alfonse D'Amato should also be \nrecognized for the contributions he made over the years.\n  This has been a top priority for myself. I served on the Banking \nCommittee in the House for the one term I was there, and the No. 1 \npriority when I reached the Senate was to be on the Banking Committee. \nI was never a banker, but I have sat across the table from many \nbankers. I thought it was very important to add the voice of a small \nbusinessman and an individual in banking legislation.\n  This legislation provides the appropriate regulatory framework for an \nevent already occurring throughout the regulatory fiat, and that is the \naffiliation between commercial banks, securities firms, and insurance \ncompanies.\n  We protect consumers by establishing a system of functional \nregulation whereby institutions will be overseen by experts in their \nareas. In other words, the securities operations will continue to be \nsupervised by security experts, banks by banking experts and, of \ncourse, insurance by State insurance commissioners.\n\n  In addition to ensuring a level playing field for business through \nconsistent regulation, again, consumers also benefit because the \ninstitutions with which they are dealing will be regulated by the \nexperts in those products. Thus, by authorizing properly regulated \naffiliations between financial companies, we ensure that our financial \nservices companies will be able to compete worldwide and with \nappropriate regulation at home, they will not be forced to move \noffshore to remain competitive.\n  Although the estimated $15 billion in cost savings will certainly \nbenefit our consumers, the provision which most immediately impacts the \nconsumer, of course, is the establishment of a national floor of \nprivacy protections.\n  A lot of people do not realize that without this bill, we would go \nback to almost zero, except for the fair credit reporting bills. This \nbrings a tremendous number of new protections in privacy to our \nconsumers. It is a major step forward in that area.\n  The consensus contained in this bill will now provide consumers with \nmajor areas of protection beyond current law. Specifically, the \nconference agreement, one, ensures consumers will have greater clarity \nof their financial institution's privacy policies by requiring the \ninstitution to disclose those policies on information sharing--to the \naffiliates and third parties of both current and former customers--at \nthe time the institution establishes a relationship with that customer, \nas well as reviewing those regulations or those policies each and every \nyear. The consumer will have major privacy protections.\n  Two, it provides consumers with the ability to take their names off \nthe list,\n\n[[Page S13890]]\n\nin other words, to opt out if they do not want their personal \ninformation shared with a nonaffiliated third party.\n  Three, it criminalizes the actions of bad actors who use false \npretense or, in other words, lie to obtain a consumer's personal \nfinancial information.\n  Four, it preserves all existing and all future State privacy \nprotections above and beyond the national floor established in this \nbill. It allows the States to set their levels as well.\n  Five, it authorizes a study to review whether further privacy \nmeasures are needed. That is very important because as we complete this \nbill--nobody has ever written a perfect bill, I do not think, out of \nWashington, and it is very important to review what we have done and \nlook at what else needs to be done. But this review is going to be very \nimportant as well in the area of privacy.\n  Although the central purpose of the bill is to remove decades-old \nbarriers to the integration of the financial services industry, by \nrecognizing that privacy is both a very important issue to the consumer \nand a responsibility of the financial institution, the bill puts in \nplace the framework to ensure the consumer is protected and allows the \nfinancial industry to expand services and products.\n  I recognize the debate over privacy has not been concluded with these \nchanges. The enthusiasm these provisions have garnered, as well as the \nexpressions of support Congress has received for recent actions to \nprevent implementation of the FDIC's ``Know Your Customer'' rule and to \nrestrict the ability of States to sell driver's license information, \ndemonstrates the public's concern over these privacy issues.\n  I look forward to further debate on these issues following the \ncomprehensive hearings Chairman Gramm has pledged to hold after we have \nreceived the findings of the report called for in this bill. After \nfurther study, we will all be better equipped to consider the issue of \nprivacy. In the meantime, I firmly believe we have provided stronger \nprotections for the consumer.\n  Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues for all their hard work. I \nstrongly urge them to support this conference report.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I believe the record will reflect that the \nSenator from Nevada, pursuant to a unanimous consent agreement, has 30 \nminutes to speak. If I am so informed, I would like to yield myself a \npart of the time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, and my colleagues, when we are talking about the \nfinancial institutions and affiliates and nonaffiliates, and \ninternational banking transactions, those are concepts which most of my \nconstituents, and I daresay most of the constituents of all of my \ncolleagues, see as having very little relevance to their lives. There \nare not too many people in the country whose lives are intimately \ninvolved, on a day-to-day basis, with affiliate sharing of information \nor involved in major financial transactions.\n  Most of us have an insurance policy or two, and increasingly--about \n50 percent--American families now have stock ownership in some form or \nanother. Most of us have bank accounts, and that is probably the extent \nof the average American family in terms of financial information. So I \nthink it may be instructive if I put some context into this debate we \nare having.\n  We have experienced, in the decade of the 1990s, an extraordinary \nrapidity of change, if you will, in the way in which financial \nservices--banking, insurance, and stock securities--are handled in this \ncountry.\n  We have also seen an enormous number of mergers across the board in \nAmerican business. To some extent, it is almost a sense of deja vu \nbecause at the end of the last century, in the 1890s, we saw a \ntremendous consolidation of industry in the country. Many will recall \nthat was a period of time in which we had vast industrial cartels and \ntrusts. So there was an enormous concentration of wealth and power in \nsome of these large industrial concerns that were just taking shape in \nthe latter part of the 19th century.\n  In a sense, as the 20th century is coming to a close, that pace has \nquickened. The critics would say we are experiencing a sense of merger \nmania or merger frenzy. So many of the major financial institutions in \nthe country are participating in that.\n  Just a couple of examples: Citibank and Travelers have come together; \nNationsBank and Bank of America--and I could point out countless \nhundreds.\n  What impact does that have on the average citizen in this country? I \nthink it is fair to say, none of us really know.\n  The advocates for these mergers and consolidations are saying: Look. \nWe will provide new convenience to the American public, we will have \none-stop shopping for insurance and banking and securities; that it \nwill be less expensive; that more options will be provided. That may, \nin fact, be the case. I think none of us know for sure.\n  The critics raise the specter that this concentration of power, this \nenormous business combine that is taking place across the whole range \nof financial services, may not be good for the country; that that kind \nof concentration of wealth, as we learned a century ago, may be bad for \nthe public. I have not reached a judgment on that.\n  I was fully prepared to support this legislation because I recognize \nanother reality. Historically, from the 1930s, banking, insurance, and \nsecurities were separated in three discrete and separate categories: If \nyou wanted to have a banking transaction, you went to the bank; if you \nwanted to get insurance coverage, you went to an insurance company; if \nyou wanted to dabble in the stock market or wanted to buy stocks or \nbonds, you went to a stockbroker.\n  That is the way most Americans have historically dealt with the \nfinancial services industry. That was as a result of legislation \nenacted after the great financial collapse of the Great Depression to \nprotect against this consolidation of power that many thought was a \ncontributing factor to the collapse of the financial industry in \nAmerica in 1929. It is called Glass-Steagall. So if that name comes up, \nthat is what that means.\n  I think that reality and fairness would dictate that the model which \nregulates those industries as three separate and discrete industries \nhas no longer relevance in America today. Whether it should, whether we \nwish that was still the case, in point of fact several things have \noccurred.\n  Court decisions, decisions by administrative agencies, have, in \neffect, torn down those walls of separation. Increasingly, we are \nhaving a lot of those services, the banking and the insurance and the \nsecurities functions, kind of merged together. As a result of that, I \nthink it is fair to say--and the advocates have made this point--the \nfinancial regulatory structure that emerged as a consequence of the \nGreat Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act, no longer comports with the \nreality of the marketplace. That is fair and that is true.\n  So we need a new regulatory model, a new framework. This legislation \nhas much to commend it. And it provides that regulatory framework. \nEssentially, we are saying in this legislation: Look, if you are \nproviding an insurance service, you ought to be regulated by the same \nregulator, whether you are a small independent insurance office in \nWinnemucca, NV, or whether you are operating in the ionosphere of some \nof the major Wall Street concerns in the financial center of our \ncountry in New York City. That is called functional regulation.\n  So that is the background.\n  As I said, I had hoped to be able to support this legislation. I \nrecognize it has been worked on for many years. The reality of this \nalso has to be tempered by another reality, and that is the right of \nprivacy. For more than a century, we have recognized in America the \nright of privacy. That right of privacy, as we know it today, is \nthreatened and endangered. It is threatened and endangered by some of \nthe marvelous technologies of our time.\n  Let's talk about financial services for a moment in terms of that \ntechnology. It was not too long ago that when you went to a bank, if \nyou were going to make a bank deposit, you saw a teller, and he or she, \nby hand, posted, entered--there was kind of a carbon\n\n[[Page S13891]]\n\nsheet--the deposit in the record. If you were applying for insurance, \nyou manually filled out papers; your insurance agent compiled all of \nthis, and he kind of kept a carbon copy. Twenty years ago, when we got \ninto Xerox capability, he had duplication capability. The same thing \nwas essentially true for securities.\n\n  What has changed all of that? Some very positive and powerful forces: \nComputerization. As a result of some software programs, it is possible \nto gather data and profile it, whether you are a bank depositor, \nwhether you are an individual who is an insurance customer, or whether \nyou are a stock and bond owner and you have your account with a \nsecurities firm. Just a stroke of the key now can bring that data up. \nWhat does that mean?\n  It means that if I am a marketer and I want to get a profile of \nsomebody who, say, has an average bank account balance of $50,000, no \nlonger would it be necessary for some poor devil in a green eye shade \nlaboring in some dimly lit corner of some financial company to go \nthrough and pull the records manually. Today, a sophisticated software \nprogram can simply, with a key stroke, bring up that information. That \ninformation is very valuable. It is very comprehensive. Today, most \nAmericans have an enormous amount of their personal financial data, the \nkind of thing that is very personal--their bank account, what checks \nthey are writing and to whom, what kind of insurance coverages they \nhave, their application indicating any health problems they might \nhave--as part of a database. It is on a computer disk drive. What kind \nof stocks and bonds they have, what kind of certificates of deposit \nthey may own and when they may come up--that database is there.\n  I think most of us have this vague concept that when we are dealing \nwith our bank, when we are dealing with our insurance company, when we \nare dealing with our stockbroker, that stuff is confidential. Isn't it? \nIsn't that similar to talking with your lawyer about a legal problem or \nyour doctor about a medical problem or even sharing with your local \npastor, your rabbi, your minister, your religious advisor? Isn't there \na privilege there? It is kind of confidential. Certainly you, as an \nindividual, think it is confidential. You certainly do not have the \nexpectation that that information is going to be shared. If that was \nyour expectation, I regret to tell you that you are wrong because today \nthat information, even without this legislation--and I will talk about \nthat--is freely exchanged.\n  It is big money. It is big money in the sense that individuals who \nshare that information--financial companies--share that information \nbecause they make substantial amounts of money as a result of that.\n  Let me give an indication in terms of what the U.S. Comptroller of \nthe Currency has said: Most large national banks--this is without this \nlegislation--sell customer account information to marketing companies. \nThose are the lovely people who call you at home during the dinner hour \nfrequently or who inundate your mailbox with some type of solicitation.\n  The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency says: Most large national banks \nsell customer account information to marketing companies, and the banks \ntypically get 20 percent to 25 percent of the revenue generated by \nmarketers. Some banks have generated millions of dollars in revenue by \nproviding third parties with information on millions of customers, \nincluding name and address, Social Security number, credit card \nnumbers--all of this according to a Ms. Julie Williams, chief counsel \nto the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.\n\n  This enormous amount of financial information that is collected, \nwhich you give your bank, your insurance company, your security broker, \nis now being freely shared. It is valuable, and it is worth millions of \ndollars. That is the current law.\n  What about this piece of legislation makes the privacy concerns even \nmore heightened? The advocates of this bill will say there are no \nprivacy restrictions now, and that is largely true. Banks, insurance \ncompanies, security houses are free to share this information. So they \nsay: Look, we have some privacy provisions in there. We are taking some \nimportant protections.\n  I will comment on that in a moment. But this bill tears down those \nwalls of separation between banking, between insurance, and between \nsecurities functions, and it kind of merges them altogether.\n  The advocates will say that is going to make it convenient for \neveryone. What it means is that a bank will now be able to own an \naffiliate, a sister company, an insurance company, and so that \ninformation from the bank and its sister affiliate, an insurance \ncompany or a security company, can now be freely exchanged.\n  We are talking about the large brokerage houses in America. We are \ntalking about the largest insurance companies in America. We are \ntalking about the largest banks in America. In effect, that information \nthe banks were selling and making substantial amounts of money on, as \nwas pointed out by the Comptroller of the Currency that they were \nselling to marketers, now, as a result of this legislation, which will \nencourage the formation of these affiliate or sister banking, sister \ninsurance, sister securities relationships, will expand exponentially. \nNo question about that--cross-marketing, that is part of the intent. \nThat is what drives this.\n  There are some realities of the marketplace we all acknowledge. So \nthat information that is in your bank account now can move to an \ninsurance company affiliate, can move to a securities affiliate, and \nthe converse of that is true; it can move in the other direction. You \nhave a stock account; that information can be shared with an affiliate \nthat is an insurance company or a bank.\n  So this information that you would think--and I thought, until I \nbecame a member of this committee and became more familiar with the \nlaws dealing with financial companies--is confidential is now going to \nbe widely shared. And there are big dollars in this. That is why the \nprivacy concerns are heightened, that more of this information is going \nto be shared with more people, the most personal and private kind of \nstuff in your financial history, your health record, as reflected by \nany information on your bank account.\n  Now, what is happening currently before this new law? Let us talk \nabout a couple of examples I think will prove to be particularly \negregious. This is the kind of abuse that occurs.\n  In one case, a 90-year-old woman who had been a customer of a bank \nfor more than 50 years--that would be a trusted relationship; I cannot \nimagine this woman would believe this information would be shared with \nothers, but it was--was billed by a telemarketer for a computer \nproduct. She didn't even own a computer. Before she died, it took her \n11 months to get the telemarketer to remove the charges from her credit \ncard account. Information which the bank had shared, her bank, a \nrelationship of 50 years, one would have to think there was a trust \nrelationship that the depositor had with that bank, but this \ninformation was shared.\n  Let me point out, as has occurred during the course of our \ndiscussion, a situation with respect to the San Fernando Valley Bank. \nThey sold a convicted felon 90 percent of the credit card numbers that \nthe convicted felon used to run up $45.7 million in bogus charges \nagainst those customers. The bank sold that information to a \ntelemarketer.\n  That is what is occurring now, today, without this exponential \nexpansion of the sharing of information. Let me talk about U.S. Bank. \nU.S. Bank was involved in sharing some information, as well. That, too, \nposed some major concerns because this information was being sold to a \ntelemarketer that offered such things as travel and health care \nproducts. The bank received nearly $4 million in commissions for \nselling this information to nearly a million customers. These things \nare occurring.\n  Here is a typical example of what this reflects. This is a deposit \nrecord. It appears that the last deposit was $109,451. What we know is \nthat the lady who made this deposit, perhaps in an off-guarded moment \nof candor, shares with the teller--she is banking the old-fashioned \nway, sharing with the teller--that she is not really sure what to do \nwith this money. One can assume that this money was recently acquired, \nthrough an inheritance or some change of circumstance in her life, and \nshe had a good bit of money that came in, this $109,000. She shares \nthis information with the teller. The teller writes on the bottom: \n``She came in today and wasn't\n\n[[Page S13892]]\n\nsure what she could do with her money.'' Look up here. It says \n``David.'' He is one of these affiliates who is involved with a \nsecurities company. It says: ``David, see what you can do. Thank you, \nteller 12''--whoever teller 12 is. That information is then being \nshared with a securities company, and, undoubtedly, this lady received \na call. She has absolutely no idea that anybody other than perhaps the \nclosest members of her family know she has just come into some money \nand deposited $109,000. That is the kind of stuff that is occurring \nnow.\n  The point I am trying to make is that if those abuses are occurring \nnow--and that is only the tip of the iceberg--imagine what is going to \nbe happening with all of these fire walls having been taken down and \nthe affiliates sharing information.\n  There is one thing I did not make clear. I did point out that banks \nwill be able to assist their affiliate that is an insurance or \nsecurities company, but these affiliates also own other companies, \ncommercial firms that may sell a whole range of products, such as \nsporting goods, travel packages, vacation homes, you name it. So that \nis part of their business currently. With the affiliation sharing, all \nof that information moves downstream within the sister affiliate, which \nis a major concern in terms of these marketing efforts.\n  Now, let's talk about what the bill purports to do. I inquire, how \nmuch time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BRYAN. OK. We will try to do this quickly.\n  Let's talk about the expectation of what people think in terms of \ntheir privacy. I think this is an interesting number. The Wall Street \nJournal did a poll on what our expectations are and what we fear will \nhappen most. Which one or two concerns are you most concerned about in \nthe next century? Loss of personal privacy, 29 percent. This is not \ndone by some do-gooder, ultraliberal social think tank; this is done by \nthe Wall Street Journal, which is the voice of American business. And \n29 percent fear loss of personal privacy.\n  When you ask people, ``Would you mind if a company you did business \nwith sold information about you to another company?'' 92 percent say \nyes. Yes, they mind. The American people care very much about that. \nThey may not know the difference between an op-sub and an affiliate, or \nwhat a unitary thrift is, what a ``whoopie'' is. Those are all terms we \nhave debated here. But they sure know what privacy is about.\n\n  ``In the future, insurance companies and investment firms may be able \nto merge into a single company. If they do, would you support or oppose \nthese newly merged companies internally sharing information?'' That is \nwhat this bill permits.\n  Eighty-one percent say no.\n  Here are some headlines across America: ``Banks Sell Your Secrets,'' \nUSA Today. Los Angeles Times: ``Privacy? Don't bank on it.'' Los \nAngeles Times: ``Your Privacy Could Be a Thing of the Past.''\n  Let's talk about the bill because the bill provides minimal \nprotection. First of all, it tells you the banks are required to post a \npolicy of what their privacy policy is. Here is an existing web page \nwith an existing bank in the country today:\n\n       Question 4: If I request to be excluded from affiliate \n     sharing of information, what information about me and my \n     products and services with you will and will not be shared \n     within your affiliated family of banks and companies?\n\n  That is the question. Here is the answer:\n\n       Answer 4: Even if you request to be excluded from affiliate \n     sharing of information, we will share this other information \n     about you and your products and services with each other to \n     the extent permitted by law.\n\n  This web page would be perfectly appropriate and legal under the new \nlaw. All that is required is a posting of the policy. Now, if anybody \nin America thinks that is an adequate protection for your privacy, I \nwould like to talk about a little piece of property I have in New York \ncalled the Brooklyn Bridge, and we would like to talk about you buying \nit from me. Utterly absurd. That is what is happening.\n  Now, there is absolutely no provision--none, zippo, nada, zero, \nnothing--that prevents the sharing of information from affiliate to \naffiliate. No privacy at all. That is freely exchanged; it is freely \nexchanged.\n  With respect to the third party, the nonaffiliate, we are told, yes, \nthere is an opt-out provision; that is, you can let people know you \nwant that not to be done. OK, that sounds fine, except there are two \nmajor, glaring exceptions. Those are marketing agreements and joint \nmarketing in which those provisions simply do not apply. So if the \nthird party itself has a company that is involved in telemarketing, \nthere is absolutely no prohibition against that information being \nshared. So in point of fact--and the USA Today, I think, has made a \nvery telling commentary on that by pointing out that these provisions \nsimply provide very little. I quote the October 28 edition:\n\n       A consumer's right to opt out of data-swapping arrangements \n     is severely restricted. Consumers would not, for instance, be \n     able to stop banks from sharing information with third \n     parties that market a bank's own products; nor could we block \n     data-sharing deals that involve products sold under joint \n     agreements.\n\n  Further, it goes on to point out there is no protection against banks \nsharing information with financial or insurance companies they own. In \nfact, since the law would encourage such cross-ownership, a consumer's \nchance of stopping widespread information sharing likely would be \nminimal.\n  I simply say for colleagues interested in privacy, receive no \ncomfort, my friends--none--that these very transparent and illusory \nprivacy provisions really provide much at all. They provide virtually \nnothing, no protection at all with respect to affiliate sharing.\n  I think the protection with respect to a transfer to a third party \nwith those two gaping loopholes--gaping--any attorney who has taken a \nsingle course in any kind of securities would easily be able to craft a \nloophole for his client that would make that activity perfectly \npermissible.\n  The bottom line of all of this is that those of us on the committee \nwho offered an amendment which would have simply said, look, you have \nto provide every customer with the right to opt out; that is, to be \nnotified that: Look, you have a right to opt out if you don't want this \nto occur, we are told, no, that would destroy the dynamics, the synergy \nof the marketplace; it could not happen.\n  Let me tell you, these very American companies--and they are premier \ncompanies and wonderful companies and successful, and as Americans we \nare vicariously proud of them--do business in Europe. But in doing \nbusiness in Europe, the European Union requires the opt-out provision. \nAnd the same companies that say American citizens should not have that \nprivacy, that it would destroy their opportunities in the market and \nthe synergies of the marketplace to provide those same protections that \nthose of us in committee sought to add to the European counterparts--\nyou will recall the U.S. bank situation. The attorney general of \nMinnesota took them to task. Guess what. As part of a settlement \nagreement that they entered into, they agreed as part of that \nsettlement agreement to do what? To inform customers of the bank's \nprivacy policy and to provide notice of customers' rights to opt out of \nthe sharing of information with bank affiliates.\n\n  Think about that. U.S. banks as part of a settlement said they could \ndo it and it would not compromise their ability to take advantage of \nthe dynamics and the synergies of the marketplace. The largest and most \nsuccessful financial companies in America that do business daily in \nEurope have agreed to be bound by those provisions, but they will not \nbe bound by the provisions in this country.\n  So Americans have a very much depreciated right of privacy compared \nto their counterparts in Europe. I would simply say, Why? Why? I don't \nknow what the answer is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield to me an additional 5 minutes?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will wind this up because the Senator \nfrom Alabama has shared this fight with the Senator from Nevada in \ncommittee and\n\n[[Page S13893]]\n\nin conference. I thank him for his leadership and his support.\n  The point I was trying to make is this is not an unreasonable \nrequest. If one of the largest banks in America, as part of a \nsettlement with the attorney general of Minnesota, can agree to the \nopt-out provisions which a number of us on the committee sought to add, \nevery bank can live with those provisions.\n  If the major banks in America that do business in Europe every day of \nthe week can live with those provisions, I think we have to ask \nourselves why would these companies not be prepared to provide the same \nkinds of privacy protections that either they have agreed to in a \nconsent decree when they have been taken to court by the attorney \ngeneral--in this case the attorney general of Minnesota--not be willing \nto provide the same kinds of protections provided to Europeans to \npeople in America?\n  There was some debate in the committee. ``We don't want to impose \nupon the American economy the European model.'' No; I don't either. \nNone of us did. The question is not do we want to impose the European \nmodel. The question that has to be framed is, why should Americans be \nentitled to less protection as to their right to privacy from the same \ncompany that is doing business in Europe and providing those \nprotections to their European customers?\n  I must say that it was because of these overarching concerns--we have \nseen the examples; I believe they are simply the iceberg of examples \ntoday--the potential for abuse in terms of violating your fundamental \nright of privacy and the most sensitive information about your personal \nlife will be widely shared and disseminated. I think if you look at it \nvery carefully, there is no protection at all in the affiliate area--\nnone. A sister company can freely exchange that information with banks, \ninsurance, stock brokerages, and the companies which those affiliates \nown.\n\n  With respect to third parties, the so-called nonaffiliate, if you \nlook at those marketing and joint agreement exceptions, I have to tell \nyou there is not much there. What you get, in fact, is the whole of the \ndoughnut. That is not much protection.\n  My able colleague from Alabama and I and others, the distinguished \nranking member of the committee, fought the good fight for this in the \ncommittee. We just believe those protections are inadequate.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-five minutes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield as much time as I shall consume.\n  Mr. President, I rise to voice my stringent objection to the \nconference report of the financial services modernization bill. While I \nbelieve we need to modernize the laws that govern this country's \nfinancial system, I do not believe we should do so at any price.\n  My colleagues in the Senate should know this legislation comes with a \nvery high price to the American people. In my judgment, the price is \nsimply too high. Let me explain.\n  First of all, I want to say that there are some very good things in \nthis bill, not the least of which is the repeal of two sections of the \nDepression-era Glass-Steagall Act which allow banks, securities firms, \nand insurance companies to affiliate. Congress has worked on this for \nmany years.\n  Under Senator Gramm's leadership as chairman of our Committee on \nBanking, this much-needed change will soon become reality. I think that \nis very positive in this bill.\n  That being said, I think it should be perfectly clear that there \nremains Depression-era laws on the books, and I hope Chairman Gramm \nwould be interested in working with others on the Banking Committee to \nrepeal those laws as well.\n  In particular, I am referring to the 1930s price control on business \nchecking accounts. To the extent that we are modernizing this country's \nfinancial laws, one would think we would eliminate this price control \nand allow small businesses across this country to receive interest on \ntheir checking accounts and enjoy the full benefits of financial \nmodernization.\n  Let me talk just a few minutes on CRA expansion.\n  I also feel compelled to set the record straight on the floor this \nafternoon on the Community Reinvestment Act provisions in this bill. \nMake no mistake about it. This bill expands--yes, Mr. President, \nexpands--the Community Reinvestment Act. I know a great deal about this \nbecause I, along with Senator Gramm, killed this very bill last year \nbecause we were both opposed to the dramatic expansion of CRA in the \nbill at that time.\n  I don't understand what is different this year. I don't understand \nwhy no one is willing to stand up and oppose the expansion of CRA when \nit is very clear that this bill does, indeed, expand CRA. Why else \nwould the administration support the bill? Why else would Rev. Jesse \nJackson support the bill? We all know why. The bill expands CRA.\n  On page 15 of the bill, my colleagues will see a provision entitled \n``CRA Requirement.'' This provision says that ``the appropriate Federal \nbanking agency shall prohibit a financial holding company, or any \ninsured depository institution from'' commencing any new activity or \ndirectly or indirectly acquiring control of a company engaged in any \nnew activity, if the institution has a less than satisfactory CRA \nrecord on its most recent exam.\n  That is a very crucial ``maintenance'' requirement, as we call it in \nthis bill.\n  Last year, the legislation gave the regulators the discretion to \nimpose restrictions for falling out of compliance with CRA. This year, \nwe have inserted a statutory prohibition of conducting new activities.\n  If the institution that was CRA-compliant when elected to become a \nfinancial holding company then chooses to engage in a new activity, the \nregulator could then use the enforcement authority in section 8 of the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act to impose civil money penalties on bank \ndirectors and officers. I am opposed to the maintenance requirement \ntoday just as much as I was opposed to the maintenance requirement last \nyear. My position has not changed.\n  This expansion does not exist in current law today. If you have a \ncertain bank charter, you can conduct all activities permissible to \nthat charter whether you have a CRA-satisfactory record or not.\n  I believe we are making a grave mistake by expanding CRA. I am \nextremely disappointed because I know we have reached the point of no \nreturn. As conservatives, we will have no legs to stand on if and when \nwe try to revisit this issue. My friends, we are, indeed, paying a very \nhigh price for this legislation.\n  Privacy is very important to all Americans. I pose a question to my \ncolleagues: Does anyone know what issue brings together the American \nCivil Liberties Union, Consumers Union, and Ralph Nader of Public \nCitizen to Phyllis Schlafly of Eagle Forum and the Free Congress \nFoundation? It is the bill before the Senate, the financial privacy \nprovisions. All of these groups have formed an unprecedented coalition \nto oppose this bill simply based on the lack of privacy protections. \nThat is the price the American people are going to pay--their privacy--\nif we pass this bill for only a few large financial conglomerates.\n  In an article entitled ``Banks Sell Your Secrets,'' USA Today \nreported:\n\n       Consumers across the USA have been shocked and upset to \n     learn banks have been selling their private financial data, \n     from account balances to Social Security numbers.\n\n  Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum is quoted:\n\n       The checks you write and receive, the invoices you pay and \n     the investments you make reveal as much about you as a \n     personal diary, but instead of banks keeping your information \n     under lock and key, it is being collected, repackaged and \n     sold.\n\n  In September of this year, the Los Angeles Times reported that \nCharter Pacific Bank of San Fernando Valley, CA, sold 3.7 million \ncredit card numbers to a felon who then allegedly ran up over $45 \nmillion worth of charges to the cardholders. It appears the felon also \nbilled customers for access to X-rated web sites the customers never \nknew about. How do these people explain that to their families, their \nneighbors, or their church members?\n\n[[Page S13894]]\n\n  The USA Today also ran an article on October 28, 1999, entitled \n``Congress Passes Up Chance to Protect Your Financial Privacy.'' \nReporting on this specific bill before the Senate today, the article \nread:\n\n       Technology already has made it far easier for disparate \n     firms to collect, share and sell warehouses of sensitive data \n     on individuals. And the banking bill would encourage banks, \n     insurance companies, and investment firms to link arms, \n     making data swapping from a wide range of sources much \n     easier.\n\n  That, my friends, is the point. We are about to pass this afternoon a \nfinancial modernization bill that represents industry interests in a \nbig way. However, we have forgotten the interests of the most crucial \nmarket participant of all in America--the consumer, the American \ncitizen. Under this bill, the consumer has little, if any, ability to \nprotect the transfer of his or her personal nonpublic financial \ninformation. Indeed, the so-called privacy protections in this bill are \na far cry from the protection we give taxpayers on their tax returns. \nIt is against the law for an unauthorized inspection or disclosure of \nan individual's tax return. Violation of this law is punishable by \nfines, imprisonment, or both. The Internal Revenue Code even prescribes \ncivil damages for the unauthorized inspection or disclosure and the \nnotification to the taxpayer if an unauthorized inspection or \ndisclosure has occurred.\n  I can assure Members these large financial conglomerates will have \nmore information on citizens than the IRS, but we have done virtually \nnothing to protect the sharing of such nonpublic personal financial \ninformation for the American people.\n\n  Proponents of financial modernization will say the bill includes the \nstrongest privacy provisions ever enacted by Congress. While that \nsounds great, the reality is the provisions are porous and do not \nprovide the consumer with sufficient information to make an informed \ndecision or the true ability to opt out of information sharing.\n  First, the opt-out requirement does not apply to affiliate sharing. \nThis is significant because the bill allows financial holding companies \nto affiliate with entities engaged in activities that are \n``complementary,'' to financial activities, as well as grandfather \ncommercial companies and those acquired from merchant banking.\n  As a result, the holding company can share a wealth of nonpublic \npersonal financial information with affiliated telemarketers selling \nnonfinancial products such as travel services, dental plans, and so \nforth. Should an insurance company be allowed to affiliate with a \ngrocery store chain in order to track an individual's diet? Nothing in \nthis bill prohibits this relationship or sharing of that information.\n  Second, the bill includes an exception to the porous opt-out \nprovision that allows two or more financial institutions to share their \ncustomers' nonpublic personal information with telemarketers to market \nfinancial products or services offered under a so-called joint \nagreement.\n  While the financial institution must notify its customers about the \nsharing of that information, it does not have to provide customers with \nthe ability to opt out of such information sharing. Furthermore, under \nthe joint agreement provision, the nonaffiliated third party could then \nshare the nonpublic personal information with its own affiliate. As a \nresult, the opt-out provision provides no privacy protection at all.\n  For example, a financial institution could endorse a for-profit \ninvestment tip sheet service or stock day trading service targeting \nsenior citizens. The financial institution could share confidential \ninformation with that tip sheet service or day trading service without \naffording the customer the right to opt out of it. To be more specific, \nthe institution can give the tip sheet or day trading service a list of \nwealthy senior citizens or, in the case of an insurance company, a list \nof recent widows or widowers who recently received a large insurance \npayment. Is this really what the Senate wants to encourage and endorse? \nI hope not.\n  The bill also allegedly includes an all-out prohibition against the \nsharing of customer account number information for marketing purposes. \nWhat about sharing account numbers for the purposes of verifying \ncustomers' credit card accounts? The bill allows that. It is a way to \nget around it. Charter Pacific Bank in California claims they sell \ncustomer data files to merchants for data verification purposes, not \nmarketing purposes. Therefore, the privacy provisions in the bill allow \nCharter Pacific to sell the customer account information to anyone, \nmuch less a felon, all over again.\n  As if that were not enough, all of a sudden new language has appeared \nin the conference report telling the regulators to allow for the \ntransfer of personal account numbers to nonaffiliated third party \ntelemarketers if the information is encrypted. Nothing in this bill \nsays financial institutions are prohibited from giving the third party \nthe key to unlock the encrypted information. In fact, that is common \npractice. This exception completely eviscerates the prohibition of \nthird party telemarketers in the bill. This means U.S. Bancorp in \nMinnesota could sell the account numbers to MemberWorks all over again. \nThis bill would not prevent it.\n  I believe these privacy provisions are a sham. I have said it before. \nThey are a joke on the American people, and I will not sit by and be a \nparty to this. When the American people, and they will, become aware of \nwhat Congress has done, it will be too late. This bill lets the genie \nout of the bottle. I am sure, as soon as this bill passes, if not \nbefore, a lot of people will be running for cover and introducing \nprivacy bills. I bet President Clinton will set up a Presidential \ncommission or something such as that, or a study group, to study the \nissue. That sounds nice. Too bad the President is not willing to make \nfinancial privacy a priority when it really matters, right here and \nright now, when we are giving financial institutions the unprecedented \nability to collect, profile, share, and sell personal nonpublic \nfinancial information.\n  Critics claim that requiring a consumer to provide his affirmative \nconsent before sharing information would be a hindrance to the free \nflow of information and basically unworkable. If this is the case, why \ndid Citibank agree to an opt-in requirement for nonaffiliated third \nparties to do business in Germany? You heard me right. The biggest and \nmost vocal proponent of this bill signed an agreement with its German \naffiliates in 1995 that basically required Citibank to obtain consent \non the application form before they could share personal data to third \nparties. Citibank agreed to give Germans more privacy protections than \nwe are giving our own citizens in the United States today.\n  Does that bother anybody else in this Chamber besides me? It should. \nI think this is a tragedy. I think it is absurd. The banking industry \nhas told us they would oppose this bill if we simply give the consumer \nthe ability to object to the sharing of nonpublic personal information. \nFirst of all, I think it is hypocritical of them to threaten us with \nthat position, seeing as how Citigroup voluntarily agreed to provide \nconsumers the ability to opt out in Germany.\n  Second, I believe Congress should not be dictated to by the financial \nindustry or any other industry as to what provisions we put in on \nbehalf of the American consumer. They should not write laws, ever. But \nCongress should.\n  I have heard many Members talk about empowerment and how we must \nempower the individual. We spend a lot of time discussing empowerment \nzones. Why are we ignoring the empowerment principle on this piece of \nlegislation? Why is Congress going to take a walk on this issue? Why is \nCongress not going to stand up for the American people and assure them \nthe ability to stop a financial institution from profiling individuals \nbased on their most personal behavioral patterns and then selling that \ninformation at will? The American people clearly believe this is too \nhigh a price to pay for this bill. If we are going to allow the huge \nfinancial conglomerates to affiliate to provide services--and we are--\nwhy must we also give them the ability to sell, profit, and exploit an \nindividual's personal nonpublic profile?\n  This is not a partisan issue. It does not matter if you are a \nDemocrat or Republican, conservative, liberal, rich or poor. An \nindividual's financial matters are very private to that individual. \nFamilies will not discuss how much money other family members make at \nthe dinner table. It is too private. It is\n\n[[Page S13895]]\n\ntoo sensitive. They do not talk about it because they do not want to \ntalk about it and they are in control of what information they share, \neven with their loved ones.\n  The bitter irony is that while the individual is practicing \ndiscretion in America, Congress is belligerently aiding and abetting \ncomplete strangers in accessing an individual's most private financial \nmatters, including account balances, where they shop, and what they \nbuy. We are aiding and abetting the felon in California who bought a \nlist of account numbers and charged up to $45 million. We are aiding \nand abetting third party marketers such as MemberWorks, who bought a \nlist from a bank and then automatically billed individuals' accounts.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again here, we are paying a \nvery high price, a very dear price for this bill. The American people \nare paying a very dear price for this bill, and they will continue to \npay it. It is very difficult for me this afternoon to celebrate this \nlandmark achievement of financial modernization when I know we did so \nat the expense of every American.\n  I know this bill will pass with a lot of votes, but I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this bill mainly because of the lack of \nprivacy provisions. Ask your mother, your father, your husband, or your \nwife about this. They will all tell you that one-stop shopping is not \nworth giving up their financial privacy. The price is too high--too \nhigh.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering S. 900 under \ncontrolled time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining for the proponents of the \nconference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Gramm has 28 minutes; Senator \nSarbanes, 23 minutes; Senator Shelby, 44 minutes; and Senator Dorgan, \n19 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 5 minutes off the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nConference Report on S. 900, the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. \nAs we prepare to enter the 21st century, it is critical that our laws \ngoverning financial services reflect the reality of the current \nmarketplace and establish a sound legal framework that will carry us \nwell into the new millennium.\n  This legislation will repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era \nlaw that separates the banking, securities, and insurance industries. \nThe Glass-Steagall Act was originally adopted in 1933 to stave off \nanother Great Depression.\n  While it clearly served its purpose back then, the law regulating our \nfinancial service industries is now sorely out of date.\n  The face of financial services has changed dramatically in recent \nyears. We are already witnessing a marketplace at work that is \nproducing new services offered by financial institutions of all shapes \nand sizes. But under current law, the financial firms are often forced \nto work around existing prohibitions on the coupling of different \nservices, often incurring unnecessary costs to the ultimate detriment \nof the consumer.\n  Modernizing current law will make the financial services industry \nmore competitive, both at home and abroad. This legislation will make \nit easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate \ntheir services, allowing them to cut expenses and offer more products \nat a lower cost to businesses and consumers.\n  The Treasury Department has estimated that increased competition in \nthe securities, banking, and insurance industry could save consumers as \nmuch as $15 billion annually.\n  I want to praise the Clinton Administration and the Senate and House \nconferees for reaching a fair and equitable compromise regarding the \napplication the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Since the enactment \nof the CRA in 1977, financial institutions have committed more than one \ntrillion dollars to low and moderate income communities.\n  The continued strength of the CRA means that hundreds of billions of \ndollars worth of new home mortgage and small business loans will be \nmade in low- and moderate-income urban and rural communities in the \nnext century.\n  The compromise contained in the conference report prevents a bank \nfrom moving into a new line of business if it does not have a \nsatisfactory lending record under the CRA, while limiting the frequency \nof reviews under the CRA for small banks with a satisfactory or \nexcellent record.\n  I am pleased to report that in my home state of Vermont, no banks, \nlarge or small, have received less than a satisfactory CRA rating. It \nis my hope that this legislation will encourage banks in other states \nto improve their community lending records. Enforcement of the CRA is a \nwin-win situation for banks and neighborhoods across the country.\n  In addition, this legislation allows states to continue to regulate \ninsurance sales by banks and other new financial entities, keeping this \nauthority where it properly belongs. The Vermont Department of Banking, \nInsurance and Securities has strongly supported its continued oversight \nof insurance sales by banks and other financial firms in my home state \nbecause of the agency's experience and expertise, and I agree.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees did not include the medical \nprivacy language included in the House-passed bill in the conference \nreport. Senators Kennedy and Jeffords joined me in sending a letter on \nJuly 20 to the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee requesting that \nthis section be struck in conference.\n  This language had been inserted in the House bill under the guise of \nproviding medical privacy protections, but it would do no such thing. \nThe language actually would have created a laundry list of lawful uses \nof personally identifiable health information without any consent by \nthe patient.\n  Moreover, the House-passed language would have wiped out the August \ndeadline for Congressional action included in the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996. I strongly opposed this \nwrongheaded approach.\n  I still have significant concerns about how this bill may negatively \nimpact the privacy of individuals medical records. However, I believe \nthe recent steps by the Clinton Administration to establish federal \nregulations governing some medical records of Americans is an important \nstep forward.\n  And I will reaffirm something I have said over, and over again--this \nCongress must act on its own and pass a comprehensive federal law that \nwill govern all medical records and all those who could have access to \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I must also express my deep disappointment with \nconference report's financial privacy provisions. Congress has missed \nan historic opportunity to provide fundamental privacy of every \nAmerican's personal financial information.\n  Our right of privacy has become one of the most vulnerable rights in \nthe Information Age. We must master new threats to our individual \nprivacy and security, and in particular, to our ability to control the \nterms under which our personal information is acquired, disclosed and \nused.\n  But this conference report fails to give consumers the control over \ntheir personal financial information that every American deserves.\n  After this conference report becomes law, new conglomerates in the \nfinancial services industry will begin offering a widening variety of \nservices, each of which requires a customer to provide financial, \nmedical or other personal information. But nothing in the new law will \nprevent these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial conglomerates \nfrom sharing this information for uses beyond those the customer \nthought he or she was providing it for.\n  For example, the conference report has no consumer consent \nrequirements for these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates to \nsell, share, or publish savings account balances, certificates of\n\n[[Page S13896]]\n\ndeposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases \nand sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims. That is \nwrong.\n  I am an enthusiast when it comes to the Internet and our burgeoning \ninformation technologies. These are exciting times, and the \ndigitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of \ncomputing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits \nto the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with \ntheir government. But we must make sure that information technology \nremains our servant, instead of becoming our master.\n  Tuesday, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Summers about the need for \nadditional legislation to provide real financial privacy safeguards. In \nthe next session of the 106th Congress, I look forward to working with \nhim and Senator Shelby, Senator Bryan, Senator Sarbanes and others on \nthe Senate Banking Committee to enact comprehensive legislation to \nupdate our laws to provide fundamental privacy protections of the \npersonal financial information of all Americans.\n  The need for financial privacy protection will not go away, and \nCongress should address it without further delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Dorgan is here to speak, and I will \nyield the floor to allow him to speak, but I want to make it clear to \nanyone who has time that we are fast reaching the magic moment where we \nare going to conclude the debate and vote. It is only fair that Senator \nSarbanes and I as managers of the bill be allowed to speak last. I ask \nunanimous consent that we may hold our time until the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor in a circumstance \nwhere I will not support the legislation that is before the Senate \ntoday. Before I describe the reasons for that, let me say I certainly \nadmire the craftsmanship and the legislative skills of the Senator from \nTexas and the Senator from Maryland, the Senator from Connecticut, and \nso many others who have played a role in bringing this legislation to \nthe floor. Frankly, I did not think they were going to get it done, but \nthey did.\n  In the final hours of the Congress, they bring a piece of legislation \nto the floor--it is called financial services modernization. I know \nthey feel passionately and strongly it is the right thing to do. For \nother reasons, I feel very strongly it is the wrong thing to do. I do \nnot come to denigrate their work. We have a philosophical disagreement \nabout this legislation, and I want to describe why.\n  This legislation repeals some of the major provisions of the Glass-\nSteagall Act named after Senator Carter Glass from Virginia, and Henry \nSteagall, a Congressman from Alabama, the primary authors. It will \nallow banks and security underwriters to affiliate with one another. It \nalso repeals similar provisions in other banking laws to allow banks \nand insurance firms to marry up. It will permit many new kinds of \nfinancial services to be conducted within a financial holding company \nor a national bank subsidiary.\n  I want to describe why I think in many ways this effort is some \nlegislative version of back to the future. I believe when this \nlegislation is enacted--and it is expected it will be--we will see \nimmediately even a greater level of concentration and merger activity \nin the financial services industries.\n  When there is this aggressive move toward even greater \nconcentration--and the concentration we have seen recently ought to be \nalarming to all of us--but when this increased concentration occurs, we \nought to ask the question: Will this be good for the consumer, or will \nit hurt the consumer? We know it will probably be good for those who \nare combining and merging. They do that because it is in their \ninterest. But will it be in the public's interest? Will the consumer be \nbetter served by larger and larger companies? Bank mergers, in fact, \nlast year held the top spot in the value of all mergers: More than $250 \nbillion in bank mergers deals last year. That is $250 billion out of \n$1.6 trillion in merger deals. Of the banks in this country, 10 \ncompanies hold about 30 percent of all domestic deposits and are \nexpected to hold more than 40 percent of all domestic assets should the \npending bank mergers that now exist be approved.\n  After news that there was a compromise on this financial services \nmodernization bill in the late hours, a compromise that there was going \nto be a bill passed by Congress, I noted the stock values of likely \ntakeover targets jumped in some cases by more than $7 a share. That \nought to tell us what is on the horizon.\n  Clearly this legislation is not concerned about the rapid rate of \nconsolidation in our financial services industries. The conference \nreport that is before us dropped even a minimal House bill provision \nthat would have required an annual General Accounting Office report to \nCongress on market concentration in financial services over the next 5 \nyears. Even that minimal step that was in the House bill was dropped in \nthis conference report.\n  What does it mean if we have all this concentration and merger \nactivity? The bigger they are, the less likely this Government can \nallow them to fail. That is why we have a doctrine in this country with \nsome of our larger banks--and that ``some'' is a growing list--of \nsomething called ``too big to fail.'' A few years ago, we had only 11 \nbanks in America that were considered by our regulators so big they \nwould not be allowed to fail. Their failure would be catastrophic to \nour economy and so, therefore, they cannot fail.\n  The list of too big to fail banks has grown actually. Now it is 21 \nbanks. There are 21 banks that are now too big to fail in this country.\n  We are also told by the Federal Reserve Board that the largest \nmegabanks in this country, so-called LCBOs, the large complex banking \norganizations, need customized supervision because their complexity and \nsize have reached a scale and diversity that would threaten the \nstability of financial markets around the world in the event of \nfailure.\n\n  Let me read something from the Federal Reserve Bank president from \nRichmond. This is a Fed regional bank president saying this:\n\n       Here's the risk: when a bank's balance sheet has been \n     weakened by financial losses, the safety net creates adverse \n     incentives that economists usually refer to as a ``moral \n     hazard.'' Since the bank is insured, its depositors will not \n     necessarily rush to withdraw deposits even if knowledge of \n     the bank's problems begin to spread.\n\n  Because the bank is too big to fail.\n\n       In these circumstances, the bank has an incentive to pursue \n     relatively risky loans and investments in hope that higher \n     returns will strengthen its balance sheets and ease the \n     difficulty. If the gamble fails, the insurance fund and \n     ultimately taxpayers are left to absorb the losses. I am sure \n     you remember that not very long ago, the S bailout bilked \n     taxpayers for well over $100 billion.\n\n  Again, quoting the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank:\n\n       The point I want to make in the context of bank mergers is \n     that the failure of a large, merged banking organization \n     could be very costly to resolve. Additionally, the existence \n     of such organizations could exacerbate the so-called too-big-\n     to-fail problem and the risks it prevents. Consequently, I \n     believe the current merger wave has intensified the need for \n     a fresh review of the safety net--specifically the breadth of \n     the deposit insurance coverage--with an eye towards reform.\n\n  This bill addresses a lot of issues. But it does nothing, for \nexample, to deal with megabanks engaged in risky derivatives trading. I \ndo not know if many know it, but we have something like $33 trillion in \nvalue of derivatives held by U.S. commercial banks in this country.\n  Federally-insured banks in this country are trading in derivatives \nout of their own proprietary accounts. You could just as well put a \nroulette wheel in the bank lobby. That is what it is. I offered \namendments on the floor of the Senate when this bill was originally \nhere to stop bank speculation in derivatives in their own proprietary \naccounts and also to take a look at some sensible regulation of risky \nhedge funds, but those amendments were rejected. You think there is not \nrisk here? There is dramatic risk, and it is increasing. This piece of \nlegislation acts as if it does not exist. It ignores it.\n  A philosopher and author once said: Those who cannot remember the \npast are condemned to repeat it. We have a piece of legislation on the \nfloor today that I hope very much, for the sake of\n\n[[Page S13897]]\n\nnot only those who vote for it and believe in it but for the American \npeople who will eventually have to pick up the pieces--I hope this \nworks.\n  Fusing together of the idea of banking, which requires not just \nsafety and soundness to be successful but the perception of safety and \nsoundness, with other inherently risky speculative activity is, in my \njudgment, unwise.\n  I do not usually quote William Safire. I guess I have done it a \ncouple times on the floor of the Senate. I suppose we all look for \nthings that are comforting to our point of view. But William Safire \nwrote a piece 3 days ago in the New York Times:\n\n       Americans are unaware that Congress and the President have \n     just agreed to put us all at extraordinary financial and \n     personal risk.\n\n  Then he talks about the risk. The risk of allowing the coupling of \ninherently risky enterprises with our banking system, that requires the \nperception of safety and soundness, I personally think is unwise. I do \nnot denigrate those who believe otherwise. There is room for \ndisagreement. I may be dead wrong.\n  It may be that I am hopelessly old-fashioned. But I just do not think \nwe should ignore the lessons learned in the 1930s, when we had this \ngalloping behavior by people who believed nothing was ever going to go \nwrong and you could do banking and securities and all this together--\njust kind of put it in a tossed salad; it would be just fine--and then \nwe saw, of course, massive failures across this country. And people \nunderstood that we did something wrong here: We allowed the financial \ninstitutions, and especially banks in this country, to be involved in \ncircumstances that were inherently risky. It was a dumb thing to do.\n  The result was, we created barriers saying: Let's not let that happen \nagain. Let's never let that happen again. And those barriers are now \nbeing torn down with a bill called financial services modernization.\n  I remember a couple of circumstances that existed more recently. I \nwas not around during the bank failures of the 1930s. I was not around \nfor the debate that persuaded a Congress to enact Glass-Steagall and a \nrange of other protections. But I was here when, in the early 1980s, it \nwas decided that we should expand the opportunities for savings and \nloans to do certain things. And they began to broker deposits and they \ntook off. They would take a sleepy little savings and loan in some \ntown, and they would take off like a Roman candle. Pretty soon they \nwould have a multibillion-dollar organization, and they would decide \nthey would use that organization to park junk bonds in. We had a \nsavings and loan out in California that had over 50 percent of its \nassets in risky junk bonds.\n  Let me describe the ultimate perversion, the hood ornament on \nstupidity. The U.S. Government owned nonperforming junk bonds in the \nTaj Mahal Casino. Let me say that again. The U.S. Government ended up \nowning nonperforming junk bonds in the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic \nCity. How did that happen? The savings and loans were able to buy junk \nbonds. The savings and loans went belly up. The junk bonds were not \nperforming. And the U.S. Government ended up with those junk bonds.\n  Was that a perversion? Of course it was. But it is an example of what \nhas happened when we decide, under a term called modernization, to \nforget the lessons of the past, to forget there are certain things that \nare inherently risky, and they ought not be fused or merged with the \nenterprise of banking that requires the perception and, of course, the \nreality--but especially the perception--of safety and soundness.\n  Last year, we had a failure of a firm called LTCM, Long-Term Capital \nManagement. It was an organization run by some of the smartest people \nin the world, I guess, in the area of finance. They had Nobel laureates \nhelping run this place. They had some of the smartest people on Wall \nStreet. They put together a lot of money. They had this hedge fund, \nunregulated hedge fund. They had invested more than $1 trillion in \nderivatives in this fund--more than $1 trillion in derivatives value.\n  Then, with all of the smartest folks around, and all this money, and \nan enormous amount of leverage, when it looked as if this firm was \ngoing to go belly up, just flat out broke, guess what happened. On a \nSunday, Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board decided to convene \na meeting of corresponding banks and others who had an interest in \nthis, saying: You have to save Long-Term Capital Management. You have \nto save this hedge firm. If you don't, there will be catastrophic \nresults in the economy. The hit will be too big.\n\n  You have this unregulated risky activity out there in the economy, \nand you have one firm that has $1 trillion in derivative values and \nenormous risk, and, with all their brains, it doesn't work. They are \ngoing to go belly up. Who bears the burden of that? The Federal \nGovernment, the Federal Reserve Board.\n  We have the GAO doing an investigation to find out the circumstances \nof all that. I am very interested in this no-fault capitalism that \nexists with respect to Long-Term Capital Management. Who decides what \nkind of capitalism is no-fault capitalism? And when and how and is \nthere a conflict of interest here?\n  The reason I raise this point is, this will be replicated again and \nagain and again, as long as we bring bills to the floor that talk about \nfinancial services modernization and refuse to deal with the issue of \nthoughtful and sensible regulation of things such as hedge funds and \nderivatives and as long as we bring bills to the floor that say we can \nconnect and couple, we can actually hitch up, inherently risky \nenterprises with the core banking issues in this country.\n  I hear about fire walls and affiliates, all these issues. I probably \nknow less about them than some others; I admit that. But I certainly \nknow, having studied and read a great deal about the lessons of \nhistory, there are some things that are not old-fashioned; there are \nsome notions that represent transcendental truths. One of those, in my \njudgment, is that we are, with this piece of legislation, moving \ntowards greater risk. We are almost certainly moving towards \nsubstantial new concentration and mergers in the financial services \nindustry that are almost certainly not in the interest of consumers. \nAnd we are deliberately and certainly, with this legislation, moving \ntowards inheriting much greater risk in our financial services \nindustries.\n  I regret I cannot support the legislation. But let me end where I \nbegan because this is not one of those issues where I don't respect \nthose who have a different view. I said when I started--I say as I \nclose--there was a great deal of legislative skill exhibited on the \npart of those who put this together. I didn't think they were going to \nget this done, frankly. I wish they hadn't, but they did. That is a \ntestament to their skill.\n  I don't know whether I am right or wrong on this issue. I believe \nfervently that 2 years, 5 years, 10 years from now, we will look back \nat this moment and say: We modernized the financial services industry \nbecause the industry did it itself and we needed to move head and draw \na ring around it and provide some guidance, some rules and regulations. \nI also think we will, in 10 years time, look back and say: We should \nnot have done that because we forgot the lessons of the past; those \nlessons represent timeless truths that were as true in the year 2000 or \n2010 as they were in the year 1930 or 1935.\n  Again, I cannot vote for this legislation. My hope is that history \nwill prove me wrong and that this will not pose the kind of \ndifficulties and risks I fear it will for the American people.\n  One final point: With respect to the regulation of risky hedge funds, \nand especially the issue dealing with the value of derivatives in this \ncountry--$33 trillion, a substantial amount of it held by the 25 \nlargest banks in this country, a substantial amount being traded in \nproprietary accounts of those banks--we must do something to address \nthose issues. That kind of risk overhanging the financial institutions \nof this country one day, with a thud, will wake everyone up and lead \nthem to ask the question: Why didn't we understand that we had to do \nsomething about that? How on Earth could we have thought that would \ncontinue to exist without a massive problem for the American people and \nfor its financial system?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, after years of persistent lobbying and a \nflood of political donations, three industries may soon have a lot to \ncelebrate--the\n\n[[Page S13898]]\n\ninsurance, banking and securities industries will have a huge victory \nif we pass this conference report today.\n  I do want to note that some of those Senators who helped to craft \nthis legislation are among the very best Members of the Senate.\n  While I oppose this measure, I certainly commend them for their \ndedication and hard work on this bill.\n  Nevertheless, with this legislation, this Congress is declaring the \nultimate bank holiday--giving banks, insurance companies and securities \nfirms a permanent vacation from the Glass-Steagall Act and other \nDepression-era banking law reforms.\n  Advocates of this legislation will tell you that it is terrific for \nconsumers, offering them one-stop shopping for all their financial and \ninsurance needs.\n  But the reality is far more complicated and far less appealing--it is \nlikely to cause a merger-mania in the industry that could severely \nlimit consumer choice and spur a rise in banking fees.\n  This conference report also raises serious issues about consumer \nprivacy. Privacy advocates worry that it will give bankers, insurers \nand securities firms virtually unlimited license to share account data \nand other sensitive information.\n  To top it all off, this legislation undermines the Community \nReinvestment Act.\n  Higher bank fees, reduced consumer choice and fewer protections for \nlow-income loan assistance--these don't sound very good to most \nconsumers, Mr. President. But they sound good to the industries that \nwill benefit from this legislation. This conference report is music to \nthe ears of the industries that have been lobbying for these changes \nfor decades.\n  And this lobbying campaign has left a trail of political \ncontributions that is nothing short of stunning. A recent study by \nCommon Cause put the political contributions of these special interests \nat $187.2 million in the last ten years.\n  That is why I am going to take this opportunity to Call the Bankroll. \nThis lobbying effort for so-called financial services modernization is \ntruly breathtaking, because it combines the clout of three industries \nthat on their own are giants in the campaign finance system, \nparticularly the soft money system.\n  Together the power of their combined pocketbooks were a powerful \nforce propelling this legislation through Congress.\n  One of these industries, the securities and investment industry is a \nlegendary soft money donor, and I will just highlight a few such firms \nthat have lobbied on behalf of this legislation.\n  Merrill Lynch has long called for banking deregulation. The company, \nits subsidiaries and executives gave more than $310,000 in soft money \nduring the 1998 election cycle.\n  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which gave more than $145,000 in soft \nmoney in 1997 and 1998, was also a key part of the lobbying team on \nthis issue. In fact the Washington Post reported that the company's \nchairman, along with several other corporate heads, made calls to White \nHouse officials the very night the conference hammered out an agreement \non this bill.\n  Lobbyists lined the halls outside the room where the conference met \nto reconcile the House and Senate version of the bill, and as we know, \nthat is standard procedure on Capitol Hill.\n  As usual, corporate lobbyists lined the halls, while the consumers \nwho will bear the impact--and consumer advocates agree it will be an \nadverse impact--of this bill, were left out in the cold.\n  The banking industry was also there that night, of course, since this \nlegislation is a bonanza for them too, revolutionizing the kinds of \nservices that banks can offer.\n  Citigroup was there, and so was the presence of the more than \n$720,000 that Citigroup and its executives and subsidiaries gave in \nsoft money to the political parties in the 1998 election cycle.\n  That is a huge sum, Mr. President, especially for an election cycle \nin which there was not even a presidential election.\n  And in the current election cycle Citigroup is off to a running start \nwith $293,000 in soft money from Citigroup, its executives and \nsubsidiaries.\n  That is more than $1 million from Citigroup, it's executives and \nsubsidiaries in just two and a half years.\n  The powerful banking interest BankAmerica, its executives and \nsubsidiaries also weighed in with more than $347,000 in soft money in \nthe 1998 election cycle, and more than $40,000 already in the current \nelection cycle.\n  And let's not forget the insurance industry. They have a massive \nstake in this legislation as well, an interest that is well-reflected \nby the size of the industry's soft money contributions.\n  For instance, there is the Chubb Corp and its subsidiaries, which \ngave nearly $220,000 in soft money contributions in 1997 and 1998, and \nhas given more than $60,000 already in 1999.\n  Then there is the industry lobby group, the American Council of Life \nInsurance, which also gave heavily to the parties with more than \n$315,000 in soft money contributions in 1997 and 1998, and more than \n$63,000 so far this year.\n  In the end, what do all these contributions add up to? They add up to \ntremendous access to legislators and broad influence over the process \nby which this legislation was crafted--access and influence that the \naverage consumer can't even begin to imagine, let alone afford.\n  This is a serious problem, and I think everyone in this Chamber knows \nit.\n  The American people certainly know it.\n  They think our votes are on the auction block, and who can blame \nthem.\n  Who can blame them, and more than that, who can show them why they \nshould think otherwise?\n  That is a question I ask my colleagues, and I think we all know the \nanswer.\n  Mr. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Financial \nServices Modernization Conference Report.\n  While I oppose this legislation, I strongly commend the work of my \nsenior colleague Senator Sarbanes. Because of his efforts, this bill is \nfar better than previous versions. It does more to help low and \nmoderate income and minority Americans to have access to capital, \ncredit and financial services. Senator Sarbanes also improved the \nprivacy provisions of this bill.\n  Despite the significant improvements Senator Sarbanes fought so hard \nfor, there are still a number of what I call ``yellow flashing lights'' \nor warning signals that force me to oppose this legislation.\n  First, I am concerned that if we relax the laws about who can own and \noperate financial institutions, an unhealthy concentration of financial \nresources will be the inevitable result. The savings of the many will \nbe controlled by the few. If we relax banking regulations in this \ncountry, Americans will know less about where their deposits are kept \nand about how they are being used.\n  Marylanders used to have savings accounts with local banks where the \nteller knew their name and their family. We have already seen the trend \ntoward mega-mergers, accompanied by higher fees, a decline in service, \nand the loss of neighborhood financial institutions. This bill \naccelerates that trend.\n  With a globalization of financial resources, the local bank could be \nbought by a holding company based in Thailand. Instead of the friendly \nteller, consumers will be contacting a computer operator in a country \nhalf-way around the globe through an 800 number. Their account will be \nsubject to financial risks that have nothing to do with their job, \ntheir community, or even the economy of the United States. I know \nimpersonalized globalization is not what banking customers want when we \ntalk about modernization of the financial services.\n  Second, I am concerned that complex financial and insurance products \nwill now be sold in a cluttered market by untrained individuals. \nInvestment and insurance planning for families is a very important \nprocess. These are some of the most important decisions that families \nmake. They should be made with the assistance of certified \nprofessionals--whom the family can trust. By breaking down these fire \nwalls and allowing various companies to offer insurance and complex \ninvestment products, we run the risk that consumers will be confused, \ndefrauded, and treated like market segments and not individuals with \nunique needs and goals.\n  Third, I am concerned about the privacy provisions in this \nlegislation. While the bill offers some privacy protections for \nconsumers, such as requiring financial institutions to provide\n\n[[Page S13899]]\n\ncustomers with notice of its privacy policies, it does not go far \nenough. There are several loopholes in the bill that will allow for the \nsharing of private information among private institutions. Customers \ncannot object to having that information shared in those circumstances \nand there are no restrictions on the kind of detailed personal \ninformation that can be shared. Imagine the problems that could arise \nif insurance providers could scrutinize your credit card purchases. \nProtecting personal information is one of the issues that matter most \nto the American people--and this bill does not speak to their concerns.\n  Finally, the bill does not have the safeguards we need against bank \nfailures. Banks will now be venturing out to engage in new and risky \nindustries. If a bank fails during one of those ventures, thousands of \npeople and businesses who have worked hard and invested their money \nwith that bank fail too. Let's not forget about the taxpayers who will \nbe left to pick up the pieces. These failures could set off a chain \nreaction and threaten the stability of our entire economy.\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed to a necessary reform of our \nfinancial services laws. But I believe the American people need greater \nprotection before a global financial plan is enacted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I oppose this conference report. There are \na number of important and positive elements in the measure that provide \nfor improvements in the regulation of financial institutions that will \nbetter enable us to assure for the soundness of our financial \ninstitutions. More could have been done in that area. But, there are \nclear improvements. There are provisions which help small banks and \nsmall insurance companies acquire additional resources that are \nimportant to their ability to compete, to help their customers and \nuseful to economy in their local areas. And, in a world marketplace, \nAmerican institutions should have the resources needed to compete in \nthat marketplace.\n  Unfortunately, these positive steps are outweighed by the negative \nimpact the bill will have on the privacy rights of Americans. Under \nthis legislation, banks, insurance firms, and credit card agencies that \nare owned by the same mega-corporation can share a consumer's personal \ninformation. What kind of stock do you own? What information can be \nacquired from your credit card statements? When do your CD's mature? \nAnd, I fear, that information about a customer's health might also \nbecome available to those in a company who might decide if a customer \nis to get a loan or not get a loan. Do we want any possibility that a \nloan officer might have access to information about the medical \ncondition and other private medical matters of a loan applicant without \nthe customer's permission? I believe that this bill should have clearly \nprovided solid protections in these areas. Unfortunately, these are the \nkinds of things that could happen if this measure becomes law.\n  The measure does not even allow a customer to say No, I do not want \nany information picked up from my bank account or from records with the \ninsurance company which is a part of a larger financial institution to \nbe shared by any other part of a financial institution. If a customer \nwants information shared because that customer believes that he or she \nwould be helped by one stop shopping for financial activities, fine. \nLet that customer waive rights to privacy by signing an appropriate \nform. But, the basic right to block information collected by a company \nfrom being shared by other parts of a company is not in this bill.\n  There is an ability to say that you do not want the financial entity \nto simply sell the information. But, I understand that under this bill, \nyour financial institution can share information they have acquired \nfrom your various accounts with other companies that they have entered \ninto certain types of marketing agreements.\n  Computers have great advantages. They increase the efficiency of our \neconomy. But, they can store huge amounts of information about a \nperson's private habits and circumstances. In this age where we have an \nexplosion in the amount of information that is collected about people, \nI believe it is essential that we erect strong barriers that prevent \nthe passage of personal information without a person's permission.\n  I am also concerned about the weakness in the bill concerning the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. We need to keep the burdens of paperwork \ndown, particularly for small banks. But, we also need to provide for \neffective teeth in the requirement that banks provide proper financial \nassistance to all parts of their service area. And, this bill falls \nshort in that area.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, although I am a longstanding supporter of \nfinancial services modernization, I will vote against S. 900--the \nFinancial Services Modernization bill. I am concerned that this bill \ndoes far too little to ensure the privacy of individuals.\n  Over the past three or four years we have seen an explosion of \nmergers in the financial services industry. Citibank and the Travelers \nGroup merged. And in my home state, BankAmerica--California's biggest \nbank--merged with NationsBank. All of these mergers, in my home state \nand elsewhere, will undoubtedly have a major impact on consumers. And \nwhile we do not know what that impact will ultimately be, I believe we \ndo know it will impact our privacy. Why?\n  Although most Americans believe their financial data is private, they \nare wrong. In fact, current law allows banks to do basically whatever \nthey want with the personal information they collect from their \ncustomers in the course of doing business. Banks can provide a \nconsumer's name, address, account balance, payment history, even his \naccount number and social security number to their affiliates. And they \ncan sell that information to third parties without even notifying the \ncustomer whose information has been sold.\n  Given that banks already share and sell the personal information of \ntheir customers, why then do I oppose this bill? I oppose it because I \nbelieve the bill will heighten the existing problem.\n  Mr. President, S. 900 will heighten the problem because, as noted by \nRobert Scheer in a November 2 Los Angeles Times editorial, ``. . . [the \nbill] allows banks, insurance and brokerage firms to merge not only \ntheir equity but also the vast accumulation of computerized records on \nconsumers' buying habits, health treatments, investments and credit \nhistory.''\n  The tearing down of walls that now exist between banks, insurance \nfirms, and securities firms, in this highly technological and \ncomputerized era, means the information now being shared will expand \nexponentially. There will be more information to share, more \ncomprehensive information to share, and more people with whom to share \nit and to whom to sell it.\n  Privacy rights are most vulnerable in the information age. And while \nI realize we cannot turn back the clock, I do believe we as policy \nmakers can and should provide some parameters for the sharing and \nselling of personal information. Unfortunately, despite all of the talk \nof self regulation, financial institutions provide little if any \nprivacy protections. The legislation before us does nothing to improve \nthis situation.\n  Finally, I understand that many financial institutions have \ncomplained that stronger privacy protections in the context of \nfinancial services modernization are unworkable, too costly to \nimplement, and will, in part, defeat the purpose of allowing banks, \ninsurance companies, and brokerage firms to affiliate. I reject these \narguments for two specific reasons.\n  First, at least one large U.S. financial institution offers its \nEuropean customers the kinds of privacy protections it contends it \ncannot offer its U.S. customers. In 1995, that institution agreed to \nallow their German customers to ``opt-in'' to having their non-public \nfinancial information shared with other companies.\n  Second, it is the current policy of some U.S. financial institutions \nnot share their customers' personal information without first getting \nthe permission of those customers or allowing those customers to ``opt-\nout'' of such sharing. And those institutions, American Express and \nU.S. Bancorp among them, apparently have not found such policies overly \nburdensome or competitively disadvantageous.\n  In closing, proponents of this legislation suggest the privacy \nprovisions included in the bill are sufficient. Indeed, some have \nsuggested the privacy provisions contained in this bill are historic.\n\n[[Page S13900]]\n\n And although some small steps have been made, like the notice \nprovision which requires financial institutions to tell customers about \ntheir policies for disclosing nonpublic personal data and the provision \nwhich prevents stronger state consumer privacy laws from being pre-\nempted, I believe the steps are far too small.\n  I wish I could support this bill. As I said at the outset, I am a \nlongstanding supporter of financial services modernization. I do not \nbelieve, however, the privacy of consumers should be, or need be, \nsacrificed for such modernization.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are not.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I seek recognition then.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  I rise with my fellow members of the committee to express my delight \nat this particular piece of legislation and the fact that we have come \nto where we are.\n  I take note of the work of Geoff Gray, Linda Lord, Wayne Abernathy, \nand other members of the committee staff who have provided such \ntremendous support for this. They have been available not only to the \nchairman but to members of the committee as well in a way that has been \ntremendously helpful. I make that acknowledgment of their contribution.\n  I will focus for just a moment on the issues of privacy. Most of the \nother issues relating to this bill have already been aired and \ndiscussed. I don't need to add to that. But I have paid a lot of \nattention to the whole privacy issue for the last 3\\1/2\\, 4 years, \nprimarily because of my interest in medical confidentiality. I am the \nprime sponsor of the bill relating to confidentiality of medical \nrecords and, frankly, have had quite an education in the whole privacy \narea as a result of that.\n  We are in a new world. That has become a cliche but, as with most \ncliches, it happens to be true. We are in a new world now where \ninformation is available at a level and a quantity that has never been \nthe case before. Those who complain about this and want to go back to \nthe anonymity of the pre-electronic age are wishing for something that \nis simply not going to happen. Those who call themselves ``privacy \nadvocates,'' who have attacked certain portions of this bill, are \nwishing for a world that is long gone.\n  The only question now with respect to the information that is \navailable to us is not will it be available but, rather, how will it be \nresponsibly used. One of the things that many of the privacy advocates \nignore is the reality of the marketplace. Having been a businessman \nprior to coming to the Congress, I want to talk about that for a \nminute. The privacy advocates think Government must intervene on behalf \nof the consumers against rapacious businesses that would somehow use \nthe information available to them in a way to do damage to those \nconsumers. I suppose there are some businesses that might be so foolish \nas to do that, but the vast majority of businesses recognize that the \nonly way they survive is on repeat business, and the only way they get \nrepeat business is to keep their customers happy.\n  I remember, during the hearings, Congressman Markey raised some \nspecters and gave us examples of abuses that banks had made of credit \ncard information of some of their customers. I made the comment there, \nand I will repeat it here: If a bank did to me what Congressman Markey \naccused a bank of doing to one of its customers, I would change banks. \nI can solve the problem on my own very quickly. I don't need the \nGovernment to step in in that situation to protect me.\n  Furthermore, the bankers I deal with, such as the retailers and \nothers that want to sell me something, are very anxious not to offend \nme. They are very anxious to keep me happy. So if they start using this \ninformation that they have, as a result of the information age, in a \nway to service my needs better, they are going to keep me happy. If \nGovernment interferes with their ability to do that, Government will \nget in the way. On the other hand, if they--that is, the banks--use \nthis information in a way I don't like, they jeopardize our \nrelationship, and they jeopardize my business.\n  We must understand here in the Congress that customers are not the \ncaptives of the business and banking organizations that depend upon \nthem for revenue. Customers are the reason for their existence, and \ncustomers, consequently, truly are king. That is another cliche that a \nlot of people who haven't been in business don't understand, but it is \ntrue. The customer is king. If you do anything that violates your trust \nwith the customer, you are going to pay for it, and you are going to \npay for it in real dollars.\n  So I believe the balance that has been struck in this bill to provide \nthe right amount of privacy protection is the correct balance, and I \nthink we must take some time and see how it works out in the real world \nof real commerce before we panic and say we must pass further Federal \nregulations.\n  With that, I record my approval of the work of the chairman and the \nranking member with respect to the conference and all of the \ndifficulties connected therewith, and say this is a historic day that \nwe are finally reaching after many, many years of wrangling on this \nsubject.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        securities transactions\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sarbanes for entering into \nthis colloquy with me during consideration of the conference report to \nthe financial services modernization bill, S. 900. This is an important \nbill which will bring our nation's regulatory structure up to date with \nthe many changes that have taken place over the past several decades \nregarding the activities of banks, securities firms, and insurance \ncompanies.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I agree with my colleague. The regulatory structure for \nbanks, securities firms, and insurance companies has not kept apace of \nthe new activities in which these entities have been able to take part.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I understand it, S. 900 will, among other things, make \nchanges to the Glass-Steagall Act which separates banking and \nsecurities business so that banks and their affiliates will be able to \ntake part in securities transactions from which they were previously \nprohibited.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is correct. This is one of the fundamental \naspects of this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. During Senate consideration of S. 900, I was concerned \nwith the ability of banks, securities firms, and insurance companies to \nenter into these new activities, and how these new activities would be \nregulated and by whom. In particular, I was concerned with how the \nsecurities activities of banks would be regulated. In the original \nversion of S. 900 there were loopholes which allowed the securities \nactivities of banks to go unregulated by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. I felt that these loopholes should be closed. I believe \nthat it makes the most sense for the regulators who have the most \nexperience in securities transactions, namely the SEC, to oversee these \nactivities.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is correct. Under current law, banks are \nexempt from SEC regulation as brokers and dealers. The original version \nof S. 900 would have maintained this exemption and would have allowed \nbanks to conduct a large range of securities transactions outside SEC \nregulation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is for this reason that I sponsored, with the support \nof Senator Schumer, an amendment to S. 900 which stated the following: \n``It is the intention of this Act subject to carefully defined \nexceptions which do not undermine the dominant principle of functional \nregulation to ensure that securities transactions effected by a bank \nare regulated by securities regulators, notwithstanding any other \nprovision of this Act.'' This amendment was agreed to during Senate \nconsideration of S. 900. Senator Sarbanes, as ranking member of the \nSenate Banking Committee, is it your understanding that the conference \nreport upholds the approach which I sought in my amendment?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, the conference report does uphold your approach.\n\n[[Page S13901]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. Meaningful oversight by the SEC of \nsecurities transactions by banks is critical to the financial health of \nour economy. Functional regulation will help to ensure that confidence \nin our financial system continues.\n  Mr. President, I have a copy of a letter from the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission Arthur Levitt to Senate Banking \nChairman Phil Gramm in which Chairman Levitt ``enthusiastically \nsupport(s) the securities provisions contained in the (chairman's) \nMark'' which eventually became part of the conference report. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing this colloquy.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Securities and Exchange Commission,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: As you know, the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission has long supported financial \n     modernization legislation that provides the protections of \n     the securities laws to all investors. I believe that the \n     changes to the securities laws contained in the proposed \n     amendments to the Chairmen's Mark that we agreed upon today \n     will significantly strengthen the investor protections of the \n     bill.\n       With the approval of those amendments, which I understand \n     you are distributing now, I enthusiastically support the \n     securities provisions contained in the Mark.\n       I appreciate your willingness to work with us on these \n     provisions to protect investors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arthur Levitt.\n\n\n                              section 711\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman of the Banking Committee. As the Chairman is aware, some \nlegitimate concerns have been raised over the potential burdens imposed \nby the reporting requirements contained in section 711.\n  Am I correct in stating that section 711(h)(2)(A) provides that \nFederal banking regulators shall ``ensure that the regulations \nprescribed by the agency do not impose any undue burden on the parties \nand the proprietary and confidential information is protected.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the Senator from \nConnecticut is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I also inquire of the chairman of the \nBanking Committee whether I am also correct in stating that the \nstatement of managers provides that ``the Federal banking agencies are \ndirected, in implementing regulations under this provision, to minimize \nthe regulatory burden on reporting parties. One way in which to \naccomplish this goal would be wherever possible and appropriate with \nthe purposes of this section, to make use of existing reporting and \nauditing requirements and practices of reporting parties, and thus \navoid unnecessary duplication of effort. The managers intend that, in \nissuing regulations under this section, the appropriate Federal \nsupervisory agency may provide that the nongovernmental entity or \nperson that is not an insured depository institution may, where \nappropriate and in keeping with the provisions of this section, fulfill \nthe requirements of subsection (c) by the submission of its annual \naudited financial statement or its Federal income tax return.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. The understanding of the Senator from Connecticut is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the chairman for his cooperation in this matter.\n\n\n                       effective date of title i\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman of the Banking Committee. Mr. Chairman, the conference \ncommittee agreed to make the effective date of implementation of title \nI, except for section 104, 120 days from the date of enactment. We \nreached this decision to provide the regulators with an opportunity to \nimplement this legislation effectively. Am I correct in stating that it \nis the intent of the conferees that title I become effective 120 days \nafter enactment even if the agencies are not able to complete all of \nthe rulemaking required under the act during that time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the Senator from \nConnecticut is correct. In addition, it should be noted that in some \ninstances, no rule-writing is required. For example, new section \n4(k)(4) of the Bank Holding Company Act, as added by section 103 of the \nbill, explicitly authorizes bank holding companies which file the \nnecessary certifications to engage in a laundry list of financial \nactivities. These activities are permissible upon the effective date of \nthe act without further action by the regulators. The conferees \nrecognize, however, that refinements in rulemaking may be necessary and \ndesirable going forward, and for example, have specifically authorized \nthe Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to jointly issue rules \non merchant banking activities. If regulators determine that any such \nrulemaking is necessary, the conferees encourage them to act \nexpeditiously.\n\n\n                              section 731\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask Senator Gramm, in his capacity as \nchairman of the Senate Banking Committee and one of the chief authors \nof the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that is before us today, to clarify a \npoint about section 731 of the act. Is it correct that section 731 is \nnot intended to affect banks whose home office and authorized branch \noffices are not located in the State described?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also inquire whether it is also Chairman \nGramm's understanding that, notwithstanding section 731, national banks \nwith interstate offices are in all events authorized under section 85 \nof the National Bank Act, as confirmed by the United States Supreme \nCourt case, Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha Service Corp., \n439 U.S. 299 (1978), to export the interest rates of the State where \ntheir home office is located?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, that is my understanding. I would add that \nnational banks are also entitled to charge the rates of the host State \nof the interstate branch, as authorized by interpretations of the \nComptroller of the Currency, where there is some nexus between the hose \nState and the loan.\n\n\n                              section 507\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my good \nfriend Senator Gramm, chairman of the Committee on Banking, on section \n507 of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. I want to \nconfirm that section 507 is intended to apply only to the amendments \nmade by subtitle A of title V of the bill, and that section 507 is not \nto be construed, under any circumstances, to apply to any provision of \nlaw other than the provisions of subtitle A. For instance, subtitle A \nof title V relates only to disclosure of nonpublic personal information \nto nonaffiliated third parties. This means that section 507 of the bill \ndoes not supersede, alter, or affect laws on the disclosure of \ninformation among affiliated entities. In particular, section 507 does \nnot supersede, alter, or affect the provisions of the Federal Fair \nCredit Reporting Act (or FCRA) regarding the communication of \ninformation among persons related by common ownership or affiliated by \ncorporate control, nor does section 507 supersede, alter, or affect the \nexisting FCRA preemption of state laws with respect to the exchange of \ninformation among affiliated entities. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the Senator from \nFlorida is correct. Section 507 is intended to apply only to subtitle A \nof title V of the bill, and is not to be construed to apply to any \nprovision of law other than the provisions of the subtitle. Thus, \nsection 507 does not affect the existing FCRA provisions on that \nstatute's relationship to state laws.\n\n\n                             section 502(b)\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I respectfully request of the chairman that \nwe engage in a colloquy regarding section 502(b), which describes the \nopt-out notice required by subtitle A.\n  I would like to clarify that a financial institutions' obligation to \nsend an opt-out notice under this subtitle is satisfied when it has \ncomplied with notification requirements regarding privacy policies and \npractices under section 503, and the consumer is further given the \nright to direct that their non-public personal information not be \ndisclosed to non-affiliated third parties. A separate opt-out notice \nneed not be provided for each third party disclosure, provided that the \nconsumer receives a prior clear and conspicuous\n\n[[Page S13902]]\n\nopt-out opportunity covering third party disclosures generally.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the interpretation of the Senator from \nIdaho on this point is correct. The intent of section 502 is to assure \nthat consumers receive clear and conspicuous notice of a financial \ninstitutions' privacy policies and practices, and to assure that \nconsumers can direct that their non-public information not be disclosed \nto third parties. So long as consumers receive a notice that gives them \na clear choice about whether or not that non-public personal \ninformation can be transferred to non-affiliated third parties, the \nopt-out choice need not be provided separately for each disclosure of \nsuch information.\n\n\n                     insurance company investments\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Banking Committee in a colloquy on the ability of \ninsurance companies to make investments that are treated as ``financial \nin nature'' under this legislation even though the investments are made \nin companies that are not engaged in financial activities.\n  Am I correct that overlap between board members and officers of a \nfinancial holding company and a portfolio company in which an insurance \ncompany has an investment is not intended to result necessarily in a \ndetermination that the holding company routinely manages or operates \nthe portfolio company? Or to state this intention another way, the \nexistence of routine holding company management or operation is to be \nbased upon an assessment of actual holding company involvement in day-\nto-day management and operations of the portfolio company, rather than \nboard member or officer overlaps.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the Senator from Utah \nis correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I also inquire of the distinguished \nchairman of the Banking Committee whether I am also correct that the \nexception under which a holding company may routinely manage or operate \na portfolio company when necessary or required to obtain a reasonable \nreturn on investment is intended to apply to an investment in a company \nthat has been generating a below average rate of return on investment \neither at the time the holding company becomes a bank holding company \nor that generates a below average rate of return at a subsequent time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the Senator from Utah \nis also correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, finally, I would inquire whether I am \ncorrect that, consistent with the principle of functional regulation \napplied throughout this legislation, the determination whether an \ninvestment made by an insurance company is made in the ordinary course \nof business in accordance with relevant state law should be made by the \ninsurance authority of the state in which the insurance company is \nlocated.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, yes, the Senator's understanding is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                             section 502(d)\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, will the chairman of the Banking committee \nyield for a few questions?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield to the vice chairman of the \nFinancial Institutions Subcommittee.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I inquire of the chairman with respect to \nthe provision in section 502(d) that prohibits the sharing of customer \naccount numbers with non-affiliated third parties for marketing \npurposes, is it the intent that the third party be able to receive \ncustomer account number upon approval by the customer?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I also inquire of the chairman whether, in \nfact, it is his expectation that the regulators will use their broad \nexemptive authority given in the legislation to allow for sharing \nencrypted account numbers if the customer has given his or her \nauthorization?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, yes, that is true.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, would the chairman please yield to me for \na question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the chairman \nof the financial Institutions Subcommittee.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished chairman \nof the Banking Committee whether the managers felt so strongly that \nthey chose to highlight this exemption for encrypted account numbers in \nreport language. We would hope the regulators would use this exemptive \nauthority. Isn't that true?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Yes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. This commonsense approach is consistent with consumer \nchoice and with the customer privacy. We expect the regulators to use \ntheir exemptive authority to allow legitimate business practices that \nsafeguard customer financial information to continue to operate and \nprovide customers with greater choices of products and services.\n\n\n                              section 401\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee. It is my understanding \nthat section 401 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is intended to prohibit \nacquisitions of grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies by \ncommercial companies. Section 401 is not intended to prohibit \nacquisitions of grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies by \ncompanies that, immediately prior to the acquisition, engage only in \nthe activities permissible for financial holding companies. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the gentleman from \nUtah is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I also seek clarification of the chairman \nof the Banking Committee that section 401 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act \nis not intended to limit or otherwise affect the powers and authorities \nof grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies after such companies \nare acquired by companies that, immediately prior to the acquisition, \nengage only in the activities permissible for financial holding \ncompanies. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the gentleman from \nUtah is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the chairman yield to me for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would be happy to do so.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, under section \n401 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision has \nthe authority to prevent evasions of the unitary thrift holding company \ngrandfather provisions of the act. Will the chairman tell me if that is \ncorrect?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there is a long-standing body of law that \naddresses the issue of when an acquisition or change in control of a \nsavings association or thrift holding company occurs. Is it intended \nthat the Office of Thrift Supervision would apply to existing body of \nlaw to determine if an evasion has occurred?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in response to my colleague, let me state \nthat section 401 is intended to authorize the Office of Thrift \nSupervision to prevent evasions through actions that are consistent \nwith the statutory, regulatory and interpretive provisions governing \nacquisitions or changes in control of savings associations and thrift \nholding companies that were in effect on the grandfather cut-off date, \nMay 4, 1999.\n\n\n                                title v\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to engage my esteemed colleague, \nSenator Gramm, in a brief colloquy to clarify two items pertaining to \ntitle V, subtitle A. First Mr. President, is it Chairman Gramm's \nunderstanding that the term ``nonpublic personal information'' as that \nterm is defined in section 509(4) of title V, subtitle A, applies to \ninformation that describes an individual's financial condition obtained \nfrom one of the three sources as set forth in the definition, and by \nexample would include experiences with the account established in the \ninitial transaction or other private financial information?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, that is my understanding.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The second item relates to an amendment to the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, ``FCRA'' in 506(b) of title V, subtitle A. Mr. \nPresident, it is my understanding that striking the FCRA's outright \nprohibition on various agencies drafting trade regulation rules or \nother regulations is intended to allow for these agencies to fulfill\n\n[[Page S13903]]\n\ntheir mandate under this title to issue regulations. The deletion \nleaves the law silent on the issue of agencies issuing regulations \noutside of this title, and it should not be construed to mean that an \nagency now has a mandate to issue any such regulations. Mr. President, \ndoes the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, Mr. Gramm, \nshare this view of the provision?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Allard's assessments \non these points.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Financial \nServices Modernization Act. I would like to explain why I will vote in \nfavor of this conference bill, but I also want to discuss one area \nwhere I feel this legislation falls significantly short--privacy. The \nfinancial modernization bill deserves the support of this body for \nseveral reasons:\n  (1) First, it reforms our antiquated financial services laws. By \nallowing a single organization to offer any type of financial product, \nthe bill will stimulate competition and innovation in the banking, \nsecurities and insurance industry. It will increase choice and reduce \ncosts for consumers, communities and businesses. According to Secretary \nSummers, Americans spend over $350 billion per year for fees and \ncommissions for brokerage, insurance and banking services. If increased \ncompetition yielded savings to consumers of even 5 percent, they would \nsave over $18 billion per year.\n  (2) By removing the barriers to competition, the act will also \nenhance the stability of our financial services system. Financial \ninstitutions will be able to diversify their product offerings--and \ntherefore their sources of revenue. They will also be better able to \ncompete in the global financial marketplace, which is rapidly changing. \nThough U.S. banks still maintain some of the highest numbers in assets, \nthey no longer rank the highest among the world's top banks in \nprofitability. The financial services modernization bill gives U.S. \nfinancial institutions the flexibility and expanded powers to stay \ncompetitive in the changing market.\n  (3) The conference bill benefits Americans communities by preserving \nthe Community Reinvestment Act. I am pleased to see that the act \nrequires that banks maintain a good track record in community \nreinvestment as a condition for expanding into newly authorized \nbusinesses. This is the first time that a bank's rating under the CRA \nwill be considered when it expands outside of traditional banking \nactivities. I am also happy to see that the act applies CRA to all \nbanks without exception.\n  Despite these merits, there is one issue of great concern to many \nCalifornians and many Americans--the lack of privacy provisions in the \nlegislation. As my colleagues know, financial institutions are \ncurrently permitted to document, profile, and sell our most personal \nfinancial information. Financial institutions share and sell social \nsecurity numbers, addresses, information about what stocks we own, what \nchecks we write, what we charge on our credit cards and how much money \nwe have in the bank. All of this without the knowledge or permission of \ntheir clients. I believe Americans should have the opportunity to \nprohibit a financial institution from sharing or selling this personal \nfinancial information.\n  The bottom line is simple: Bank customers should have the final say \nin whether their bank sells or even shares their personal financial \ninformation. Regardless of whether that information is being shared \nwith a financial institution within a bank's shareholding company or \nwith a third party. The consumer should decide who has access to this \npersonal information. According to an October 21st USA Today article, \nU.S. Bancorp sold customer information to a telemarketer membership \nprogram. U.S. Bancorp customers began complaining that they were billed \nfor marketing services they never agreed to. According to the lawsuit \nagainst U.S. Bancorp, the bank's customers say they were never even \ncontacted by the marketing service before the charges appeared on their \nstatements.\n  In one case, the suit says, a 90-year-old woman who had been a \ncustomer of U.S. Bancorp for more than 50 years was billed for a \nprogram that offers discounts on computer products. The woman didn't \nown a computer. Before she died, she tried for 11 months to get the \ntelemarketing firm to remove the charges from her credit card account. \nThe legislation does not do enough to prevent this type of problem. In \nanother example, the Los Angeles Times reports that a small San \nFernando Valley bank unknowingly became the accessory to a huge credit \ncard scam. The bank sold 3.7 million credit card numbers to a felon, \nwho then allegedly bilked cardholders out of millions of dollars.\n  Under the act, people applying for a mortgage will have no say over \nwho has access to their personal financial data. If a person has been \ntreated for an illness and paid for their medical tests with their \ncredit care or personal checks, that individual's bank and mortgage \ncompany will share this information, without the knowledge or consent \nof the client. Tax information, insurance information, and records of \nmedical tests they have purchased will be fair game for financial \ninstitutions. This sensitive information should be kept private--not \nshared between banks, insurance companies, and securities firms.\n  For 66 years--since the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted after the \nDepression--a boundary has existed between banks, insurance companies, \nand securities firms. This bill breaks through that wall, by allowing \nfinancial entities to merge. This change, while beneficial to the \nindustry, should not come at the expense of the consumer. Industry \ngroups are opposed to privacy provisions--and go so far as to say that \nprivacy provisions could make it tougher for them to fight fraud. It's \nno surprise they feel this way, considering banks typically get 20-to-\n25 percent of the revenue generated by the marketer. But a handful of \nfinancial companies already allow customers to restrict the use of \nprivate information--and it doesn't seem to be hurting them. American \nExpress sends customers a notice once a year, asking customers if they \nwant to receive product offers from American Express or outside \nmerchants. Even if customers want the offers, the company never gives \ndetailed information about a transaction history. If American Express \ncan protect its customer's privacy, why can't all financial \ninstitutions?\n  The conference bill includes only a weak privacy provision allowing \ncustomers to say no to their bank's disclosure of information to third \nparties--such as telemarketers. I think this is a serious flaw in an \notherwise very good bill. In fact, the language adopted by the \nconference authorizes financial institutions and third parties to enter \ninto joint marketing agreements that would allow them to skirt the opt-\nout requirement. And the bill intentionally does not restrict the \nsharing of private financial information among a financial \ninstitution's affiliates. I hope my colleagues will work with me in the \nfuture to see that Americans' privacy is better protected.\n  The Financial Services Modernization Act makes the most important \nlegislative changes to the structure of the U.S. financial system since \nthe 1930s. I believe the bill is good for the U.S. economy as well as \nour ability to compete in global financial markets. Despite my reserves \nabout the privacy provisions in the bill, I support S. 900, and urge \nits adoption by my colleagues.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I express my genuine appreciation to all \nthe members of the Senate Banking Committee for their hard work, \ncommitment and dedication to resolving the tough and contentious issues \nsurrounding the conference report that we are considering today. It is \nno exaggeration to suggest that this conference report represents more \nthan 15 years of hard work and perseverance in tackling one of the most \nimportant issues in the new economy.\n  I support the conference report. However, I do so with some \nreservations about the way the final product was developed and because \nit does not include a number of important consumer protection \nprovisions. For example, the legislation will pre-empt important state \nlegislation prohibiting certain predatory lending practices that result \nin poor, vulnerable, elderly homeowners being bilked out of thousands \nof dollars or, in some cases, losing their homes.\n\n[[Page S13904]]\n\n  However, I believe enactment of financial modernization is a critical \nfirst step toward breaking down barriers to allow financial services \ncompanies to provide better services at lower costs to consumers and to \nhelp insure American dominance of global finance in the 21st Century.\n  As we all know, breaking down the walls that separate commercial \nbanking from the insurance and securities industries is of enormous \nimportance to the future of the financial services industry, which has \nundergone an immense transformation in recent years. Dramatic changes \nin technology along with historic mergers, consolidations, and \nacquisitions have reordered the structure of the financial services \nindustry and made the statutory distinctions that have existed in the \nlaw until today less and less relevant in the real world.\n  As a result of these changes, large corporations have begun bypassing \ntraditional financial institutions and accessing capital markets \ndirectly. Many large corporations now meet their funding needs by \nissuing commercial paper, rather than by borrowing from banks. Banks \nand thrifts are also experiencing increased competition from non-\nbanking institutions that offer a range of financial products and \nservices. During this time, commercial banks have been unable to \nprovide consumers with a number of important financial products and \nservices.\n  The conference report that the Senate is considering today repeals \nthe Glass-Steagall Act, which has separated banks from securities firms \nsince the 1930s. It also repeals a similar provision that has separated \nbanking and insurance. It will permit the creation of new financial \nholding companies that could offer banking, insurance, securities and \nother financial products.\n  I am very pleased that the Treasury Secretary Summers and Federal \nReserve Bank Chairman Alan Greenspan have come to an agreement on the \noperating subsidiary issue that was included in the conference report. \nBanks will now be able to choose the corporate structure under which to \nconduct new non-banking activities--either through an operating \nsubsidiary or through an affiliate. The bill would allow operating \nsubsidiaries to engage in merchant banking activities, but only if the \nFederal Reserve and the Treasury jointly agree that the activity is \npermissible. A bank would have to be well capitalized and well managed \nafter deducting its equity investment in an operating subsidiary from \nits capital in order to take advantage of these new activities. I \nbelieve that this compromise will let banks choose their own operating \nstructure and will help maintain safety and soundness in our financial \nsystem.\n  The operating subsidiary provisions also include language that would \nretain state authority over state chartered bank subsidiaries. Section \n121(d)(1) of the final bill provides that nothing in Section 46(d) \nsupersedes the current authority of the FDIC over bank subsidiary \nactivities under Section 24 of the Act. The provision recognizes that, \nconsistent with current and proposed rules of the FDIC, investment \nauthorities of state-chartered bank subsidiaries are not to be \nrestricted to any greater extent that those authorized for a state bank \nitself. More particularly, in several states, including Massachusetts, \nstate banks have a long history of exercising limited authority to \ninvest in common stocks either directly or through wholly-owned \nsubsidiaries. The FDIC has acknowledged and approved such investment \nauthority through so-called investment subsidiaries. It is my \nunderstanding that the newly added Section 46(d) acknowledges and \npreserves that authority and does not contemplate imposition of \nadditional regulatory requirements or impediments.\n  I am also glad that the conference report will permit financial \ninstitutions to engage in merchant banking activities. This will allow \nbanks to invest in small companies for the purpose of appreciating and \nultimately reselling the investment. The merchant banking provisions \nlimit the day-to-day management of companies by financial institutions \nand the duration of the investment. I am hopeful that these new powers \nwill allow banks to provide more capital for small businesses, which \nhave been leading contributors to the economic growth of our country.\n  The conference report includes an important limitation on banking and \ncommerce which eliminates the ability of commercial firms to form new \nunitary thrifts unless they had owned or had applied to own a unitary \nthrift by May 4, 1999. Under the conference report, current unitary \nthrift holding companies and their savings association subsidiaries \nwould be able to continue their normal activities. However, future \nsales of unitary thrift holding companies would not be allowed to \ncommercial firms. Sales would be limited only to financial holding \ncompanies.\n  Building this fence around financial firms to keep them largely \nisolated from joint ownership with commerce and industry is an \nextremely important safeguard in this legislation. My first priority as \nmember of the Senate Banking Committee is to maintain the safety and \nsoundness of our financial system to insure that American taxpayer \nfunds are not necessary to bail out our financial institutions. \nHowever, we are now in an era in which banks and other firms are \nbecoming ``too big to fail'' where the government will intervene if its \ncollapse would cause a major harm to the economy. With the enactment of \nthis legislation, banks, insurance and securities conglomerates will \ngrow even larger and more intertwined. The failure of any one of these \nnew conglomerates could disrupt our financial system and risk a \ntaxpayer-funded bailout that would dwarf the savings and loan payout. \nFor example, recently the Federal Reserve Bank felt compelled to rescue \nthe Long Term Capital, a hedge fund, even though it was not a federally \ninsured bank.\n  That is why I strongly supported including a provision that would \nhave required large banks to back some portion of their assets with \nsubordinated debt. Holders of this type of debt would have a strong \nincentive to monitor each financial institution's level of risk to \nprotect their investment. This approach could also serve as an early \nwarning signal for regulators of banks that are engaged in risky \nactivities. Unfortunately, this requirement was reduced to only a \nstudy. I will be working with my colleagues and with federal regulators \nto address this problem in the future.\n  I am also very disappointed that the conference report does not \ninclude acceptable language regarding mutual insurance companies. Many \nStates currently have laws that restrict the hostile take over of a \nmutual insurance company that has recently converted to a stock \ninsurer. However, the conference report allows these state laws to be \npreempted ``so long as such restriction does not have the effect of \ndiscriminating, intentionally or unintentionally, against an insured \ndepository institution or an affiliate thereof * * *.'' I believe that \nthis language, as currently written, would allow only banks whose \ntakeover attempts were denied by a state insurance commissioner to \nlitigate. The ability to litigate would not be extended to any other \npotential acquisitor.\n\n  This law means that any state restriction of a banking organization's \nattempts to takeover a demutualizing insurance company could be \nconstrued by a court as discrimination against the bank. I believe that \nthis could lead to costly and time consuming litigation for every \ninsurance company that attempts demutualization. Further, if a court \nwere to fail to interpret the word ``discrimination'' narrowly, this \nnew language could essentially end the important state preemption \nprovision only in cases where a bank is the proposed acquisitor. It \nwould not allow other potential acquisitors to litigate.\n  I am also very concerned about the provision included in the \nconference report that will allow mutual insurance companies to \nredomesticate to another state and reorganize into a mutual holding \ncompanies or stock companies. I believe that this provision will allow \nsome mutual insurance companies to move to states without adequate \nconsumer protections and could endanger policyholders during a \nconversion from mutual to stock form.\n  I am pleased, however, that the conference report includes the PRIME \nAct, which will provide an opportunity to lend a helping hand to those \nin need of financial aid and technical assistance so that they can \nfulfill their personal, family, and community responsibilities. \nMicroenterprise development has\n\n[[Page S13905]]\n\ngiven many a chance to break the cycle of poverty and welfare and move \ntoward individual responsibility and financial independence.\n  Specifically, the PRIME Act authorizes funding for technical \nassistance to give microentrepreneurs access to information on \ndeveloping a business plan, record-keeping, planning, financing and \nmarketing, which are crucial to small business development.\n  For example, PRIME would augment funds for valuable programs run by \nWorking Capital, located in Massachusetts and a recipient of a \nPresidential Award for Excellence in Microenterprise Development in \n1997. Working Capital currently offers a number of valuable programs to \nits microenterprise customers which could be augmented by additional \nfunding under PRIME such as providing business credit to \nmicroentrepreneurs and providing business education and training on how \nto draw up business plans and prepare financial projections. These \nprograms instruct microentrepreneurs on how to use these tools in \nmanaging their businesses. This type of assistance is crucial to the \ndevelopment of our low-income communities and throughout the United \nStates.\n  I very much appreciate that the conference report includes a \nprovision to repeal the Savings Bank Provisions in the Bank Holding \nCompany Act. Section 3(f) was added to the Bank Holding Company Act in \n1987 to provide a special grant of authority to savings banks, but \ncourt decisions and Federal Reserve Board interpretations now make it \nrestrictive for many Massachusetts banks. Repeal of this provision will \nbring the treatment of Massachusetts savings banks in line with that of \nother financial institutions.\n  Mr. President, I also want to emphasize that although I strongly \nbelieve that we have to take this first step to toward modernizing our \nbanking industry and although I will support this conference report, I \nremain committed to strengthening and improving consumer privacy \nprotections and to encouraging greater community investment by \nfinancial institutions.\n  I believe that we can and must do more to safeguard the financial \nprivacy of every American. Every American deserves to control his or \nher personal financial information. I am concerned that the changes in \ntechnology and in the marketplace have diminished every American's \nability to safeguard his or her personal financial privacy. The \nconference report gives customers of financial services companies only \nlimited control over their personal financial information. Customers \nwill now have the right to object to their institutions' sharing their \nfinancial data with third parties and will require these institutions \nto provide notice to customers when they disclose financial information \nwithin an affiliate. Fortunately, the conference report does not \npreempt stronger state privacy laws.\n  I want to note for the Record that I supported stronger privacy \nprotections that would have given every customer the right to see what \nfinancial information would be shared with affiliates or third parties. \nI also supported an opt-in standard for consumers whose financial \ninstitution provides their personal financial information to \nunaffiliated third parties. This provision was supported by 26 state \nAttorneys General and many others. I will be working with my \ndistinguished colleagues including the Senator from Maryland Mr. \nSarbanes, as well as Senators Bryan, Shelby and others to work on \nstrengthening safeguards to protect the privacy of every American.\n  All throughout the consideration of this legislation, from the very \nfirst meetings of the Banking Committee, through floor consideration \nand the conference negotiations, Congressional Democrats and the \nAdministration have insisted that the Community Reinvestment Act must \nbe allowed to grow and adapt to the new circumstances being created for \nthe financial industry. Despite the most aggressive, uninformed, and \nsustained attack on that important law I have ever witnessed, I am \nhappy to say that the new law will reflect this important goal.\n  The new law established that, as a precondition for any bank to \nexercise any of the new powers authorized by this legislation, either \nde novo or through a merger or acquisition, a bank must have a \nsatisfactory CRA rating. This test will be applied each time a bank \nseeks to take engage in a new activity, so that a bank will have to, as \na practical matter, both have and maintain a satisfactory CRA rating to \ntake advantage of the new law. Prior to this agreement, a bank could \nstart up a securities affiliate without any regard to its CRA rating, \nso this new law is clearly a step forward. That is why Reverend Jesse \nJackson and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) support \nthe CRA provisions in the bill.\n  I understand and share the concerns of some of my colleagues who \nbelieve that the conference report does not go far enough. Certainly, \nthe alternative that and my fellow Democrats supported would have been \nmore acceptable. However, I believe that this legislation clearly meets \nthe objective of ensuring that CRA remains a central part of every \nfinancial institution's operations into the next century.\n  The conference report would also require certain agreements between a \nbank and community groups made in connection with CRA to be fully \ndisclosed and would reduce the frequency of CRA compliance exams for \ncertain banks with less than $250 million in assets.\n  I am concerned that further attempts to weaken the Community \nReinvestment Act will occur during the 106th Congress. Let me be \nabsolutely clear: I will strongly oppose any attempts to weaken CRA in \nany manner whatsoever. CRA is a fundamental tool to insure that all \ncreditworthy Americans, regardless of the neighborhood they live in, \nregardless of their race or circumstances, have access to the bank \nloans that are needed to buy a home or start a business. It is a law \nthat breathes life into the rhetoric we all use extolling the virtues \nof equal opportunity. We cannot and must not return to the days of \npoverty and desperation borne of bank redlining in too many communities \nacross the nation.\n  This conference report is far from perfect, but few compromises ever \nare. A product that represents more than 15 years of hard work and the \ndebates of literally hundreds of individuals and disparate \nconstituencies could hardly represent a perfect product to every side. \nThis report is no different. But I will tell you, and I think almost \nall of us would agree that in the American system of free enterprise \nthe interests of consumers and industry are best served if we permit \ncompetition as long as that competition is fair and does not give any \nindustry or player an advantage over another. I believe that this \nlegislation is an important step in facilitating that competition and \nit meets that test by allowing every American access to a broader group \nof financial services at a lower cost. We have a historic chance to \nprovide meaningful financial services reform. I will support the \nconference report and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. And, \nremembering as I think we all should, that this legislation represents \nnot an endpoint but a starting point, I would respectfully suggest that \nwe all focus in the months and years ahead on the potential role this \nSenate can play in helping to create the environment in which financial \nservices work to the best advantage of every American. Our goal should \nbe nothing less.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I expect the financial services \nmodernization conference report will pass both the Senate and House \nwith large majorities. I certainly understand the strong support for \nthis sweeping legislation, though I must register my strong displeasure \nand firm opposition to the punitive unitary thrift charter provisions \nincluded in this measure. The language approved by the conference \ncommittee and favored by the Clinton-Gore administration unfairly, \nunnecessarily and without compelling reason eliminates and restricts \nexisting authorities and powers of the unitary thrift charter.\n  I am proud to represent a state where the thrift industry is \nthriving. Washington state thrifts manage over $200 billion in assets. \nIt may surprise some to learn that the largest unitary thrift in the \nnation, Washington Mutual, is headquartered in Washington state. One \ndoes not expect a financial institution of this size to be based in \nWashington. Though, knowing this fact, one should not be surprised to \nlearn of my significant interest in how this legislation affects my \nlargest financial institution constituent and a major Washington state \nemployer.\n\n[[Page S13906]]\n\n  I support virtually all of the conference report's modernization \nprovisions: eliminating the 1933 barrier to the affiliation of banks, \ninsurance companies and securities firms that will allow consumers \ngreater choice at reduced costs; the compromise agreement reached \nbetween the Federal Reserve Board and Treasury Department on the \nregulation of operating subsidiaries; improving the Community \nReinvestment Act; expending Federal Home Loan Bank provisions that will \nallow greater access for small business and farm loans; and the \ninclusion of privacy protections for consumers.\n  These provisions do contribute to the modernization of our nation's \nfinancial services industry from the Great Depression era laws under \nwhich they have been operating. These changes represent positive \nadvances for the future. Such is not the case with the unitary thrift \ncharter provisions. The unitary thrift language is regressive and \npunitive--a step backwards for financial modernization and a black-mark \non an otherwise favorable bill. I sincerely regret that delusional \nfears about the non-existent and impossible mixing of banking and \ncommerce under a unitary thrift charter have prevailed over fact and \nreason. Neither the FDIC or the primary regulator have identified any \nsafety and soundness concerns during the three decade existence of \nunitary thrifts. Not one.\n  It is clear that this legislation unfairly treats Washington Mutual \nand other unitary thrifts, and for this specific reason I seriously \nconsidered voting against the conference report to protest the \ninjustice of the unitary thrift provisions. After listening to and \nspeaking with Chairman Gramm to clarify the impact of the unitary \nthrift charter provisions, however, I concluded that I will support \npassage of the conference report. The unitary thrift provisions are \ncompletely contradictory to this legislation's goal of modernization, \nyet I find the clarifying statements of Chairman Gramm to be of \nsufficient reassurance that I will not vote against this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report accompanying S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of \n1999. And I want to begin my remarks today by congratulating Senator \nGramm, my friend and the chairman of the committee. We would not be \nhere without his hard work, dedication, and skillful negotiation and he \ndeserves the lion's share of credit for the fine bill we have before us \ntoday.\n  We are making history here. It has been 66 years since Congress \npassed the Glass-Steagall banking act in the depths of the Great \nDepression. It has been at least twenty years since determined efforts \nbegan in the Congress to repeal this outdated law and modernize the \ncountry's banking code. Today--finally--we have come to the end of the \nroad.\n  As we stand on the verge of passing this bill, we have a great view \nboth backward and forward. We can see a past in which the country's \nfinancial services industry led the world despite an archaic code \nrecognized by everyone to be insufficient. And we can look ahead into a \nfuture that offers the American financial consumer: New and innovative \nproducts, better choices, information and service, and workable \nregulations that allow our financial firms to compete in the global \nmarketplace to an even greater extent than today.\n  This much-needed legislation modernizing our nation's banking laws is \nhappening none too soon. I want to spend some time talking about the \ntwo reasons I believe we're here. The first is the transformation of \nour economy over the past 20 years, and by extension the remarkable \nchanges in our financial services sector. And the second is the \ntremendous impact of the technological revolution on the banking \nindustry.\n  We are currently in the eighth year of the longest peacetime economic \nexpansion in our history. When you look at the data, there is only one \nconclusion to draw: we are now reaping the economic benefits of the \nhard decisions on economic fundamentals we made back in the 1980s. \nUnder the leadership of President Reagan, we dramatically lowered \nmarginal tax rates, began the rollback of burdensome and overlapping \nregulations, promoted openness to trade and investment around the \nworld, lowered interest rates, and defeated the inflation menace that \ncrippled our economic competitiveness. In the 1990s, Congress finally \ncompleted the job by producing the first balanced federal budgets in a \ngeneration.\n  You cannot overestimate the impact of these fundamental economic \nvictories on the prosperity the nation is enjoying today. One of my \nbiggest concerns, as I think about the history of this era, is people \nwill be left with the impression that President Clinton's 1993 tax \nincreases created this economic expansion. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. We must not forget the hard--and ultimately correct--\ndecisions made on fundamental questions like taxes, regulation, \ninterest rates, and inflation in the 1980s that freed up the \nmarketplace and allowed American businesses to capitalize on their \ninherent advantages.\n  The country's financial sector has certainly shared in this \nprosperity. We have witnessed a revolution in the delivery of financial \nservices during the 1990s as the traditional barriers between banking, \ninsurance and securities began to come down. Freedom and our free \nenterprise system ensured that new financial products and alliance \nemanated from America to service the demands of the global economy. \nThese products and alliance provide American businesses, investors, and \nconsumers with the ability to secure more easily the capital they need \nto finance their hopes and dreams. As this new economic and financial \ndynamic became more clear, it was also apparent our existing banking \ncode was outdated and in need of change.\n  As part of the new economy, it is hard to overstate the impact of the \ntechnological revolution on the financial marketplace. Earlier this \nyear, during hearings on the bill before us, Chairman Greenspan noted \nthe financial sector:\n\n       . . . is undergoing major and fundamental change driven by \n     a revolution in technology, by dramatic innovations in the \n     capital markets, and by the globalization of the financial \n     markets and the financial services industry.\n\n  Indeed, the financial marketplace is changing with lightning speed. \nIn September, we held a high-technology summit at the Joint Economic \nCommittee. One of those who testified before our committee was \na twenty-nine-year-old entrepreneur who created an electronic stock \ntrading network. Nine of these electronic trading networks make up \nabout twenty percent of the NASDAQ market and are posing a serious \nchallenge to more traditional stock exchanges and markets. Mortgages \nand traditional banking services are available over the internet. And \nanybody who watches television advertisements knows a new generation od \nweb-based businesses are transforming the traditional image--and, \nincidentally, the fee structure--of stock brokers and stock trading. \nThese businesses and the many others who have gone online to challenge \nthe existing orthodoxy are prompting sweeping changes in the financial \nmarketplace. And they are creating yet another imperative for this \nbill.\n\n  As the American financial industry seized on technological advances \nto lead the world into new financial markets and new financial \nproducts, they awoke from their long slumber of lobbying wars and turf \nprotection and realized it was in everybody's best interest to pass \nthis bill. If our financial firms are to lead and compete in the world \nmarketplace, they must be able to compete from a position of strength. \nAnd they must compete from the foundation of banking laws that reflect \nthe new realities of the world marketplace.\n  The end game on this legislation was by no means easy. During the \neleven months we spent writing this bill, we had to continually strike \ncareful balances between the broad, over-arching goals of the bill and \nthe temptation to tinker with the marketplace and predetermine the \nshape of future financial products and services. The fast pace of \nchange presents a difficult choice for policymakers. We are often too \ncumbersome in the Congress to lead, we can be irrelevant if we follow, \nand some among us believe it could be risky to get out of the way. In \nthe face of this dilemma, some of our colleagues wanted us to \nanticipate every possible side-effect of this financial transformation \nand write the laws accordingly. This is just not possible, and the \nresultant regulatory burdens would have stopped this financial \nrevolution in its tracks.\n\n[[Page S13907]]\n\n  In the bill before us today, we tried to embrace the following \nprinciples:\n  First, banks, insurance companies and securities firms should be able \nto enter one another's business and create a financial dynamic for the \nnext century;\n  Second, new banking products should be regulated by the regulator \nthat knows them best.\n  Third, institutions should disclose to customers what they are doing \nwith their sensitive personal information--both within and outside the \nfinancial firm. And customers should be able to stop these companies \nfrom sharing their information with third parties.\n  Next, new financial activities conducted through subsidiaries of \nbanks should be conducted so as to ensure taxpayer guaranteed deposits \nare not threatened.\n  And finally, the burdensome regulations on banks with respect to \ncommunity lending should not be increased as a result of what we're \ndoing in this bill.\n  There are sensible guidelines and I'm satisfied we've created the \nbasis here for a safe, sound and flexible financial industry that will \nserve the interests of American consumers, investors and businesses \nwell into the future.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are making history here. \nA hundred years from today, I believe the primary thing people will \nremember about this Congress is that we finally did the right thing and \npassed this bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on a personal \nnote. As I begin to recognize the reality that my service in the United \nStates Senate will end in slightly more than a year, I find I am \nengaging in the occasional reflection.\n  During the last 12 years of my 18 years in the Congress, I served on \nthe Senate Banking Committee--the committee responsible for writing and \noverseeing the laws of the land that regulate the banking and financial \nindustry. This has been special to me because I spent the first sixteen \nyears of my career in the banking business. It was work I enjoyed as \nthe years went by. It was also work I found increasingly frustrating \nbecause of the stifling regulatory burden placed on banks by the \nfederal government. It was for these and other reasons I left my \nposition as President and LEO of my bank in Cape Coral, Florida and ran \nfor the Congress.\n  I will not stand here today and claim the credit for the far-reaching \nand far-sighted bill before us today. My friend and colleague Senator \nGramm deserves the credit on the Senate side. I nonetheless feel a \nstrong sense of pride and institutional accomplishment for the legacy \nwe are leaving to the United States in passing this bill. It will \nbenefit the people, the industry, and the economy as a whole and it is \ntruly a document we can all be very proud of. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the conference report\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have always been supportive of \nmodernizing the outdated laws and regulations governing the financial \nservices industry. It doesn't make sense to me to slap a regulatory \nstraight-jacket on American financial companies and drive up costs for \nconsumers while companies around the globe are able to compete \nunhindered by unnecessary barriers. It seems to me that you can't \ncompete in a 21st century global financial market using a playbook that \nwas written during the Great Depression.\n  But I have also believed that financial services modernization \nshouldn't come at the expense of consumer and community interests. In \nfact, back in May, I voted against the Senate version of this bill, as \ndid 43 of my colleagues here in the Senate, because it would have \ndevastated lending in rural and low income communities, and because it \ndidn't adequately address the issue of consumer financial privacy.\n  Fortunately, this conference report is leaps and bounds better than \nthe bill that passed along party lines here in the Senate several \nmonths ago. It won't allow financial institutions to participate in the \nnew and improved financial market unless they maintain a good community \nlending record. And, while far from perfect, it also begins to address \nthe issue of consumer financial privacy, which was virtually non-\nexistent in the previous bill.\n  This bill requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy \nand information sharing policies to their customers. And in some \ninstances--but not enough--it allows consumers to block these companies \nfrom sharing their private customer information with other companies. \nThis is an improvement over the original Senate bill, and even an \nimprovement over current law.\n  This is a good start on financial privacy, but it doesn't close the \ndeal. The privacy provisions in the conference report do not provide \nthe level of protection that the American people deserve.\n  There is a long way to go with respect to protecting the financial \nprivacy of all Americans. While I am disappointed that the privacy \nprotections in the bill are not as strong as I would like, I share the \nbeliefs of several of my distinguished colleagues, such as Senator \nSarbanes and Senator Leahy, that these protections can be and must be \nfurther strengthened by legislation next year, and I intend to work \nclosely with my colleagues to make sure this happens.\n  On balance, the conference report should be adopted, and I hope that \nthe same forces that worked so hard to move legislative mountains and \nalign political stars to make this legislation possible will work \nequally as hard with me and other Senators next year to give Americans \nthe privacy protection they demand and deserve.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. The Financial \nServices Modernization Act of 1999 is landmark legislation that \nprovides for a historic modernization of our financial services system. \nThis legislation is the culmination of years of effort on the part of \nseveral Congresses, several administrations, and federal financial \nregulators. Passing this legislation will eliminate inefficiencies and \nunnecessary barriers in our economy that were created by the Glass-\nSteagall Act of 1933 and other laws passed generations ago.\n  With this legislation, the Congress recognizes the significant \ntransformations taking place in our economy and its financial services \nsector. Through this Act, Congress makes the necessary and critical \nleaps for our financial services sector to catch up with the realities \nof a marketplace and economy driven by an information technology \nrevolution. The changes created through this legislation are \ninevitable. They overhaul laws implemented decades ago that have not \nwithstood the test of time and that have increasingly been bypassed \nthrough more and more regulatory loopholes. Passing the Financial \nServices Modernization Act of 1999 will create a rational financial \nstructure in the U.S., the world's largest economy, that will be \ncompetitive in the global economy. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  By updating laws separating banks, securities firms, and insurance \ncompanies, this Act will result in a broader array of financial \nservices and products for consumers. It will spur innovation in the \nfinancial services industry and create a more competitive marketplace \nwhere powerful new products come to market more quickly and at a lower \ncost to consumers. It will lead to the creation of an array of new \nproducts for consumers and at the same time will help them to make \ntheir choices more intelligently and efficiently by allowing for one-\nstop shopping for a multitude of financial services.\n  Specifically, by overriding sections of the Glass-Steagall Act and \nother federal and state laws, this legislation will allow banks, \ninsurance companies, and security firms to more easily merge or \notherwise enter one another's businesses.\n  While allowing the industry greater flexibility to provide services, \nthis legislation also protects consumer privacy by requiring financial \ninstitutions to create privacy policies and spell them out to \nconsumers. Financial institutions will have to provide notice of how \nthey share the financial information of their customers and with \ncertain exceptions they would be prohibited from disclosing personally \nidentifiable financial information to non-affiliated third parties \nwithout first giving consumers the opportunity to ``opt out''. The \nlegislation gives regulatory agencies the authority to enforce those \nprivacy protections.\n  Importantly, this legislation also retains key parts of the 1977 \nCommunity Reinvestment Act. Any financial services company that is out \nof compliance\n\n[[Page S13908]]\n\nwith that Act would not be allowed to take advantage of mergers and \nother benefits outlined under this legislation. It is right that the \nAdministration and others held fast to keeping a strong CRA component \nin this legislation. The CRA has been critically important to many \ncommunities and community-based organizations in Connecticut and across \nthe country. The CRA, like the Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) \nthat I strongly support, helps more Americans to actively participate \nin our economy by providing them the ability to build assets and to \naccess financial services.\n  This legislation is not perfect. Its implementation will need to be \nmonitored over time. I will be paying particular attention to how this \nlegislation affects both consumer privacy and CRA implementation. \nHowever, this legislation is good and long overdue. It provides \nbalanced and strong protections for consumers and communities without \ndiluting its intended financial services benefits.\n  Finally, I would like to thank those who have worked so tirelessly to \ndo what so many others have tried and failed to do for the last 20 \nyears. Through the hard work of the Senate Banking Committee members, \nincluding Senator Dodd of Connecticut and Chairman Gramm, their House \ncounterparts, in conjunction with the Administration, particularly \nSecretary Summers and his staff, the financial services industry, and \nthose representing the interests of consumers and communities, we now \nhave legislation with compromise language that achieves a broad public \npurpose. We are now able to achieve the improvements to our financial \nservices sector that have been needed for decades and that will \neffectively bring us into the next century.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Financial \nModernization Bill. After decades of unsuccessful tries, it appears \nthat financial modernization legislation may finally become a reality. \nAs we move into the next millennium, I believe it is important that the \nfinancial service structure in this country is up to par with the rest \nof the world so that American finance can continue to lead \ninternationally.\n  The thing that impresses me the most about this bill, Mr. President, \nis not the way it will strengthen American financial markets and allow \nthis important sector of our economy to grow with the technology of the \nage. It's not even that we will close the Unitary Thrift Loophole, or \nthat we will maintain the Community Reinvestment Act to ensure that low \nincome and minority communities in my home state of Arkansas will \ncontinue to have access to the capital needed to create jobs and \nincrease incomes. What impresses me most, Mr. President, is the way we \nare going about passing it. When I vote for this bill later today, I \nfeel like I will have weighed all the issues and had the opportunity to \nactually work to make it better for the people of my state. We \ndeliberated, discussed, and fought over the merits of the legislation--\nnot just parliamentary tactics. This bill was scrutinized by Senator \nSarbanes and Senator Gramm and all of my colleagues on the Senate \nBanking Committee before it ever got to the floor. Before it was even \nput on the calendar, it was subject to the judgement and the intellect \nof these men, whose esteem I hold in the highest regard.\n  After this bill came out of committee and to the floor, we were able \nto offer and vote on amendments to adjust and strengthen the bill. I \nsupported some amendments that passed, and I supported some that \nfailed, but what is important is that my votes and the votes of my \ncolleagues were registered and the conferees were able to gauge the \nSenate's support for these provisions. This allowed for compromise, Mr. \nPresident, and at the end of the day it allowed for a bill that a \nmajority of the Senate can and, I predict, will support.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over the \nlack of adequate privacy protections in the financial modernization \nbill under consideration. While I feel that the current laws governing \nour financial services industry are out-of-date and in need of \nmodernization, I do have strong concerns over the inadequate and weak \nprivacy provisions included in this bill.\n  Paramount to our freedom is the right to privacy; to be left alone \nand to be secure in the belief that our business is just that, ours and \nno one else's. When we do share our personal business information with \nothers it is with the real and reasonable expectation that it remains \nour property. When dealing with our doctor or lawyer we know that the \ncommunication is privileged. Traditionally, when providing information \nto our banker or insurance agent or our stockbroker, we similarly \nbelieved that the information provided was specific to that \ntransaction.\n  We choose to compromise our privacy to the extent necessary to \nconduct business and with the belief that the information is ours and \ndoes not become the property of the person with whom we are dealing. No \none has the right and no one should have the right to market our \npersonal information without our prior approval. To do so violates our \nprivacy and compromises the trust relationship that is vital to \ncommerce.\n  Regrettably, we now know that those we trusted with one of our most \nprized possessions, our privacy, have violated that trust in the \ninterests of profit. In the course of deliberations of this bill, we \nhave heard that the sharing of information is essential to efficiency \nin the market place and to better provide customer benefits and \nservices. However, the fact remains that these benefits come at the \nexpense of personal privacy and that creates an atmosphere of distrust \nand invites abuse by the very people we must trust to conduct our \nbusiness. Technology must be tempered with caution. Efficiency cannot \nbe at the expense of personal privacy. Institutions should not have the \nlicense to exploit our information unless they allow us to opt out. \nIndividuals should have the right to allow institutions to share their \ninformation by opting in. Customers should be given sufficient notice \nand choice to deny financial institutions from sharing or selling their \nnonpublic, personally identifiable, sensitive financial information. \nAmericans must have the ability to say ``no.''\n  This bill remembers the big financial institutions in this country, \nhowever, seems to forget the most important variable in the equation--\nthe individual. This bill protects banks' rights, but fails to consider \nan individual's rights to privacy. We need to establish rules to \nprotect the privacy of a customer's confidential information. No longer \nshould we rely upon or expect the financial institutions themselves to \ndo this, as they are the very ones profiting from the sale of customer \ninformation. We must find a balanced system that protects consumers.\n  I assure my colleagues that we will very soon be revisiting this \nissue and that these deliberations will be prompted by constituents \nabused as a result of the loopholes contained in this bill. Bottom \nline, financial institutions should not be allowed to share and sell \nconfidential, personal customer information without consent. Americans \nneed provisions which truly protect their privacy. Americans deserve \nthis right, no less.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I raise today in support of passage of the \nConference Report to accompany S. 900, the Financial Services \nModernization Act of 1999.\n  During my first term in the Senate, I served as a member of the \nSenate Banking Committee. It was a busy time for the Committee: we \npassed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, permitted for the first time \ninterest bearing checking accounts, and agreed to the Community \nReinvestment Act. During those years, the Committee also undertook the \ndifficult tasks of restructuring the finances for New York City and \nChrysler Corporation. I am proud of the work we did on the Committee \nwith these initiatives, and we made sure that the American taxpayers \ndid not have to foot the bill for the restructuring of the debt.\n  I am pleased that after all these years, we are on the verge of \npassing comprehensive reform that has bipartisan and Administration \nsupport. This bill will finally break down inefficient barriers between \ninsurance, banking, and securities and allow United States financial \nservices corporations to compete on an even basis with their European \nand Asian counterparts.\n  Over the years, through regulation, court cases, and the development \nof\n\n[[Page S13909]]\n\nnew financial products, the line separating banking, insurance, and \nsecurities has been blurred. In recent years, banks have been selling \ninsurance and mutual funds; brokerage firms have been offering \ncustomers money market accounts with check writing privileges. The \nmarket was dictating that the laws needed to be rewritten. I have \nalways believed that the laws should be written by Congress, not \nbureaucrats. It has taken time to fine tune these changes and reach \nthis bipartisan consensus; but Congress has finally met this challenge.\n  Mr. President, over the course of the last five years, a lot of work \nand hundreds of hours have gone into perfecting this monumental \nlegislation. I want to commend the Members of the Conference Committee, \nrepresentatives from the Administration and the Federal Reserve, and \nthe financial community for crafting a consensus piece of legislation. \nIt will open competition, while establishing proper safeguards to \nprotect consumer privacy and maintaining safety and soundness standards \nfor federally insured financial institutions.\n  In a free market society, competition lowers prices and raises the \nlevel of customer service. I believe consumers will benefit from this \nlandmark bill by giving them the choice of products and services \noffered by more market participants. I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to speak in support of the passage of this long overdue \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference agreement before the Senate today. There are few bills \nCongress has completed in my time here which will have a more profound \nimpact on our economy than this legislation to modernize and harmonize \nthe various segments of our financial services industry.\n  I think this historic legislation will result in lower costs of \nfinancial services for American consumers, and enhance the \ncompetitiveness of United States companies in the global financial \nmarketplace.\n  At the outset, I want to congratulate Chairman Gramm and the members \nof the Senate Banking Committee for all of their hard work on this \nissue. As Chairman Gramm knows, it has been no easy task to get the \nbanking, securities and insurance industries, as well as the \nAdministration, the regulators and community groups to agree on what \nshape this law should take. It is a testament to Senator Gramm's \ntenacity that he was able finally to hammer out this agreement.\n  As we move into the 21st century, the United States continues to \nmaintain capital markets which are the envy of the world. Bank \nconsolidations and rapid expansion of new global markets have meant \nphenomenal growth in our financial services sector in recent years. The \nwave of bank mergers in the late 1990's has led to a situation where \nthe assets held by the five largest banks in the United States now \ntotal $2.1 trillion. Five years ago, the top five only had $753 billion \nin assets.\n  In 1998, for the first time in many years, a U.S. bank is one of the \ntop 10 largest in the world based on assets. From 1997 to 1998, U.S. \nbanks in the top 100 in the world saw their assets grow by 23 percent, \ntheir capital base grow by 48 percent and their revenues increase by 36 \npercent. The United States has 8 of the top 10 securities firms in the \nworld and 4 of the top 20 insurance companies.\n  With all of this financial strength consolidated in the United \nStates, some may wonder why we need this historic new law. With the \nadvent of the European Monetary Union, the combined gross domestic \nproduct of the nations in the Union is already equal to that of the \nUnited States. When the U.K. joins the Union, the combined GDP will be \n10 percent greater than the GDP of the United States. United States \nfirms need to be more flexible, more efficient, and able to offer more \nproducts if they are to compete successfully in these new markets.\n  Currently, European laws are much more flexible, allowing financial \nservices firms across the Atlantic to be better integrated than United \nStates firms. Our laws need to keep pace. This conference report will \nallow our various banking, insurance and securities firms to combine \nthrough financial holding companies so that they may be even stronger \ncompetitors in the increasingly international financial services \nmarketplace.\n  This enhanced efficiency is not only good for the United States' \ncompetitiveness in the international market, it is good for consumers. \nThe Treasury Department estimates that every 1 percentage point decline \nin the cost of financial intermediation could save U.S. consumers $3.5 \nbillion a year.\n  This new law will allow consumers to enjoy cheaper access to capital \nand one-stop shopping at financial services superstores. Americans who \nwant to borrow to buy a new car or a home, purchase insurance to \nprotect that car or home, or invest in securities for the future, will \nfor the first time under this new law be able to do all of that at one \ntime, in one place and at a lower cost.\n  I want to commend the chairman and conferees for the way in which \nthey have resolved two major issues which concerned me when we debated \nthis bill in the Senate. Those issues are whether the Federal Reserve \nor Treasury Department should be the primary regulator of the new \nfinancial holding companies, and what to do about abuses of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act of CRA.\n  First, I have great respect for Treasury Secretary Summers and his \npredecessor, Robert Rubin. They are two of the finest economic \nand financial minds in the world. But I simply believe that it is more \nappropriate for the Federal Reserve, a nonpolitical entity also headed \nby a pretty good economic and financial mind in Alan Greenspan, to \nserve as the primary regulator in this new age. Regulation of our \nfinancial system should not be subject to the ups and downs of the \npolitical process, as would be the case if a political appointee, in \nthis case the Secretary of the Treasury, had control.\n\n  I believe that this bill makes the proper policy decision by \ndesignating the Federal Reserve as the umbrella regulator of financial \nholding companies. The bill provides a mechanism for coordination \nbetween the Fed and the Treasury in approving new financial activities \nfor financial holding company subsidiaries. The Treasury Department, \nthrough the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will maintain its \nfunctional regulatory authority over the banking activities of \naffiliates and subsidiaries of national banks. This is a good \ncompromise and I salute the chairman for his work.\n  Second, I commend the chairman for his diligence in attempting to \naddress the abusers related to the CRA. This bill does not go as far as \nI know the chairman would like, but it is a good start. And for those \nconcerned community groups out there who have not abused the CRA, let \nthere be no confusion: when this law is signed by the President, there \nwill still be a CRA and there will still be robust community lending \nacross the United States. In fact, the law itself states that nothing \nin the conference agreement repeals any existing provision of the CRA.\n  What the bill does is provide regulatory relief to small banks which \ndemonstrate that they have achieved at least a satisfactory CRA rating \nin their most recent audit. This will reduce the burdens related to CRA \nexams for 82 percent of all banks. And for the larger institutions in \ncities like Albuquerque, the CRA will continue to apply in the same \nmanner as it does today. That is an eminently reasonable approach.\n  Finally, the bill allows a little sunlight to be shed on all CRA \nagreements between banks and community groups. Over the next ten years, \nbanks have promised $350 billion in loans and payments to community \ngroups under the CRA. This law will require full public disclosure of \nthose agreements, and an annual accounting of how the money and other \nresources promised in the agreement were utilized. The public has a \nright to examine the costs and benefits associated with CRA agreements, \nand this will provide that public accountability.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend all of those who have worked so hard \nto finally get Congress to the point where this bill can become law. I \nam happy to support this bill, and look forward to the President \nsigning it into law.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we have been debating the subject of \nbanking in the Senate since the 18th century. We began to ask ourselves \na question, could we have a national bank,\n\n[[Page S13910]]\n\nwhich Mr. Hamilton, of New York, thought we could do and should do. We \ncreated one. It had a very brief tenure. It went out of existence just \nin time that the Federal Government had no financial resources for the \nWar of 1812. So it was reinstituted, in 1816 for 20 years, and went out \nof existence just in time for the panic of 1837. We went through \ngreenbacks. There must have been a wampum period. We went to gold \ncoinage. Then a free coinage of silver dominated our politics for \nalmost two decades, as farmers sought liquidity and availability of \ncredit. Finally, at the end of the century of exhaustive debate, we \nmore or less gave up and adopted what we now call the Federal Reserve \nSystem.\n  To say we debated this matter for a century is certainly true. For \nthe last quarter century, we have turned our focus to the nonbank bank. \nYou are really reaching for obscurity when you define an issue as we \nhave done, and yet that seems to be the term with which we have to \ndeal.\n  The issue of the nonbank banks, were banks will be allowed to expand \ninto newly authorized businesses such as securities and insurance \nunderwriting, could finally be resolved in the Senate today. As we \nconsider the conference report on financial modernization and prepare \nto pass the most significant piece of banking legislation since the \n1933 Glass-Steagall Act, I would like to make two points, followed by a \ncoda. The first being that we need financial modernization, that \nDepression-era banking laws need to be repealed. A May 4, 1999, \nWashington Post editorial reads:\n\n       Since the Depression, Federal law has sought to keep \n     banking, insurance and securities industries separate. The \n     idea, in part, was to make sure that Federally insured bank \n     deposits didn't wind up somewhere risky and unregulated. But \n     in recent years, even without a change in the law, that \n     separation has eroded. Banks have found ways to offer mutual \n     funds to their customers; investment firms function like \n     deposit institutions; etc. It makes sense now to bring \n     legislation--and regulation--in line with reality.\n\n  It strikes me as odd that most corporations are free to engage in any \nlawful business. Banks, by contrast, are limited to the business of \nbanking. It is generally agreed that the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and \nthe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 need to be amended. Banks, \nsecurity firms, and insurance companies should be allowed to offer each \nother's services. They already do by finding loopholes in the law. \nCongress must catch up, and pass a law that condones this activity. \nLondon does it. Tokyo too. Why not New York, which, if I may say, is \none of the world's banking capitals?\n  This is a real problem for existing banks, who find themselves under \nthe serious constraints of Depression-era banking laws. Suddenly, they \nfind that their activities are encroached upon and they are not able to \ndo things that they ought to do--that they are going to need to do--in \norder to survive in a competitive world economy.\n  With this bill, we have the opportunity to modernize our financial \ninstitutions and allow banks to do the things they ought to do, that \nthey are going to need to do, to survive and grow. We must seize this \nopportunity, pass this bill, and give our banks the opportunity to \ncompete in the world economy.\n  Now to the second point. When this bill came up for a vote last May, \nI could not support it because the provisions concerning the Community \nReinvestment Act were unacceptable. The CRA, enacted in 1977, has \nplayed a critical role in revitalizing low-and-medium-income \ncommunities. New York has benefitted from this. A March 17, 1999 New \nYork Times editorial states:\n\n       In New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, the money has \n     turned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and \n     a new middle class. The banks earn less on community-based \n     loans than on corporate business. But the most civic-minded \n     banks have accepted this reduced revenue as a cost of doing \n     business--and as a reasonable sacrifice for keeping the \n     surrounding communities strong.\n\n  I am told that an acceptable--albeit not perfect--compromise has been \nworked out on this matter. With this agreement in hand, I can now \nsupport the bill. However, I urge the regulators to keep a close eye on \nthe CRA provision and make sure that banks make loans where they are \nrequired to and keep investing in those communities that need it most.\n  I conclude on the question of privacy. No small matter. Consumers, \nrightly so, are concerned that their personal information will be \nshared among the newly affiliated companies. The bill places no \nrestrictions on the kinds of detailed personal information--such as \ncustomer bank balances, credit card account numbers, income and \ninvestments, insurance records, purchases made by check or credit \ncard--that can be swapped among them. A November 3, 1999, Times \neditorial addresses this matter:\n\n       In an electronic world where businesses can effortlessly \n     collect, compile, and mine personal data for marketing and \n     other purposes, consumers should have the right to control \n     the spread of their financial information. Under current \n     Federal law, consumers have almost no rights in this area. \n     The bill adds some limited protections, but it does not go \n     far enough, particularly since conglomeration will greatly \n     accelerate the sharing of private information in the \n     financial sector.\n\n  As we move ahead with this bill and make substantial changes to the \nbanking laws, we must make sure that privacy laws keep pace. this is \nmuch too important of an issue to be overlooked.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Times March 17th and November 3rd \neditorials, and the Post March 4th editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 17, 1999]\n\n                        Mischief From Mr. Gramm\n\n       Cities that were in drastic decline 20 years ago are \n     experiencing rebirth, thanks to new homeowners who are \n     transforming neighborhoods of transients into places where \n     families have a stake in what happens. The renaissance is due \n     in part to the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, which \n     requires banks to reinvest actively in depressed and minority \n     areas that were historically written off. Senator Phil Gramm \n     of Texas now wants to weaken the reinvestment Act, \n     encouraging a return to the bad old days, when banks took \n     everyone's deposits but lent them only to the affluent. \n     Sensible members of Congress need to keep the measure intact.\n       The act was passed in 1977. Until then, prospective home or \n     business owners in many communities had little chance of \n     landing loans even from banks where they keep money on \n     deposit. But according to the National Community reinvestment \n     coalition, banks have committed more than $1 trillion to once \n     neglected neighborhoods since the act was passed, the vast \n     majority of it in the last six years.\n       In New York City's south Bronx neighborhood, the money has \n     turned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and \n     a new middle class. The banks earn less on community-based \n     loans than on corporate business. But the most civic-minded \n     banks have accepted this reduced revenue as a cost of doing \n     business--and as a reasonably sacrifice for keeping the \n     surrounding communities strong.\n       Federal bank examiners can block mergers or expansions for \n     banks that fail to achieve a satisfactory Community \n     Reinvestment Act rating. The Senate proposal that Mr. Gramm \n     supports would exempt banks with assets of less than $100 \n     million from their obligations under the act. That would \n     include 65 percent of all banks. The Senate bill would also \n     dramatically curtail the community's right to expose what it \n     considers unfair practices. Without Federal pressure, \n     however, the amount of money flowing to poorer neighborhoods \n     would drop substantially, undermining the urban recovery.\n       Mr. Gramm argues that community groups are ``extorting'' \n     money from banks in return for approval, and describes the \n     required paperwork as odious. But community organizations \n     that build affordable housing in Mr. Gramm's home state \n     heartily disagree. Mayor Ron Kirk of Dallas disagrees as \n     well, and told the Dallas Morning News that he welcomed the \n     opportunity to explain to Mr. Gramm that ``there is no \n     downside to investing in all parts of our community.''\n       In a perfect world, lending practices would be fair and the \n     reinvestment Act would be unnecessary. But without Federal \n     pressure the country would return to the era of redlining, \n     when communities cut off from capital withered and died.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 3, 1999]\n\n                     Privacy in Financial Dealings\n\n       The financial services bill that will overhaul the nation's \n     banking laws is a good deal for financial institutions but a \n     bad deal for consumer privacy. The bill would allow banks, \n     brokerage houses and insurance companies to merge into \n     financial conglomerates, a long-overdue reform. The banking \n     industry stands to gain from the right to expand into other \n     businesses, and consumers could benefit from the case of one-\n     stop shopping and the creation of new financial services. But \n     protecting consumers' financial privacy should also be \n     central to financial modernization. This bill is weak on that \n     score.\n       In an electronic world where businesses can effortlessly \n     collect, compile and mine personal data for marketing and \n     other purposes, consumers should have the right to control \n     the spread of their financial information. Under current \n     federal law, consumers\n\n[[Page S13911]]\n\n     have almost no rights in this area. The bill adds some \n     limited protection, but it does not go far enough, \n     particularly since conglomeration will greatly accelerate the \n     sharing of private information to the financial sector.\n       The bill would require that a financial institution provide \n     customers with general notice about its privacy and \n     disclosure policy. But the institution would remain free to \n     share a customer's personal information with affiliates of \n     the company and with unaffiliated companies that sign \n     marketing agreements, without the customer's consent and \n     without giving the customer the right to object to having \n     that information transferred.\n       The bill places no restrictions on the kind of detailed \n     personal information--such as customer bank balances, credit \n     card account numbers,income and investments, insurance \n     records, purchases made by check or credit card--that can be \n     swapped among affiliated companies. New regulations proposed \n     by the Clinton administration on medical privacy would \n     prohibit a health insurance company from disclosing medical \n     records to a bank. But nothing in this bill would stop a bank \n     or life insurance company, for example, from sharing equally \n     personal information about customers.\n       The bill allows consumers to ``opt out'' of disclosure of \n     private information to unaffiliated companies. But that \n     provision contains a big loophole. It would not apply if a \n     financial institution enters into a joint agreement with an \n     unrelated financial institution to market products or \n     services. That means even corporate entities that have no \n     business relationship with a customer could get private \n     information without the customer's consent.\n       Privacy advocates have argued that financial institutions \n     should be required to get a customer's consent before they \n     transfer or sell personal information. But the banking lobby \n     contends that getting affirmative authorization is too \n     costly. At the very least, consumers who want to keep their \n     records private should be allowed to opt out of having that \n     information disclosed to others.\n       President Clinton has supported a strong opt-out provision, \n     but in final negotiations in Congress the administration \n     acceded to the loopholes that narrow the opportunities to opt \n     out. Most consumers do not want their banks to share or sell \n     personal information to other businesses, whether under one \n     corporate umbrella or not. Their concerns about privacy will \n     only grow as the new conglomerates begin to cross-market \n     their products. If President Clinton signs the bill, as \n     expected, he must push for separate privacy legislation that \n     actually gives consumers the right to personal data.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 1998]\n\n                           Banking on Reform\n\n       The Senate today is scheduled to begin considering a bill \n     that would remake the financial services industry, allowing \n     banks and insurance companies and investment banks and \n     insurance companies and investment firms to merge and \n     compete. Similar legislation is making its way through the \n     House. The thrust of both bills is sound. But while the \n     industries have lobbied hard to shape a law satisfactory to \n     them, the current legislation doesn't adequately protect low-\n     income communities or consumers' privacy. Financial \n     modernization should apply to them, too.\n       Since the Depression, federal law has sought to keep the \n     banking, insurance and securities industries separate. The \n     idea, in part, was to make sure that federally insured bank \n     deposits didn't wind up somewhere risky and unregulated. But \n     in recent years, even without a change in the law, that \n     separation has eroded. Banks have found ways to offer mutual \n     funds to their customers; investment firms function like \n     deposit institutions; etc. It makes sense now to bring \n     legislation--and regulation--in line with reality.\n       Congress has been trying to do so, and failing, for more \n     than a decade, and may again. But on the major issues, the \n     administration, the Federal Reserve and Congress have pretty \n     well agreed. They would let the financial services industries \n     meld while for the most part keeping them out of other \n     businesses, a wise decision. They've come up with fire walls \n     and regulatory schemes that, while still not entirely agreed \n     upon, have satisfied most concerns about protecting federally \n     insured deposits.\n       But there is no consensus yet on safeguarding the interests \n     of underserved communities. Since 1977 federally insured \n     banks have been subject to the Community Reinvestment Act, \n     requiring them to seek business opportunities in poor areas \n     as well as middle-class and wealthy neighborhoods. The law, a \n     response originally to clear evidence of bias in lending, has \n     worked well. It doesn't force banks to make unprofitable \n     loans, but it encourages them to look beyond traditional \n     customers, and it's had a beneficial effect on home ownership \n     and small-business lending.\n       Sen. Phil Gramm, chairman of the Banking Committee, now \n     wants to scale the law way back. He argues that community \n     groups use it to extort money from banks; there's scant \n     evidence for that. The real danger is that, with financial \n     modernization, banks will gradually escape their community \n     obligations by transferring capital to affiliates that aren't \n     covered by the law. The law should be extended and modernized \n     to keep pace with a changing industry.\n       Consumer privacy also could be in danger as barriers among \n     industries break down. An example: Should your life insurance \n     medical records be shipped over, without your knowledge, to \n     the loan officer considering your mortgage application? Sen. \n     Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and Rep. Ed Markey of \n     Massachusetts, among others, would give consumers more \n     control over the sale and sharing of personal data. As the \n     financial industry moves into a new era, privacy laws should \n     also keep pace.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support in favor of the \nFinancial Services Modernization Act. I do so because of my heartfelt \nconviction that it will be good for the American economy, it will be \ngood for the financial services sector of the economy, and it will also \nbe good for consumers and the American people for many years to come.\n  I will begin by expressing my gratitude and respect for the leaders \nwho have brought us here today after so many years. Senator Gramm has \nperformed admirably in getting this accomplished after so many years in \nthe past it has failed. I salute him and commend him for his efforts.\n  Quite frankly, there were some questions about the new chairman when \nhe assumed this position: Would he be willing to make reasonable \ncompromises necessary to get the bill passed? Would he take a broader \nview or be the captive of narrow parochial interests? Would he be \nflexible? All these questions, I am proud to say, have been answered in \nthe affirmative.\n  I wish to salute my colleague, Senator Gramm, for this historic \naccomplishment. Without his leadership, we would not be here today. It \nis a masterful bit of work. And I am proud of his accomplishment in \nthis regard.\n  I also wish to salute my colleague, Senator Sarbanes. Also, we would \nnot be here today without his leadership. He has proven to be a \ntireless advocate and effective spokesperson for those who are less \nfortunate. He has proven to be a tireless worker in favor of the rights \nof privacy of America's consumers. We would not have a bill before the \nSenate today that could pass this body, that the President would sign, \nor, frankly, one that enjoyed wide support were it not for the tireless \nefforts of Senator Sarbanes. I compliment him as well. He has been a \ncopartner in this historic accomplishment which we recognize today.\n  This legislation is good for the American economy. The era of global \ncompetitiveness in the financial services sector is unquestionably an \narea in which our Nation is preeminent. The world looks to the United \nStates to lead the way in areas such as banking, insurance, securities, \nand investment banking.\n  Financial services contribute annually to a trade surplus for the \nUnited States of America at a time when our trade deficit is running \ninto the hundreds of billions of dollars. But we cannot take our \ncurrent preeminence for granted. I have had some experience in this \nregard.\n  My colleagues may not know that Indiana was one of the very last \nStates to adopt not interstate banking but across-State-line banking in \nthe mid-1980s. As a result of the fact we didn't modernize our laws, \nonce the walls came tumbling down, as they inevitably do, almost all of \nIndiana's financial institutions in the banking sector were gobbled up \nby institutions from other States.\n  If we were similarly to hamstring America's financial institutions--\nbanking, insurance, and securities--with antiquated laws that kept them \nfrom having the flexibility needed to compete with our foreign \ncompetitors, the day might not be too far removed when those from \nGermany, Japan, Switzerland, and other nations would be gobbling up our \nfinancial institutions because they were too weak or incapable of \ncompeting. We shouldn't let that happen to our country.\n\n  Hundreds of thousands of jobs across our country and tens of \nthousands of jobs in Indiana depend upon us getting this done. I am \nproud to say that we\n\n[[Page S13912]]\n\nwill. It is good for America's economy. It is also good for the broader \neconomy.\n  Manufacturing, agriculture, and other sectors depend upon access to a \nvital growing financial services sector. Access to capital is one of \nthe key ingredients for financial success today. Because of this bill, \ngreater efficiency in providing funds for expansion will exist, leading \nto greater investment, greater productivity, and a rising standard of \nliving for America's working men and women. Access to capital is one of \nthe key ingredients to success in the economy today. This legislation \nwill ensure that the funds keep flowing from America's economy, making \nit more productive and more efficient for American workers and American \nshareholders alike.\n  This legislation is good for consumers. Not only will it be \nconvenient, providing one-stop shopping for working men and women \nacross our country, where they go to a single place and meet their \nbanking needs, insurance needs, security investment needs, and others, \nbut it will also lead to greater efficiency, lower interest rates, and \ngreater access to credit. It will also lead to greater innovation in \nthe new marketplace with greater competition.\n  I foresee a day not too far removed when services that we can barely \nimagine today will be provided more conveniently and efficiently to \nAmericans across our country.\n  Frankly, I approach this bill with some reservations as well. Some \nissues needed to be resolved or I would not be standing here today to \nexpress my strong support for this legislation. Foremost among these \nwas the Community Reinvestment Act, an act that is necessary to \nguaranteeing access to capital for Americans of every walk of life, \nregardless of race, creed, or color.\n  As I said when I previously took the floor to speak on this issue, \naccess to capital today is as important as access to electricity was in \nthe 1930s or access to a telephone was in the 1950s or 1960s. I \nrecognize that issue has been positively resolved in the course of our \nnegotiations.\n  Second, the emerging issue of privacy is very important. I share the \nconcerns of many Americans about what will happen to their most \nsensitive information in the new global marketplace.\n  I am pleased to say that we have taken the first steps in this \nlegislation to guarantee greater privacy for American consumers by \nrequiring clear and plain disclosure about what information will be \nused within a company, and also allowing American consumers the right \nto opt out and prohibit companies that they do business with from \nsharing their financial information with third parties.\n  This is an issue we have only begun to recognize. We must continue to \nfollow it in the days to come. If it should be the case that greater \nprotections are necessary, I will be one of those who will help to lead \nthe way and look forward to leading the way to ensuring that. For the \ntime being, I am pleased with the provisions currently in the bill and \nam proud to say we are taking a significant step forward.\n  In conclusion, for 20 years, we have been laboring to modernize the \nlaw that governs financial services that was first enacted in the \n1930s. A long string of people who have preceded us in this body have \nattempted this and have not been successful. But thanks to the \nleadership of Senator Gramm and the leadership of Senator Sarbanes, the \nability of all involved to come together and compromise for the well \nbeing of the American economy, the American consumer, and the future of \nour country, today we celebrate the historic accomplishment.\n\n  I intend to vote for this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Again, I congratulate all who have brought us to this important \naccomplishment.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes and I have decided, giving \npeople an opportunity to get here, that I will speak, and then Senator \nSarbanes will speak. Then I will close out.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am very happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Both sides have tried very hard to canvas their members \nto see if anyone wishes to speak on this bill. At the moment, we have \nreached the point where we don't think there is anyone left to speak. \nThe time for voting has been set for reasons of people having been \ndrawn to other responsibilities. But if there is someone out there who \nwants a few minutes to speak on this legislation, now is the time. \nOtherwise, it is going to be closed out. We have tried very hard to \noffer all Members an opportunity to speak, if they wish to do so, on \nthis conference report.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me agree with my ranking member to say \nthat we have waited 40 years for this bill. We are not waiting any \nlonger than 3:30. If someone wants to get over here and speak, they had \nbetter do it. It is always a little bit risky to try to sum up on a \nbill such as this that has been in the making for 40 years, a bill that \noverturns a piece of legislation that Franklin Roosevelt said was the \nmost important bill ever passed by an American Congress.\n\n  Having listened to the debate, I have a few points in conclusion. \nFirst, there is often such a difference between reality and perception. \nI listened to some of my colleagues, especially those who oppose the \nbill, talk about special interests and what this special interest or \nthat special interest got in this bill. In my period of service in \nCongress, I have never participated in the writing of a bill with less \nspecial interests involved than this bill. When Republicans on the \ncommittee started in January a series of meetings to talk about why we \nwanted to modernize the financial laws of the country, why we wanted to \nrepeal Glass-Steagall, why we wanted to restructure the economy in \nterms of benefit, we set out a theory of financial services \nmodernization and we set out a plan to try to achieve it.\n  As I listened to all the talk about special interests, I remember \nTexas bankers and Texas insurance agents both sending a letter which \narrived on the same day telling my constituents I had betrayed their \nparticular interests to the other. The insurance agents sent out a \nletter saying I had sold out to the bankers; the bankers sent out a \nletter saying I had sold out to the insurance agents.\n  The bottom line is nobody was sold out in this bill. We started a \nnegotiation to try to deal with a legitimate concern. The concern was \nthis: If someone is going to a bank for a loan, should that bank, while \nthey are in the process of making that loan, have the right to try to \nsell an individual insurance? We tried to sit down with everybody \nknowledgeable and come up with a real solution. In the end, I am happy \nto say, both of these interest groups concluded nobody had sold their \ninterests out and we had put together a good bill.\n  However, there is a simple test on this bill. If anybody wants to set \na marker today to determine whether in 20, 40, or 60 years from now we \nare going to compare this bill to Glass-Steagall, whether this bill is \na success, there is a simple test. That test is, Will this bill \ngenerate more diverse products for the American consumer? Will those \nproducts better meet the needs of the American consumer? And will they \nbe cheaper? If those things don't happen, this bill fails.\n  That is what this bill is about. There is nothing in this bill that \nsets out to benefit big banks in New York. I don't represent New York. \nI don't have any huge banks in my State. Long ago, other people bought \nout the big banks in my State. I have sought in this bill, and I \nbelieve the vast majority of all of our Members, have sought to promote \nthe interests of the consumer.\n  This bill is about people who go to work every day and who borrow \nmoney on their homes. If someone can improve on their mortgage rate and \nbring down the interest they pay by even one-quarter of 1 percent, that \nmeans thousands of dollars in their pockets over a 30-year period. That \nis what this bill is about. This bill is about people who want checking \naccounts and who want services, and they want those services provided \non a competitive basis where they are as cheap as can be produced and \nsold. That is what this bill is about.\n  This bill is about people who want the ability to do their banking, \ntheir insurance, their securities, their retirement on a competitive \nbasis. It is about bringing together those forces.\n\n[[Page S13913]]\n\n  We have been living with a system that was established during the \nGreat Depression. I don't think there is any reason now to go back and \nrehash why it happened. But one can make a strong case that the \nDepression was produced by a failure of the Federal Reserve. Milton \nFriedman made that case in the ``Monetary History of the United \nStates'' and won the Nobel prize principally for that work.\n  Congress was frightened. They didn't know what to do. It was an age \nof demagoguery. Probably the most demagogic statement that has ever \nbeen made in American history was made by the President of the United \nStates, Franklin Roosevelt, when during the debate on Glass-Steagall he \nsaid:\n\n       The money changers have fled from the high seats in the \n     temple of our civilization.\n\n  That statement is reminiscent of statements being made in Central \nEurope at the same time.\n  Congress didn't know what caused the Depression. They were \nfrightened. They didn't know what to do so they passed a bill that I \nthink one can argue historically was as punitive as it was \nprescriptive. It was aimed at one man, in some ways--J.P. Morgan--\nprobably the greatest American of the early 20th century. We don't know \na lot about him because he never held public office, but he was \nprobably the greatest American of the early part of this century.\n  In this era, we had a bill passed that basically forced an artificial \nseparation of the financial sector of our economy. That bill, despite \nthe fact its author within a year had concluded it was a mistake, has \nbeen the law of the land. In fact, Time magazine calls it the defining \nfinancial legislation of the 20th century.\n  We came here today to change the defining legislation of the 20th \ncentury. We came to bring logic back to the financial sector. We didn't \ncome here today to bring it back to benefit banks or to benefit \ninsurance companies or to benefit securities companies. We came to \noverturn the most significant financial legislation of the 20th century \nbecause it is in the interests of the American consumer that it be \noverturned.\n  Let me touch on areas that will be much benefited by this that have \nhad no discussion. The first point, one of the biggest problems we \nhave, is the inability of small businesses to raise capital. Probably \nthe most concentrated part of the American financial sector is \nsecurities underwriting.\n  If a little business in Mexia or College Station, TX, or Cambridge or \nEaston, MD, or any other of thousands of small or medium-sized towns \nacross America, has a good idea, they will have a hard time raising \ncapital because it is hard to get Wall Street interested in a small \nbusiness in a little town unless you have one of the great ideas of the \ncentury--and even then it takes a long time to prove it.\n  By letting banks participate in underwriting securities now, every \nbanker in every small town will have the ability to identify a good \nsmall business and give them access to capital that has never existed \nbefore in the history of this country. That is a benefit which will \naccrue to literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses over the \ndecades to come as a result of this bill because we will vastly expand \nthe number of securities underwriters, we will make every bank in every \ncity in America a potential underwriter for small business. That is a \ndramatic and positive change in law.\n  We dominate the world's financial markets, and we have done it with \none hand tied behind us, because we have the greatest economic system \nin the history of the world.\n  But we can untie that hand that we have had tied behind us, and we do \nit in this bill by repealing Glass-Steagall. This bill is going to make \nAmerica more competitive on the world market, and that is important \nbecause it means thousands of jobs, high-paying jobs--not just on Wall \nStreet in New York City, but for every business and every consumer in \nAmerica. I believe we are too quick to say something benefits Wall \nStreet instead of Main Street. The reality is, Wall Street is the \nfoundation on which Main Street is built. When America is more \ncompetitive, every American benefits.\n  There has been a lot of talk that what we are trying to do is already \nhappening to some degree. And it is because almost immediately after \nthe passage of Glass-Steagall, we had an effort by regulators to begin \nto bore holes in these walls between insurance and banking, and between \nsecurities and banking. We have seen, through regulatory innovation, a \nsuccessful effort in some areas to get around the law. This has allowed \nsome competition to occur. The problem is, what regulators give, they \ncan take back. So we have created a situation where we have given \nvirtual police power to regulators because they have allowed these \ninnovations to occur and they can take them back at any moment. That \ncreates too much power to be focused in the hands of a very small \nnumber of people.\n  We change that by tearing down the walls, and in the process taking \nthat discretionary power away from the regulators so people are \nguaranteed in law the right to be engaged in these activities.\n  My dear colleague from Maryland mentioned yesterday the issue of \n``too big to fail.'' That is a real issue. In this bill we start the \nprocess of dealing with the issue of too big to fail. We establish a \nprinciple, as part of the compromise that was worked out between \nTreasury and the Federal Reserve, which is not well understood. It is a \ncomplicated kind of issue. But what it does is profoundly important \nbecause for the first time in American financial law, we require big \nbanks to have subordinated debt. That is debt that only gets paid once \nthe depositors are paid, the creditors are paid, and everything else is \npaid off. That subordinated debt is a real live thermometer that is \nconstantly telling us how well this financial institution is. It is \nconstantly telling us how safe and how sound these institutions are. It \nrepresents, in my opinion, the beginning of our effort to deal with a \nvery real problem that Senator Sarbanes talked about, and that problem \nis the problem of being too big to fail. We don't let banks do anything \nwithin the bank unless they have an incredibly high rating on that \nsubordinated debt; that is, that it be rated AAA, AA, or A.\n  There has been a lot of talk about CRA. The bottom line is we have \ndone several very positive things. First, sunshine is the best \ndisinfectant. How can people be held accountable if we don't know what \nthey have been given money to do, how much money they have been given, \nand how they spend it. In this legislation, we have set out an ironclad \nprocess to guarantee us that information.\n  Second, there is a regulatory burden problem. Small banks end up \nbeing heavily burdened by regulations that often have a relatively \nnominal effect on big banks. We have dealt with that by giving smaller \nbanks some needed regulatory relief. In terms of privacy, we have heard \na lot of discussion, but we need to remember two things: No. 1, we \nrequire in this bill, in a provision that was adopted in the \nconference, offered by Members of the Senate conference, a disclosure \nin detail of what a bank's privacy policies are. That gives consumers \nthe most powerful tool that exists in a free society in protecting \nprivacy, and that is if you do not like the bank's policy, you can take \nyour business somewhere else.\n  Second, we give consumers the power to opt out.\n  So these are important provisions. I thought, as we waited to be sure \neveryone is here for this vote, that these points needed to be made.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as we come to the closing moments of \nthis discussion of the conference report, I want to recapitulate a few \npoints.\n  First of all, I think it must be understood that changes are taking \nplace in the financial landscape at the moment. They have been taking \nplace over the last 20 years. In some respects, this legislation is an \neffort to create a statutory framework which will encompass the changes \nthat have been happening and which it is reasonable to assume will \ncontinue to happen, even if we do not have legislation.\n  So many of the connections and the relationships about which some \nhave expressed concern in the course of the debate--because they see \nthis legislation as permitting them--are happening right now and will \ncontinue to happen. But they are happening without a rational \nlegislative framework,\n\n[[Page S13914]]\n\nwithout the Congress, in effect, having made judgments as to what the \nstructure of the system is going to be, without the actors within the \nsystem knowing exactly what the rules are, and having the security that \ncomes from knowing they are operating within a defined environment.\n  I stress that because some have raised it in the course of the \ndebate. Let me say in that respect I think we have had a very good \ndebate on this conference report, if I may say so. I thank those of our \ncolleagues who have spoken because of the depth of the perceptions and \nunderstanding they have brought to this debate. I think what transpired \nlast night and today has been in the better traditions of the Senate.\n  The marketplace in many respects has influenced the need for this \nlegislation. Securities firms have been offering bank-like products. \nBanks have been offering insurance-like products. Both have been \nengaged in significant securities activities. This has been taking \nplace out in the marketplace but without a statutory framework within \nwhich it clearly functions. These developments have now been going on \nfor more than two decades. We have been wrestling in the Congress for \napproximately that length of time to see how to revise our laws \nconcerning financial services in order to update them. We are about to \naccomplish that today.\n  This will enable the regulators--and of course this bill is very \nstrong on functional regulation--to maintain appropriate oversight as \nwe deal with this evolving marketplace. At the same time, it will \nenable financial service firms to respond to the needs of their \ncustomers. Many assert the customers will receive very significant \nsavings. Others say, no, no, it is going to result in greater costs. In \na sense, we will have to see how it plays out.\n  The administration sent a letter to us from the Secretary of the \nTreasury. I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The administration says the following:\n\n       By allowing a single organization to offer any type of \n     financial product, the bill will stimulate competition, \n     thereby increasing choice and reducing costs for consumers, \n     communities, and businesses. Americans spend over $350 \n     billion per year on fees and commissions for brokerage, \n     insurance and banking services. If increased competition \n     yielded savings to consumers of even 5 percent, they would \n     save over $18 billion per year.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Removal of barriers to competition will also enhance the \n     stability of our financial services system. Financial \n     services firms will be able to diversify their product \n     offerings and thus their sources of revenue.\n       Financial firms will be able to diversify their product \n     offerings and thus their sources of revenue. They also will \n     be better able to compete in global financial markets.\n\n  Which, of course, has become an increasingly relevant consideration \nas we consider our position vis-a-vis those of financial institutions \nheadquartered in countries overseas.\n  From the very beginning, many of us made it very clear there were \nimportant principles we thought had to be addressed with respect to \nthis legislation if we were to support it. We had to face questions, of \ncourse, of the safety and soundness of our financial system. We had \nimportant questions of CRA, important questions of consumer protection, \nimportant questions of the line between banking and commerce, which has \nbeen an important principle in the American system.\n  In the end, we have been able to work these issues in a way that we \nhave addressed those concerns--not entirely in some instances.\n  People have talked about privacy today. It is my expectation that \nissue will continue to remain on our agenda because we have not yet \nfully disposed of it, although I do note this bill put in some privacy \nprotections where none now exists. People should bear that in mind. \nThose who look at these provisions and say: We want more--and I am \nessentially with them; I introduced a bill earlier in this session that \nhad more such provisions, and I continue to support those concepts--for \nthose who say they want more, they need to understand we have nothing \nat the moment. The privacy provisions that are in this bill represent \nan important step forward.\n  I also have indicated that the too-big-to-fail issue--and the \nchairman has also commented on that--is an important matter that still \nremains before us. It is imperative this study the Federal Reserve and \nthe Treasury are to do jointly come back with recommendations that \nenable us to address that issue.\n  This is a risk that is present in the situation. We have confronted \nit in the past with respect to various financial institutions. We get \nthe moral hazard question: Institutions which assume they have reached \nthe size that they then become too big to fail have less of a \nconstraint upon them in terms of their activities than smaller \ninstitutions because they begin to operate on the assumption that no \none is going to require them to bear the consequences of their \nimprudence.\n  There have been occasions, of course, in the past when regulators \nhave said we simply cannot allow this institution to bear the full \nconsequences of its bad judgments because if we do that, it will have \nan impact upon the financial system as an entirety; therefore, we need \nto work out ways in which we can address that question with respect to \nthese large financial mergers and acquisitions which, of course, are \ngoing to happen under this legislation. Of course, they were already \nhappening.\n  What the legislation does is put a framework around this activity \nwhich will enable the regulators to exercise much more careful \noversight. It is preferable to have a framework developed by the \nCongress, not on an ad hoc basis by one regulator or another regulator, \nnot in situations where some perceive that regulators are being \ncompetitive with one another in terms of how they deal with the \nfinancial services sector. If we can have a responsible statutory \nframework established by the Congress which is contained in this \nlegislation that is now before us, it will contribute to the safety and \nsoundness of the financial system. This legislation better enables us \nto maintain the separation of banking and commerce.\n\n  There are important consumer protections, including some protections \nabout which the Securities and Exchange Commission was concerned, and \nthe legislation that has been developed has the very clear support of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  We have preserved the relevancy of the Community Reinvestment Act, \nand we have given banks the choice to conduct their expanded activities \neither through a holding company or, to a limited extent, through a \nsubsidiary. That was the issue that had the Federal Reserve and the \nTreasury in deep discussions with one another, and in the end I believe \nthey resolved that satisfactorily.\n  Let me also observe that this rational legislative framework we are \nputting into place provides for the future evolution of the financial \nservices industry. People will have the security of knowing what the \nplaying field is, something they do not know today with assurance. \nNowadays, they go to a regulator and get permission to engage in an \nactivity. The next thing they know, they are in court, and then the \ncase has to wind its way through the court system. They may either be \nupheld or turned down.\n  No one is quite sure what they are permitted to do and what they are \nnot permitted to do. People are constantly testing the edges of this. \nThe regulators are in some confusion. In some instances we have \noverlap, and in other instances we seem to have no overlapping at all--\nin fact, a vacuum--in terms of overseeing these activities.\n  With this conference report and this legislation which represents a \nmajor change--there is no doubt about that--these are far-reaching and \ndifficult public policy issues. They have not been solved for so long \nbecause they are far-reaching and difficult. We have had to address \nbalancing the needs and concerns of the consumers--which, after all, \nought to be one of our prime objectives--with a necessity of \naccommodating to new technology and new ways of doing business and the \nnature of the competition we are facing from abroad.\n  In the course of working through this, it has been an extremely \ninteresting process. I take considerable satisfaction from the fact \nthat in working with the chairman and with many others, we have been \nable to go from a position where we had a bill that, when it\n\n[[Page S13915]]\n\nleft the Senate, was vehemently contested to where we now come back \nwith a conference report that most of us, if not all, can join in \nsupporting and commending to our colleagues.\n  I recognize some of the points that were made here by some who were \napprehensive about the future. I think those are reasonable arguments. \nThey are arguments we considered. They were factors with which we had \nto wrestle. But I am hopeful that what we are doing here will represent \na very important step forward in the workings of the financial services \nindustry, in the protections for our consumers, in giving us a rational \nstatutory framework, and in enabling the regulators to do their job.\n  It sustains the relevancy of the Community Investment Act, which has \nbeen so important for some of the movement of capital into low- and \nmoderate-income communities in this country. It has made such a \ndifference. It is a very important first step, an important first step \non the privacy issue. We have tried to safeguard the ability of State \nregulators to participate. On privacy, States can continue to enact \nlegislation of a higher standard than the Federal standard. State \ninsurance regulators will continue to play the role they have \ntraditionally played with respect to State regulation of insurance.\n  So I think, all in all, we have put together a good and balanced \npackage. I commend it to my colleagues as we move to final passage. I \nthank the chairman of the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: The Administration strongly supports passage of \n     S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. This legislation \n     will modernize our financial services laws to better enable \n     American companies to compete in the new economy.\n       The bill makes the most important legislative changes to \n     the structure of the U.S. financial system since the 1930s. \n     By allowing a single organization to offer any type of \n     financial product, the bill will stimulate competition, \n     thereby increasing choice and reducing costs for consumers, \n     communities and businesses. Americans spent over $350 billion \n     per year on fees and commissions for brokerage, insurance, \n     and banking services. If increased competition yielded \n     savings to consumers of even 5 percent, they would have over \n     $18 billion per year.\n       Removal of barriers to competition will also enhance the \n     stability of our financial services system. Financial \n     services firms will be able to diversify their product \n     offerings and thus their sources of revenue. They also will \n     be better able to compete in global financial markets.\n       The President has strongly supported the elimination of \n     barriers to financial services competition. He has made \n     clear, however, that any financial modernization bill must \n     also preserve the vitality of the Community Reinvestment Act, \n     enhance consumer protection in the privacy and other areas, \n     allow financial services firms to choose the corporate \n     structure that best serves their customers, and continue the \n     traditional separation of banking and commerce. As approved \n     by the Conference Committee, S. 900 accomplishes each of \n     these goals.\n       With respect to CRA, S. 900 establishes an important, \n     prospective principle: banking organizations seeking to take \n     advantage of new, non-banking authority must demonstrate a \n     satisfactory record of meeting the credit needs of all the \n     communities they serve, including low and moderate income \n     communities. Thus, S. 900 for the first time prohibits a bank \n     or holding company from expanding into newly authorized \n     businesses such as securities and insurance underwriting \n     unless all of its insured depository institutions have a \n     satisfactory or better CRA rating. Furthermore, CRA will \n     continue to apply to all banks, and existing procedures for \n     public comment on, and CRA review of, any application to \n     acquire or merge with a bank will be preserved. The bill \n     offers further support for community development in the form \n     of a new program to provide technical help to low- and \n     moderate-income micro-entrepreneurs.\n       The bill includes other measures affecting CRA that have \n     been narrowed significantly from their earlier Senate form. \n     The bill includes a limited extension of the CRA examination \n     cycle for  small banks with outstanding or satisfactory CRA \n     records, but expressly preserves the ability of regulators \n     to examine a bank any time for reasonable cause, and does \n     not affect regulators ability to inquire in connection \n     with an application. Finally, the bill includes a \n     requirement for disclosure and reporting of CRA \n     agreements. We believe that the legislation and its \n     legislative history have been constructed to prevent undue \n     burdens from being imposed on banks and those working to \n     stimulate investment in underserved communities.\n       In May, the President stressed the importance of adopting \n     strong and enforceable privacy protections for consumers \n     financial information. S. 900 provides protections for \n     consumers that extend far beyond existing law. For the first \n     time, consumers will have an absolute right to know if their \n     financial institution intends to share or sell their personal \n     financial data, and will have the right to block sharing or \n     sale outside the financial institutions' corporate family. Of \n     equal importance, these restrictions have teeth. S. 900 gives \n     regulatory agencies full authority to enforce privacy \n     protections, as well as new rulemaking authority under the \n     existing Fair Credit Reporting Act. The bill also expressly \n     preserves the ability of states to provide stronger privacy \n     protections. In addition, it establishes new safeguards to \n     prevent pretext calling, by which unscrupulous operators seek \n     to discover the financial assets of consumers. In sum, we \n     believe that this reflects a real improvement over the status \n     quo; but, we will not rest. We will continue to press for \n     even greater protections--especially effective choice about \n     whether personal financial information can be shared with \n     affiliates.\n       We are pleased that the bill promotes innovation and \n     competition in the financial sector, by allowing banks to \n     choose whether to conduct most new non-banking activities, \n     including securities underwriting and dealing, in either a \n     financial subsidiary or an affiliate of a bank.\n       The bill also promotes the safety and soundness of the \n     financial system by enhancing the traditional separation of \n     banking and commerce. The bill strictly limits the ability of \n     thrift institutions to affiliate with commercial companies, \n     closing a gap in existing law. The bill also includes \n     restrictions on control of commercial companies through \n     merchant banking.\n       Although the Administration strongly supports S. 900, there \n     are provisions of the bill that concern us. The bill's \n     redomestication provisions could allow mutual insurance \n     companies to avoid state law protecting policyholders, \n     enriching insiders at the expense of consumers. The \n     Administration intends to monitor any redomestications and \n     state law changes closely, and return to the Congress if \n     necessary. The bill's Federal Home Loan Bank provisions fail \n     to focus the System more on lending to community banks and \n     less on arbitrage activities short-term lending that do not \n     advance its public purpose.\n       The Administration strongly supports S. 900, and urges its \n     adoption by the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Lawrence H. Summers,\n                                        Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it would be my objective to speak and end \nby 3:30 and we would have the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, success is claimed by a thousand parents. \nAnd today there are a lot of people who can claim parenthood. I am very \nhappy to have played a part in delivering the bill before the Senate \ntoday.\n  I think it represents the American legislative process at its best. \nIt has resulted more from an effort to reach a logical conclusion than \nto satisfy various special interest groups. In that way, it is not \nunique but it is different.\n  But the question is not how proud we are of this bill today. The \nquestion is, How will it look 50 years from now when it has gone from \ninfancy to maturity?\n  Obviously, after setting out a dramatic change in public policy, it \nis fair to set out a test for determining its success. How will people \njudge whether we were successful in passing this bill today? My test \nis, What are we trying to do in the bill? Are we trying to benefit \nbanks or insurance companies or securities companies, or are we trying \nto benefit consumers and workers? The test that I believe we should \nuse--the test I will use, the test I hope people looking at this bill \nyears in the future will use--is, Did it produce a greater diversity of \nproducts and services for American consumers? Were those products \nbetter? And did they sell at a lower price? I think if the answer to \nthose three questions is yes, then this bill will have succeeded.\n  The world changes, and we have to change with it. Abraham Lincoln \nused to tell the story about how Government had to change all outmoded \nlaws because they did not fit anymore, much as it would be unreasonable \nto expect a man to wear the same clothes he wore as a boy; that there \nis a nature to things and to society, and as they change, Government \nhas to change to recognize the new reality.\n  I believe today we are changing financial services in America to \nreflect that we do have a new century coming and we have an opportunity \nto dominate that century the way America dominated the last century.\n  Ultimately, the final judge of the bill is history. Ultimately, as \nyou look at\n\n[[Page S13916]]\n\nthe bill, you have to ask yourself, Will people in the future be trying \nto repeal it, as we are here today trying to repeal--and hopefully \nrepealing--Glass-Steagall? I think the answer will be no. I think it \nwill be no because we are doing something very different from Glass-\nSteagall. Glass-Steagall, in the midst of the Great Depression, thought \nGovernment was the answer. In this period of economic growth and \nprosperity, we believe freedom is the answer.\n  This is a deregulatory bill. I believe that is going to be the wave \nof the future. Although this bill will be changed many times, and \nchanged dramatically as we expand freedom and opportunity, I do not \nbelieve it will be repealed. It sets the foundation for the future, and \nthat will be the test.\n  So I am proud to have been part of this. I am proud to have worked \nwith everybody as part of the process. It has been interesting and \nGovernment at its best. I think one of the reasons we run for public \noffice is to get a chance to do things such as this. I am glad to have \nhad an opportunity to play a part and urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this dramatic move into the future.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, is there time remaining? I yield the \nSenator 2 minutes if there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time until 3:30.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will be done by 3:30.\n  I intend to vote for this legislation. I congratulate the parents of \nthe bill: Senator Gramm, Senator Sarbanes, and others, who worked very \nhard. This was not easy to do.\n  I agree, it is Government at its best. I believe this is very much \nproconsumer. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to do a \nfinancial transaction and being told: I would like to be able to do it, \nbut I can't. We have been limiting our individual capacity to develop \nour economy, to pursue the American dream, and do all other sorts of \nthings that make America such a great country.\n  I appreciate very much the effort made to make certain there is still \ngood regulatory oversight. I have no doubt that safety and soundness \nconsiderations will be taken into account. I think the concerns that we \nare going to have a meltdown such as we had in 1929 are concerns that \nare dramatically overblown, given the strength both of the Treasury and \nthe Federal Reserve in this legislation.\n  So I appreciate very much the hard work and diligence of the chairman \nand the ranking member because I believe our economy and our people \nwill benefit from it.\n  I am grateful as well--I do not know if the Senator from Texas is--\nthat the unitary thrift provision is limited in this legislation. The \nJohnson-Kerrey amendment that passed on the floor might have been a bit \ndifficult, but I think it is an important provision. I like the \nprovisions for community reinvestment. I think it is a terrific \ncompromise. My small banks have been asking for regulatory relief that \nprovides it. I think the sunshine provisions are quite exciting. I look \nforward to seeing where this money and how this money is being spent.\n  On the issue of privacy, you have improved current privacy \nprotections, better than what we have under existing law. I must say, I \nhad my own interest in privacy, and my concern about privacy increased \nas a consequence of examining this bill. I hope to participate in a \nbipartisan effort to give the American people the kind of privacy \nprotections that American citizens both expect and deserve.\n  Again, I congratulate and thank very much the chairman and ranking \nmember. It is a very important piece of legislation. People were \npredicting you were not going to be able to get the job done. I hope \nyou enjoyed the pizza that night when you stayed up very late to finish \nyour work. I am grateful you went the extra mile. There is no doubt in \nmy mind there is going to be a positive cause and effect between this \nbill being law and the health of the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this legislation has been a long time \ncoming. Many, including this Senator, consider it long overdue. It is \nhistoric in magnitude.\n  It has been described, appropriately, as a new ``Constitution'' for \nfinancial services for the 21st Century. Because of its importance, it \nhas been hard fought. But we can be proud of the final product. It will \nfoster a continuation of the extraordinary economic growth this nation \nhas seen in the last several years.\n  Most importantly, it offers new opportunities and benefits for \nAmerican consumers. It allows for ``one-stop shopping'' for an array of \nfinancial services. Americans will be able to conduct their banking, \ninsurance and investment activities under one roof, with all the \nconvenience that entails.\n  By allowing a single company to offer an array of financial products, \nthis bill will stimulate competition, leading to greater choices and \nreduced fees for consumers and businesses alike. New companies will \ncreate innovative new products for consumers.\n  It is important to remember how far we have come to reach this \nhistoric moment. Congress has been trying to pass a bill along these \nlines for 20 years. We came extremely close in the last Congress, but \nit fell apart in its waning moments over disagreements about the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n  Again in this Congress, the bill saw some tough moments. In the \nSenate, it passed by party-line votes both in committee and on the \nfloor.\n  Because of the deep commitment of Democrats to enactment of this \nlegislation, we did not give up. We introduced an alternative bill that \ncould garner bipartisan support. And I am proud to say that this \nconference agreement embodies all of the principles that we advocated \nin our alternative bill.\n  We do not need to surrender our beliefs to support of this bill, \nbecause it adopts our positions on every major issue. Best of all, \nthese victories mean that the President can sign this bill into a law, \nso it can improve the delivery of financial services for many years to \ncome.\n  Our positions prevailed right down the line.\n  Our position prevailed on banking and commerce: this bill strictly \nlimits the ability of thrifts to affiliate with commercial companies, \nclosing a loophole in current law.\n  Our position prevailed on operating subsidiaries: the bill allows \nbanks to choose whether to conduct new activities in either a financial \nsubsidiary or an affiliate. They can choose whatever form best suits \ntheir customers' needs.\n  Our position prevailed on consumer protections: the SEC retains the \nability to protect consumers when banks sell securities products, which \nwas a major concern of SEC Chairman Levitt. The agreement also \npreserves important state consumer protection laws governing insurance \nsales, and prohibits coercive sales practices.\n  Our position prevailed on the Community Reinvestment Act: CRA is \npreserved under this bill. The agreement addresses our greatest concern \nby requiring that banks have a good track record on lending within \ntheir own communities before they can expand into newly authorized \nbusinesses.\n  We can be proud of these achievements, and proud to support this \nbill.\n  At the same time, we can be disappointed the bill does not go further \nto protect consumers' financial privacy. The bill does contains some \nimportant provisions requiring financial institutions to give customers \nnotice about their privacy policies. But these companies retain \nextraordinary latitude in sharing a customer's most sensitive, personal \ninformation without the customer's consent and without even giving the \ncustomer the right to object. We have to do better. This issue is far \nfrom over, and we will have to revisit it next year.\n  Despite these shortcomings, which also exist in current law, this \nlegislation will benefit consumers, businesses and the economy, and \ndeserves our support. Through this bill, Congress is finally reforming \nour outdated financial services laws to recognize new realities in the \nmarketplace.\n  I would like to commend our many colleagues, administration \nofficials, and outside institutions that have worked so long and so \nhard to bring us to this point. We must especially recognize the \nleadership of the ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator \nSarbanes, for his dogged determination to ensure that this final\n\n[[Page S13917]]\n\nproduct upheld the public's best interests. The Secretary of the \nTreasury, Larry Summers, and his predecessor, former Secretary Rubin, \nalso played key roles in ensuring that this legislation protected the \ninterests of American consumers.\n  I must also commend the Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator \nGramm, for his recognition of the need for compromise and \nbipartisanship in producing a bill that deserves the signature of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Mr. President, this legislation deserves the support of an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority of our colleagues, and I urge them to \nvote for it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a difficult day for the people of \nmy home State of Washington. I spent a lot of time last night talking \nwith my neighbors, my family members, and local officials in Seattle. \nLike me, they are all trying to make sense out of something that makes \nno sense--yesterday's act of violence which killed two people, injured \ntwo more, and brought fear to my own neighborhood.\n  I wasn't sure if I should come to the floor today because I kept \nasking myself, What is there left to say? That once again, Americans \nare mourning after yet another deadly shooting? That once again, our \nfamilies and our neighbors are gripped with fear because someone with a \ngun has decided to act violently? That once again, these outbreaks of \nviolence aren't going away--they are just becoming too common?\n  I decided I should come to the floor to offer first my condolences to \nthe families who have been involved and to talk to the people of my \nState and to thank the law enforcement officials who have responded and \nto talk to my colleagues about what we can do. My heart goes out to \neveryone who walks along the Burke-Gilman Trail, a trail I have walked \non so many times. My heart goes out to every child who was held in \nschool until they got home safely last night and into their parents' \narms. My heart goes out to everyone who works and lives and knows this \nneighborhood. On Tuesday, it was safe. Today, it is gripped with fear.\n  Do we see what is happening? Or have these crazy acts become so \ncommon that we think we just cannot do anything about them? Can't we \nsee it was someone else's neighborhood yesterday? It was my \nneighborhood today. Tomorrow it could be your neighborhood. What can we \ndo? Why haven't we done something already? Are we too gripped with \npartisanship? Are we too tied to special interests to act? Are we too \nafraid to change the status quo or to even question our own rhetoric? \nAre we asking the right questions? Are we really posing the right \nanswers?\n\n  I know it is in our spirit as Americans to hope for the best and to \nbelieve things will get better. That is usually the way it is. But how \nmany shootings will it take before we realize things aren't getting \nbetter on their own? They are getting worse, and it is up to us to take \naction.\n  It seems to me we, as a nation, have not dealt with the mentally ill. \nWe don't want to pay for costly services. But don't we all end up \npaying later at a far higher cost? It seems to me, as a nation, we have \nnot spoken out against violence in a strong and consistent manner. \nCan't we find a way to speak out without violating our freedom of \nspeech? Can we have this conversation without falling into the traps of \nthe far right and the far left?\n  Every time we turn on the news and we are gripped by fear, guns are \ninvolved. What tragedy will it take before we act? How many people have \nto die? How many shootings is it going to take? How close to home do \nthey have to strike?\n  We had a shooting here in the Capitol, in the heart of democracy, and \nwe still have not acted. Can't we make commonsense rules about keeping \nguns away from those who shouldn't have them?\n  I personally am tired of the old rhetoric. From the far left they \nsay: Take all the guns away. From the far right they say: It is not the \nguns, it is lax law enforcement.\n  Give me a break. We are the greatest nation in this world; can't we \ncome up with some commonsense ideas about how to protect our own \npeople? I think we can.\n  This Congress has failed miserably. Here we are, in the same year as \nthe Columbine tragedy, with no juvenile justice bill, no background \nchecks for guns sold at gun shows, no resources for our communities to \nhelp those who are mentally ill, and no afterschool activities for our \nkids. That is shameful.\n  I hope my colleagues will stop and think for a minute and realize \nthis is not happening to someone else. It is happening to all of us. It \nwas Hawaii on Tuesday. It was Washington on Wednesday. It could be your \nState today. Those are just the mass shootings that get a lot of media \nattention. We should not forget, on the average, 12 children a day die \nfrom gunfire.\n  I say to my colleagues, I would love to work with anyone from either \nside of the aisle who wants to take the time to really talk about what \nour country is facing. There are many factors. People are overstressed; \nviolence is pervasive; weapons are easy to get. It is a flammable \ncombination that has exploded too often.\n  Our country is looking for leaders who will work together on this. I \nsay it is time to try. I invite anyone who wants to work with me to let \nme know.\n\n[[Page S13918]]\n\nI certainly am one mom who has had enough.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, recent comments by several Russian \nGovernment officials about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and our \nplans to deploy a national missile defense are very troubling to me. \nFor example, the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ivanov, was quoted last \nweek as saying:\n\n       There . . . cannot be any bargaining with the Americans \n     over the anti-ballistic missile defense.\n\n  This may be a clever negotiating tactic, but it is not a very \nproductive one. It unnecessarily pushes the United States to make a \nchoice between defending ourselves against limited ballistic missile \nthreats and withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. We have \nalready decided, by the adoption of the National Missile Defense Act, \nthat we will defend ourselves as soon as technologically feasible \nagainst limited ballistic missile attack. We should not be forced to \nwithdraw from the treaty.\n  The Russians should understand that our system is directed at rogue \nthreats and will not jeopardize their strategic deterrent force. We \nhave an opportunity to work cooperatively to ensure that we are \nprotected, both Russia and the United States, against emerging \nballistic missile threats without undermining strategic deterrence.\n  The ABM Treaty needs to be changed to permit the deployment of \ndefenses against limited ballistic missile threats and to allow the \nparties to utilize new defensive technologies. There should be no \nrestrictions, for example, on the use of sensor capabilities such as \nthe space-based infrared system and cooperative engagement capability. \nWe should also be able to take advantage of new basing modes and \nadvanced technologies such as the airborne laser.\n  The ABM Treaty must be interpreted to allow the parties to use the \nbest technologies that are available in their own defense against rogue \nthreats. The strategic deterrent of each nation can be preserved at the \nsame time limited missile defenses are permitted and considered \nacceptable under the ABM Treaty.\n  Another Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week:\n\n       Russia does not see as acceptable such an ``adaptation\" of \n     this treaty. Russia will not be a participant in destroying \n     the ABM Treaty.\n\n  The Russian Government's contention that adapting the ABM Treaty to \nmodern realities is akin to destroying it is unfortunate. In fact, the \nopposite is true. To refuse to adapt this treaty to the new realities \nis to guarantee its irrelevance.\n  One reality is the new ballistic missile threat. The other is that \nthe United States is going to respond to this threat and protect itself \nby deploying a missile defense system. The sooner the Russians \nunderstand our commitment to defend ourselves, the more likely it is we \ncan agree to sensible modifications of the ABM Treaty for our mutual \nbenefit and safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the beginning of this congressional \nsession was filled with hope and promise. A strong economy and \nimprovements in the Federal budget gave us a wonderful opportunity to \nmake important investments in our Nation's future. A portion of these \nsurpluses could be used to extend the solvency of the Social Security \nprogram. A portion of the surplus could be used to restore solvency to \nMedicare and to modernize its benefit structure to reflect current \nmedical practices. A portion of the surplus could be used, as was urged \nin the full-page ad in the Washington Post of October 28, ``to use this \nopportunity to preserve our parks and open spaces forever.'' This could \nbe accomplished by such things as fully funding the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and a portion of the surplus could be used to fund \ntax relief and economic stimulation.\n  Instead of devoting the surplus to these important matters, Congress \nis dribbling away the surplus with a combination of get-out-of-town \nspending and budgetary trickery. Our actions--emergency spending, \nscorekeeping adjustments, administrative directives--have one simple \nresult: They are spending our surplus. Once current revenues are spent, \nthe non-Social Security surplus will be spent and the Social Security \nsurplus will be spent. If Congress continues on this gimmick-potholed \npath, we will be harshly judged by the American people for our \nshortsightedness.\n  On October 4 of this year, the Washington Post ran an article on the \n10-year anniversary of the reunification of Germany. In that article, \nWolfgang Schaeuble, the Christian Democratic leader and Chancellor \nKohl's most trusted adviser, lamented the fact that Germans had avoided \nmaking the tough political choices 10 years ago that would have made \ntheir country stronger today. The spirit of reunification created an \natmosphere for reform. The Germans could have used that spirit to make \nfundamental changes to their overly generous social contract that all \nacknowledged was unsustainable. They deferred, and the result was a \ntripling of the national debt in less than a decade.\n  We face the same choice today. Our positive economic outlook creates \na similar potential for the United States. The budget surplus gives us \nthe resources to convert a substantial part of that potential to \nreality.\n  At the beginning of the year, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated we would have a non-Social Security surplus of $21 billion. \nWhat have we done in the last 10 months? The combination of excessive \nspending and the budget trickery designed to disguise even greater \nspending have placed the on-budget surplus in serious jeopardy and \nthreatened to undermine the Social Security surplus. These actions--\nspend and then hide--have occurred in waves throughout 1999. As with \nour coastline, no single wave erodes our beaches. Rather, it is a \nsuccession of waves that erodes the sand. These spending waves have \neroded our surplus, eroded our opportunities, eroded our vision of what \ncould be accomplished.\n  In May of 1999, the Congress passed a supplemental appropriations \nbill which provided for $15 billion for everything from reconstruction \naid for Central America and the Caribbean to farm loan assistance. Much \nof the May supplemental bill was designated as an emergency. No \nspending cuts or revenue increases were enacted to offset the emergency \nspending contained in that May 1999 supplemental appropriation. The \nconsequence? A $15 billion reduction in the non-Social Security \nsurplus.\n  The May supplemental appropriations lowered for 1999 the surplus by \n$4 billion. That was a significant number because without that \nadditional $4 billion of unpaid-for spending, we would have actually \nended 1999 with an on-budget surplus. But because of it, we have ended \n1999 with an on-budget deficit of $1 billion.\n  The May supplemental will lower the current fiscal year 2000 on-\nbudget surplus by $7 billion. It will lower the next fiscal year 2001 \nby $2 billion; 2002 by $1 billion; and 2003 by $1 billion.\n  By this action, we not only adversely affected the fiscal status of \nthe year in which the action was taken but for 4 years into the future.\n  This chart shows we started with a $21 billion on-budget surplus; as \na result of that portion of the supplemental appropriations which was \napplied to fiscal year 2000, we reduced it by $7 billion. So now we \nonly have a $14 billion on-budget surplus.\n  The next wave hit in August of 1999, the Agriculture Appropriations \nAct: $8 billion of emergency spending, again, none of which was offset \nby reductions in spending elsewhere or increased revenues. So we have \nreduced the on-budget surplus by another $8 billion from $14 billion to \n$6 billion.\n  In October of 1999, the Defense appropriations bill included more \nthan $7\n\n[[Page S13919]]\n\nbillion in emergency spending, of which $5 billion reduces this year's \non-budget surplus. So our $6 billion on-budget surplus is now down to \n$1 billion.\n  Also, in October of 1999, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations \nbill designated $4.5 billion of spending for the emergency of the \ndecadal census. More than $4 billion of that amount will come directly \nout of the 2000 on-budget surplus and, thus, as a result of that, we \nhave exhausted our on-budget surplus, and we have reduced the Social \nSecurity surplus from $147 billion to $144 billion.\n  What have we done thus far? We have initiated a series of waves of \nunfunded spending which have gone through all of our regular revenue \nfor the year 2000 and now have gone through all of the on-budget \nsurplus and have eaten into the Social Security surplus by $3 billion.\n  That was not all. In addition to this spending, we have also had a \nseries of accounting tricks. In the summer of 1999, to give the \nappearance of meeting the discretionary spending caps established as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Budget Committee directed \nthe Congressional Budget Office to alter its estimates of spending \nincluded in several of the appropriations bills. These so-called \nscorekeeping adjustments which total $17 billion make it look as if we \nare spending less in the current year than is actually the case.\n  The Budget Committee justifies these directions by claiming they are \nmore in line with those used by the Office of Management and Budget.\n  What is happening is we are cherry picking. For example, the Office \nof Management and Budget spending estimate for the year 2000 for the \nDepartment of Defense is lower than the Congressional Budget Office. \nTherefore, the Budget Committee says: Use the Office of Management and \nBudget. But guess what. When we turn to the energy and water \nappropriations bill where the reverse is true--that is where CBO's \nspending is lower than the Office of Management and Budget--they said: \nUse the Congressional Budget Office estimate.\n\n  It is a case of trickery: Pick the lowest estimate of spending and \nforce that lower estimate to be the one used to assess whether or not \nwe have eaten into the Social Security surplus. The analogy would be a \nbusiness which used two sets of books. The difference is that the \nbusiness man or woman who did that would go to jail.\n  No Halloween mask can hide our identities as we engage in these \ntrick-or-treat charades. When these scorekeeping adjustments are added \nto the emergency spending listed previously, Congress will have spent \nthe entire amount of its current revenue, the entire amount of its on-\nbudget surplus, and will have spent at least $20 billion of Social \nSecurity surplus for fiscal year 2000.\n  The trickery does not end there. Another bit of trickery is directed \nat administrative action. In an effort to avoid paying for additional \nspending, congressional leaders have asked the administration to make \nchanges in the Medicare rules allowing for higher reimbursement levels \nto Medicare health care providers. These payments, anticipated to be \napproximately $4.5 billion over the next 5 years, will not show up in \nany action taken by Congress, but they will certainly result in higher \nspending and smaller surpluses.\n  The analogy is to a family which sends a son or daughter to college \nand gives him or her a credit card to pay for college expenses. The \ncredit card receipts may not be signed by the parents, but they are \nultimately going to be responsible. At the day of reckoning, they will \nhave to pay for them and reduce their bank account in so doing.\n  The threat to the on-budget and Social Security surpluses are not \nconfined to the current fiscal year. There are other waves that have \nyet to hit the beach but are forming on the ocean's horizon.\n  As an example, we are proposing paybacks, additional reimbursement to \nMedicare providers for the current fiscal year of $1 billion; for the \nfiscal year 2001, $5 billion; and over the next 10 years, $15 billion. \nNone of those are currently proposed to be offset by either spending \nreductions or revenue increases. In the House of Representatives, they \nare proposing to marry a minimum wage increase with tax cuts. Those tax \ncuts over 10 years will total $95 billion. They are not proposed to be \noffset by either spending cuts elsewhere or revenue increases.\n  Mr. President, $5 billion of the discretionary spending authorized in \nthe last few months will not occur in the current fiscal year but, \nrather, have been pushed into 2001, and another $2 billion has even \nbeen pushed into the year 2002. The spending limits of fiscal years \n2001 and 2002 are even more restrictive than this year's limit. The \nspending cap for 2000 was set in 1997 at $579 billion. We are probably \ngoing to spend in excess of $610 billion before this session concludes. \nWe have blown through the spending cap for this year by some $31 \nbillion.\n  The problem gets worse because in fiscal year 2001, we have set \nourselves a spending limit of $575 billion, $35 billion below what we \nare spending this year. In the fiscal year 2002, the spending cap is \n$569 billion, another $6 billion below current year spending.\n  Given the fact that Congress cannot pass spending bills within this \nyear's limit of $579 billion, it is wholly unrealistic to believe \nCongress will have even greater success with the significantly lower--\n$35 billion next year and $41 billion 2 years out--limits than we have \ntoday. Spending above those limits will further threaten the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  In fiscal year 2000, we will spend all of the tax revenue we collect, \nwe will spend all of the on-budget surplus, and we will dip into Social \nSecurity by about $20 billion. In the year 2001, we will spend all the \nrevenue we collect, and at this rate, we have already spent all but $3 \nbillion of the on-budget surplus.\n  Why is this recounting of the reality of our spendthrift year of 1999 \nimportant? Some say it does not matter if we spend the Social Security \nsurplus; we have done it for 30 years, so why not 1 more year? Why stop \nthe spend-and-borrow party today? Spending the Social Security surplus \nis stated to be good for the economy.\n  I argue just the opposite, that preserving the Social Security \nsurplus is intricately linked to a strong American economy. Most \neconomists agree that increasing national savings is important to \nmaintaining a strong economy. Greater savings results in greater \ninvestment in plant and equipment, which creates jobs and raises \nproductivity. Greater productivity translates into a higher standard of \nliving. The surest way to increase national savings is to reduce the \nFederal debt.\n  The Finance Committee even has a subcommittee dedicated to this \nproposition. It has a subcommittee with the title, Long-Term Growth and \nDebt Reduction. We have denominated one of our very institutions to the \nproposition of the relationship between economic growth and debt \nreduction.\n  Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told the \nSenate Finance Committee earlier this year:\n\n       Increasing our national saving is critical. The President's \n     approach to Social Security reform supports a large unified \n     budget surplus. This is a major step in the right direction \n     in that it would ensure that the current rise in government's \n     positive contribution to national saving is sustained.\n\n  I would say that quotation is even more relevant today, as we have \njust gotten the latest monthly report on the national personal savings \nrate and it is virtually at an all-time low. It is, in fact, the \nsavings that are occurring at the national governmental level that are \nproviding most of the savings which are available in our economy.\n  Reducing the Federal debt frees capital for use in the private \nsector. Lowering the public debt reduces the Federal Government's \ninterest costs, freeing scarce resources for other important public \ninvestments.\n  The Office of Economic Policy reported in August that over the last 7 \nyears, because of the greater fiscal discipline that has been practiced \nat the national level, we have saved for the American taxpayer $189 \nbillion in interest costs--$189 billion which is now available for \nother constructive public uses, including financing tax relief for \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Reducing the Federal debt also has a positive effect on individual \nAmerican families. When the Federal Government decreases its borrowing, \nit results in greater availability of capital for all other borrowers. \nThe same Office of Economic Policy estimates that a typical American \nfamily with a $100,000\n\n[[Page S13920]]\n\nmortgage on their home will save about $2,000 a year in mortgage \npayments if interest rates are reduced 2 percent as a result of the \nFederal Government's more austere fiscal policy.\n  So saving the Social Security surplus is important in the economic \nlife of our Nation and for individual American families today. It also \nwill be a critical factor in the challenge we are going to be faced \nwith in the next two decades as Social Security begins to meet the \ndemands of the baby boom generation.\n  Demographic changes taking place in our country will dramatically \nalter the Social Security program. An aging post-World War II \ngeneration, declining birthrates among young- and middle-aged adult \nAmericans, and increasing life expectancies will quickly deplete the \nassets which are currently accumulating in the Social Security trust \nfund.\n\n  By law, surpluses generated by Social Security may only be invested \nin U.S. Government or U.S. Government-backed securities. The Social \nSecurity surpluses being generated today were planned as part of the \nchanges made to the program in 1977 and then in 1983. The surpluses \nwere created for the express purpose of prefunding the retirement \nbenefits of the baby boom generation. It is much like the biblical \nprinciple of saving during 7 good years to prepare for 7 lean years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes to \ncomplete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n  Under current projections, these surpluses will reverse in the year \n2014 when the baby boom generation begins to retire. Their demand for \nretirement benefits will outpace the revenue collected from payroll \ntaxes after the year 2014. These shortfalls will require that the \nassets, the Federal Government's securities which have been accumulated \nby the Social Security trust fund, be redeemed.\n  In essence, the Social Security trust fund, with a large pile of \nseveral trillion dollars' worth of Federal securities, will now be \ngoing to the Federal Treasury and saying: We are going to turn these \npieces of paper back to you, and we need the cash they represent in \norder to meet the current obligations to Social Security beneficiaries.\n  The most effective way to plan for the demands that will be created \nby the baby boomers' retirement is to utilize the current Social \nSecurity surpluses in a very thoughtful and prudent manner, in a manner \nto reduce that portion of the national debt which is held by the \npublic.\n  Lowering our outstanding debt today will put the United States in a \nmuch stronger financial position should we need to borrow funds to \nredeem the U.S. Treasury securities currently held by the Social \nSecurity trust fund. The cash obtained from redeeming those assets will \nbe used to pay benefits when the baby boom generation retires.\n  The Social Security surplus can lower the debt held by the public by \n$2 trillion if we do not waste it. That $2 trillion reduction in debt \nheld by the public will serve as a critical cushion to meet our Social \nSecurity obligations.\n  In summary, we are about to lose a great opportunity to address the \nlong-term fiscal challenges facing our country. Instead of preserving \nboth the on-budget and the Social Security surpluses for uses in saving \nSocial Security, Medicare, investing in America, or returning it to the \ntaxpayers in the form of tax relief, Congress is frittering the money \naway.\n  We have spent the fiscal year 2000 on-budget surplus, and we have \nspent at least $20 billion of this year's Social Security surplus. The \noutlook for 2001 and 2002 is not any better. We should stop these \nactions now, pay for the spending we enact, and avoid the use of \naccounting gimmicks.\n  We stand at a unique point in history. Two months from now, we will \nmove into a new century and, indeed, a new millennium. Instead of \ntaking a ``get the appropriations bills done and get out of here \napproach,'' we should direct our sights to larger goals. We should be \nprepared to act boldly. We can seize upon this opportunity provided for \nus by a strong economy and an improved financial state of affairs and \nembark on a fiscal agenda that will pay rich dividends for decades to \ncome.\n  Our predecessors, at the beginning of the 19th and 20th centuries, \nfaced similar opportunities and challenges. Each chose the bold \napproach. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the building of the Panama \nCanal in 1904 were emblematic of a proud, vigorous, bold new nation at \nthe beginning of a new century. Although controversial in their day, \nthe Louisiana Purchase and the building of the Panama Canal are \nexamples of courageous endeavors that have stood the test of time.\n  The question facing this Congress is whether we will live up to the \nexample of the 19th century and the 20th century as we commence the \n21st century or whether we will squat in the narrow, visionless box \nbuilt for parliamentary pygmies. Will we validate Proverbs 19:18, \nwherein it says: ``Where there is no vision, the people perish''?\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor over the \nlast few days in an effort to win support for bipartisan legislation to \nsecure prescription drug coverage for the Nation's older people. As \npart of that effort, I have been urging seniors, as this poster says, \nto send in copies of their prescription drug bills to each of us in the \nSenate in Washington, DC.\n  In addition to getting copies from seniors of their prescription drug \nbills, I am now hearing from seniors who are sending me copies of \nprescriptions they cannot afford to get filled. This is a prescription \nthat was written for an older gentleman at home in Beaverton, OR. He is \nusing 21 prescriptions at this point. He has already spent almost \n$1,700 this year on his prescriptions. Here we have three he cannot \nafford to get filled: Glucophage is a drug that one takes to deal with \ndiabetes; Tagamet; Prilosec--three very common prescriptions older \npeople in our country need and use. This is an example of what he sent \nme, prescriptions his doctor wrote out, and he can no longer afford to \nactually get them filled.\n  This is the kind of account I am hearing from seniors across the \ncountry. We have asked them to send in copies of their prescription \ndrug bills. I have a whole sheaf of those, all kinds of bills we are \nreceiving in that area. But now we are actually hearing from seniors \nand getting copies of their prescriptions their physicians are writing \nfor them that they cannot even take to a drugstore and get filled.\n  In the last 24 hours, we in the Senate have been watching the news \nreports about the dueling press conferences involving prescriptions. \nThere has been an awful lot of finger pointing one way or another. \nFrankly, each one of them has some reasonable points to make. What is \nso frustrating is that instead of these dueling press conferences and \ngoing back and forth, having all this finger pointing, the Senate ought \nto be working on bipartisan legislation.\n  There is one bipartisan bill now before the Senate. It is the Snowe-\nWyden legislation. The Senator from Maine and I have teamed up over the \nlast few months to put together a bipartisan bill to get prescription \ndrugs covered for older people on Medicare. We have 54 Members of the \nSenate already on record as voting for a specific plan to fund this \nprogram. A majority of the Senate is now on record for a bipartisan \nproposal to pay for prescriptions.\n  Here we are, with the session only having a few more days to go, \nSenators--I am sure I am not the only one--getting copies from seniors \nof prescriptions that they cannot actually afford to have filled. We \nhave asked them in recent days to send us copies of their prescription \ndrug bills. They have been doing that. Now they are sending us copies \nof prescriptions they cannot afford to take to their neighborhood \npharmacy and get covered.\n  It is so sad to see these dueling press conferences, and then we \ndon't have a response, to have seniors telling us the sad and often \ntragic stories about how\n\n[[Page S13921]]\n\nthey can't afford to take their medicine. Their doctor tells them to \ntake three pills. They don't do that. They start taking two. They start \ntaking one. Eventually they get much sicker.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. It uses marketplace \nforces. We don't have a Federal price control regime. We don't have a \none-size-fits-all health care policy. We have the kind of approach that \nworks for Members of Congress and their families.\n\n  Our bill, called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage \nEquity Act, is a senior citizens version of the kind of health plan \nthat Members of Congress have. We incorporated recommendations from \nconsumer groups. Families USA, for example, has made some excellent \nrecommendations on consumer protections that older people need.\n  We have also listened to the insurance sector and the pharmaceutical \nsector, making sure there would be adequate incentives for research and \nthe initiatives that are underway to help us find a cure for \nAlzheimer's and all of the illnesses that are so tragic, for which \nevery Member of the Senate wants to see a cure.\n  I will keep coming to the floor. I want to cite a couple more \nexamples before we wrap up. I know other colleagues want to speak.\n  I heard recently from a senior citizen in Forest Grove that in recent \nmonths she spent almost $1,500 on her prescription drugs. Another older \nperson from the Portland metropolitan area reported that in a few \nmonths, she spent over $600 for her medications. She is now taking more \nthan seven medications on an ongoing basis.\n  Very often the families have to go out and try to find free samples \nto compensate for some of the drugs the older people can't afford. \nFamilies have to chip in when it is hard for them to afford medicine. \nThey are all asking, is the Senate going to just bicker about this \nissue or is the Senate going to come together in a bipartisan way and \nactually do something about these problems? We have more than 20 \npercent of the Nation's older people spending over $1,000 a year out of \npocket on their medicine.\n  I am very often asked: Can this Nation afford to cover prescription \ndrugs? My response is, we cannot afford not to cover these \nprescriptions. As I have cited several times during these \npresentations, a lot of these drugs help us to hold down costs. They \nhelp us to deal with blood pressure and cholesterol. The anticoagulant \ndrugs are absolutely key to preventing strokes. I cited an example of \none important anticoagulant drug where for $1,000 a year, in terms of \nthe cost to the senior, they are able to save $100,000 in expenses that \nthey would incur if they suffered a debilitating stroke when they \ncouldn't get these medicines.\n  It is absolutely essential that we secure this coverage for the \nNation's older people. It seems to me now a question of political will. \nCan we set aside some of the partisanship on this health care issue, \nsome of the bickering that has gone on back and forth? I believe the \nSnowe-Wyden legislation--a majority of the Senate has already voted for \nin terms of its funding plan--is the way to go. But I know colleagues \nhave other ideas.\n  What we ought to do is resolve to deal with this issue in a \nbipartisan way. I hope seniors will continue to send us copies of their \nprescription drug bills, as the poster says, to their Senator in \nWashington, DC.\n  I hope in the days ahead we won't see a whole lot more of these \ntragedies such as the one I have cited today. It is one thing for a \nsenior to send in their bills and say, I am having difficulty paying \nfor this; I hope you will cover it. But it is quite another for a \nsenior citizen to send me, as this older person did from Beaverton, a \ncopy of his prescriptions saying--it says it right down in the margin--\n``can't afford to get filled.'' Prescriptions his doctor ordered, in \neffect the prescriptions go unfilled. These are important medicines. If \nyou don't take Glucophage and you have diabetes, you can have some very \nserious health problems.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will look to get beyond the dueling press \nconferences, look beyond some of the issues that have surrounded this \ndiscussion in a partisan way and say: We are going to come together and \ngo to bat for seniors and their families. It is time to do it.\n  I intend to keep coming back to the floor until we secure this \ncoverage. It was important for seniors back in the days when I was \ndirector of the Gray Panthers. It is even more important now because \nthese drugs can help us to save bigger health care bills down the road. \nI will be back on the floor continually calling for a bipartisan \napproach to this issue, one that uses marketplace forces to deal with \nthe challenge of health care costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, as we gather together to witness \nLincoln Chafee take the oath of office to serve as the Senator from \nRhode Island, I am reminded of my conversation last week with \nTransportation Secretary Rodney Slater.\n  We shared fond memories of our friend and spoke of his many \ncontributions to transportation safety. Secretary Slater worked closely \nwith Chairman Chafee on transportation issues that came before the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the remarks made last \nweek by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater on the passing of our \ncolleagues, Senator John Chafee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater on the \n                     Passing of Senator John Chafee\n\n       We are deeply saddened by the death of Senator John Chafee. \n     He served the people of Rhode Island and of this nation long \n     and well, and leaves a legacy of accomplishment that will \n     endure for generations.\n       As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee, Sen. Chafee realized that the highway system is \n     more than concrete, asphalt and steel, and was an early \n     champion of a safer, more balanced, environmentally sensitive \n     transportation system. As a key author of the ground-breaking \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, he \n     possessed a vision of how much better and stronger our \n     surface transportation system could be. He then worked \n     tirelessly to preserve and build on those gains in the 1998 \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. He cared \n     deeply about health care, and fought hard for critical \n     highway safety improvements and against drunk and drugged \n     driving.\n       Sen. Chafee was responsible for the creation of the \n     Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program and \n     transportation enhancement activities. He insisted that the \n     highway system not be looked at alone, but rather as a \n     comprehensive network which includes trains, planes, buses, \n     ferries, bicycles and pedestrain paths.\n       Sen. Chafee also was a protector of our marine environment, \n     playing a major role in the passage of legislation to prevent \n     oil spills and prohibit ocean dumping. He also was \n     instrumental in the passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act. He \n     always worked in a bipartisan manner with President Clinton \n     and this administration in order to get things done.\n       Here at the U.S. Department of Transportation, we will work \n     to carry forward his legacy as we continue to build the \n     transportation system of the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13921-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13921-S13922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OMBUDSMAN REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in the Summer of 1998, I met with a group \nof concerned citizens from the Overland Park neighborhood, which is \nlocated in southwest Denver. The dozen or so residents had requested a \nmeeting with me to discuss an issue that had taken up more than six \nyears of their lives and had driven them to distrust anything the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency had told them about a Superfund site \nlocated in their neighborhood called Shattuck.\n  The story surrounding the Shattuck Superfund site and what the EPA \ndid to this community will have a lasting impact not only on the \nresidents of the\n\n[[Page S13922]]\n\nOverland Park neighborhood, but on each and everyone of us who look for \nthe EPA to be the guardian of our nation's environmental health and \nsafety.\n  For those who have not followed the Shattuck case, these are the \nfacts that have been uncovered thus far. In 1991, the local Region 8 \nEPA office and the Colorado Department of Health began to look at \npossible remedies for the cleanup of the old S.W. Shattuck Chemical \nCompany located on South Bannock Street in Denver. Initially, it was \ndetermined that the safest and most effective cleanup was removal of \nthe radioactive waste to a registered storage facility in Utah. But \nfollowing a secret meeting between Shattuck's attorneys, EPA and the \nColorado Department of Health the decision was made to store the waste \non-site. Residents in the area were never told that the remedy chosen \nby the EPA had never been used before anywhere in the United States, \nand more importantly documents calling into question the reliability of \nthe remedy were kept from the public. In 1993, the EPA signed the \nRecord of Decision (ROD) and the radioactive waste at the Shattuck \nSuperfund site was entombed on-site.\n  Over the next five years the citizens of Overland Park fought to get \ntheir neighborhood back. They petitioned the EPA for a review of the \ndecision and were denied. They attempted to submit new information \nabout the safety of the remedy selected and were told by the EPA the \nremedy was safe. Finally, last summer the residents concerns were \nbrought to my attention. After meeting with area residents and business \nowners, I determined their questions deserved answers and together we \nbegan a journey to find the truth about Shattuck.\n  Last October, I asked the EPA to meet with the community to answer \ntheir questions and was informed they would not conduct such a public \nmeeting. Outraged by their answer, I exercised my right as a U.S. \nSenator to hold up Senate confirmation of a key EPA official. The move \nresulted in the EPA agreeing to my request for an independent \ninvestigation of Shattuck by the National Ombudsman. Earlier this year \nhe began his investigation and quickly determined the claims made by \nresidents were not only meritorious, but that EPA officials had engaged \nin an effort to keep documents hidden from the public.\n  In fact, the Ombudsman was so successful at uncovering the facts \nsurrounding Shattuck, his investigation has resulted in EPA officials \nnow looking at eliminating his office. A meeting was recently held \namong all ten EPA regional administrators and staff from EPA \nAdministrator Carol Browner's office to discuss eliminating the \nOmbudsman position. This can not be allowed to happen! Nor will I allow \nit to happen. Without the Ombudsman's investigation on Shattuck the \nresidents of Overland Park would have never learned the truth. The \nOmbudsman's investigation brought integrity back into the process.\n  The EPA's efforts to curtail the Ombudsman's independence is an \nattempt to seek revenge for the on-going Shattuck investigation and to \nintimidate citizens who dare question the answers they are given by the \nEPA. I have recently introduced Senate Bill 1763, the ``Ombudsman \nReauthorization Act of 1999,'' which will preserve the office of the \nNational Ombudsman. The battle to enact this legislation could be \ntougher than getting the EPA to admit they made a mistake at Shattuck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13922-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Chafee's last formal address. It was given \nat the National Cathedral on the occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary \nCelebration of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. They \nreflect the great beauty of the man, who loved his country so, and gave \nso much to it.\n  I ask unanimous consent the address be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks of Senator John H. Chafee for Fiftieth Anniversary Celebration \n   of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, October 21, 1999\n\n       Thank you, Dick, for your generous introduction. Secretary \n     Babbitt, Mayor Williams, Commissioner Peck and friends, it is \n     an honor to join you today.\n       Every so often there occurs an event so cataclysmic, so \n     egregious, that it sparks a demand for national action. For \n     example, in the 60's and early 70's, many in our nation were \n     disturbed about the foul condition of our natural waters--our \n     lakes, streams, and rivers--where fish could no longer \n     survive and filth was obvious to all who would look.\n       There were those who said a national response was required, \n     but other demands on the federal treasury took precedence. \n     Until one day the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, polluted with \n     oil and grease, caught fire. That's right--a river burst into \n     flames in 1969.\n       That was the final indignity--that was what brought about \n     the Clean Water Act of 1972. This led to an eventual \n     expenditure of $70 billion by the federal government for \n     waste water treatment plants and an even greater outlay by \n     private industry and local communities to comply with new \n     discharge standards.\n       A desperate call for national action to preserve the \n     historically and architecturally important buildings across \n     our land was heard in 1963. Out of a single event--the \n     destruction of magnificent Penn Station in New York City--\n     arose a national outcry.\n       Modeled in part after the Baths of Caracalla, Penn Station \n     was an awe inspiring building the likes of which will never \n     again be built.\n       A line from an editorial in the New York Times, published \n     soon after the commencement of the station's demolition, \n     expressed the sentiment of the day. It read:\n       ``We will probably be judged not by the monuments we build \n     but by those we have destroyed.''\n       Fortunately, there was in existence an organization--The \n     National Trust for Historic Preservation--that was trying to \n     sound the alarm to our nation that we must save the Penn \n     Stations and other grand buildings. And that organization is \n     doing a superb job and we are fortunate it exists on this, \n     its 50th birthday.\n       There are three points I'd like to leave with you today. \n     They are:\n       First, as supporters of the National Trust, you are engaged \n     in extremely important work for our country.\n       Second, you are on the cutting edge of the environmental \n     movement.\n       Third, some suggestions I have that could make your efforts \n     even more effective.\n       Let me exemplify point one. You are engaged--as supporters \n     of the National Trust for Historic Preservation--in work that \n     is extremely important to our country. You are preserving \n     what British novelist D.H. Lawrence once referred to as the \n     ``spirit of place.'' Expressing his anxiety about the quiet \n     exchange of quaint English hamlets for the faceless \n     infrastructure of the industrial age, he wrote:\n       ``Different places on the face of the earth have different \n     vital effluence, different vibration, different chemical \n     exhalation, different polarity with different stars: call it \n     what you like. But the spirit of place is a great reality.''\n       All across our land, your actions are preserving that \n     spirit of place.\n       You are doing far more than trying to save the Penn \n     Stations of our land. You are fostering an urban \n     revitalization of whole sections of some of our older cities. \n     By encouraging tax credits for rehabilitation of older \n     buildings, by promoting smart-growth initiatives, and the \n     conservation of open space, you are making whole sections of \n     our older cities more livable, more attractive to home \n     buyers.\n       This all makes such sense. By promoting city dwelling we \n     reduce expenditures on brand new roads, sewer pipelines, gas, \n     electric, and phone lines, thus assisting our town and \n     country treasuries. For within historic districts exists the \n     needed infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S13923]]\n\n       None of it has to be built--it is already in place because \n     of the past exodus of residents. Washington, DC is typical of \n     our older cities where the population has gone from 800,000 \n     in 1950 to 540,000 today--a 32 percent drop.\n       And, there are tremendous economic benefits to what you are \n     doing. Studies have shown that dollar for dollar, historic \n     preservation is one of the highest job-generating economic \n     development options available. In other words, one million \n     dollars spent on rehabilitation creates more permanent jobs, \n     does more for retail sales, and does more for family incomes \n     in a community than a like amount spent on new construction.\n       Because of efforts of the members of the National Trust \n     over the years, and the leadership it has given, my state is \n     a microcosm of what is taking place across our nation. Many \n     of our magnificent marble palaces in Newport were saved from \n     being subdivided into a series of apartments and instead were \n     preserved as originally built. Now, they are by far the \n     largest tourist attractions in our state, and extremely \n     important to the economy of Newport.\n       Likewise, historic districts are flourishing and home \n     owners are eager to buy turn of the century homes that were \n     so soundly built.\n       This didn't just happen. It came about with the consent \n     inspiration and guidance from the National Trust.\n       Let me move to point two. You are on the cutting edge of \n     the environmental movement.\n       Why do I say that? If we can be successful in enticing a \n     goodly portion of our citizens to live within our cities, we \n     have helped stanch the flow of what we've come to know as \n     urban sprawl. We are losing our farmland at a frightening \n     rate--two acres every minute of every day, according to \n     estimates of the American Farmland Trust.\n       There is no question that every new home that is built in \n     our suburbs or every new housing development that is created, \n     affects some creature's habitat. I have long held that if we \n     give nature half a chance, it will rebound. But we must give \n     it that half a chance. Regrettably, in too few areas are we \n     doing that. The National Trust is at the forefront of \n     environmental action by making our cities more attractive, \n     thus reducing the paving and development of our countryside.\n       Few environmental challenges equal that of global warming, \n     and the principal culprit in that area is the automobile. If \n     people remain within cities, there are indeed fewer autos on \n     the road, which means less pollution, less global warming.\n       Now for point three: some suggestions to make your efforts \n     even more effective.\n       Do all you can to make the federal government a leader in \n     historic preservation. When we do something really good, \n     cheer us on. For example, we can all be delighted and \n     encouraged by the inclusion of large sums of money in \n     transportation legislation for so-called enhancements. These \n     substantial moneys can be used, among other things, to \n     restore historic buildings. Senator Pat Moynihan deserves the \n     principal credit for the Enhancement Program, which we first \n     did in the 1991 Highway Bill and continued in the 1998 \n     Transportation Bill known as TEA-21. This was a radical \n     departure from previous highway bills and Senator Moynihan \n     deserves tremendous credit.\n       We in the federal government can also lead by example by \n     restoring post offices and courthouses rather than abandoning \n     them and moving their activities to the suburbs.\n       Let me give you an example of a courthouse we managed to \n     save that was historically and architecturally important. \n     Almost a decade ago, I visited the traditional home of the \n     federal judiciary in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico--a court house \n     that had fallen into disrepair. It was a shambles, and there \n     was a movement underway to abandon the structure in favor of \n     constructing a new one in the suburbs. But the building's \n     historic significance coupled with such architectural \n     flourishes as a beautiful two-story loggia overlooking the \n     harbor, warranted its preservation.\n       Thanks to the General Services Administration's \n     preservation efforts, and a $35 million restoration, this \n     beautiful courthouse has been saved and will be dedicated \n     next spring.\n       The restoration of the Courthouse should spur a renaissance \n     in San Juan's historic quarter. Lawyers doing business at \n     court will frequent nearby restaurants and shops. Hotels and \n     other businesses may spring up as more people visit the area.\n       We can create incentives in the tax code to promote \n     restoration. As many of you know, those who restore historic \n     buildings for commercial purposes re already eligible for tax \n     credits. Since these provisions have been in place, $18 \n     billion dollars have been generated in private investment. \n     You should be proud of these numbers, for they didn't \n     happen of their own accord. They came about with the \n     constant inspiration and guidance from the National Trust.\n       I have long hoped to extend these credits to homeowners \n     through legislation called the Historic Homeownership Act. It \n     would allow homeowners who rehabilitate homes in historic \n     areas to take a tax credit equal to 20 percent of the \n     project's cost. This credit could be used toward one's tax \n     liability or in the form of a mortgage credit certificate. \n     Because of this flexibility, these provisions would be \n     attractive to low and middle income homeowners, not just \n     those in the top tax brackets.\n       There has been overwhelming support for this legislation \n     across the political spectrum. Earlier this year, we enacted \n     a version of it as part of the tax bill approved by Congress. \n     That was the bill the President subsequently vetoed. The \n     prospects for enacting that homeownership tax credit bill \n     this year are dim. Hopefully, next year we can do it. Before \n     I go, I want to get this done! You can help by pestering your \n     Senators and Representatives to support the Historic \n     Homeownership Act.\n       Another major way you can lend a hand is by giving vocal \n     support to efforts states, counties, and towns are making to \n     preserve open spaces. If the land is going to be saved, then \n     homes are not going to be built there.\n       Clearly, open space conservation and historic preservation \n     go hand in hand. In fact, Senator Joe Lieberman and I are \n     pressing for legislation that would accomplish both goals. It \n     is called the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act. It would \n     fully fund the Historic Preservation Fund at 150 million \n     dollars per year and encourage states to set aside open \n     space. While we may be addressing these concerns at the \n     federal level, the time is ripe to promote ballot initiatives \n     in your own towns and counties.\n       Last year, voters approved the vast majority of the 200 \n     ballot initiatives for open space purchases to curb urban \n     sprawl at state and local levels.\n       With such wide-ranging support, evidently these measures \n     are not just the province of the elite. No, the rich and poor \n     alike support them, because they benefit everyone.\n       One of the biggest successes occurred in New Jersey where \n     voters, in 1998, set aside $98 million to buy open space.\n       And, just last week, two local anti-sprawl initiatives made \n     news in the Washington area. In Montgomery County, planners \n     proposed to spend $100 million over the next decade to \n     preserve historic properties and undeveloped land. In \n     addition, the city council in Rockville, Maryland approved a \n     six-month development moratorium on single-use retail stores \n     of 60,000 square feet or more.\n       There are many ways that we can encourage historic \n     preservation at the federal level. But absent your \n     cooperation, none of the preservation work would get done. So \n     the rest is up to all of you. And I trust that you will carry \n     out these initiatives with purpose and enthusiasm. Do what \n     you can to recruit others to join your ranks.\n       Naysayers may ask: What difference does saving one train \n     station or post office truly make in the future of America? \n     My response is this: preservation is not just about \n     conserving brick and mortar, lintel and beam. It is about the \n     quality of life, and the possibility of a bright future. Carl \n     Sandburg expressed the danger of losing touch with our past \n     when he said:\n       ``If America forgets where she came from, if people lose \n     sight of what brought them along, . . . then will begin the \n     rot and dissolution.''\n       Who could say it better!\n       On behalf of the city of Providence and Rhode Island, we \n     look forward to sharing our historic treasures with you \n     during your 2001 conference. Keep up the good work. Thank \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13923-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13923-S13924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on a modest \npackage of trade bills which included the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. As a \nlong time supporter of expanding trade opportunities for Vermonters and \nall Americans, as well as people in developing countries, I reluctantly \ncast my vote against this bill.\n  Exports are a key component of Vermont's economy. As a small state, \nwe must promote our products beyond the Green Mountains. Vermonters are \nreaping the benefits of more open markets around the world and these \nmarkets are creating new jobs here at home. Not long ago, I led a \nVermont trade delegation to Ireland which has one of the fastest \ngrowing economies in Europe.\n  Having said that, trade is about more than financial statistics. It \nis about more than increasing market opportunities for American \nproducts, as important and laudable a goal as that is. In our \nincreasingly inter-connected world, trade involves a broad range of \nissues and concerns. As the wealthiest nation, we also have a \nresponsibility to do what we can to ensure that the benefits of the \nglobal economy are enjoyed by people from every walk of life, here and \nabroad. And when we vote, we have a responsibility to ensure that \nlegislation entitled the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act'', \nactually benefits African workers and protects their families' health \nand welfare, and the natural environment. The bill that was passed \nyesterday will not do that.\n  I have felt for some time that our relationship with Africa needs to \nchange. It cannot continue to be based almost exclusively on aid, when \nthe real engine of development, as we have seen\n\n[[Page S13924]]\n\nelsewhere in the world, is investment and trade. However, in developing \na trade policy toward Africa--where poverty is deeply rooted and \nprotections for the environment and the rights of workers are virtually \nnon-existent--precautions must be taken to ensure that it is a sound \npolicy that responds to Africa's unique and urgent needs.\n  It used to be that workers' rights and environmental concerns were \ntreated separately from trade considerations, or not at all. \nFortunately, that has begun to change. One of the reasons I voted for \nNAFTA was because it contained side agreements on labor and \nenvironmental issues.\n  However, while those agreements were a step forward, time has shown \nthat they did not go far enough. Unfortunately, even the modest labor \nand environmental agreements that we fought hard to include in NAFTA \nwere not included in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \nvirtually every amendment to add similar provisions was defeated. Such \na step backward makes absolutely no sense.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act's provision on workers' \nrights, which has been included in other trade legislation, has \nroutinely allowed countries notorious for abuses to escape without \npenalty. Unions have rightly criticized this provision for being vague \nand unenforceable. It is an invitation for exploitation of cheap \nAfrican labor.\n\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act does not include a single \nprovision related to environmental concerns. Multinational \ncorporations, especially mining and timber companies, have a long \nhistory of taking advantage of Africa's weak environmental laws and \ncontributing to pollution, deforestation and the uprooting of people. \nIf barriers to foreign investment are lowered or eliminated--as the Act \ncalls for--and meaningful, enforceable environmental protections are \nnot put in place, these problems will only get worse.\n  Like the NAFTA debate, however, the rhetoric on both sides of this \nissue was overblown. The African Growth and Opportunity Act is not, as \nsome of its supporters claimed, an historic step toward integrating \nAfrica into the global economy. At best, this Act will have a modest \nimpact. It simply offers limited market access to African countries \nunder the Generalized System of Preferences and establishes a U.S.-\nAfrican trade and economic forum.\n  On the other hand, the African Growth and Opportunity Act will not, \nas some of its opponents claimed, force African countries to cut \nspending on education and health care, and to adhere to stringent \nInternational Monetary Fund conditions. It rewards African countries \nthat are taking steps toward economic and political reforms, as most \nAfrican countries are already doing, but it does not force them to do \nanything.\n  In all my time in the Senate, this is the first attempt that has been \nmade to redefine our relationship with Africa from one of dependency to \none which begins to promotes economic growth and self-reliance. This is \nlong overdue, and the opportunity to address these issues is not likely \nto come again soon. I had hoped that when the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act reached the floor it would have provided for expanded \nexport opportunities for both Africans and Americans while protecting \nAfrican workers and the environment.\n  Many of my concerns about the African Growth and Opportunity Act, \nalso hold true for the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. I fully \nsupport efforts to expand U.S. trade with Caribbean Basin countries and \nto provide these countries with trade benefits that will help them \ncompete in the global economy. However, again, it is vitally important \nthat the trade benefits included in this Act actually benefit those who \noften need them the most--workers and their families. Virtually every \namendment that would have required Caribbean companies to institute \nfair and enforceable labor standards before they could be eligible for \ntrade benefits under the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act was \ndefeated, and crucial protections were therefore not included.\n  Mr. President, it is disappointing that given the opportunity to \nsimultaneously redefine our relationship with Africa, re-examine our \ntrade policy toward the Caribbean Basin and expand international \neconomic opportunities for Americans, that the approach and the outcome \nwas so flawed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13924-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN'S \n                             ASSASSINATION\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Today is the fourth anniversary of the \nassassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. On October 25, \n1995, ten days before his assassination, Prime Minister Rabin spoke in \nthe Rotunda of the capitol at a ceremony celebrating the passage of the \nJerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. The honor of introducing him fell to me. \nI said, ``History will honor him as the magnanimous leader of a brave \npeople--brave enough to fight daunting odds--perhaps even braver still \nto make peace.'' Four years later as Israel and the Palestinians \nprepare to begin final status negotiations, I think it appropriate to \nremember the man who helped lead his people down this road to peace. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my remarks on that \noccasion.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan on the Passage of The \n Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, United States Capitol Rotunda, October \n                                25, 1995\n\n       My pleasant and most appropriate task this afternoon is to \n     introduce one of Jerusalem's most illustrious sons.\n       History will acknowledge him as the unifier of the City of \n     David--the Chief of Staff whose armies breached the barbed \n     wire and removed the cinder blocks that has sundered the city \n     of peace.\n       History will honor him as the magnanimous leader of a brave \n     people--brave enough to fight against daunting odds--perhaps \n     even braver still to make peace.\n       History will remember him as the last of the generation of \n     founders--the intrepid children of a two thousand year dream. \n     Almost certainly, the last Israeli Prime Minister to play a \n     leading role in the War for Independence, he was also the \n     first--and to this day the only--Prime Minister to be born in \n     the Holy Land.\n       He is a proud son of Jerusalem. As a young man he dreamed \n     of a career as an engineer.

Mr. President, I am pleased that yesterday the Senate \nadopted my amendment to H.R. 434, the African and Caribbean trade \nlegislation, regarding the upcoming World Trade Organization (WTO) \nMinisterial Conference in Seattle, Washington, from November 30 to \nDecember 3, 1999.\n  My amendment is straightforward. It expresses the sense of the \nCongress on the importance of the new round of international trade \nnegotiations that will be launched at the WTO Ministerial Conference, \nand would require the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to \nsubmit a report to Congress regarding discussions at the Ministerial on \nantidumping and countervailing duty agreements. My amendment sends a \nmessage from the Congress that these talks are significant and that we \nwill be examining these discussions closely. Specifically, it sends a \nmessage to our trading partners that we have no intention of allowing \nthe antidumping and countervailing duty agreements to be nonchalantly \nrelinquished, and that we will be keeping an official record of any \ndiscussions on these topics.\n  I am strongly opposed to opening the antidumping and countervailing \nduty agreements to negotiation, and, therefore, I am very pleased that \nthe Administration reports that it will put forth a U.S. trade agenda \nthat reaffirms trade remedy laws, and, specifically, U.S. rights to \nenforce antidumping and countervailing duty measures. Nevertheless, we \nshould expect that certain WTO member governments will attempt to \nweaken the current antidumping and countervailing rules during the next \nround of talks. Certain WTO member governments will likely attempt to \nuse the antidumping and countervailing rules as leverage against other \nU.S. priority issues, thus, pitting U.S. industries against one \nanother.\n\n[[Page S13925]]\n\n  Without the antidumping and countervailing duty agreements, I believe \nthat many of our trading partners would not hesitate to flatly dismiss \ntheir WTO obligations in order to maximize their own profits. \nAntidumping and countervailing duty rules offset foreign \ncountervailable subsidies and below-cost pricing schemes intended to \nharm a U.S. industry. Prohibiting these unfair trade practices is the \nessence of our most basic trade agenda, and laws to thwart and penalize \nthis behavior were enacted as early as 1897. As in 1897, antidumping \nand countervailing measures are a vital tool to combat unfair trade.\n  My amendment would help the Administration put forth a U.S. trade \nagenda at the Seattle talks that reaffirms U.S. rights to enforce \nantidumping and countervailing duty measures, and that protects these \ncodes from any negotiation. Undermining the right of the U.S. to \nrespond to unfair trade practices will hinder the ability of many U.S. \nmanufacturers, including U.S. steel mills, to fight against unfair \ntrade. It would also undermine a century of work to build a \nstraightforward and responsive international trade system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate, then, has just passed the \ncontinuing resolution to the 10th of November. Progress is being made \nevery hour on the appropriations process--some hours more than others. \nI hope Members will continue being patient while the final must-do \nlegislation is completed.\n  I want to say again that I think the last 2 days have been phenomenal \nwhen you stop and look at all the difficulty that was involved--the \nfact that we passed major trade legislation by a vote of 75 or 76 to 23 \nlast night, and today we passed the biggest reform of the banking and \nsecurities financial services industry in several decades with 90 \nvotes. It is incredible.\n  We are going to continue to work to move vital legislation. We have \nother conferences that we hope to get agreed to. We need to get \nagreements. In fact, we must get an agreement on the FAA \nreauthorization bill. We are very close to getting an agreement on the \nsatellite conference report. We are very close on the work incentives \nconference report.\n  There are three or four major conferences that are very close to \nbeing completed. When they are completed, we will take them up as soon \nas possible.\n  In addition, if agreements are reached on appropriations bills, of \ncourse, we would set everything aside for that. It seems to me that \nDistrict of Columbia and perhaps the foreign relations conference \nreports could be ready as early as tomorrow. Certainly, if they are, we \nwill vote on them.\n  The Senate hopefully also will reach, in just a very few minutes, an \nagreement on how to proceed on the bankruptcy bill. Senator Daschle and \nI have been working on this for weeks actually. I think we are very \nclose to having an agreement. We are exchanging amendments so each side \nwill know what is in our amendments both tonight and again tomorrow by \nnoon. I hope Members who have relevant amendments on the underlying \nbankruptcy bill will come to the floor and offer them yet today.\n  We are in what I hope are the final days of the session. Members must \nbe willing to work into the night in order to complete this \nlegislation. I know there are some relevant amendments that are \ncontroversial and they will have second-degree amendments. Members \nshould come to the floor and offer them.\n  Members could also expect votes during tomorrow's session. One could \ncome with regard to appropriations. We could have votes on amendments \nwith regard to the bankruptcy bill.\n  Members should expect that on Monday there will be recorded votes \nbeginning at 5:30.\n  Also, votes will be ordered on the bankruptcy consent, calling for \ntwo votes with respect to minimum wage and business cost issues at \n10:30 on Tuesday morning.\n  I am announcing that we may have to have votes tomorrow. We will have \nvotes at 5:30 Monday. We will have votes at 10:30 on Tuesday.\n  We hope within the next few minutes to be able to enter the agreement \non the bankruptcy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the majority leader yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I defer.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, does the majority leader have any \ninformation regarding the Interior appropriations bill? That is one of \nthe bills that is continuing to be negotiated.\n  Maybe I should wait to get his attention.\n  Will the majority leader yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator from \nLouisiana, I apologize for not directing my attention to her question. \nI was visiting with the Senator from Maryland with respect to possible \nvotes tomorrow.\n  The Interior appropriations conference report is being worked on \nwhile negotiations have been going forward on the foreign operations \nappropriations conference report. I have information that real progress \nhas been made today on the foreign operations appropriations report, \nbut they will not get to the point of wrapping up Interior until the \nforeign operations bill is done.\n\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana has a real interest in that \nInterior bill, particularly provisions that could affect coastal areas \nsuch as hers and mine. Oil and gas revenues have been going in the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund for years and to lands out west, which is \nwell and good. However, we take the risks in our area and we have not \nbeen getting any money. I don't think that is fair. We have beach \nerosion problems; we have estuary replenishment with which we need to \ndeal. I am very sympathetic to the concerns of the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  No final agreement has been reached on Interior. The Senator still \nhas time to weigh in mightily with the Senators involved, and the \nadministration, and needs to talk to them. I know the Senator has \nSenator Daschle working feverishly in her behalf.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If I could respond, both have been very helpful and \nsupportive as we worked toward a bipartisan compromise on some of these \nissues.\n  I particularly thank the majority leader for his efforts as a \ncosponsor of one particular piece of legislation, but there have been \ndifferent versions filed. However, there is a tremendous amount of \ninterest.\n  Perhaps I should ask Senator Gorton--I said I will say this \npublicly--if tomorrow at his convenience, maybe through the majority \nleader or directly, he can give Members some idea of some of the things \nthat perhaps are being discussed in terms of riders that were very \ncontroversial when this bill passed, as well as some of the specific \nways we may be funding some of these projects.\n  We want to work out a bipartisan solution that is reflective of what \nmany Members have worked on now for over 2 years. Maybe there could be \nan appropriate time tomorrow for discussion. Senator Daschle may have \nsomething to add.\n  I certainly want to be supportive of progress we are making on \nbankruptcy, but I think there are some other important issues, too, \nthat should be dealt with in the next few days.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more with the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. This is an important issue. While \nwe need to stay focused on the appropriations bill\n\n[[Page S13926]]\n\nand on bankruptcy, she has been working on this matter for a long, long \ntime and has made great progress.\n  I share the view expressed by the majority leader that this is an \nissue that has great impact not only in her region of the country but \nin regions throughout the country. I hope we can resolve this \nsatisfactorily and she can be satisfied with the final product. I will \ndo all I can to work with the majority leader to see that happens in \nthe remaining days of this session.\n  I commend the majority leader for getting the Senate to this point. I \nthink we are very close to reaching an agreement. As I understand, we \nhave not yet had the opportunity to exchange amendments, but we will be \ndoing that shortly. He and I have both worked with our colleagues to \nensure we can work through this agreement. I think this is a win-win. I \nthink it is an opportunity to finish an important piece of legislation, \nan opportunity to deal with some issues that both sides think are \nimportant. I think it is a very appropriate vehicle with which to get \nour work done. I am hopeful we will get total cooperation procedurally \nto allow the Senate the opportunity to finish this work.\n  I am fully expecting before the end of the day we will have an \nagreement that will allow the Senate to go through the next couple of \ndays in expectation of finishing this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes \nto speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few minutes ago I posed a few \nquestions to the majority leader about a very important piece of \nlegislation, an appropriations bill that is still pending. As we know, \nthere are several important appropriations measures being debated and \nnegotiated, and that is the process. Some of that happens, a lot of it, \nbehind closed doors, which is the way it has worked for many, many \nyears and will probably continue to work that way.\n  However, there are some questions I want to raise or some points I \nwant to bring up. There are a great number of Members--Senators from \nthe South, the East, the North, and the West, Democrats and \nRepublicans, a great group of House Members, led by Don Young of Alaska \nand George Miller of California, Chris John from Louisiana, Billy \nTauzin from Louisiana, a Democrat and Republican respectfully, and \nRepresentative Udall in the House--who have worked very hard to come to \nsome bipartisan agreements about a new way to spend offshore oil and \ngas revenues in a way that is fair to all the coastal States, \nparticularly those States including Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and \nAlabama to a certain degree, that produce these offshore oil and gas \nrevenues. Without our States acting as a platform, this industry would \nnot exist.\n  Many Members have worked on a bipartisan redirection of some of those \nrevenues to come back to the States and local governments instead of \ngoing into the Federal Treasury as they do now, and as they have been \nsince 1955, redirecting those revenues back to help the coastal \nrestoration programs, to help restore our coastlines particularly in \nLouisiana, which is so fragile, and the Florida Everglades, which need \na tremendous amount of help.\n  In addition, we have the idea these moneys could be permanently \nallocated to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund which has \nbeen funded intermittently--hit and miss--through the decades.\n  We think the American people should have something to count on, so \nthey know every year their Federal Government is going to take a very \nsmall portion, but an important portion, of money for land purchases \nand acquisitions and conservation easements to help expand our park \nsystem, both at the Federal level and to improve our park system, as \nwell as giving Governors and mayors and county officials the ability to \ncreate recreational opportunities. As a Governor, Mr. President, you \nknow how important that is to the people of your State and my State. \nThey believe strongly in recreation and access to the outdoors.\n  In addition, this bipartisan group believes it can also take a \nportion of those moneys and expand the very successful Pittman-\nRobertson, which is one of the most successful Federal programs, \nworking in partnership with local outdoors enthusiasts--hunters, \nfishermen and women, conservationists in those areas--and to fully fund \nhistoric preservation and urban parks, to name just a few. It is a very \ncomprehensive approach. It is an innovative approach.\n  Although we do not have a bill out of either House yet, we do have a \ngreat markup that I want to share with the Members, Chairman Young's \nmarkup that came out this morning. Their bill, which is reflective of \nsome of the things I have said, will be considered next week. It would \nbe a tremendous accomplishment for this administration and for this \nCongress to come together in a bipartisan way to make at least a \ndownpayment this year. If we cannot fully fund what I have generally \njust described, let us at least make an effort this year to fund, for 1 \nyear, these programs that are currently already authorized, that have \nbeen in existence for many years, to actually put some money where our \nmouth is--within the budget caps and the balanced budget agreement we \nhave reached--so we could perhaps build on this year and, over the next \nseveral years, fully fund the programs I have talked about.\n  I will ask to have printed in the Record today a letter I received \nfrom 800 individuals and organizations supporting this initiative. It \nis signed by 800 of some of the leading environmentalists and activists \nin the country today, groups representing all different aspects of the \nenvironmental community from the east coast to the west coast, from \nsouth to north. They have submitted a letter to us today supporting the \nefforts I have just articulated.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter, dated November 1, 1999, as well \nas a table of Federal offshore mineral revenue collections for 1989-\n1999 and projects for 1999-2000, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 November 1, 1999.\n     U.S. Senate/House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: As the twentieth century draws \n     to a close, Congress has a rare opportunity to pass landmark \n     legislation that would establish a permanent and significant \n     source of conservation funding. A number of promising \n     legislative proposals would take revenues from non-renewable \n     offshore oil and gas resources and reinvest them in the \n     protection of renewable resources such as our wildlife, \n     public lands, coasts, oceans, cultural treasures, and outdoor \n     recreation. Securing this funding would allow us to build \n     upon the pioneering conservation tradition that Teddy \n     Roosevelt initiated at the beginning of the century.\n       The vast majority of Americans recognize the duty we have \n     to protect and conserve our rich cultural and natural \n     legacies for future generations. A diverse array of \n     interests, including sportsmen and women, conservationists, \n     historic preservationists, outdoor recreationalists, the \n     faith community, business interests, state and local \n     governments, and others, support conservation funding \n     legislation because they recognize it is essential to fulfill \n     this obligation.\n       We call upon you and your colleagues to seize this \n     unprecedented opportunity. Pass legislation that would make a \n     substantial and reliable investment in the conservation of \n     our nation's wildlife, public lands, coastal and marine \n     resources, historic and cultural treasures, urban and rural \n     parks, and open space. Design a bill that provides \n     significant conservation benefits, is free of harmfull \n     environmental impacts to our coastal and ocean resources, and \n     does not unduly hinder land acquisition programs.\n       An historic conservation funding bill is within our grasp. \n     It will be an accomplishment that all can celebrate. We look \n     to Congress to make this legislation a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    ------  ------\n\n[[Page S13927]]\n\n\n\n Federal Offshore Mineral Revenue Collections, Calendar Years 1989-1999\n \n                         Year                                Amount\n \n1989..................................................    $2,915,145,540\n1990..................................................     3,367,738,819\n1991..................................................     2,793,166,498\n1992..................................................     2,561,405,652\n1993..................................................     2,856,913,823\n1994..................................................     2,915,284,805\n1995..................................................     2,723,753,949\n1996..................................................     4,253,641,347\n1997..................................................     5,259,228,035\n1998..................................................     4,322,637,332\n                                                       -----------------\n  Average.............................................     3,396,891,580\n \n\n\n  Projected Federal Offshore Mineral Revenue Collections, FY 1999-2005\n \n                         Year                                Amount\n \n1999..................................................    $2,946,000,000\n2000..................................................     2,584,000,000\n2001..................................................     2,812,000,000\n2002..................................................     2,827,000,000\n2003..................................................     2,669,000,000\n2004..................................................     2,575,000,000\n2005..................................................     2,489,000,000\n                                                       -----------------\n  Average.............................................     2,700,285,714\n \n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, basically they are saying there is a \nway, a better way, to allocate these revenues from offshore oil and gas \nto fund a variety of programs that are fair to all the different parts \nof this Nation, one that is environmentally friendly, one that focuses \non the needs of our coastline and also recognizes the proper role of \nCongress in authorizing the purchases of land because that is something \nthat should be done not only by the administration, whoever the \nPresident may be, Republican or Democrat--whether it is the current \nPresident, who has been terrific in many ways on this issue--but it is \nsomething that must be worked on in conjunction with the Members of \nCongress.\n  They have signed a letter that is going to be distributed. I will \nhave it printed for the Record. In addition, I would like the Record to \nreflect we received 2 weeks ago an endorsement from the National \nChamber of Commerce. They usually do not get into environmental issues \nsuch as this, but the Chamber of Commerce realizes, as businesspeople \nrepresenting some of the finest businesses in our country, that a clean \nenvironment, access to parks and recreation, improving the quality of \nlife for Americans everywhere, is the Chamber's business because we are \nabout improving the quality of life, improving our economy. They see \nthis as an important bill.\n  It is not that usual to have the environmental community and the \nbusiness community together. This is one idea they have both said is \nterrific; let's move forward.\n  Finally, for the Record, I want to resubmit a letter from 40 \nGovernors--not 10, not 12, not Democratic Governors, not Republican \nGovernors. Mr. President, you were a Governor at one time, and a great \nleader, so you know it is not easy to get 40 signatures from the \nGovernors' Association of Democrats and Republicans who have said the \nsame thing.\n  I ask unanimous consent those letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Richard Gephardt,\n     Minority Leader,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle and Representatives Hastert \n     and Gephardt: The 106th Congress has an historic opportunity \n     to end this century with a major commitment to natural \n     resource conservation that will benefit future generations. \n     We encourage you to approve legislation this year that \n     reinvests a meaningful portion of the revenues from federal \n     outer continental shelf (OCS) oil and gas development in \n     coastal conservation and impact assistance, open space and \n     farmland preservation, federal, state and local parks and \n     recreation, and wildlife conservation, including endangered \n     species prevention, protection and recovery costs.\n       Since outer continental shelf revenues come from \n     nonrenewable resources, it makes sense to permanently \n     dedicate them to natural resource conservation rather than \n     dispersing them for general government purposes. Around the \n     nation, citizens have repeatedly affirmed their support for \n     conservation through numerous ballot initiatives and state \n     and local legislatioan. We applaud both the Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee and the House Resources Committee \n     for conducting a bipartisan and inclusive process that \n     recognizes the unique role of state and local governments in \n     preserving and protecting natural resources.\n       The legislation reported by the Committees should, to the \n     maximum extent possible, permanently appropriate these new \n     funds to the states, to be used in partnership with local \n     governments and non-profit organizations to implement these \n     various conservation initiatives. We urge the Congress to \n     give state and local governments maximum flexibility in \n     determining how to invest these funds. In this way, federal \n     funds can be tailored to complement state plans, priorities \n     and resources. State and local governments are in the best \n     position to apply these funds to necessary and unique \n     conservation efforts, such as preserving species, while \n     providing for the economic needs of communities. The \n     legislation should be neutral with regard to both existing \n     OCS moratoria and future offshore development, and should not \n     come at the expense of federally supported state programs.\n       We recognize that dedicating funds over a number of years \n     to any specific use is a difficult budgetary decision. \n     Nevertheless, we believe that the time is right to make this \n     major commitment to conservation along the lines outlined in \n     this letter.\n       We look forward to working with you to take advantage of \n     this unique opportunity and are available to help ensure that \n     this commitment is fiscally responsible. Thank you for your \n     consideration of these legislative principles as you proceed \n     to enact this important legislation.\n         Gov. John A. Kitzhaber, M.D., Oregon; Gov.

Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, I am writing in support of S. 25, the Conservation \n     and Reinvestment Act of 1999. The Chamber has long supported \n     the concept that the federal government should share a \n     portion of revenues from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) energy \n     production efforts with the coastal states that may be \n     affected by these activities.\n       S. 25 recognizes the contribution that states make to \n     national fuel production and reducing our nation's dependence \n     on foreign oil. It would direct more monies from leasing and \n     production activities to those states and communities that \n     shoulder the responsibility for energy development along; \n     their coastlines. It would provide local communities with \n     impact assistance funds to address infrastructure problems \n     and other public service needs associated with federal \n     offshore activities. It is a bipartisan conservation \n     legislation that would help promote a lasting legacy of \n     natural resource stewardship for future generations.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing more than three million businesses of \n     every size, sector, and region, applauds your efforts to help \n     remedy the disparity between states and the federal \n     government in offshore development and looks forward to \n     working with you to achieve this important goal.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say, as we \nget down to the final days of these negotiations, even though we do not \nhave a bill out of the Senate or out of the House, we do have a lot of \nlanguage that helps to show there is bipartisan support for this \neffort. I am hoping the\n\n[[Page S13928]]\n\nappropriators, who are at the negotiating table, will hear loudly and \nclearly from hundreds and thousands of individuals and groups that \nthere is a better way to spend this money.\n  We realize we do not have all we would like, but we would like the \nfinal product of this Interior bill to come out in a way that is \nreflective of the principles I have outlined--Federal/State \npartnership, coastal impact assistance, full funding for land and \nwater, historic preservation, and wildlife conservation, with current \nappropriated and authorized programs--not anything new, just something \na little better, a little different, a little improved.\n  As we are waiting for the final decisions of today and how we are \ngoing to proceed I wanted to take some time to have these documents \nprinted in the Record and to thank my colleagues on this side of the \naisle, particularly my senior Senator from Louisiana, for his tireless \nwork; particularly Chairman Murkowski for his terrific work on this \nissue as chairman of our committee; particularly the members of the \ncommittee, Senator Johnson, Senator Bayh, Senator Lincoln, and others; \nSenator Sessions, who has been a terrific supporter.\n  I thank them for their work on this bill and tell them we are moving \nforward. We are building support and building a bipartisan bill. Today \nwas good news when Chairman Young and the ranking member, George \nMiller, who had competing versions, came together and signed an \nagreement that is very reflective of what I think the American public \nwants us to do in this Congress.\n  We may not be able to get it all done this year, but we could make an \nimportant downpayment, a first step towards this historic conservation \nbill and leave a real legacy for our children and our grandchildren--\nnot just a 1-year appropriation but a real legacy, as this century \nends, of which we can all be proud and all share credit for something \nwell done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13928-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13928-S13929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to speak \nabout a subject which has been the topic of much political rhetoric in \nrecent days: Social Security. While there was a time when not all in \nCongress acknowledged this fact, Social Security's long-term solvency \nis crucial to today's and tomorrow's retirees. There has never been a \nmore successful Government program: Social Security has helped cut the \npoverty rate of older Americans by two-thirds. We must ensure this \nprogram will survive well into the 21st century.\n  The current dispute centers on which party is more committed to \npreservation of the Social Security program. I must say that I am \npersonally pleased to see this development, which reflects the fact \nthat Social Security is truly a consensus issue among the American \npeople. The current debate takes place in the confusing world of arcane \nbudgetary terminology and it is sometimes difficult to sort out. \nHowever, in evaluating the present-day claims and counterclaims, the \nhistoric record clearly shows that it is the Democratic Party which has \nconsistently fought to protect the program since its inception in the \nSocial Security Act of 1935. And though I could certainly be accused of \nbeing biased on the question, I believe that a close look will reveal \nunmistakably that Democratic proposals to save Social Security for \nfuture generations greatly surpass the recent efforts of my friends \nacross the aisle in laying claim to be the protectors of Social \nSecurity.\n  For example, let's look at the competing proposals to place a \n``lockbox'' around Social Security and see which one truly best \nprotects the benefits of tomorrow's recipients.\n  First, Democratic lockbox proposals establish a Social Security and \nMedicare lockbox that precludes any portion of the Social Security \nsurplus or any portion of the surplus reserved for Medicare to be used \nfor any purpose other than to strengthen and preserve these programs. \nOver the next 15 years, the Democratic lockbox would protect 100 \npercent of the Social Security surplus each year, and one-third of any \non-budget surplus for Medicare.\n  On the other hand, the Republican lockbox proposal does not reserve \nany of the projected surpluses for Medicare, nor does it extend the \nlife of the Social Security trust fund, which, under their proposals, \nwill be insolvent in 2034. Furthermore, in the absence of protections \nfor Medicare, this critical program is projected to be insolvent in \n2015. Perhaps most importantly, the Republican proposals include \nlanguage which creates a large potential loophole for the lockbox \nprotections. Specifically, if any legislation is designated as ``Social \nSecurity reform provisions''--regardless of whether such provisions \nhelp or hurt the interests of beneficiaries--lockbox surpluses would \nnot have to be used to pay benefits and could be used for tax cuts. \nFinally, the Republican lockbox proposal does not even require that \nsuch Social Security ``reform'' legislation extend the solvency of the \nSocial Security program. Is this meaningful, long-term protection for \nSocial Security?\n\n  Some on the other side have accused Democrats of raiding Social \nSecurity surpluses, yet the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office--\nwhose head was appointed by the Republican leadership--has determined \nthat spending bills supported by the congressional majority have \nalready tapped into the Social Security surplus by at least $13 \nbillion. In belated recognition of this fact, House Republicans have \nproposed a 1.4 percent across-the-board cut in the operating budgets of \nFederal agencies. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nam loath to take a step in the wrong direction just after we have \nrecently provided--on a bipartisan basis--the Department of Defense \nwith much-needed budget relief for both personnel and equipment costs.\n  But when we consider the impact of recent congressional proposals on \nthe future of Social Security we must look back no further than August \n1999 when the Republican majority pushed through Congress a tax cut \nthat, at the time, I labeled a ``convenient but fiscally irresponsible \nmeasure.'' This tax bill would have consumed virtually all of the \nprojected $1 trillion non-Social Security budget surplus over the next \n10 years, without setting aside any funds for Medicare solvency. The \ndirect revenue loss was estimated at $792 billion over that period, and \nwith the sharply diminished surplus, higher interest costs on the \nnational debt would bring the total to $964 billion. And the projected \n$1 trillion surplus itself is dependent on large cuts in national \ndefense, education, and other priority programs. If one only assumes \nthat these programs are held at their current levels, plus inflation, \nthe projected 10-year surplus falls from $1 trillion to $46 billion.\n  Clearly, enactment of this massive tax cut, which the President \nappropriately vetoed, would have vastly compromised and complicated our \nability to preserve Social Security and Medicare. No other action \nconsidered in this Congress comes even close to having this large a \nnegative impact on Social Security's future.\n  We can continue to attempt to ``one-up'' each other over who has the \nbetter plan to protect the existing Social Security trust fund. In \ntrying to set the record straight from my own viewpoint, I have spoken \ntoday from perhaps a partisan perspective. However, there is plenty of \nblame to go around for our joint failure in this session of Congress to \nuse the unique opportunity afforded by the long-sought end to massive \nFederal budget deficits to enact true Social Security reform to protect \nthe benefits of millions of future recipients. The millions of \nAmericans who depend on Social Security for themselves or their parents \nand grandparents, now and in the future, deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S13929]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13929-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 625\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have a unanimous-consent \nagreement now. I will read it carefully, and if there are any \nquestions, Senator Daschle may point them out. I believe it will be \nfair in the way it is going to be handled and will allow us to complete \nthis important legislation hopefully by Tuesday or not later than \nWednesday of next week. It will allow for, of course, relevant \namendments and second-degree amendments if any will be in order to \nthose, but it will limit the nonrelevant amendments to three on each \nside with an agreed-to time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader yield on that point for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand this agreement--I went through it in \ndetail--it will allow relevant second degrees to relevant amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ran into that hornet's nest yesterday. There are a couple \nrelevant amendments that are certainly worthwhile and actively \nsupported, but they also are very much opposed by others who want to \nsecond degree them. Clearly, that will be in order.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for working with me on this, since the middle \nof October actually. I believe this bill can be considered and \ncompleted. Bankruptcy reform is something we certainly want to do. I \nknow the minority leader has indicated his desire to have three \nnongermane amendments in order to the bill from Members of his side of \nthe aisle. Those are relative to East Timor, agriculture, and minimum \nwage. I hope all Members would allow us to adopt this agreement in \norder for the Senate to consider and approve this very important \nbankruptcy reform bill.\n\n  On our side, we will have three amendments, also, that relate to \neducation, drugs, and business costs. I will specify that in a moment.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to consideration \nof Calendar No. 109, S. 625, the bankruptcy bill, and following the \nreporting by the clerk, the committee amendments be immediately agreed \nto and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc.\n  I further ask consent that all first-degree amendments must be filed \nat the desk by 5 p.m. on the second day of the bill's consideration and \nthat all first-degree amendments must be relevant to the issue of \nbankruptcy, and/or truth in lending/credit card agreements, with the \nexception of three amendments to be offered by the minority, or his \ndesignee, relative to agriculture, minimum wage/taxes, and East Timor, \nand three amendments to be offered by the majority leader, or his \ndesignee, regarding education, drugs, and business costs.\n  I further ask consent that the 5 p.m. filing requirement apply to \neach of these nonrelevant amendments and there be a time limit of 2 \nhours equally divided on each nonrelevant amendment, with the exception \nof the agriculture and drug amendments on which there will be 4 hours \neach for debate, with no second-degree amendments in order to these six \nissues and no motions to commit or recommit in order.\n  I further ask consent that at 3 p.m. on Monday, November 8, the \nminority leader, or his designee, be recognized to offer the amendment \nrelative to the issue of minimum wage, and following the debate the \namendment be laid aside, and the majority leader, or his designee, be \nrecognized to offer the amendment relative to business costs, and that \nthe votes occur in relation to the amendments at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, \nNovember 9, with 1 hour equally divided prior to the vote for \nconcluding debate. I further ask consent that the first vote occur in \nrelation to the minority amendment, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the majority amendment, with 4 minutes prior to each vote \nfor explanation.\n  I further ask consent that following the disposition of all of the \nabove-described amendments, the bill be immediately advanced to third \nreading, that the Senate then proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. \n833, that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the \nSenate bill as amended be inserted, the bill be advanced to third \nreading, and a vote occur on passage of the bill, without any \nintervening action, motion or debate.\n  Further, I ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, and the Senate bill be placed back \non the calendar.\n  Finally, I ask consent that the exchange of the amendments by the two \nleaders on the two issues regarding minimum wage and business costs \noccur at noon on Friday. If by 3 p.m. either Member objects to the text \nof the amendments, this agreement be null and void and the bill be \nplaced back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, Mr. \nPresident, for the information of our colleagues, we have exchanged \nsome of the amendments that have been referred to in this unanimous-\nconsent request. There may be minor alterations in these two amendments \nthat have been exchanged. We will not have any major changes in our \namendments. And I assume that while there may be minor alterations, we \ndo not anticipate any consequential alterations in the amendments to be \noffered by the Republicans.\n\n  I ask the majority leader if that is his understanding relating to \neducation and drugs.\n  Mr. LOTT. First, let me clarify one error I made. Staff informs me I \ndid say: ``If by 3 p.m. any Member objects.'' It should say: ``If by 3 \np.m. either leader objects to the text of the amendments, this \nagreement be null and void and the bill be placed back on the \ncalendar.''\n  Now, under the Senator's reservation, Mr. President, responding to \nhis questions, obviously, on both sides--there may be minor changes \nthat you would want to make on your agriculture amendment or East \nTimor, whatever; same thing on this side. I think we have to continue \nto work in good faith. If it goes to fundamental substance, and changes \na major portion or the overall intent of the bill, I think that would \nbe exceeding the bounds of reasonableness. But if it is some technical \nchange or some minor change, we will have to continue to work with each \nother to get that done. I hope everybody will continue to be as \nflexible as they can be in that effort. But there is no intent to come \nback now and change the whole thrust of the bill. And that would not be \nfair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank all of the Senators involved in \nthis. We have consulted with virtually every Member. While no one is \never completely satisfied with a complex agreement such as this, I \nthink it gives us the best opportunity to address an important issue, \nbankruptcy, and to address some other issues about which both caucuses \ncare a good deal. So I think this is a good agreement. I appreciate the \nwork of the majority leader to get us to this point.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13929-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13929-S13930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope now that Members will remain tonight \nto do their opening statements. I see the distinguished chairman is \nhere, Senator Grassley from Iowa, who has probably asked me about this \nbill over 100 times this year. I apologize to him now for not having \ngotten it on the calendar and up for consideration before now. But he \nhas been dogged in his determination to address this very important \narea.\n  I say right up front we would not be having bankruptcy reform if it \nwere not for the diligent efforts and the patience and the \ndetermination and the substantive involvement of the Senator from Iowa. \nSo I think it is to his credit.\n  Now we need to move forward and get this bill completed, get it into \nconference, and hopefully act on it very quickly out of conference.\n  But since we do have this agreement now, and the manager is ready to \ngo--and I presume the manager on the Democratic side is ready to go--I \ncan announce now there will be no further votes this evening. The \nSenate will resume the bankruptcy bill at 9:30 a.m.\n\n[[Page S13930]]\n\non Friday. All Senators should be aware that votes could occur with \nrespect to the appropriations process or amendments to the bankruptcy \nbill on Friday.\n  Several Senators have been asking about exactly what we can expect \ntomorrow. I cannot say. If we have an appropriations conference report \nthat has been cleared that we are ready to move on, we will try to do \nit on a voice vote; but if we have to have a recorded voted, we just \nhave to have a recorded vote. If we are ever going to get to the final \ndays of the session, we have to be prepared to vote on Fridays and \nMondays, if that is necessary. So we cannot give any assurance at this \npoint that there will not be votes tomorrow. There very well may be.\n\n  Votes will occur at 5:30 Monday. And under this agreement, at least \ntwo votes will occur at 10:30 Tuesday.\n  Then, in conclusion, I wish to, again, thank all our colleagues for \ntheir cooperation this week. The fact that we did overwhelmingly pass \nthis very important trade bill involving the Caribbean Basin area, \nCentral America, and Africa, after a long period of time, is a \nsignificant and positive step for our country, I believe, not to \nmention the additional trading opportunities in other countries. And \nalso to have completed the conference report on the financial services \nmodernization--the second monumental achievement this week--I think the \nSenate, as a whole, can take a lot of pride. And now we are ready to \nbegin a third one. I wish every week could be as productive.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13930-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13930-S13967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BANKING REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we start this very important \nbankruptcy reform legislation, first, thanks for working out the \nnecessary parliamentary arrangements for bringing this bill up are owed \nto our majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, and our minority \nleader, the Democratic leader, the Senator from South Dakota. So I \nthank them very much.\n  Then secondly, not only because this bill is up now on the floor of \nthe Senate but also for the process of getting it through the Judiciary \nCommittee, we, obviously, thank the Senator from Utah, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, for his leadership at the level of \nthe committee and for a lot of things that had to be worked out to get \nus to the floor. And also thanks to the Senator from Vermont, the \nranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, for his \ncooperation.\n  Since the beginning of the year, I have had the opportunity to work \nwith the ranking minority member of our subcommittee that I chair, the \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli. Working with him has been a real \ntreat, always with efforts to reach agreement. And for people \nthroughout this country who have a tendency to be cynical about \nWashington, because of the lack of cooperation between the Democratic \nParty and the Republican Party, I wish they could feel the working \nrelationship Senator Torricelli, a Democrat, and I have had working on \nthis legislation from its original introduction, with his not agreeing \nto everything I\n\n[[Page S13962]]\n\nintroduced--he was a cosponsor--but with a spirit that throughout this \nprocess, which has gone on since January to this point of bringing the \nbill up on the floor of the Senate, that we would work cooperatively \nand in a spirit of cooperation to reach further compromises. I hope \nthat brings us to a point where we do not have a lot of controversial \namendments on the floor of the Senate, at least as they relate to the \nbankruptcy subject, the relevant amendments.\n  There will be a lot of amendments that have been in this bipartisan \nunanimous-consent agreement that are considered nongermane amendments, \nwhich will be brought up, that are controversial. We expected that to \nbe part of the process. But for the amendments we have that relate to \nbankruptcy, I think there will be a lot fewer amendments because of the \ncooperation Senator Torricelli has shown in this compromise.\n  For the second time in 2 years, the Senate is considering fundamental \nbankruptcy reform. Last year, we passed a bankruptcy reform bill but \nthe Senate was prevented from considering the final conference report \nat the very end of the 105th Congress. This year, we have the chance to \nfinish this important work. We've been waiting for some time to get \nthis bill up on the floor, and now that we're here, I'm anxious to \nbegin the debate.\n  Bankruptcy is one of the most complicated subjects we will consider \nthis year. So, at the outset, Mr. President, I think it's important for \nme as the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over \nbankruptcy to take a few minutes to describe what bankruptcy reform is \nreally all about in commonsense terms that we can all understand. \nSimply put, bankruptcy is a court proceeding where people get their \ndebts wiped away. Every time a debt is wiped away through bankruptcy \nsomebody loses money. That's plain and simple common sense. Of course, \nwhen somebody who extends credit has their obligation wiped away in \nbankruptcy, they are forced to make a decision. Should this loss simply \nbe swallowed as a cost of business? Or do you raise prices for other \ncustomers to make up for your losses?\n  When bankruptcy losses are rare or infrequent, lenders can just \nswallow the loss. But when bankruptcies are frequent and common, \nlenders have to raise their prices to offset losses. For this reason, \nTreasury Secretary Larry Summers testified at his confirmation hearing \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee that bankruptcies tend to drive up \ninterest rates. Mr. President, if you believe Secretary Summers, \nbankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular hardworking Americans have \nto pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of \nbankruptcies. The bankruptcy bill we're considering will discourage \nbankruptcies, and therefore lessen upward pressure on interest rates \nand higher prices by making it harder for people who can repay their \ndebts to wipe them away. It seems like common sense to require people \nwho can repay their debts to pull their own weight. But under our \ncurrent bankruptcy laws, someone can get full debt cancellation in \nchapter 7 with no questions asked. If we pass S. 625, bankruptcy judges \nand trustees will start asking questions about ability to repay. And, \nif someone seeking bankruptcy can repay, they will be channeled into \nChapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires people to repay some \nportion of their debts as a pre-condition for limited debt \ncancellation. Of course, people who can't repay can still use the \nbankruptcy system as they would have before. But, for people with \nhigher incomes who can repay their debts, the free ride will be over.\n  The basic bankruptcy policy question the Senate has to answer is \nthis: Should people with means be required to pay at least some of \ntheir debts under Chapter 13 or not? Right now, the current bankruptcy \nsystem is oblivious to the financial condition of someone asking to be \nexcused from paying his debts. The richest captain of industry could \nwalk into a Bankruptcy Court tomorrow and walk out with his debts \nerased. And, as I described earlier, the rest of America will pay \nhigher prices for goods and services as a result.\n  I would ask my colleagues to think about that for a second. If we had \nno bankruptcy system at all, and we were starting from scratch, would \nwe design a system that lets the rich walk away from their debts and \nshift the costs to society at large, including the poor and the middle \nclass? I don't think that any of us here would design such a system. \nBut somehow, that's exactly the system we have now. I could easily \nimagine the fiery rhetoric from our more liberal friends if we on the \nRepublican side were to even suggest that the Senate create a \nbankruptcy system that lets the wealthy and the well-to-do walk away \nfrom their debts and stick working Americans with the tab. But we have \njust such a system in place today.\n  Mr. President, if Senators ask themselves the question ``Who wins and \nwho loses under current law, and who will win and who will lose if we \npass S. 625,'' then I think that the importance of bankruptcy reform \nbecomes pretty obvious. If you believe President Clinton's own Treasury \nSecretary, society at large loses under the current system when \nbankruptcies drive up interest rates. Of course, it's the deadbeats who \nwalk away from their debts who win under the current system. If we pass \nthis bill, then the American people will win as upward pressure on \ninterest rates and prices is removed. And people who look at bankruptcy \nas a convenient financial planning tool will lose.\n\n  Mr. President, I think our situation is urgent. Our bankruptcy system \nis spiraling out of control. These are good times in our Nation. Thanks \nto the fiscal discipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of \nthe American people, we have the first balanced budget in a generation. \nUnemployment is low, we have a burgeoning stock market and most \nAmericans are optimistic about the future. But in the midst of such \nprosperity, about one and a half million Americans declared bankruptcy \njust in 1998. Based on filings for the first two quarters of 1999, it \nlooks like there will be just under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings for \nthis year. To put this in some historical context, since 1990 the rate \nof personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent. Now, I \ndon't think that anyone knows all the reasons underlying the bankruptcy \ncrisis. But I think I can talk about what's not at the root of the \nbankruptcy crisis. I have a chart here that shows the dramatic increase \nin bankruptcies since 1993. During the same timeframe, as the chart \nshows, unemployment has declined just as dramatically and real wages \nhave risen to an all-time high.\n  The economic numbers tell us that the bankruptcy crisis isn't the \nresult of people who can't get jobs. And the jobs that people do have \nare paying more than ever. So, the bankruptcy crisis isn't about \ndesperate people confronting layoffs and underemployment. With the \neconomy doing so well, and with so many Americans with high-quality, \ngood-paying jobs, we have to look deep into the eroding moral values of \nsome to find out what's driving the bankruptcy crisis. Some people flat \nout don't want to honor their obligations and are looking for an easy \nway out. In the opinion of this Senator, a significant part of the \nbankruptcy crisis is basically a moral crisis. Some people just don't \nhave a sense of personal responsibility.\n  It seems clear to me that our lax bankruptcy system must bear some of \nthe blame for the bankruptcy crisis. Just as the welfare system we used \nto have encouraged people not to get jobs and encouraged people not to \neven think about pulling their own weight, our lax bankruptcy system \ndoesn't even ask people to consider paying what they owe. Such a system \nobviously contributes to the fraying of the moral fiber of our Nation. \nWhy pay your bills when you can walk away with no questions asked? Why \nhonor your obligations when you can take the easy way out through \nbankruptcy? If we don't tighten the bankruptcy system, this moral \nerosion will certainly continue.\n  Mr. President, the polls are very clear that the American people want \nthe bankruptcy system tightened up. In my home State of Iowa, 78 \npercent of Iowans surveyed favor bankruptcy reform. And the picture is \nthe same nationally. According to the PBS program ``Techno-Politics,'' \nalmost 70 percent of Americans support bankruptcy reform. The American \npeople seem to sense that the bankruptcy crisis is fundamentally a \nmoral crisis. According\n\n[[Page S13963]]\n\nto a poll conducted by the Democratic polling firm of Penn & Schoen on \nperceptions of bankruptcy, 84 percent of Americans think that \nbankruptcy is more socially acceptable today than a few years ago. Of \ncourse, Penn & Schoen is a Democratic polling firm used by President \nClinton. So, I think that this number is very telling given that it was \nproduced by a liberal polling firm.\n  In my State of Iowa, the editorial page of the Des Moines Register \nhas summed up the problem we have with the bankruptcy system by stating \nthat bankruptcy ``was never intended as the one-stop, no-questions-\nasked solution to irresponsibility.'' I totally agree. So, let's look \nat the situation we face today. We have a bankruptcy system which \nfosters irresponsibility and which operates as a regressive system for \nredistributing economic resources from America's working families to \nthe wealthy. In effect, blue collar factory workers are paying the tab \nfor well-compensated professionals to live high on the hog.\n  Mr. President, as we move forward to debate bankruptcy reform, I \nbelieve that we must keep in mind the fact that the bankruptcy crisis \nis both an economic problem and moral problem. If we pass meaningful \nbankruptcy reform this year, as I hope and expect that we will, the \nSenate can remove a drag on the economy and at the same time contribute \nthe rebuilding of our Nation's moral foundations.\n  Mr. President, over 30 years ago, Senator Albert Gore, Sr.--the \nfather of the Vice-President--introduced a bill to means-test Chapter 7 \ndebtors. In his introductory statement, in words that still ring true \ntoday, he described the similarities between special tax loopholes and \nlax bankruptcy laws. Senator Gore said that bankruptcy is like a \nspecial interest tax loophole in that someone gets out of paying his \nfair share at the expense of hardworking Americans who play by the \nrules. I think that Senator Gore had it exactly right all the way back \nthen.\n\n  In the last Congress we almost closed the Chapter 7 loophole. The \nSenate and House both passed good bills, and we made them both better \nin a conference report that received overwhelming bipartisan support in \nthe other body. But we ran out of time in the Senate. I've made every \neffort to be fair and bipartisan throughout this process. When Senator \nTorricelli became my ranking member at the beginning of this year, I \nwent to him and asked him to work with me on a new bankruptcy bill. \nSenator Torricelli asked for several modifications to last year's \nbankruptcy bill to respond to concerns raised by Members on his side of \nthe aisle. I agree to make many of these changes. The means-test is \nmuch more flexible in this year's bill, giving judges greater \ndiscretion to consider the individual circumstances of each debtor. The \nbill contains much tougher penalties for using threats to coerce \ndebtors into paying debts which could be wiped away once they are in \nbankruptcy. The bill also requires the Justice Department to \nconcentrate law enforcement resources on enforcing consumer protection \nlaws against abusive debt collection practices, and allows State law \nenforcement to enforce State consumer protections in bankruptcy court. \nThe committee report lists these modifications in greater detail and \nsummarizes the major changes from last year's conference report. Mr. \nPresident, when all of these many changes are considered in a fair and \nreasonable way, I believe that it will be clear that a great majority \nof Senators can support S. 625 as it is right now. But there's more. \nThe Grassley-Torricelli amendment contains even more changes to ensure \nthat lower income Americans are not disadvantaged by this reform. A \nprovision to impose personal liability on debtor attorneys--which I \nstrongly suppport--has been removed. And the Grassley-Torricelli \namendment contains numerous changes to the small business title of the \nbankruptcy bill to add new flexibility.\n  Shortly, I will cosponsor an amendment with Senator Torricelli to \nrequire credit card companies to give consumers meaningful information \nabout minimum payments on credit cards. Consumers will be warned \nagainst making only minimum payments, and there will be an example to \ndrive this point home. Finally, consumers will be given a toll-free \nphone number to call where they can get information about how long it \nwill take to pay off their own credit card balances if they make only \nthe minimum payments. This new information will truly educate \nconsumers. This new information will improve the financial literacy of \nAmerican consumers.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, S. 625 was passed on a strong, bipartisan \nvote of 14-4. All Republicans and half of the Democrats voted for the \nbill. So, we have a good bill and one that most Members of the Senate \nshould be able to support at the end of the day. With so many consumer \nprotections and disclosures, I'm confident that the Senate will pass S. \n625 with strong support.\n  In addition to benefitting society at large, lessening upward \npressures on interest rates, S. 625 makes a number of changes which I \nbelieve will be very beneficial to especially vulnerable segments of \nour society. Child support claimants have been given the highest \npriority when the assets of a bankruptcy estate are distributed to \ncreditors. Bankruptcy trustees and creditors of bankrupts are required \nto give information about the location of deadbeat parents who owe \nchild support, turning our bankruptcy courts into a low cost locator \nservice for custodial parents. And finally, under S. 625 parents owning \nchild support can erase a wider array of debts than is typically the \ncase, thereby preventing private creditors from competing with child \nsupport claims in a post-bankruptcy environment. This is an important \npoint that I think everyone should realize. Under the Senate bill, \nchild support will never compete with private creditors after \nbankruptcy. This is a unique feature of this year's Senate bill, so \nmany Members may not be aware of it. I would ask Senators interested in \nchild support and bankruptcy to study section 314 of the bill.\n  S. 625 also makes Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code permanent. This \nmeans that America's family farms are guaranteed the ability to \nreorganize as our farm economy continues to be weak. As we all know \nfrom our recent debate on emergency farm aid, while prices have \nrebounded somewhat recently, farmers in my home State of Iowa and \nacross the Nation are getting some of the lowest prices ever for pork, \ncorn and soybeans. Clearly, this bill is an important step in \npreserving the integrity of our farming economy and preserving the \nfamily farm.\n  S. 625 contains changes to deal with the complex problem of \ninternational bankruptcies. S. 625 will speed up the Chapter 11 process \nfor small businesses and will reduce the risk of domino-like failures \nin financial markets.\n  In Conclusion, S. 625 is good for family farmers, good for small \nbusinesses, good for single parents who depend on child support and \ngood for consumers. If you care about making people in string financial \nshape pull their own weight, you should vote for this bill. If you care \nabout the lax morality associated with letting people who have the \nclear ability to pay walk away from their debts with no question asked, \nyou should vote for this bill. When the time comes, I'm sure that \ncommon sense will reign and the Senate will pass S. 625, with strong \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased we are finally considering the \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. I would like to express my personal \nappreciation to Senator Lott for his efforts, along with those of \nSenator Daschle, which resulted in this opportunity for floor \nconsideration of the bill. Also, I am grateful for the hard work of \nSenator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, along with \nSenator Torricelli, the ranking Member of the subcommittee, for their \ntireless efforts in working out this bipartisan bill. I also thank \nSenators Sessions, Biden, and others for their dedication and hard work \non this bankruptcy reform bill.\n  As I have said before, I remain confident that given the opportunity \nto consider the merits of this legislation, the Senate will pass this \nbill with overwhelming, bipartisan support. As we consider S. 625, I am \nhopeful that we will keep in mind the broad support for the substance \nof this important legislation. I hope we will see quick passage\n\n[[Page S13964]]\n\nof these much needed reforms to the bankruptcy system, because the \nreform proposals have been studied by Congress at length, they are \nbipartisan, and they are fair.\n  First, the reforms proposed in this bill have been deliberated at \nlength. Indeed, Congress has been engaged in the consideration of this \nissue for several years, and the Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts, which is chaired by Senator Grassley, has \nheld numerous hearings on the issue of bankruptcy reform. The \nsubcommittee heard extensive testimony from literally dozens of \nwitnesses on this subject.\n  Second, this bill is truly bipartisan. During our consideration of \nthis bill at both the subcommittee and full Judiciary Committee levels, \nnumerous changes suggested by the minority were included in the bill. \nWe have been able to reach a number of compromises on this legislation \nin order to respond to the concern of both parties. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to once again thank Senators Grassley and \nTorricelli for their bipartisan efforts to create this balanced bill.\n  Finally, this bill is fair. One of the principles that guided the \nauthors of our country's original bankruptcy laws, and which is guiding \nus as we overhaul these laws today, is the concept of a fresh \nstart. The bankruptcy system was designed to provide a fresh start to \npeople in serious financial difficulty, who have no other way out of \ntheir predicament. Mr. President, S. 625 does just that. It ensures \nthat people in the most serious financial difficulty will continue to \nhave access to the debt relief they need. At the same time, this \nlegislation ensures that more of the people who have the capacity to \nrepay their debts are required to do so.\n\n  Depending on what study you believe, anywhere from 6 to 15 percent of \nbankruptcy filers are using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool, \nrunning up debts and erasing them under laws that consider income \nirrelevant--all without any noticeable impact on their lifestyle. I \nwould doubt that any of my colleagues feel that these are the sort of \nfilers who need a fresh start. What they need is a lesson in personal \nresponsibility.\n  I believe that S.625 accomplishes both goals. The bill continues to \nmake bankruptcy an accessible option for those who truly need it. But, \nit makes it more difficult for spendthrifts--those people who have no \ndesire to change their excessive lifestyles and see bankruptcy as a \nconvenient way to erase their debts.\n  It is no secret that the current bankruptcy system is broken and that \nCongress must fix it to preserve the opportunity for those individuals \nin financial straits to obtain a ``fresh start.'' Despite this \ncountry's strong economy--unemployment is down and inflation is low--\nthe rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased dramatically. \nInstead of bankruptcy being a safety net, it has become for some a \nconvenient financial management tool.\n  I find it unacceptable and inherently unfair that those who pay their \nbills have to foot the bill for those who are able to pay, but choose \nnot to. It has been conservatively estimated that personal bankruptcies \ncost every household $400 per year, and it takes fifteen responsible \nborrowers to cover the cost of one bankruptcy of convenience.\n  The goal of our bankruptcy system has always been to protect those \nwho need protecting--to provide those who experience genuine and \nserious financial hardship the opportunity to wipe the slate clean. We \nmust return our system back to its original mission.\n  Bankruptcy reform is not a Republican or a Democratic issue--it is a \nconsumer issue. According to a recent poll, 76 percent of Americans \nbelieve that individuals should not be allowed to erase all their debts \nin bankruptcy if they are able to repay a portion of what they owe. \nThis survey merely reflects the American public's belief that \nindividuals should be responsible for their own actions. S. 625 helps \nremedy the glaring problems of today's bankruptcy system be creating a \nneeds-based system to determine the chapter under which a person should \nfile for bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, the House bankruptcy reform bill passed by an \noverwhelming margin of 313 to 108. Half of the House Democratic Caucus \njoined with every House Republican to support a bill with more \nstringent measures than those we are considering in the Senate.\n  S. 625 contains new measures to protect against fraud in bankruptcy, \nsuch as a requirement that debtors supply income tax return sand pay \nstubs, audits of bankruptcy cases, and limits on repeat bankruptcy \nfilings. It eliminates a number of loopholes, such as the one that \nallows debtors to transfer their interest in real property soothers who \nthen file for bankruptcy relief and invoke the automatic stay. And, it \nputs some controls on the ability of debtors get large case advances on \ntheir credit cards and to pay luxury goods on the eve of filing for \nbankruptcy.\n  At the same time, s. 625 provides many unprecedented new consumer \nprotections. It imposes penalties upon creditors who refuse to \nnegotiate in good faith with debtors prior to declaring bankruptcy. \nAlso, it imposes penalties on creditors who wilfullly fail to properly \ncredit payments made by the debtor in a chapter 13 plan, and for \ncreditors who threaten to file motions in order to coerce a \nreaffirmation without justification. Moreover, the bill imposes new \nmeasures to discourage abusive reaffirmation practices.\n  It also addresses the problem of bankruptcy mills, firms that \naggressively promote bankruptcy as a financial planning tool, and often \nend up hurting unwitting debtors by putting them in bankruptcy when it \nmay not be in their best interest. The legislation also imposes \npenalties on bankruptcy petition preparers who mislead debtors.\n  Importantly, S. 625 makes major strides in trying to break the cycle \nof indebtedness. It educates debtors with regard to the alternatives \navailable to them, sets up a financial management education pilot \nprogram for debtors, and requires credit counseling for debtors.\n  I am particularly proud that the bill makes extensive reform of the \nbankruptcy laws in order to protect our children. I have authored \nprovisions to ensure that bankruptcy cannot be used by deadbeat dads to \navoid paying child support and alimony. Under my provisions, the \nobligation to pay child support and alimony is moved to a first \npriority status, as opposed to its current place at seventh in line \nbehind attorneys fees and other special interests. My measures also \nensure the collection of child support and alimony payments by, among \nother things, exempting state child support collection authorities from \nthe ``automatic stay'' that otherwise prevents collection of debts \nafter a debtor files for bankruptcy, and by exempting from discharge \nvirtually all obligations one ex-spouse owes another.\n  S. 625 also includes a provision to create new legal protections for \na large class of retirement savings in bankruptcy. This measure has \nwidespread support from a long list of groups, ranging from the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons, to the Small Business Council \nof America and the National Council on Teacher Retirement.\n  Let me take this opportunity also to point out that the assets of \nsome pension plans already are protected from bankruptcy proceedings. \nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled in Patterson v. Shumate, \nreported at 504 U.S. 753 (1992), that assets of pension plans which \nhave, and are required by law to have, anti-alienation provisions, are \nexcluded from bankruptcy estates. Let me be clear that my amendment is \nintended to expand the protection of retirement savings to protect \nassets that were not previously protected. My amendment is not intended \nin any way to diminish the protections offered under existing law and \nunder the United States Supreme Court's decision in Patterson v. \nShumate, but, rather, is intended to provide protection to other \nretirement plans and accounts not currently protected.\n  I am proud to propose several enhancements to the bill that primarily \nare designed to protect consumers and further provide incentives for \nconsumers to take personal responsibility in dealing with debt \nmanagement.\n  In the area of domestic support, as I indicated earlier, Senator \nTorricelli and I intend to build upon the new legal protections we have \ncreated, as part of the underlying bill, for ex-spouses and children \nwho are owed\n\n[[Page S13965]]\n\nchild support and alimony. The changes will further strengthen the \nability of ex-spouses and children to collect the payments they are \nowed, and will make changes to a number of existing provisions in the \nbill to clarify that they will not directly or indirectly undermine the \ncollection of child support or alimony payments.\n  I must highlight just a few of these important enhancements: our \namendment prevents bankruptcy from holding up child custody and \ndomestic violence cases. It facilitates wage withholding to collect \nchild support from deadbeat parents. In addition, our amendment helps \navoid administrative roadblocks to get kids the support they need. It \nmakes staying current on child support a condition of discharge in \nbankruptcy. Also, our amendment makes the payment of child support \narrears a condition of plan confirmation. Finally, it allows for the \npayment of child support with interest by those with means.\n  In the area of debtor education, I have developed an amendment that \nwill protect from creditors contributions made to education IRAs and \nqualified state tuition savings programs for educational expenses. This \nis a significant protection for those who honestly put money away for \nthe benefit of their children and grandchildren's future schooling. The \npotential that education savings accounts will be abused in bankruptcy \nis addressed by the amendment's requirement that only contributions \nmade more than a year prior to bankruptcy are protected. I believe that \nprotecting educational savings accounts is particularly important \nbecause college savings accounts encourage families to save for \ncollege, thereby increasing access to higher education. Nationwide, \nthere are more than a million educational savings accounts, meaning \nthere are more than a million children who could potentially benefit \nfrom this amendment. As much as I believe that bankruptcy laws need to \nbe reformed to prevent abuse and to ensure debtors take personal \nresponsibility, the ability to use dedicated funds to pay the \neducational costs of children should not be jeopardized by the \nbankruptcy of their parents or grandparents.\n\n  I developed a debt counseling incentive provision, which builds on \nthe credit counseling provisions currently in S. 625. It removes any \ndisincentive for debtors to use credit counseling services by \nprohibiting credit counseling services from reporting to credit \nreporting agencies that an individual has received debt management or \ncredit counseling, and establishes a penalty for credit counseling \nservices that do. Debt management education is vital to reducing the \nnumber of Americans who, because of poor financial planning skills, are \nforced to declare bankruptcy. Providing credit counseling--instruction \nregarding personal financial management--to current and potential \nbankruptcy filers will help curb bankruptcy filings.\n  In addition, I intend to offer an amendment that is designed to curb \nfraud in bankruptcy filings. This amendment puts in place new \nprocedures and provides new resources to enhance of bankruptcy fraud \nlaws. It will require (1) that bankruptcy courts develop procedures for \nreferring suspected fraud to the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for \ninvestigation and prosecution and (2) that the Attorney General \ndesignate one Assistant U.S. Attorney and one FBI agent in each \njudicial district as having primary responsibility for investigating \nand prosecuting fraud in bankruptcy.\n  I also plan to offer an amendment that allows the victim of a crime \nof violence or drug trafficking offense to move the bankruptcy court to \ndismiss a voluntary petition filed by a debtor who was convicted of the \ncrime of violence or drug trafficking offense. To protect women and \nchildren who may be owed payments by such a debtor, however, the \namendment still allows the bankruptcy petition to continue if the \ndebtor can show that the filing of the petition is necessary to ensure \nhis ability to meet domestic support obligations. Bankruptcy is not an \nentitlement--it is a process by which certain qualifying individuals \nwith substantial debts may cancel their debts and obtain a ``fresh \nstart.'' Under this amendment, violent criminals and drug traffickers--\nindividuals who have chosen to engage in serious, criminal conduct--\nwould be precluded from availing themselves of the benefits of \nbankruptcy protection.\n  Mr. President, if we do not take the opportunity to reform our \nbankruptcy system, every family in my own State of Utah and throughout \nthe Country, many of whom struggle to make ends meet, will continue to \nbear the financial burden of those who take advantage of the system. \nLast year alone, approximately $45 billion in consumer debt was erased \nin personal bankruptcies. Losses of this magnitude are passed on the \nAmerican families at an estimated cost--if we use low estimates--of \n$400 for every household in American every year.\n  Rampant banckruptcy filings are a big problem. In 1998, 1.4 million \nAmericans filed for bankruptcy. That was more Americans than graduated \nfrom college. That was also more Americans than were on active military \nduty.\n  Not long ago, I received a letter from a long list of organizations, \nranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the National Ski and \nSnowboard Retailers Association, the American Sheep Industry \nAssociation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the National \nMulti-Housing Council. In the letter, they drove home the importance of \nthis legislation to small businesses. I would like to read a quote from \nthat letter:\n\n       Delay of this will . . . hurt America's small businesses--\n     the heart and soul of this nation. These hard-working \n     entrepreneurs, trying to live out their American dream, can \n     be financially devastated by one ``bankruptcy of \n     convenience''. Additionally, frivolous bankruptcy filings \n     force businesses to charge more for goods and services. This \n     is why small business owners throughout the country are \n     calling on Congress to repair our fundamentally flawed \n     bankruptcy system--they've waited long enough.\n\n  In closing, let me say I hope we can move through this bill in a \ntimely and orderly fashion. I hope Members who intend to offer \namendments do so sooner rather than later, so we may consider as many \namendments as we can and hopefully finish consideration of this bill by \nearly next week. I look forward to doing what I can to help Senators \nGrassley and Torricelli move this process along.\n  I do not think this is going to be difficult given the many \ncompromises already reached in this legislation. This bill is fair, \nbalanced, and long overdue.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent during \nconsideration of S. 625, the following staffers be extended the \nprivilege of the floor: Rene Augustine, Makan Delrahim, Kolan Davis, \nJohn McMickle, Kyle Sampson, and Leah Belaire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I again commend Senators Grassley and \nTorricelli for the great work they have done and all members on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee for having worked so hard to get this bill \nready for presentation today. I hope we can pass it quickly. With that, \nI end my remarks and turn the time over to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch, who made very \nimpressive remarks on this subject, for his leadership as chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. I particularly wish to express my appreciation \nto the Presiding Officer who has led this effort since I have been in \nthe Senate to reform our bankruptcy court system. Make no mistake about \nit, we are talking about a Federal court system that provides the \nability for individual Americans, who legitimately owe debts to people \nnot to pay their debts and to wipe those debts out.\n  This is a historic American principle. We have had bankruptcy courts. \nThey are referred to in the Constitution of the United States. They are \nuniquely and totally a Federal court procedure.\n  I think it is appropriate for us to make timely changes as the nature \nof our times in court change. We review what is happening and make sure \nour law is effective to accomplish the best and highest ideals of the \nAmerican people.\n  We last passed historic bankruptcy reform in 1978. We have not since \nthat time confronted the issue squarely and fundamentally and \ncomprehensively to see what is happening and see what we\n\n[[Page S13966]]\n\ncan do about it. Any Federal court system must be fair, it must be \ncoherent and logical, it must be commonsensical, and it must help us \nfurther our economic growth and vitality as a nation.\n  At the same time, any legal system we establish, as the Chair so \neloquently said, has a moral component. We need to make sure as a \nnation that our bankruptcy laws encourage the highest and best ideals \nof the American people. In fact, all laws should do that; particularly, \nI suggest, bankruptcy laws. We believe, as Americans, that people who \nget hopelessly in debt ought to be able to start over and not have \ntheir lives forever burdened by debts they could never repay. That is \nthe historic principle. We should not retreat from that, and certainly \nthis bill reflects no retreat from that.\n\n  But it is never a good thing to go into bankruptcy. It is an \nunfortunate event, when people reach a point in their lives when they \nare unable to pay a just debt they incurred because they got some \nbenefit from that debt. They borrowed money to buy a TV set; they \nborrowed money to buy a car; they borrowed money to take a trip. \nSomebody loaned them that money. The purpose of that loan was to have \nit repaid, and most people believe they ought to repay that debt. If \never in this country we believe that we do not have to pay debts, \nbecause it is inconvenient or difficult, we have a real problem because \nthe ability of honest and hard-working people to obtain loans is going \nto be much more difficult.\n  An individual citizen should pay his or her debt. It is possible--and \nwe made great progress, Mr. President, under your leadership--to create \na system that does allow people to start over. But at the same time, it \ndoes not reward those who lightly walk away from debts they have every \nability to repay either in whole or in part. Fundamentally, the way \nthis system works is very unusual, in many respects. If a person makes \na salary of $80,000 and if that person has a debt of $50,000 and that \nis the only debt they have, it may strike you they could easily pay it \noff in 2 or 3 years without a great deal of strain, perhaps. It may \nstrike Americans as strange to realize, regardless of their ability to \npay it off in relatively short order, they could walk into bankruptcy \ncourt, file under chapter 7, and wipe out that debt and not ever have \nto pay it. Some people do that and abuse the system.\n  I heard recently of an individual who made $35,000 a year, had a \n$1,500 debt, and filed for bankruptcy because he did not want to pay \nthat debt. That kind of thing happens in our court. That is an extreme \nexample, but there are less extreme examples of it on a routine basis. \nIf a person is able to pay back a part of their debt, why should they \nnot?\n  You say, well, it was for a hospital. Why should the hospital not get \npaid if he can pay some of his legitimate hospital bills? Why would we \nnot want them to do that? Why should we say to an honest person who \nstruggles to pay the hospital bill: You are just a chump; you are the \nclever guy, you went and got a lawyer, paid him $1,000, and he is going \nto wipe out your $3,000 debt to the hospital. If a person cannot pay \ntheir hospital bill, if they cannot pay their other bills, if their \nincome will not support it, then bankruptcy is for them. But there are \nabuses, I assure you, and they are quite common--too common, I suggest.\n  There is a strange tendency in the filings, whether you file under \nchapter 13 or chapter 7--as you know, when you file in chapter 7, you \nsimply offer up your assets, wipe out all your debts and walk away, \nnever to have to pay any of those debts again. If you file under \nchapter 13, the court will work with you and your attorney and develop \na repayment plan for all or a portion of that debt. They will stay the \ninterest that is accruing on the debts. They will say how much ought to \nbe paid to each creditor. They will keep those creditors from suing or \nfiling any harassment action against the person paying them off until \nthe debts are paid.\n\n  In my home State of Alabama, in Birmingham, which is where chapter 13 \npayments began quite a number of years ago, over half, maybe more than \n60 percent of the individual citizens, for some reason--for various \nreasons--have chosen to file under chapter 13 and pay back all or a \nportion of their debts. But in some of the larger urban areas of this \ncountry, that figure is even under 10 percent. Routinely, the lawyers \ncome in and advise their clients to file under chapter 7. They file \nunder chapter 7 and wipe out all their debts when many of those could \neasily pay them back.\n  There are some good reasons why people would want to file under \nchapter 13 and pay back a lot of the debts they owe. They will be able \nto have more self respect as individuals if they pay off their debts. \nIt stops the creditors from suing them, the phone calls, and the \nharassment that might come when you owe many different debts. You have \na better credit rating when you have paid off your debts, and you are \nable to keep certain items you might not be able to keep otherwise. \nThere are other advantages to filing chapter 13.\n  If a court were to decide, as they could under our new law, that you \nhave the ability to pay back and you are shifted to chapter 13, it is \nnot all bad. There are many reasons why a careful lawyer representing a \nclient would suggest chapter 13 is a good way to go.\n  So we have a system today that is very enticing to the irresponsible. \nWe have a system today that is driven by a lot of different factors. \nOne factor is the advertisements we see on television describing how to \navoid your debts.\n  People see those advertisements and then go to the attorneys who \nspecialize in bankruptcy. The attorneys tell them: You have these \ndebts, and the easy thing to do is file chapter 7; I will file your \nbankruptcy for $700, $1,000, and you will not have to pay any more \ndebts. You have to put everything you have on your credit card for the \nnext 3 months. Do not pay any bills; do not pay any of your payments on \nany of your notes; take that money and give it to me; set aside the \nrest of it; we will file bankruptcy and just wipe it all out.\n  That is what is happening in America today. People are induced to do \nthat.\n  I thought about it: Do they know? People get depressed and get \npanicky. They do not know what to do. People are suing them and \nthreatening them. They go to their lawyer and ask for advice. I am of \nthe opinion that at least a significant minority of those individuals \nwant to pay their debts, but for various reasons they are in trouble \nand unable.\n  I visited in my hometown of Mobile an outstanding institution, a \nnonprofit credit counseling agency. That agency meets with families who \nare in financial trouble. The people at this agency sit down with these \nfamilies and help them work out a budget. It helps the family members \nunderstand the consequences of spending. It helps them to set \npriorities on which debt to pay first. It helps them to set up a \nsavings plan. Sometimes they will even receive the check and pay \ncertain debts that are required and give the family a certain amount of \ncash to use for their weekly or monthly bills.\n  Normally, they call the credit card companies, the banks, and other \npeople who have claims against the family and negotiate a lower \ninterest rate. They are able to do that. Companies will do it. And the \nfamilies can pay off those debts in that fashion. It is highly \nsuccessful.\n  One of the main reasons for divorce in America today is financial \ndifficulty. That is a known fact. As a matter of fact, it is the main \nreason. These nonprofit agencies encourage people to undergo marital \ncounseling. A lot of people are in financial trouble because of \nalcoholism. Credit counseling or nonprofit agencies care about the \npeople who come before them and help them get alcoholism treatment or \nhelp them get into AA.\n  Many gamblers are in financial trouble. One member of the family \ngambles and has lost the money. This is a known fact. They get people \ninto Gamblers Anonymous and help save their family.\n  Maybe they need mental health treatment. They can oftentimes get them \ninto those treatment facilities. That kind of thing is healthy.\n  One of the things I suggested, something with which the chairman, \nSenator Grassley, and others on the committee agreed, is before you \nfile for bankruptcy, you have to contact a credit counseling agency and \ndiscuss with them the possibility of choosing an alternative to filing \nfor bankruptcy. The truth is, most people want to pay their debts. They \njust do not know how\n\n[[Page S13967]]\n\nto do it in a way that will be OK in light of the creditors pressing on \nthem.\n  We believe that can be a significant step forward in helping people \nin debt. They can be counseled by experts in money management on how to \nhandle their money and get out of debt on their own, how to maintain \ntheir self-respect and pride, and to actually pay off the debts.\n  If you get a loan from your brother-in-law or if you borrow money \nfrom the bank, you ought to pay it back if you can. This bill \nencourages that.\n\n  There are people with high incomes who are filing for bankruptcy \ntoday. We have heard the stories of young lawyers and young \nprofessionals who get a new car, have student loans and $5,000 or \n$6,000 in credit card bills, and the creditors are calling. They do not \nreally want to slow down. They can just file for bankruptcy and wipe \nout these debts. That is not right. We will be focusing on that.\n  It will not burden poor people. Credit counselors will have to be \napproved by the bankruptcy court. They will be nonprofit individuals \nwho will be audited on a regular basis. These are the steps I believe \nwill encourge people to avoid filing bankruptcy.\n  This bill will be a major step forward for families who are entitled \nto child support and alimony. They will be moved to the top of the \npriority list. It will be a great step forward for them. Child support \nand alimony will be improved.\n  A bankruptcy system for farmers that is adjusted to their unique \nproblems will be enhanced and made permanent by this legislation. \nSenator Grassley has been a champion of those issues for many years, \nand he has achieved that again in this bill. We will make it permanent \nwith this bill.\n  I respect the work the Senator from Iowa is doing. This is a good \npiece of legislation. It calls on individuals to pay what they can. It \nallows judges to consider the circumstances involved before an order is \ngiven. It will improve the respect businesses and Americans have for \nbankruptcy if they know it is not being abused as it is today. We can \nstop it, and we can do better. This bill will do that.\n  There are loopholes that good lawyers have learned to exploit. I do \nnot blame the lawyers for it. If we have it in the law of Congress that \nsays this is appropriate, they are going to use it to the benefit of \ntheir clients.\n  We had a circumstance in which a tenant's 1-year lease had expired. \nHe had not paid his debts. The landlord wanted to evict him. He filed \nfor bankruptcy. People are filing all over America and getting a stay \nof legal action, causing the landlord to hire a lawyer and wait several \nmore months before he can get the person removed from the premises. \nMaybe he never intended to lease it for more than 1 year anyway. Maybe \nhe had another tenant to take the place after 12 months. That person, \nthrough abuse of the bankruptcy system, could do that. That is very \ncommon in America.\n  Many of these problems are being addressed. I know the chairman \nbelieves strongly that creditors ought not have lawyers go down to \ncourt all the time. The bill allows you to represent yourself, if you \nchoose, in bankruptcy court under many circumstances.\n  This legislation will improve the system of law in Federal courts. It \nwill have a more just result. It will stop individuals who are able to \npay back all or a portion of their debts from walking into court and \nwiping out their debts. This bill will stop that.\n  For people in serious debt who fall below the median income of \nAmerica, they will be able to choose chapter 7 or 13. But for those \nwith higher incomes, if they have the ability to pay the debts, we \nthink this bill will make them do so, or at least a portion of what \nthey owe, if the judge so orders. It is a step in the right direction.\n\n  I am proud to serve on the subcommittee which Senator Grassley \nchairs. This bill is a step forward for our courts. I hope as we move \nforward we will have the support we had previously. It passed in this \nbody last year with 94 out of 100 votes. It is essentially the same \nbill. It passed in our committee by a vote of 14-4. It passed the House \nwith 303 votes to 100. It is a popular bill. It has broad bipartisan \nsupport. It has dragged on for far too long. It is time for us to see \nit to conclusion.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership, determination, and \npersistence in driving this bill to a successful conclusion.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to ensure that seniors are given an opportunity to serve as \nmentors, tutors, and volunteers for certain programs; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n          THE SENIORS AS VOLUNTEERS IN OUR SCHOOLS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Seniors As \nVolunteers in Our Schools Act of 1999,'' a bill which will be an \nimportant step in ensuring that our schools provide a safe and caring \nplace for our children to learn and grow. This bill will help build \nlasting partnerships between our local school systems, our children and \nour country's growing number of senior citizens.\n  Under the bill, school administrators and teachers are encouraged to \nuse qualified seniors as volunteers in federally funded programs and \nactivities authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n(ESEA.) It specifically encourages the use of seniors as volunteers in \nthe safe and drug free schools programs, Indian education programs, the \n21st Century Community before- and after-school programs and gifted and \ntalented programs. I believe the best way to get older Americans to \nserve as volunteers is to ask them. My bill does just that.\n  The Seniors as Volunteers in Our Schools Act creates no new programs; \nrather it suggests another allowable use of funds already allocated. \nThe discretion whether to take advantage of this new resource continues \nto remain solely with the school systems.\n  Studies show that consistent guidance by a mentor or caring adult can \nhelp reduce teenage pregnancy, substance abuse and youth violence. \nEvidence also shows that the presence of adults on playgrounds, and in \nhallways and study halls, stabilizes the learning environment. And \nrecently, the Colorado School Safety Summit, convened by Governor Bill \nOwens, recommended connecting each child to a caring adult as a way to \nreduce youth violence.\n  Our country is in the midst of an age revolution. There are twice as \nmany older adults today as there were 30 years ago. America now \npossesses not only the largest, but also the healthiest, best-educated, \nand most vigorous group of seniors in history.\n  In the years ahead, an increasing number of us will be living decades \nlonger than our own parents and grandparents. We need to think of those \nextra years of life as a resource. I believe seniors can be role models \nand share the wisdom, experience, and skills they have acquired over a \nlifetime of learning.\n  I know firsthand of the importance of mentoring based on my own \nexperiences as a teacher. A mentor can have a profound positive impact \non a child's life.\n  What better way to expand the number of mentors than to invite our \nseniors/elders to volunteer in schools? What better way to make our \nschools safer for our children than to have more adults visibly \ninvolved?\n  I do not expect this legislation to solve all the problems \nconfronting our schools today. But, I see it as a practical way to help \nmake our schools safer, more caring places for our children. If our \ninstitutions create opportunities that allow them to make a genuine \ncontribution, I believe America's growing senior population can play an \nimportant role in supporting our nations' schools. And, older adults \nhave what the working-age population lacks: time.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto contracts with the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District, Utah, \nto use Weber Basin Project facilities for the impounding, storage, and \ncarriage of nonproject water for domestic, municipal, industrial, and \nother beneficial purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n     the use of weber basin project facilities for nonproject water\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to take a step in \naddressing the long-term water needs of Summit County, Utah. The bill I \nam introducing today authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto contracts with the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District. This \nlegislation would permit non-federal water intended for domestic, \nmunicipal, industrial, and other uses to utilize federal facilities of \nthe original Weber Basin Project for various purposes such as storage \nand transportation.\n  In this case, the Smith Morehouse Dam and Reservoir was constructed \nby the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District in the early 1980's using \nlocal funding resources in order to create a supply of non-federal \nproject water. However, it has been determined that there is currently \na need to deliver approximately 5,000 acre feet of this non-federal \nSmith Morehouse water in conjunction with approximately 5,000 acre feet \nof federal Weber Basin project water to the Snyderville Basin area of \nSummit County, Utah and to Park City, Utah.\n  In 1996, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District entered into a \nMemorandum of Understanding and Agreement to deliver this water \napproximately 14 miles from Weber Basin Weber River sources within a \ncertain time frame and dependent upon the execution of an Interlocal \nAgreement with Park City and Summit County. The Warren Act requires \nthat legislation be enacted to enable the District to move ahead with \nthis agreement with Summit County and Park City to deliver the water \nutilizing built Weber Basin Project facilities built by the Bureau of \nReclamation.\n  There is an immediate need for the delivery of water to this area. \nThe Utah State Engineer halted the approval of new groundwater \ndevelopments in the area last year. At the same time, Summit county is \nexperiencing tremendous growth; in fact it is one of the highest growth \nareas in the state. The areas to be served are within the area taxed by \nthe Weber Basin District, and there is a definite need for a public \nentity to build a project to supply an adequate, reliable, and cost \neffective water delivery project to meet the future demands of this \narea.\n  Since there is precedent allowing the wheeling of non-federal water \nthrough federal facilities, my colleagues should realize that this is a \nnon-controversial piece of legislation. Therefore, I hope that Congress \nwill move quickly to pass this legislation next session and I look \nforward to working closely with my colleagues on the Energy Committee \nto move it quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1854. A bill to reform the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust \nImprovements Act of 1976; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1999. I also am pleased to \nnote that joining with me in sponsoring this important bipartisan \nlegislation are Senators DeWine and Kohl the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Antitrust, Business Rights and Competition Subcommittee \nof the Committee on the Judiciary. I thank my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle for their efforts and cooperation in working to craft this \nbalanced reform measure which is long overdue.\n  The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires \ncompanies contemplating a merger of acquisition to file a premerger \nnotification with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice \nor the Federal Trade Commission if the size of the companies and the \nsize of the proposed transaction are greater than certain\n\n[[Page S13974]]\n\nmonetary thresholds. These monetary thresholds have not been changed--\neven for inflation--since the legislation was originally enacted in \n1976, over 23 years ago. When the statute was first enacted, Congress \nintended to limit the scope of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to very large \ncompanies involved in very large transactions. At that time, the House \nJudiciary Committee reported that the statute would apply ``only to the \nlargest 150 mergers annually: These are the most likely to \n`substantially lessen competition'--the legal standard of the Clayton \nact.'' However, because the monetary thresholds in the statute have \nnever been updated, nearly 5,000 transactions were reported.\n  Because these monetary thresholds have not been kept current, \ncompanies frequently are required to notify the Antitrust Division and \nthe FTC of proposed transactions that do not raise competitive issues. \nAs a result, the agencies are required to expend valuable resources \nperforming needless reviews of transactions that were never intended to \nbe reviewed. In short, current law unnecessarily imposes a costly \nregulatory and financial burden upon companies, particularly upon small \nbusinesses, as well as a sizable drain on the resources of the \nagencies. Because of the unnecessarily low monetary thresholds, the \ncurrent Act simply fails to reflect the true economic impact of mergers \nand acquisitions in today's economy.\n  In addition, after a premerger notification is filed, the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Act imposes a 30-day waiting period during which the proposed \ntransaction may not close and the Antitrust Division or the FTC \nconducts an antitrust investigation. Prior to the expiration of this \nwaiting period, the agency investigating the transaction may make a \n``second request''--a demand for additional information or documentary \nmaterial that is relevant to the proposed transaction. Unfortunately, \nmany second requests require the production of an enormous volume of \nmaterials, many of which are unnecessary for even the most \ncomprehensive merger review. Complying with such second requests has \nbecome very burdensome, often costing companies in excess of $1 million \nto comply. Second requests also extend the waiting period for an \nadditional 20 days, a period of time which does not begin to run until \nthe agencies have determined that the transacting companies have \n``substantially complied'' with the second request. This procedure \nresults in many lawful transactions being unnecessarily delayed for \nextended periods of time.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing today will \ncorrect these problems with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. First, the \nlegislation increases the size-of-transaction threshold from $15 \nmillion to $35 million, effectively exempting from the Act's \nnotification requirement mergers and acquisitions that, based on the \nFTC's data, do not pose any competitive concerns. Such mergers make up \nat least one-third of transactions reported in 1999. Therefore, this \nmodest legislation provides significant regulatory and financial relief \nfor small- and medium-sized companies. In addition, the legislation \nindexes the threshold for inflation, so that the problem of an \nexpanding economy outgrowing the statute's monetary threshold will not \nrecur.\n  In addition to providing regulatory and financial relief for \ncompanies, another purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the \nAntitrust Division and the FTC efficiently allocate their finite \nresources to those transactions that truly deserve antitrust scrutiny. \nTo ensure budget neutrality, the legislation adjusts the amount of the \nfiling fee that parties must submit with their notification: For \ntransactions valued between $35 million and $100 million, the filing \nfee remains unchanged at $45,000; for transactions valued at more than \n$100 million, the filing fee is increased to $100,000. I have worked \nwith the business community to ensure that this filing fee adjustment \nis fair by imposing a higher fee on transactions which likely will \nrequire more of the agencies' resources to review. Although I would \nprefer that the filing fees be eliminated completely, in the interest \nof seeing the reforms in this bill become law, this legislation does \nnot include such a measure.\n  Second, this legislation reforms the second request process by \nlimiting the scope of the information and documents that the agencies \nmay require transacting companies to produce. Under this legislation, \nsecond requests must be limited to information that (1) is not \nunreasonably cumulative or duplicative and (2) does not impose a cost \nor burden on the transacting parties that substantially outweighs any \nbenefit to the agencies in conducting their antitrust review. If a \ncompany believes that the second request does not meet this standard, \nthen that company may petition a United States magistrate judge for \nreview of the second request. Similarly, if the company produces \ninformation and documents pursuant to a second request, but the agency \ndetermines that the company has not ``substantially compiled'' with the \nrequest, then the company also may petition the magistrate judge for a \ndetermination on substantial compliance. To ensure that proposed \ntransactions are not unreasonably delayed, the bill provides deadlines \nby which the agency must notify a company of its failure to comply with \na second request and also imposes certain controls, so that the process \nis not tied up in litigation by either the transacting party or the \ngovernment.\n  Finally, this legislation requires that the Antitrust Division and \nthe FTC jointly report to Congress annually regarding the second \nrequest process and jointly publish guidelines on how companies can \ncomply with second requests.\n  Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today sets forth \nreforms to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that are long overdue. It provides \nsignificant regulatory and financial relief for businesses, while \nensuring that transactions that truly deserve antitrust scrutiny will \ncontinue to be reviewed. As this bill moves through the legislative \nprocess, I remain willing to address any concerns any of my colleagues \nmay have, and look forward to working with the Administration to see \nthat this proposed legislation becomes law, thereby providing relief \nfor small business that is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1999.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the Hart-Scott-\nRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1999 and to commend Chairman Hatch \nfor his efforts on this legislation. This measure would amend the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Act and make several changes to enhance the merger review \nprocess undertaken by the Antitrust Division of the Department of \nJustice and the Federal Trade Commission. We believe that reforms to \nthis statute are long overdue--the threshold hasn't been changed since \nthe statute's enactment in 1976--but we also view the proposals in this \nlegislation as a starting point, and not necessarily the last word on \nthis subject.\n  The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is crucial to the enforcement of \ncompetition policy in today's economy--it ensure that the antitrust \nagencies have sufficient time to review mergers and acquisitions prior \nto their completion. The statute requires that, prior to consummating a \nmerger or acquisition of a certain minimum size, the companies involved \nmust formally notify the antitrust agencies and must provide certain \ninformation regarding the proposed transaction. For those transactions \ncovered by the Act, the parties to a merger or acquisition may not \nclose their transaction until the expiration of a thirty day waiting \nperiod after making their Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing. This waiting \nperiod may be extended by the antitrust agencies requesting additional \ninformation from the parties to the transaction in which case, under \ncurrent law, the parties may not complete the deal until twenty days \nafter supplying the government with the requested information.\n  While this statute has a very laudable purpose, especially with the \ntremendous numbers of mergers and acquisitions taking place in recent \nyears, some of its provisions are in need of revision. Most \nimportantly, while inflation has caused the value of a dollar to drop \nby more than a half in the past 25 years, the monetary test that \nsubjects a transaction to the provisions of the statute has not been \nrevised since the law's enactment in 1976. As a result, many \ntransactions that are of a relatively small size and pose little \nantitrust concerns are nevertheless swept\n\n[[Page S13975]]\n\ninto the ambit of the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process. This \nlegislation would raise the size of transaction covered by the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Act from $15 million to $35 million. This will both lessen \nthe agencies' burden of reviewing small transactions unlikely to \nseriously affect competition and enable the agencies to allocate their \nresources to properly focus on those transactions most worthy of \nscrutiny. Further, exempting smaller transactions from the Hart-Scott-\nRodino process will significantly lessen regulatory burdens and \nexpenses imposed on small businesses. The parties to these smaller \ntransactions will no longer need to pay the $45,000 filing fee--or face \nthe often even more onerous legal fees and other expenses typically \nincurred in preparing a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing--for mergers and \nacquisitions that usually don't pose any competitive concerns.\n  In exempting this class of transactions from Hart-Scott-Rodino \nreview, however, it is important that we not cause the antitrust \nagencies to lose the funding they need to carry out their increasingly \ndemanding mission of enforcing the nation's antitrust laws. Therefore, \nwe have attempted to ensure that our measure is revenue-neutral--\nindeed, it would raise filing fees for transactions valued at over \n$100,000,000, which makes sense because these transactions require more \nscrutiny. In considering this legislation, of course, we will need to \ncarefully study the budgetary implications of this reform to ensure \nthat our goal of revenue-neutrality has been met. As this measure moves \nforward, however, we ought to consider whether bigger deals of, say, $1 \nbillion or $10 billion and over should require higher fees.\n  This legislation makes other changes designed to enhance the \nefficiency of the pre-merger review process. The waiting period has \nbeen extended from twenty to thirty days after the parties' compliance \nwith the government's request for additional information, a more \nrealistic waiting period in this era of increasingly complex mergers \ngenerating enormous amounts of relevant information and documents. As \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a deadline for action \noccurs on a weekend or holiday, the deadline is extended to the next \nbusiness day. This simple provision will eliminate gamesmanship by \nparties who currently may time their compliance so that the waiting \nperiod ends on a weekend or holiday, effectively shortening the waiting \nperiod to the previous business day.\n\n  Mr. President, some have expressed concerns regarding the \ndifficulties and expense imposed on business in complying with \nallegedly overly burdensome or duplicative government requests for \nadditional information. So we believe that it is reasonable to consider \nmethods to prevent abuse of this process by overbroad or unreasonable \nrequests. Therefore, this legislation includes provisions to amend the \nstatute to add a right of appeal to a U.S. Magistrate Judge to \nadjudicate disputes regarding the propriety of government requests for \nadditional information. We have not reached any final conclusions \nregarding the wisdom of these provisions; they are certainly worth \n``floating'' as ideas, and the process will determine if they should be \nincluded as part of a final product. Further, we should keep in mind \nthat if this right of appeal provision is enacted it will impose \nsignificant additional litigation burdens on the antitrust agencies \nwhich might require a corresponding increase in funding for these \nagencies. Our goal, again, is to improve the functioning of the pre-\nmerger review system which is so vital to antitrust enforcement and, in \nthat context, this provision deserves at least a supportive ``look.''\n  Mr. President, let me make one additional point. We recognize that \nall will not agree with the necessity or efficacy of all of these \nreform proposals. We are, of course, willing to consider any \nmodification to this legislation that will advance our goals of a more \nefficient merger review process. But virtually everyone agrees that \nHart-Scott-Rodino needs to be updated and we're pleased that this \nmeasure moves us forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1855. A bill to establish age limitations for airmen; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    the airline pilot retirement age\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nattempts to diminish the scope of a problem that is facing our air \ntransport industry, namely a critical shortage of pilots. The pilot \nshortage is starting to have effects in many rural states.\n  In response to this problem. I am today introducing a bill that would \nrepeal the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rule which now \nrequires pilots who fly under Part 121 to retire at ago 60. Under my \nlegislation, pilots in excellent health would be allowed to continue to \npilot commercial airliners until their 65th birthday.\n  The Age 60 rule was instituted 40 years ago when commercial jets were \nfirst entering service. The rule was established without the benefit of \nmedical or scientific studies or public comment. The most recent study, \nthe results of which were released in 1993, examined the correlation \nbetween age and accident rate as pilots approach 60. That study found \nno increase in accidents.\n  The FAA contends that although science does not dictate retirement at \nthe age of 60, it is the age range when sharp increases in disease \nmortality and morbidity occur. In FAA's view it is too risky to allow \nolder pilots to fly the largest aircraft, carrying the greatest number \nof passengers over the longest non-stop distances, in the highest \ndensity traffic.\n  However, 44 countries worldwide have relaxed then age 60 rule within \nthe last ten years primarily because the pilot shortage is a worldwide \nphenomenon. Many of these air carriers currently fly into U.S. \nairspace.\n  One of the ways carriers are attempting to adapt to the shortage is \nto lower their flight time requirements. In my view, this is a risk \nfactor the FAA should be concerned about.\n  How did this shortage occur? The reason is simple: There has been an \nexplosive growth of the major airlines worldwide, and there's a \nshortage of military pilots who used to feed the system. In addition, \nthere is an aging pilot pool that must retire at age 60.\n  Add to this domino effect the decline in the number of people \nlearning to fly, due primarily to the cost, and the pool of available \npilots has shrunk.\n  The shortage acutely affects my home state of Alaska because we \ndepend on air transport far more than any other state. Rural residents \nin Alaska have  no way out other than by air service. There are no \nrural routes, state or interstate highways serving most rural residents \nin Alaska and the airplane for many of them is their lifeline to the \noutside world.\n\n  The pilot shortage has left Alaskan carriers scrambling for pilots. \nAlaska's carriers must hire from the available pilot pool in the lower \n48. Many of these pilots view flying in Alaska as a stepping stone that \nallows them to build up flight time. Although they get great flying \nexperience in my home state, in nearly all instances when a pilot gets \na higher-pay job offer with a larger carrier in the lower 48, he leaves \nAlaska.\n  According to the Alaska Air Carriers Association, raising the \nretirement age to 65 will help alleviate the shortage and keep \nexperienced pilots flying and serving rural Alaskans.\n  Mr. President, I would note that what is happening across the country \nis that the major carriers are luring pilots from commuter airlines, \nwho in turn recruit from the air charter and corporate industry, who in \nturn hire flight instructors, agriculture pilots, etc. Which leaves \nrural carriers strapped. The big fish are feeding off the little ones.\n  Small carriers simply cannot compete with the salaries, benefits and \ntraining costs of the major carriers. They simply do not have the \nfinancial resources.\n  According to figures provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, \nthere were 694,000 pilots in 1988 and 616,342 in 1997. Within that \nnumber, private pilot certificates fell from approximately 300,000 in \n1988 to 247,604 in 1997. Commercial certificates, like air taxi and \nsmall commuter pilots, fell from 143,000 in 1988 to 125,300 in 1997. \nThe number of total pilots in Alaska fell from more than 10,000 in 1988 \nto approximately 8,700 in 1997.\n  However, light is beginning to show at the end of the tunnel.\n\n[[Page S13976]]\n\n  Organizations such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association \n(AOPA) and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) have \nbeen monitoring this shortage for some time and have stepped up to the \nplate to get people interested in flying. AOPA has started a pilot \nmentoring program in 1994 and approximately 30,000 have entered the \nprogram. GAMA's ``Be a Pilot'' program is starting to bring more \npotential pilots into flight training.\n  Even the Air Force is starting to institute new programs to keep \npilots.\n  In Alaska, as a result of a precedent-setting program involving Yute \nAir, the Association of Village Council Presidents, the University of \nAlaska, Anchorage, Aero Tech Flight Service, Inc., and the FAA, a \nprogram was developed to train rural Alaska Natives to fly. Seven are \non their way to pilot careers.\n  Also, the number of students working on pilot licenses at the \nUniversity's Flight Technology program has almost doubled in two years.\n  It is my hope that the shortage has hit rock bottom. But even so, it \nwill take years before a cadre of qualified pilots is ready to take to \nthe friendly skies.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to wrestle with this \nproblem. As long as a pilot can pass the rigorous medical exam, he or \nshe should be allowed to fly. Air service is critical to keep commerce \nalive, especially in rural states.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1855\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AGE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     beginning on the date that is 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act--\n       (1) section 121.383(c) of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, shall not apply;\n       (2) no certificate holder may use the services of any \n     person as a pilot on an airplane engaged in operations under \n     part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, if that \n     person is 65 years of age or older; and\n       (3) no person may serve as a pilot on an airplane engaged \n     in operations under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, if that person is 65 years of age or older.\n       (b) Certificate Holder.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``certificate holder'' means a holder of a certificate \n     to operate as an air carrier or commercial operator issued by \n     the Federal Aviation Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1857. A bill to provide for conveyance of certain Navajo Nation \nlands located in northwestern New Mexico and to resolve conflicts among \nthe members of such Nation who hold interests in allotments on such \nlands; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be \nintroducing the Bisti PRLA Dispute Resolution Act, which will resolve a \nconflict regarding coal mining leases in New Mexico. A coal company and \nthe Navajo Nation have been deadlocked within the Department of \nInterior appeals process regarding preference right lease applications \n(PRLAs) in the Bisti region of northwestern New Mexico. When enacted, \nthis legislation will resolve a complex set of issues arising from \nlegal rights the Arch Coal Company acquired in federal lands, which are \nnow situated among lands which constitute tribal property and the \nallotments of members of the Navajo Nation. Both the company and the \nNation support this legislation to resolve the situation.\n  There are many reasons the solution embodied in this bill achieves \nbroad benefits to the interested parties and the public. It will allow \nthe Navajo Nation to complete the land selections that were made in \n1981 to promote tribal member resettlement following the partition of \nlands in Arizona. It also guarantees that Arch Coal, Inc. will be \ncompensated for the economic value of its coal reserves. An independent \npanel will make recommendations to the Secretary of Interior regarding \nthe fair market value of the coal reserves, gives the company bidding \nrights, protects a state's financial interest in its share of federal \nMineral Leasing Act payments, and allows the Navajo Nation full fee \nownership in their lands.\n  The Secretary of Interior will issue a certificate of bidding rights \nto Arch Coal upon relinquishment of its interests in the PLRAs. The \namount of that certificate will equal the fair market value of the coal \nreserves as defined by the Department of Interior's regulations. A \npanel consisting of representatives of the Department of Interior, Arch \nCoal, and the Governors of Wyoming and New Mexico will help determine \nfair market value. While the Interior Department is authorized to \nexchange PRLAs for bidding rights, the Department has not done so, \nlargely because of the difficulty it perceives in determining the fair \nmarket value of the coal reserves. The panel method in this legislation \nwill promote the objectivity of that process.\n  Upon the relinquishment of the PRLAs and the issuance of a \ncertificate of bidding rights, the Department of Interior will execute \npatents to the Navajo Nation of the selected lands encompassed by the \nPRLAs. This is a win-win situation for all parties involved; is \nendorsed by the affected parties, and is a fair resolution to this on-\ngoing problem. I hope for prompt action on this legislation early next \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 1858. A bill to revitalize the international competitiveness of \nthe United States-flag maritime industry through tax relief; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n         The National Security Sealift Enhancement Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce tax reform \nlegislation that is long overdue in the effort to revitalize the \nnation's fourth arm of defense, the United States flag merchant marine. \nMy bill, the National Security Sealift Enhancement Act of 1999, would \nprovide targeted tax relief to enable the United States-flag oceangoing \ncommercial fleet to better compete with foreign-flag commercial fleets \nregistered in nations that have exempted companies from taxes.\n  Currently, United States companies operating U.S.-flag vessels, and \nforeign-flag vessels operating under the application of national laws \nsuch as Japan or France, are forced to compete against companies that \noperate vessels under flag-of-convenience registries. Flag-of-\nconvenience shipping registries operate under the legal authority of \nnations such as Panama, Liberia, Vanuatu, or the Marshall Islands, and \nattract shipping companies because of the deminimus regulatory costs \nthey impose on companies operating under their flag. All of these \nnations exempt companies from taxes on income, and employees operating \non the vessels do not pay tax on income they earn working aboard. The \nowners can employ foreign laborers, usually from third world nations, \nfor very little pay, often working in unacceptable conditions. \nAdditionally, the vessel operations are not required to comply with \nrigorous United States Coast Guard safety and environmental standards, \nand these operators use private companies to inspect their vessels to \nensure that they are in compliance with international safety laws.\n  Mr. President, we are all well aware of the critical role played by \nthe American maritime industry in the economy of Louisiana and our \nnation. In my home state alone, the total economic impact of that \nindustry was estimated in 1997 to be over $28 billion, supporting \napproximately 230,000 jobs throughout Louisiana. That economic impact \nconstitutes almost 30 percent of the total gross state product for \nLouisiana. Louisiana companies were among the first to respond to the \nnation's call to provide for the rapid transport of critical equipment, \nmunitions, and supplies to the Persian Gulf in those critical days \nfollowing the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. However, the very \nexistence of the American flag fleet, and thus the related economic and \nnational defense benefits that flow from that fleet, are severely \nthreatened by U.S. tax rules that unfairly hamper and restrict American \nshipping.\n  I have worked from the first days of my arrival in the Congress to \nstrengthen the U.S.-flag maritime industry and level the playing field \nin international shipping. Despite the well-intentioned efforts of the \nCongress, the Maritime Administration and other federal agencies to \nsupport the U.S.-flag commercial fleet, unfavorable and clearly \nnoncompetitive U.S. tax policies have led\n\n[[Page S13977]]\n\nto the continuing decline of that fleet. In fact, according to \nstatistics maintained by the Maritime Administration, the commercial \nfleet of the United States has fallen into 11th place internationally, \nin total carrying capacity, ranking behind those fleets of Panama, \nLiberia, Malta, the Bahamas, and other nations who offer significant \neconomic and tax advantages to their commercial vessels and crews.\n  These same issues have also plagued other industrialized nations that \noperate shipping under the application of national laws and policies. \nFor instance, between the period of 1975 and 1992, the national flag \nfleet operations in terms of deadweight carrying capacity decreased by \n94% in the United Kingdom, 98% in Norway, 73% in France, 53% in \nGermany, 73% in Sweden, 98% in Denmark, and 47% in Japan.\n  In order to combat decreases in the operation of shipping under \nnational registries, nations have taken steps to provide direct \nsubsidies or indirect support schemes that help owners offset the \nhigher costs of operating under national laws. Other nations, such as \nDenmark and Norway, have created what are called international \nregistries, or open registries, and have reduced taxes and societal \ncosts to help offset the costs as compared to flag-of convenience \nvessels. Out of the eleven largest shipping registries, by carrying \ncapacity, seven operate as flag-of-convenience registries or open \nregistries. The other four nations are Greece, Japan, the People's \nRepublic of China (which operates it's fleet as a governmentally \ncontrolled entity), and the United States.\n  Mr. President, what is even more astounding is that the percentage of \ncargoes carried by U.S.-flag vessels in the foreign trades has also \ndeclined precipitously. At the end of World War II, after we had been \nforced to rebuild our shipping fleet in order to satisfy our defense \nlogistic needs, almost 60 percent of the U.S. oceanborne commerce in \ninternational trade was carried aboard U.S.-flag vessels. Today, that \nfigure is a mere 3 percent. To state this another way, 97 out of every \n100 tons of cargo imported into or exported from the United States is \ncarried aboard foreign-flagged ships. Through a wide variety of \nfavorable tax incentives, including in most cases a total exemption \nfrom taxation, many foreign jurisdictions have succeeded in developing \ncommercial maritime fleets that far exceed the capacity of that in the \nU.S.\n  What truly concerns me is that the United States is rapidly \nundermining its very national security through its failure to enable \nthe U.S.-flag commercial fleet to compete on an equal footing with \nforeign-flagged shipping. I recognize the strategic importance of the \nU.S.-flag merchant marine and American merchant mariners, and share the \nviews of other senior political and military leaders that the ability \nof the U.S. to move its military personnel and supplies overseas \nquickly and effectively is critical to its national security. The \nUnited States cannot rely on foreign allies to achieve our national \nsecurity objectives. We must be able to act decisively, and to act \nunilaterally, when our strategic interests are jeopardized. To ensure \nthe maritime industry's ability to accomplish this crucial task, the \nmilitary utilizes privately-owned U.S.-flagged commercial vessels to \nsupplement the military's own transportation systems in both times of \nwar and peace. Without such capability, the military would have to \nbuild and operate, at a significantly greater expense to the government \nand ultimately the U.S. taxpayers, many more military transport vessels \nto ensure it can effectively respond to military contingencies in a \ntimely manner.\n\n  As General Colin Powell so accurately observed following the Persian \nGulf War in 1991:\n\n       Our [nation's] strategy requires us to be able to project \n     power quickly and effectively across the oceans to deal with \n     the crisis we couldn't avoid or predict. Sealift will be \n     critical to fulfilling this strategic requirement. . . . [The \n     military] also acknowledges that the merchant marine and our \n     maritime industry will be vital to our national security for \n     many years to come . . .\n\n  We simply cannot stand idly by while this vital national security \nasset is undercut through counter productive tax policies that do not \nallow the U.S.-flag commercial fleet to operate competitively, in the \nmost competitive of all markets--that of international shipping.\n  Mr. President, to preserve that vital national security asset, I \nbelieve it is essential to provide a tax environment for U.S.-flag \ncarriers that more closely approaches the favorable tax treatment \nprovided by other maritime nations to their own merchant fleets, while \nalso creating incentives for the construction of new vessels in U.S. \nshipyards. Foreign tax incentives have significantly undermined the \nability of the U.S. to retain a viable commercial fleet for defense \npurposes and to enhance the balance of trade. By way of example, U.S.-\nflag commercial vessel operators must pay a 34 percent tax on corporate \nincome and a 50 percent duty on vessel repairs made in foreign \ncountries; they are subject to far more restrictive (and expensive) \nCoast Guard and other federal operational and safety requirements; and \ntheir crewmembers engaged in the foreign trade do not share in the tax \nrelief otherwise provided to U.S. citizens working abroad. On the other \nhand, owners of foreign-flagged vessels of the Bahamas, Liberia, Malta, \nPanama and many other countries are totally exempt from any taxation. \nTherefore, it is not surprising to see that the Bahamas, Liberia, \nMalta, and Panama have four of the top five commercial fleets in the \nworld, and that vessel owners from around the world regularly register \ntheir ships with these countries to avoid taxation.\n  Mr. President, I am not proposing to exempt U.S.-flag vessel owners \nfrom U.S. income taxes. Rather, I have developed a comprehensive yet \nnarrowly focused bill that provides the necessary relief to alleviate \nthe tax burden on the U.S.-flag fleet. This legislation is designed to \nprovide a tax environment for U.S.-flag carriers that more closely \napproaches the favorable tax treatment provided by other maritime \nnations to their own merchant fleets. The Act includes the following \nprovisions:\n  Capital Construction Fund (CCF) Reform. Title I of the Act would \nexpand the CCF to allow deposits of earnings from U.S. flag, foreign-\nbuilt ships to be contributed to a CCF for the construction of vessels \nin the United States. Qualified withdrawals from a CCF would continue \nto apply only to U.S. built vessels and would be expanded to include \nvessels that operate between coastwise points of the United States. \nContributions to a CCF would no longer be treated as preference items \nunder the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and owners of U.S. flag \nships would also be allowed to deposit into a CCF the duty arising from \nforeign ship repairs.\n  Election to Expense U.S. Flag Vessels. Significantly, for the \nmajority of the foreign flag commercial fleet, there is no applicable \ndepreciation schedule for commercial vessels because those vessels and \ntheir corporate owners and operators are totally exempt from income \ntaxation. Other maritime nations that impose income taxes on commercial \nvessel operations still have depreciation schedules far more lenient \nthan the anti-competitive 10-year schedule applicable to U.S.-flagged \nvessels. Therefore, in order to be internationally competitive, Title \nII of the Act would enable the owner of any U.S. flag vessel engaged in \nthe international trade of the U.S. to fully deduct that vessel in the \nyear in which the vessel is acquired and documented under the U.S. \nflag.\n  Seaman's Wage Exclusion. Consistent with the current policies and \nobjectives of Section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code, Title III of \nthe Act would extend the foreign earned income exclusion to American \nmerchant mariners by changing the definition of ``foreign country'' to \ninclude a principal place of employment aboard a commercial vessel \noperating outside the United States, and amending the foreign residence \ntest to include work aboard a vessel.\n  Alternative Minimum Tax Relief. In order to be internationally \ncompetitive, Title IV of the Act repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax \n(AMT) with respect to shipping income. No such tax exists on commercial \nvessels of any other foreign country, and the changes proposed \nelsewhere in this Act will essentially be meaningless if the AMT \ncontinues to apply to shipping income.\n  Deduction of Expenses. The existing tax provision which permits the \ndeduction of expenses with respect to conventions, seminars or other \nmeetings on U.S.-flag cruise vessels traveling between U.S. ports would \nbe expanded by\n\n[[Page S13978]]\n\nTitle V of the Act to include U.S.-flag cruises between the United \nStates and foreign ports.\n  Mr. President, absent the tax reforms in the attached proposal, U.S.-\nflag carriers in Louisiana and elsewhere will continue to face a \nformidable tax cost disadvantage against foreign flag carriers, who pay \nlittle or no tax to their home countries. This cost differential \nimpedes the ability of U.S.-flag carriers to compete in the global \nmarketplace, as evidenced by the ever growing share of non-U.S. flag \ncarriers currently carrying this nation's imports and exports. It is \nuniversally recognized that key components of a strong national economy \nare a strong national merchant marine and shipyard industrial base, and \nit is now appropriate to alleviate the tax burden on the U.S.-flag \nfleet and simultaneously promote construction in U.S. shipyards. I urge \nmy colleagues to strongly support this legislation for the good of our \nAmerican flag fleet and the security of our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1858\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncomprehensive tax relief for small family farmers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     farmer tax relief act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a multi-faceted \npackage of tax cuts and federal program changes to help our nation's \nfarmers weather this period of low commodity prices. I will first note \nthat this bill is obviously not a cure-all for the farmers' plight, but \nsignificant tax reform is an essential component of creating an \nenvironment where farmers can thrive. Regulatory reform, crop insurance \nreform, and improvements in our agriculture trade policies are also \ncritical elements of boosting farm income.\n  The bill I introduce is a collection of tax reform concepts that have \nbeen considered individually, but not as a package of comprehensive \nrelief to farmers. Some were in the congressional tax cut package that \nthe President summarily vetoed, denying relief to farmers, middle class \nworkers, and small business owners. All of the provisions of this bill \nwould benefit the farm community, and should not be tossed aside due to \npartisan posturing as was the case with this past summer's tax relief \nbill. By offering this multi-part\n\n[[Page S13980]]\n\nlegislation, I hope to provide a vehicle to move comprehensive tax \nrelief for an important sector in the American economy and culture that \nhas not shared in the prosperity of recent years.\n  The first provision in this legislation is the Farm and Ranch Risk \nManagement Accounts, which were also a part of the recent tax cut bill \nthat the President vetoed. This provision would allow producers to put \nup to 20% of net farm income in a tax deferred account where the funds \ncould be held in reserve for up to five years for financial \nemergencies. Farmers operate in a volatile market, and they need all \nthe risk management tools we can provide. When farmers earn a profit \nthey usually invest in additional farm assets, and this would give them \na tax incentive and opportunity to instead save more income as a buffer \nduring down cycles.\n  The second provision of my tax bill would accelerate the 100% \ndeductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed to \nmake them immediately effective, rather than the full phase-in by 2003. \nI will note again that this was one of the critical provisions in the \ntax cut bill that was vetoed by the President, and is also included in \nmy health care legislation. Farmers should not receive the same tax \nconsiderations on health benefits as everyone else who obtains \ninsurance through their employment, so that they do not have to choose \nbetween decent health care and other necessities of life. This \nprovision equalizes the tax treatment for these farmers.\n  The third provision would raise the effective exemption from estate \ntaxes to $5 million and raise the gift tax exemption to $25,000. \nAccording to USDA figures, farmers are six times more likely to face \ninheritance taxes than other Americans. Farmers must farm more and more \nacres now to just eke out a humble income. Thus, they accumulate large \ncapital investments through the years that provide them a modest \nliving, but when they die their estate is treated as if they were very \nrich, and many have never even had a new pickup. Many of these families \nwant to leave their property to their children, so that they can \ncontinue the heritage of farming the land. However, the estate tax can \nreach such prohibitive levels that sometimes the property must be sold \nto satisfy the insatiable tax revenue appetite of the federal \ngovernment.\n  At the present time, the average age of farmers is 58 years old. We \nare just a few years from a period of significant transfers of real \nproperty from one generation to another. With all the obstacles to \nsuccess that producers currently face, why is the federal government \nadding to their burdens by jeopardizing the time honored tradition of \npassing the family farm down from generation to generation, when it \nonly generates one percent of federal taxes? Taxes should be gathered \nto pay for the necessities of government, not to transfer wealth from \none segment of the population to another. And even if you believe that \nsuch wealth transfer is a legitimate function of tax policy, can we at \nleast agree that family farms should be shielded from the takings? The \nestate tax can be as high as 55%, which is unfair, threatening the \ncontinuity of family-owned businesses.\n  The next provision amends the tax code to treat lands which are \ncontiguous to a principal residence and which were farmed for five \nyears before the principal residence as part of such residence, \nallowing it to be part of the exclusion of gain from the sale of the \nprincipal residence. This allows older farmers to sell their property \nwithout facing extraordinary capital gains taxes as a consequence.\n  The legislation also acknowledges that farm income can fluctuate \nsignificantly from year to year, and that farmers need a break when \nincome goes does significantly after several good years. The bill thus \nincludes a provision to reach back into a previous tax year and pull \nincome from good years into a current down year. Farmers would then be \nrecompensed for tax overpayments from previous years. Current law \npermits farmers to lower their tax burdens in good years by averaging \nin income from less profitable past periods, but it does not allow \nprevious good years to be averaged in to current low income levels. \nThis provision would provide this assistance to struggling farmers, \nagain, giving them some tools to work within a very volatile market.\n  The bill also includes a provision to exempt from the alternative \nminimum tax certain income from unincorporated farms. Thanks to \ninitiatives to provide tax credits to working families, many farm \nfamilies would be able to reduce their tax burden if they were not \nbumping up against the alternative minimum tax. This correction is \nneeded because the alternative minimum tax also does not always permit \nfarmers to take advantage of current laws concerning farmer income \naveraging.\n\n  My legislation contains a provision to exclude from gross income up \nto $350,000 of capital gain from the transfer of property in complete \nor partial satisfaction of qualified farm indebtedness of a taxpayer, \nsubject to means testing. This would exclude capital gains taxes from \nthe forced liquidations of farm property.\n  The bill also ensures that farm landlords are treated the same as \nsmall business people and other commercial landlords, and removes the \nrequirement that they pay self-employment tax on cash rent income. This \nitem corrects an IRS technical advice memorandum to ensure that \nfarmers, like other real estate owners, do not have to pay self-\nemployment taxes on income from cash rent.\n  The measure also amends current law to emphasis certain beneficial \nfarm program goals. They include a requirement that USDA, when \napproving applications for loans and grants under the Consolidated Farm \nand Rural Development Act, places a high priority on projects that \nencourage the creation of farmer-owner facilities that process value-\nadded agricultural products; an amendment to the Federal Agriculture \nImprovement and Reform Act to give USDA discretion to use funds for \nrural development technical assistance; an amendment to the Rural \nDevelopment Act to emphasize market development education and technical \nassistance for operators of small- and medium-sized farms, in addition \nto production assistance. The amendment also requires USDA to explore \nnew marketing avenues such as direct farm to consumer markets, local \nvalue-added processing, and farmer-owned cooperatives.\n  We need a renaissance of new thinking and new marketing opportunities \nfor our farmers. I want to ensure that existing programs are focused on \nhelping farmers receive a larger share of the value of their products. \nAs I have said before, I've always been struck by how we have a \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development and a Department of \nAgriculture, but no real government emphasis on rural development. I \nhope that these provisions can help rebuild our rural economies.\n  The next two components of the bill restore a tax-exemption for \nvalue-added farmer-owned cooperatives that was taken away by a recent \nIRS ruling, and extends declaratory judgment relief for the \ncooperatives affected by this ruling.\n  Finally, the bill also includes a provision that increases the \nthreshold amount that triggers when a farmer and employed farm worker \nwould have to pay payroll taxes. The current threshold is $150, and \nthis bill would raise it to $3,000. Farmers need the flexibility to be \nable to hire part-time workers, such as other nearby farmers or \nteenagers during the summer. We should free them from the burden and \npaperwork of having to pay payroll taxes on a minimal amount of \nexpenditures on employees. This $150 figure in current law obviously \ndoes not reflect current realities on the farm, and Congress should \nmake this much needed adjustment in the threshold figure.\n\n  Again, I believe that it is important to emphasize that major tax \nrelief for farmers is a critical component of making Freedom to Farm \nwork, and that's why I'm introducing this bill. I hope that hearings \nwill be held next year on Freedom to Farm, and some adjustments my need \nto be made to current law. In fact, I have my own bill pending that \nwould extend the term for producers' marketing loans from nine months \nup to thirty-six months, to give farmers more flexibility, and thus \nmore market power, in determining when to put their grain on the \nmarket. No one on this side of the aisle argues that Freedom to Farm is \nperfect, but there are fundamental concepts in the bill that farmers \nrequested and I believe still want, such as the freedom to\n\n[[Page S13981]]\n\nmake their own decisions on what and how much to plant. I believe \nfarmers want to plant for the market, not the government.\n  This bill reflects my commitment to try to deliver on the promises to \nfarmers that were made when Freedom to Farm was passed, such as trade \nexpansion, fast track authority, regulatory reform, and crop insurance \nreform.\n  Of course, if the administration was truly attempting to be \naccommodating the needs of the farm community, there would be less need \nfor the regulatory reform bills currently pending. I know American \nfarmers can complete worldwide, but we cannot drag our feet on creating \na climate in which they can succeed. I believe this farmer tax relief \nbill is a critical piece of the puzzle.\n  Mr. President, the second tax relief measure I am introducing today \nwould expand income averaging to small agriculture-related businesses.\n  Before 1986, American farmers, agricultural-related businesses and \nothers could apply income averaging for tax purposes. But the Tax \nReform Act of 1986 entirely eliminated income averaging. Congress acted \nprimarily on the assumption that tax reduction would substantially \nreduce the number of taxpayers whose fluctuating incomes could subject \nthem to higher progressive rates and there was no need for income \naverage. While it was understandable that Congress took such action at \nthat time, I believe it was clearly a mistake because Congress \ncompletely ignored the nature of agriculture and our rural communities.\n  Today, low commodity prices have made the income of American farmers \nand agriculture-related businesses fluctuate more wildly than that of \nany other group of taxpayers. In my own state of Minnesota, income in \nfarm communities had decreased dramatically in recent years.\n  In response to this critical situation, Congress reinstated income \naveraging for individual farmers temporarily in the Taxpayer Relief Act \nof 1997, and last year Congress made it permanent for farmers. This was \ngood change and I was pleased to join Senator Burns and others in \npassing this important legislation. In my package of tax relief for \nfarmers just discussed, I have added new flexibility for farmers to use \nincome averaging to their benefit.\n\n  Unfortunately, Congress unintentionally left one important group out \nof last year's relief legislation. American small agriculture-related \nbusinesses, those who work hard to provide seeds, fertilizer, farming \nequipment and other farm products for farmers, whose income depends on \nfarmers' income, are not included in current law providing income \naveraging. As a result, these small businesses are facing hardship and \nneed this relief as well.\n  Expanding income averaging to small agriculture-related businesses \nwould provide modest, but much needed, assistance to these businesses \nand allow them to continue serving farmers and rural communities. It \nalso is consistent with the approach Congress took in the past \nregarding income averaging. Unlike the permanent income averaging for \nfarmers, my legislation would sunset income averaging for agriculture-\nrelated businesses in three years. In addition, it only covers small \nbusinesses, not big corporations.\n  Mr. President, the third tax bill I will introduce today is the Rural \nRevitalization Tax Credit (RRTC) Act. This bill fits into my overall \ngoal of making rural America a better place to live.\n  The objective is to attract business investment to rural areas to \nprovide jobs for those who value life in the small towns of rural \nAmerica. These jobs can also be invaluable for farm families suffering \nhard times through low commodity prices, crop diseases or weather \ndisasters. Full or part time jobs can often help farmers help their \nfamily farms in down cycles.\n  This legislation is designed to encourage business investment in high \npoverty rural communities. It would create rural revitalization tax \ncredits which include a development credit that is provided to any \ncompany locating in high poverty rural communities. A company would \nreceive a 6 percent tax credit annually of the amount of the \ninvestment, which amounts to about 25 percent of the value of the \noriginal investment over 7 years.\n  It also creates a wage tax credit which allows employers in high \npoverty rural communities to receive up to $3,000 per employee hired in \nthat community. In addition, qualified businesses are allowed to write \noff up to $37,500 as an expense the cost of depreciable, tangible \npersonal property. This proposal is similar to urban empowerment zone \nproposals introduced in the Congress. We want to apply it to rural \nAmerica as well.\n  Mr. President, this measure will not solve all the problems that \nfarmers and people in rural areas are facing, but I believe it is one \nway to create more economic opportunities in our rural communities to \npreserve and improve the excellent quality of life in these areas.\n  I send the three bills to the desk and ask that they be assigned to \nthe appropriate committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bills will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1862. A bill entitled ``Vermont Infrastructure Bank Program''; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  vermont infrastructure bank program\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \npermit my home state of Vermont to enter the State Infrastructure Bank \n(SIB) program. Before the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act \nfor the 21st Century (TEA-21) all 50 states were qualified for SIB \nrevolving funds. These funds are capitalized with federal and state \ncontributions and used to provide loans and other sorts of non-grant \naid to transportation projects. TEA-21 expanded the SIB program to \nCalifornia, Florida, Missouri, and Rhode Island. With this bill, I am \nproposing to add Vermont as a participant in the SIB program.\n  The SIB program functions to authorize loans to public or private \norganizations to cover the whole or partial costs of an approved \nproject, and to make allowances for the planning and development of \nfunding streams for repayment, which would not begin until five years \nafter the completion of the project. Also, there is a provision in the \nTEA-21 for the creation of a multistate infrastructure bank system \namong the pilot states. In this system, states are encouraged to share \nboth funds and ideas for curbing pollution and traffic problems and \nencouraging other forms of transportation.\n  It is my feeling that Vermont can be a national model on the \nefficiency of meeting clean air standards and managing sprawl while \npromoting economic growth. Under the SIB program the Vermont Agency of \nTransportation (VAOT) will collaborate with other state agencies and \nlocal organizations such as the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning \nOrganization (CCMPO) in order to reduce traffic, pollution, and growth \nproblems that arise.\n  In order to fulfill these goals through creative, cutting-edge \nprojects, VAOT will require sufficient funds. To secure these funds, \nthe legislation that I am introducing today would extend the SIB \nprogram to include Vermont. This program will be an invaluable resource \nin the funding of projects that will prevent our beautiful state from \nmoving in the direction of gridlock and congestion.\n  Vermont can be a model for the nation--an example for other states \nfacing similar issues of finding a balance between growth and \nlivability. Vermont's participation in the SIB program would provide \nmore options to find the solutions that will permit this proper balance \nto be attained.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1862\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STATE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1511(b)(1)(A) of the Transportation Equity Act for \n     the 21st Century (23 U.S.C. 181 note; 112 Stat. 251) is \n     amended by inserting ``Vermont,'' after ``Florida''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1863. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan incentive to small businesses to establish and maintain qualified \npension plans\n\n[[Page S13982]]\n\nby allowing a credit against income taxes for contributions to, and \nstart-up costs of, the plan; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             small employer pension start-up incentive act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill I believe will \nprovide important benefits for our country's small businesses and the \nmillions of people who work for them. The Small Employer Pension Start-\nup Incentive Act (SEPSI) will provide help to small businesses who want \nto help their employees save for their retirement.\n  Congress has spent a great deal of time recently exploring the impact \non our country of the impending wave of baby boomer retirements. Much \nof this debate has centered around strengthening the Social Security \nTrust Fund, so we can keep the promise we made to all working Americans \nthat Social Security will be there for them when they retire. During \nthis debate, however, we have all but neglected the important role the \nprivate pension system plays in American's retirement security.\n  Social Security was never intended to provide the sole source of \nincome for our retirees. Despite that, however, it is the only source \nof retirement income for 16% of elderly Americans. And it is the \nprimary source of income for two-thirds of all retirees. Unless we can \nchange this disturbing trend, preserving Social Security for the 21th \nCentury will not be enough--there will still be far too many Americans \nwho will spend their retirement years one step away from poverty.\n  In addition to preserving Social Security, we must help Americans \nbetter prepare for their retirement years. When the President submitted \nthis budget this year, he proposed dedicating most of our projected \nsurpluses to create Universal Savings Accounts for all Americans. I \nstrongly believe the concept behind the USA proposal was a good one. If \nour projected surpluses actually materialize, we have an unprecedented \nopportunity to plan for our nation's future, to make the kinds of \ninvestments that will pay off for ourselves and for our children. \nHelping strengthen our private pension system is one of those key \ninvestments we should be making now, before the wave of retirements \nbegins.\n  An important place to start is with our small businesses and their \nemployees. Over 38 million workers in this country work for small \nbusinesses, that is, companies with less than 100 employees each. And \neven though almost everyone employed by a large company has access to a \npension plan through their employer, only 20% of small business \nemployees have pension plans available where they work. This means 31 \nmillion working Americans have no opportunity to save for their \nretirement through their employers.\n  Small business owners don't offer plans, not because they don't want \nto, but because they simply can't afford to. Administrative costs are \ndisproportionately high for businesses with few employees, as are the \ncosts associated with meeting all of the regulatory requirements that \ncan apply to pension plans. And their employees, who frequently earn \nminimum wage and don't have access to health insurance either, couldn't \nafford to set money aside for their retirement even if their employers \noffered pension plans.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today will help reverse this trend. The \nSmall Employer Pension Start-up Incentive Act will provide two new tax \ncredits to small businesses that are providing pension plans to their \nemployees for the first time. The first credit will help defray the \nadministrative costs that accompany starting a new pension plan. It \nwill provide up to $500 per year in tax relief for small businesses to \ncompensate for the administrative costs they incur in providing a new \nplan. The credit would be available for three years, for employers with \nup to 100 workers.\n  The second credit goes right to the heart of the pension problem--it \nhelps subsidize the contributions employers make into a new plan on \nbehalf of their employees. Studies have shown that pension \nparticipation increases dramatically when employers offer to match \nemployee savings. But in far too many small businesses, neither the \nemployer nor the employee can afford to set aside the money. My bill \nwill provide a 50% tax credit for any employer contributions into a new \npension plan on behalf of their lower paid employees, up to a maximum \nof 3% of the salaries of these workers. The credit will be available \nfor the first 5 years of any new qualified pension plan offered by a \nsmall business employing up to 50 workers.\n  I believe that enactment of the Small Employer Pension Start-up \nIncentive Act will help dramatically increase the number of Americans \nworking for small businesses that can begin saving for their \nretirement. Providing these tax credits to small businesses, along with \nthe other pension reform proposals that are included in S. 741, the \nPension Coverage and Portability Act I introduced with Senators Graham \nand Grassley, will go a long way toward helping Americans plan for a \nsecure retirement in the 21st century.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1863\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nwhich will dramatically expand rural America's access to modern health \ncare.\n  The Health Care Access Improvement Act creates a significant tax \nincentive, which encourages doctors, dentists, physician assistants, \nlicensed mental health providers, and nurse practitioners to establish \npractices in under-served areas. Until now, rural areas have not been \nable to compete with the financial draw of urban settings and therefore \nhave had trouble attracting medical professionals to their communities. \nThe $1,000 per month tax credit will allow health care workers to enjoy \nthe advantages of rural life without drastic financial sacrifices. But \nthe real winners in this bill are the thousands of Americans whose \naccess to health care is almost impossible due to a lack of doctors and \ndentists in small town America.\n  There are nine counties in the great state of Montana which do not \nhave even one doctor. In these rural settings, agriculture is often the \nonly employer. Farming and ranching is hard, dangerous work. Serious \ninjuries can happen in an instant. And while Montanans have always been \nknown as a heartier breed of people, we get sick too. It is \nunreasonable to expect the farmer who has had a run-in with an auger or \nthe elderly rancher's widow to drive two hours or more to get stitched \nup or to have a crown on a tooth replaced. As doctors, dentists, \nphysicians assistants, mental health providers, and nurse practitioners \nare attracted to under-served areas, Montanans and others in isolated \ncommunities will finally enjoy the medical treatment they deserve.\n  Mr. President, everyone wins with this legislation. Rural Montana, \nrural America, and providers all benefit from increased access, service \nand a better quality of life. I look forward to this legislation's \nquick passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1865. A bill to provide grants to establish demonstration mental \nhealth courts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    AMERICA'S LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH PROJECT ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \n``America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project. This bill is \ndesigned to address the impact that the increased \ndeinstitutionalization of America's mentally ill has had on our \ncriminal justice system. This is a serious problem affecting both the \nhealth and safety of our Nation. Essentially, the situation we have \ntoday in our prisons and jails is the result of over thirty years of \ncuts in the budgets of mental health institutions, as well as the \noutlawing of involuntary commitments. Faced with fewer dollars and \ngreater legal requirements, these mental health care facilities began \nde-institutionalizing America's mentally ill in record numbers. \nAccording to one estimate, the number of persons finding treatment in \nmental health facilities plummeted from 560,000 in 1955 to just 100,000 \nin 1989.\n  A recent Justice Department study revealed that 16 percent of all \ninmates in America's State prisons and local jails today are mentally \nill. The American Jails Association estimates that 600,000 to 700,000 \nseriously mentally ill persons each year are being booked into local \njails alone. In my own home State of Ohio, 18 percent of all prison \ninmates were in mental health programs last year. That's the highest \npercentage in the country.\n  Far too many of our nation's mentally ill persons have ended up in \nour prisons and jails. In fact, today, the Los Angeles County Jail is \nthe largest mental health care institution in our country. It treats \n3,200 seriously mentally ill people every day. The impact on law \nenforcement has been significant. Institutions and agencies designed to \nfight crime have had to spend valuable time and scarce resources \nproviding mental health services to prisoners. In Ohio, nearly 1 in 5 \nprisoners need special psychiatric services or accommodations.\n  Tragically, many mentally ill inmates could have received proper \ntreatment from a variety of private and public sources before they \nended up in the prison system. Part of the problem is a serious lack of \ncoordination between our local law enforcement and social service \nsystems. The interaction within law enforcement--between our courts and \nprisons--is even worse. All too often, the mentally ill act out their \nsymptoms on the streets. They are arrested for minor offenses and wind \nup in jail, where appropriate treatment simply does not exist. They \nserve their sentences or are paroled, but find themselves right back in \nthe system after committing further crimes--often more serious--only a \nshort time later.\n  The Justice Department has found that over 75 percent of mentally ill \ninmates are repeat offenders. In some States, the problem is even \nworse. California's Department of Corrections, for example, recently \nreported that 94 percent of mentally ill parolees returned to prison \nwithin two years, versus 57 percent of the parolee population at large.\n\n  Throughout this destructive cycle, law enforcement and corrections \nspend time and money trying to cope with the unique problems posed by \nthese individuals. Certainly, some mentally ill offenders must be \nincarcerated because of the severity of their crimes. Many others who \ncommit very minor offenses could receive appropriate care early on, \nreducing recidivism and unnecessary burdens on our police and \ncorrections officials, as well as many mentally ill offenders, \nthemselves.\n  That's why, Mr. President, I am introducing America's Law Enforcement \nand Mental Health Project (LAMP), to begin to identify--early--those \nwho are mentally ill within our justice system and to use the power of \nthe court to assist them in obtaining the treatment they need. This \nwill be a step toward making some of the changes necessary to \neffectively address the issues surrounding the mentally ill in our \njustice system.\n  This bill would establish a federal grant program to help states and \nlocalities develop ``Mental Health Courts'' in their jurisdictions. \nThese courts would be specialized courts with separate dockets. They \nwould hear cases exclusively involving nonviolent of-\n\n\n[[Page S13984]]\n\nfenses committed by mentally ill or retarded individuals. \nFundamentally, Mental Health Courts would enable state and local courts \nto offer alternative sentences or alternatives to prosecution for those \noffenders who could be served best by mental health services.\n  To deal with the separate needs of mentally ill offenders, these \nMental Health Courts would be staffed by a core group of specialized \nprofessionals, including a dedicated judge, prosecutor, public defender \nand court liaison to the mental health service community. The courts \nwould promote efficiency and consistency by centrally managing all \noutstanding cases involving a mentally ill defendant admitted to the \nMental Health Court.\n  The Mental Health Court judge ultimately would decide whether or not \nto hear each case referred to the court. The Mental Health Court would \nnot deal with defendants unless they are deemed mentally ill by a \nqualified mental professional or the mental health court judge. \nSimilarly, participation in the court by the mentally ill would be \ncompletely voluntary. Once the defendant volunteers for the Mental \nHealth Court, however, he or she would be expected to follow the \ndecision of the court. For instance, in any given case, the Mental \nHealth Court judge, attorneys, and health services liaison may all \nagree on a plan of treatment as an alternative sentence or in lieu of \nprosecution. The defendant must adhere strictly to this court-imposed \ntreatment plan. The court must then provide supervision with periodic \nreview. This way, the court could quickly deal with any failure of the \ndefendant to fulfill the treatment plan obligations. In this sense, the \nMental Heath Court would function similar to drug courts.\n  Mr. President, the idea of Mental Health Courts is innovative, but \nnot untested. Broward County, Florida, established the nation's first \nMental Health Court almost two years ago. This court hears an average \nof 69 cases per month. Remarkably, Broward's Mental Health Court has \nbeen able to link over one-third of all its defendants with community \nhealth care providers or private psychiatric help. Notably, less than \nten percent of all defendants were deemed inappropriate for mental \nhealth court and only eight percent refused community health services.\n  Although a voluntary system, Broward has found that many mentally ill \npersons do choose to have their cases heard in the Mental Health Court. \nThese defendants don't always know what treatment options are available \nto them before they fall into the hands of the criminal justice system. \nA judicial program offering the possibility of effective treatment--\nrather than jail time--gives a measure of hope and a chance for \nrehabilitation to defendants.\n  Other jurisdictions across America have studied the Broward County \nmodel and have established their own Mental Health Courts or seek to do \nso, such as Butler County in my state of Ohio. King County, Washington, \nalso has developed a more expansive Mental Health Court this past year. \nOur nation's communities are trying desperately to find the best way to \ncope with the problems associated with mental illness. Law enforcement \nagencies and correctional facilities simply do not have the means, nor \nthe expertise, to properly treat mentally ill inmates in general. \nMental Health Courts offer an alternative.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url":

Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine \n     Expeditionary Unit scheduled for deployment in February 2000 \n     would not be ready for such deployment ``without greatly \n     increasing the risk to those men and women who we ask to go \n     in harm's way'';\n       Whereas Vice Admiral Murphy, Commander of the Sixth Fleet \n     of the Navy, recently testified before the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate that the loss of training on Vieques \n     would ``cost American lives'';\n       Whereas the Navy is currently prevented as a consequence of \n     unrestrained civil disobedience from using the training \n     facilities on Vieques which are required to accomplish the \n     training necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of combat \n     readiness; and\n       Whereas while the Department of Defense is trying to work \n     with the Government of Puerto Rico on a permanent solution to \n     resolve the current training crisis, the Department of the \n     Navy has an immediate requirement to gain access to these \n     facilities for 13 days in December to accomplish the critical \n     integrated training necessary to achieve a satisfactory level \n     of combat readiness for the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group \n     and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Navy should conduct the 13 days of \n     pre-deployment training which is required to be performed on \n     the Island of Vieques to ensure the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle \n     Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit are free of \n     serious deficiencies in major warfare areas, thereby reducing \n     the risk to those men and women who we ask to go in harm's \n     way; and\n       (2) the President should not deploy the U.S.S. Eisenhower \n     Battle Group or the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit until--\n       (A) the President, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval \n     Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, reviews \n     the certifications regarding the readiness of the battle \n     group and the expeditionary unit made by the Commander of the \n     Second Fleet of the Navy and the Commander of the Marine \n     Forces in the Atlantic, as the case may be; and\n       (B) the President determines and so notifies Congress that \n     the battle group and the expeditionary unit are free of \n     serious deficiencies in major warfare areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13986-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   DENYING SAFE HAVENS TO INTERNATIONAL AND WAR CRIMINALS ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  LEAHY (AND HATCH) AMENDMENT NO. 2510\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for Mr. Leahy (for himself and Mr. Hatch)) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 1754) entitled the ``Denying Safe Havens to \nInternatinoal and War Criminals Act of 1999''; as follows:\n\n       On page 30, lines 20 and 21, strike ``with respect to \n     immigration laws''.\n       On page 30, lines 24 and 25, strike ``or proceedings under \n     the immigration laws.'' and insert a period, quotation marks, \n     and a second period.\n       On page 31, strike lines 1 through 8.\n       On page 33, line 13, insert ``and'' after the semicolon.\n       On page 33, line 15, strike ``; and'' and insert a period, \n     quotation marks, and a second period.\n       On page 33, strike lines 16 through 20.\n       Beginning on page 38, line 22, strike ``or require'' and \n     all that follows through ``transferred'' on line 2 of page \n     39.\n       On page 39, line 13, after the period, insert ending \n     quotation marks and a final period.\n       Beginning on page 39, strike line 14 and all that follows \n     through line 20 on page 40.\n       On page 42, line 5, after ``denaturalize'', insert ``(as \n     otherwise authorized by law)''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13986-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION AMENDMENTS OF \n                                  1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       INOUYE AMENDMENT NO. 2511\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for Mr. Inouye) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n225) to provide housing assistance to Native Hawaiians; as follows:\n\n       On page 98, strike line 23 and all that follows through \n     page 99, line 8.\n       On page 118, line 20, strike ``1999'' and insert ``2000''.\n       On page 118, line 23, strike ``October 1, 1999'' and insert \n     ``the date of enactment of the Native American Housing \n     Assistance and Self-Determination Amendments of 1999''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13986-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13986-S13990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CHIPPEWA CREE TRIBE OF THE ROCKY BOY'S RESERVATION INDIAN RESERVED \n                  WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BURNS (AND BAUCUS) AMENDMENT NO. 2512\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for Mr. Burns and Mr. Baucus) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill (S. 438) to provide for the settlement of the water rights \nclaims of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation, and \nfor other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chippewa Cree Tribe of The \n     Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights \n     Settlement and Water Supply Enhancement Act of 1999''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in fulfillment of its trust responsibility to Indian \n     tribes and to promote tribal sovereignty and economic self-\n     sufficiency, it is the policy of the United States to settle \n     the water rights claims of the tribes without lengthy and \n     costly litigation;\n       (2) the Rocky Boy's Reservation was established as a \n     homeland for the Chippewa Cree Tribe;\n       (3) adequate water for the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky \n     Boy's Reservation is important to a permanent, sustainable, \n     and sovereign homeland for the Tribe and its members;\n       (4) the sovereignty of the Chippewa Cree Tribe and the \n     economy of the Reservation depend on the development of the \n     water resources of the Reservation;\n       (5) the planning, design, and construction of the \n     facilities needed to utilize water supplies effectively are \n     necessary to the development of a viable Reservation economy \n     and to implementation of the Chippewa Cree-Montana Water \n     Rights Compact;\n       (6) the Rocky Boy's Reservation is located in a water-short \n     area of Montana and it is appropriate that the Act provide \n     funding for the development of additional water supplies, \n     including domestic water, to meet the needs of the Chippewa \n     Cree Tribe;\n       (7) proceedings to determine the full extent of the water \n     rights of the Chippewa Cree Tribe are currently pending \n     before the Montana Water Court as a part of In the Matter of \n     the Adjudication of All Rights to the Use of Water, Both \n     Surface and Underground, within the State of Montana;\n       (8) recognizing that final resolution of the general stream \n     adjudication will take many years and entail great expense to \n     all parties, prolong uncertainty as to the availability of \n     water supplies, and seriously impair the long-term economic \n     planning and development of all parties, the Chippewa Cree \n     Tribe and the State of Montana entered into the Compact on \n     April 14, 1997; and\n       (9) the allocation of water resources from the Tiber \n     Reservoir to the Chippewa Cree Tribe under this Act is \n     uniquely suited to the geographic, social, and economic \n     characteristics of the area and situation involved.\n\n      SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To achieve a fair, equitable, and final settlement of \n     all claims to water rights in the State of Montana for--\n       (A) the Chippewa Cree Tribe; and\n       (B) the United States for the benefit of the Chippewa Cree \n     Tribe.\n       (2) To approve, ratify, and confirm, as modified in this \n     Act, the Chippewa Cree-Montana Water Rights Compact entered \n     into by the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's \n     Reservation and the State of Montana on April 14, 1997, and \n     to provide funding and other authorization necessary for the \n     implementation of the Compact.\n       (3) To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to execute \n     and implement the Compact referred to in paragraph (2) and to \n     take such other actions as are necessary to implement the \n     Compact in a manner consistent with this Act.\n       (4) To authorize Federal feasibility studies designed to \n     identify and analyze potential mechanisms to enhance, through \n     conservation or otherwise, water supplies in North Central \n     Montana, including mechanisms to import domestic water \n     supplies for the future growth of the Rocky Boy's Indian \n     Reservation.\n       (5) To authorize certain projects on the Rocky Boy's Indian \n     Reservation, Montana, in order to implement the Compact.\n       (6) To authorize certain modifications to the purposes and \n     operation of the Bureau of Reclamation's Tiber Dam and Lake \n     Elwell on the Marias River in Montana in order to provide the \n     Tribe with an allocation of water from Tiber Reservoir.\n       (7) To authorize the appropriation of funds necessary for \n     the implementation of the Compact.\n\n      SEC. 4.

Mr. President, the Senate passed the conference \nagreement for the Interior appropriations bill on October 21, 1999. \nAlthough this conference report was approved by unanimous consent, I \nwanted to express my objections to the amount of excessive pork-barrel \nspending and extraneous legislative riders included in this final \nagreement.\n  In late September, the Senate passed an Interior bill that included \n$217 million in wasteful and unnecessary spending. This new conference \nagreement has taken pork-barrel spending to higher proportions by \nadding an additional $140 million in earmarks that either were not \nincluded in the Senate or House bill, or increased funding levels for \ncertain projects at levels far above the requested amounts.\n  I am constantly amazed by tactics used by my colleagues to attach \nearmarks for parochial projects that have not been authorized or that \ncircumvent a fair and merit-review process. The conferees have even \nincluded report language that directs federal agencies to fund targeted \nearmarks included in the conference report prior to distributing \ngeneral allocated funds to the rest of the country.\n  In my review of the final conference report, I have identified \nnumerous earmarks and riders that are included in a list of \nobjectionable provisions that is available on my Senate webpage. I \nremind my colleagues that I do not object to these projects based on \ntheir merit nor do I intend to belittle the importance of specific \nprojects to local communities. My objections are based on issues of \nfairness and following established procedures to consider budgetary \nitems as well as a undergoing a separate legislative process for policy \nand statutory changes to our federal laws. Unfortunately, the conferees \nhave been able to side-step our established budget and legislative \nrules by utilizing deceptive wording and budget gimmickry.\n  For example, this conference report includes an extra $22 million in \ndesignated ``emergency'' funding for certain areas in the State of \nAlaska. This funding was not considered in either the Senate or House \nbills, but added during last-minute negotiations. Again, I certainly \nunderstand economic hardships facing rural Alaskans, but why is funding \neconomic projects such as building a regional shipyard, a larger \nfishing dock, as well as converting a pulp mill to a Coca Cola bottling \nplant, of higher priority than addressing important land and resources \nmanagement issues that are intended to be paid for through the Interior \nappropriations bill? This added ``emergency'' spending, despite that \nfact that it will purportedly not count against budget cap \nrestrictions, will still be paid for by the taxpayers.\n  Also added in this conference report is an entirely new title that \nincludes legislation, the ``Mississippi National Forest Improvement Act \nof 1999,'' which had not previously considered in the previous Senate \nor House bills. Furthermore, emergency funding of $68 million is \nprovided for the ``United Mine Workers of America'' benefit fund, also \nnot previously included in either the Senate or House versions of the \nInterior appropriations bills.\n  The conferees have targeted funding for projects that provide little \ndetail as to their overall national priority or merit. For example, \n$300,000 that was originally dedicated for a Forest Service regional \noffice is instead directed to be earmarked for heating, ventilation, \nand air conditioning systems at the Forest Products Labs in Wisconsin. \nLanguage is included to provide for specific acquisition of a high band \nradio system for the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia. \nWhile these maintenance improvements may very well be necessary, is \nthis the type of projects that deserve funding above other important \nland, forest and wildlife priorities?\n  Much of this wasteful spending could be directed toward other \npriorities and programs that allow states and local communities to \nprioritize their own needs at the local level, such as the State-side \nprogram of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I, along with several \nof my colleagues, have supported prioritizing the State-side program of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund as a program that provides federal \nresources for projects that are considered fairly and competitively. \nThe conferees agreed to provide $20 million to the State-side program \nfor the first time in many years, but this level is less than the $30 \nmillion approved by the Senate and far below what is necessary to \naddress locally identified needs. Unfortunately, the State-side \nprogram, and many other programs that fund projects based on merit and \nnational priority, are penalized due to other low-priority and special \ninterest spending as part of this conference report.\n  Mr. President, each year the conferees utilize the appropriations \nprocess to tack on legislative riders that either were not considered \nthrough a legislative process or added with the intension to delay \nimportant policy and regulatory changes. Many environmental and land \nmanagement laws cannot be updated or reviewed when legislative riders \nare included that prohibit any action by federal agencies to proceed \nwith a fair and comprehensive review of impacts on our natural \nresources. A few of the these riders include:\n  A delay in promulgating rules to update oil valuation royalty \nassessments for oil drilled on federal lands;\n  A two-year exemption for certain mining companies who utilize public \nlands for purposes of storing mine waste;\n  A year-long delay for surface management regulations governing \nhardrock mining; and,\n  A continuing moratorium on Indian tribal P.L. 93-638 Indian Self-\nDetermination Contracts that allow direct management and funding for \ntribally operated programs.\n  I support an open and fair review of our laws that govern public \nlands and resources, but we cannot fully evaluate the fairness and \nappropriateness of proposed changes when legislative riders such as \nthese put a halt to our congressional review.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that important land, forest and \nNative American programs will continue to be supported through this \nannual funding bill. Unfortunately, many communities across this \ncountry will not receive the critical resources they need because of \nthe continuing and unfair practice of pork-barrel spending. This year, \nour American taxpayers will pay the tab for $357 million in parochial \nand low-priority spending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13991-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13991-S13992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RESPECT MONTH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, both the State of Michigan and the \nCity of Detroit have proclaimed the month of October ``Respect Month'' \nfor the past decade and October 30th ``Respect Your Neighborhood Day''. \nThese designations give us the opportunity to recognize and celebrate \nthe many daily acts of service, that sometimes go unnoticed, but are so \nvital to binding our communities and nation together with harmony and \nunity. Over the last month, organizations and schools in Michigan took \nthe opportunity to give young people a greater acceptance of the \nsimilarities and differences of others.\n  The principle of respect is especially important in the aftermath of \nlast school year's shootings. While our nation is focused on creating \nan atmosphere free from fear and violence, it is important to pause and \nreflect on our respect for one another. Respect is a valuable lesson \nfor the schools who are struggling to repair the damage these\n\n[[Page S13992]]\n\nhorrific acts of violence have caused. In fact, in the last few weeks I \nhave reported several incidences of gun violence which have devastated \nfamilies and school communities, leaving many people wondering what we, \nas a nation, can do to prevent these tragedies, and how we can \nreinforce the rule of respect.\n  I believe there are many things that we can do to make a difference. \nI have stated many times that one of the first things Congress can do \nis limit the easy access to firearms by our young people. I will \ncontinue to speak out about the need for strengthening our gun laws, \nbut I also believe that there are other critical components of the \ncomplex puzzle of youth violence and one of them is respect. Devoting a \nmonth to respect provides an excellent avenue by which our young people \ncan focus on the importance of honor, acceptance, and values.\n  While this is not expected to end all violence, it is my hope that by \ncontinuing to implement the lessons of respect in our daily lives, we \ncan, in fact, make a positive impact in neighborhoods, not only across \nMichigan, but across the country as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13992-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE HONORABLE ELMER B. STAATS, COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED \n                           STATES, 1966-1981\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today the American Society for \nPublic Administration (ASPA) will be celebrating its 60th Anniversary \nby honoring Elmer B. Staats, who served as Comptroller General of the \nUnited States from 1966-1981. The Comptroller General of the United \nStates has enormous responsibility as head of the U.S. General \nAccounting Office (GAO). Much of what we take for granted about GAO's \nsuccesses in the area of government accountability results from the \nleadership of each Comptroller General. The commitment required to \nfulfill the responsibilities of this important position are equally \nbalanced by the excellence we have seen in the occupants of the job.\n  That said, Elmer Staats occupies a special place not only in GAO's \nhistory, but for establishing the foundation of improved government \naccountability and fiscal responsibility so important to the sound \nfunctioning of our government. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs I can attest to the importance of Mr. Staats' \ncontributions, because they have crucially shaped the effectiveness of \nGAO over the years and have been of enormous assistance to the \nCommittee and to the Congress as a whole.\n  Elmer Staats increased GAO's visibility and services to the Congress \ndramatically. Elmer Staats expanded GAO's work beyond the mere \nconsideration of the legality of expenditures and agency administrative \nactivities, and began examining the effectiveness of government \nprograms. What is important is that he did so by adapting rigorous \naccounting or ``Yellow Book'' Government Auditing Standards. In fact, \nwhen it comes to the Yellow Book, Elmer Staats literally wrote the \nbook. Finally, Elmer Staats set the pace for GAO to be a leader in the \nfight against waste, fraud, and abuse. As Stephen Barr reported in The \nWashington Post on Thursday, October 28, 1999, ``For fiscal 1999, the \nGAO expects its recommendations to produce budget savings and financial \nbenefits worth more than $20 billion. That follows several years in \nwhich the GAO's auditing and investigative work has led to annual \nsavings of between $16 billion and $21 billion.''\n  I applaud ASPA's decision to honor Elmer Staats to highlight its own \n60 years of service to our nation, and I extend my personal \ncongratulations to Elmer Staats for receiving such a high honor. I ask \nunanimous consent that a congratulatory letter from the current \nComptroller General, David M. Walker, be entered into the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                              GAO,\n\n\n                               U.S. General Accounting Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1999.\n     The Honorable Elmer B. Staats,\n     5011 Overlook Road, NW.,\n     Washington, DC 20016.\n       Dear Elmer: It is with enormous pride and privilege that I \n     join your many colleagues and friends in honoring you on this \n     60th anniversary of the American Society of Public \n     Administration. I regret that I cannot be there to share in \n     the celebration due to a previous family commitment.\n       In the worlds of public accounting and public \n     administration, we are the beneficiaries of your good name \n     and myriad good works. It is both an honor and a \n     responsibility to follow in your footsteps as Comptroller \n     General of the United States. I would not begin to attempt to \n     summarize the dollars saved, the federal programs \n     strengthened, and the citizens' lives improved as a result of \n     your many years of public service. I refer not only to your \n     accomplishments as Comptroller General, but to your continued \n     association with GAO and a multitude of public and private \n     sector organizations since your so-called ``retirement'' from \n     federal service.\n       I want to take this opportunity to highlight a few well-\n     known parts of your celebrated record, which include: \n     development of the ``Yellow Book'' of government auditing \n     Standards, expansion of GAO's work in program evaluation, the \n     effectiveness of your personal diplomacy on Capitol Hill, the \n     reorganization of GAO into issue areas, establishment of \n     GAO's job planning processes, the revitalization of the Joint \n     Financial Management Improvement Program, and GAO's \n     participation and leadership of the International \n     Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). Your \n     work made believers out of many in GAO, the Congress, \n     andother accountability professionals throughout the world \n     who continue to recognize today that GAO's core values of \n     accountability, integrity, and reliability are the very \n     foundation of public trust and confidence.\n       The changes you effected during your 15-year tenure as \n     Comptroller General allowed GAO's institutional role in \n     government to expand and improve. You demonstrated a unique \n     mixture of energy, innovation, patience, and perseverance in \n     being responsive to the Congress; ensuring the application of \n     the standards of our profession; and preparing executives in \n     all branches of government to understand, address, and \n     resolve the problems that GAO uncovers.\n       Elmer, your legacy is with us in every new step and renewed \n     effort at GAO. On behalf of the staff here at the General \n     Accounting Office, and my fellow INTOSAL colleagues \n     throughout the world, I extend the very best to you and your \n     family on this joyous occasion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David M. Walker,\n\nComptroller General of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13992-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13992-S13993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LYNDON A. WADE\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I once heard Marian Wright \nEdelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund, say that ``Service \nis the rent each of us pays for living--the very purpose of life and \nnot something you do in your spare time or after you have reached your \npersonal goals.'' I can think of no greater example of that philosophy \nthan Mr. Lyndon A. Wade.\n  Lyndon A. Wade has served as President of the Atlanta Urban League \nfor over 30 years. Since 1968, under his leadership, this broad-based \ncommunity and social service agency has affected major decisions and \nbrought about changes in among other things, land and transportation \nplanning, equal employment opportunities and minority employment in \nbuilding and construction trades.\n  Currently, the League operates programs of service in the areas of \nemployment, housing, education and youth services. The agency provides \nsocial services to over 3,000 people annually and is affiliated with \nthe United Way Agency and also receives funding from city, county, \nstate, and federal governments, foundations, and corporations.\n  Mr. Wade is a native Atlantan and a product of the Atlanta public \nschools. He received his BA form Morehouse College and his Masters \ndegree in Social work from Atlanta University. He began his career as \nan assistant professor in Emory University's Department of Psychiatry, \na position he occupied from 1963 to 1968.\n  Between 1971 and 1975, while serving as President of the Atlanta \nUrban League, Mr. Wade was appointed by Federal Judge Frank Hooper to \nchair the bi-racial Advisory Committee to the Atlanta Board of \nEducation. This group was successful in forging the Atlanta Compromise \nwhich ended 15 years of protracted court struggle surrounding the \ndesegregation of Atlanta's public schools.\n  From 1971 until 1985, Mr. Wade served on the Board of Directors of \nthe Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority where he held the \nposts of Secretary, Chairman of the Development Committee and Vice-\nChairman. He was one of the major architects of Marta's Affirmative \nAction Program which has\n\n[[Page S13993]]\n\nresulted in hundreds of jobs for minorities and females as well as \nproducing approximately $3 billion in contracts for minority and female \nentrepreneurs since the beginning of the system.\n  During the early 1970's, the Atlanta Urban League, under Wade's \nleadership, paved the way for minorities and women to gain admission to \nthe building trades elite crafts. Working with Arthur Fletcher and the \nU.S. Department of Labor a federal employment plan was developed for \nthe construction industry in Metropolitan Atlanta. This plan served as \na monitoring guide for hiring and utilization of minority and female \nworkers.\n  Over his long and distinguished career, Mr. Wade has received \nnumerous citations and honors including: Fulton County Medical \nSociety's Distinguished Service Award; Social Worker of the Year 1971 \nby the North Georgia Chapter of the National Association of Social \nWorkers; and the Distinguished Service Award by the Atlanta Morehouse \nAlumni Club.\n  He is a member of the Academy of Social Workers, the Atlanta Action \nForum, the Atlanta Committee for Public Education, Organizing Committee \nfor Gilda's Club, Channel 36's ``Quest'' Advisory Board, the \nAssociation of United Way executive committee, the Urban Insurance Task \nForce, and District Attorney Paul Howard's Transition Team as well as a \n1970 Graduate of leadership Atlanta.\n  From September 1958 to July 1962, Mr. Wade served in the United \nStates Military and received an honorable discharge with the rank of \nFirst Lieutenant. He is married and the father of four children. He is \nalso a life-long member of the Central Methodist Church in Atlanta.\n  I thank Mr. Wade for the wonderful work he has done on behalf of \nAtlanta and its residents and I wish the very best for him and his \nfamily in his much deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13993-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRATULATING TWO OUTSTANDING ARKANSAS EMPLOYERS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two \noutstanding companies in Arkansas that were named last month as two of \nAmerica's 10 best manufacturing plants in North America by Industry \nWeek magazine. This dual achievement is impressive and stands as a \ntestament to the strong work ethic and pride in workmanship that exists \namong Arkansas workers.\n  Scroll Technologies of Arkadelphia and Eaton Corporation's Aeroquip \nGlobal Hose Division in Mountain Home were selected from over 400 \nplants that were considered for this award. Applicants were judged on \nproductivity, workplace safety, community involvement, customer and \nsupplier relations, product quality and innovation in technology.\n  Scroll Technologies, which manufactures air conditioning and \nrefrigeration equipment, employs 575 workers and is one of the most \nadvanced production plants of its kind. This company's success is \nfounded upon management-employee partnerships, its highly skilled \nworkforce and a strong commitment to workplace safety. Scroll \nTechnologies can also be proud of its sound environmental record.\n  Eaton Corporation's Aeroquip Global Hose Division opened for business \nin 1975 and now employs 285 workers in Northwest Arkansas. Eaton-\nAeroquip manufactures hydraulic hoses used in large trucks and \ntractors. This company has succeeded by abandoning the traditional, \nhierarchical manufacturing process and adopting an organizational \nstructure based on 50 employee teams. Team members are encouraged to \ngive candid feedback about all aspects of the plant's operations and \nare rewarded with performance based bonuses.\n  I have always said that Arkansas' greatest asset is its people. I am \nglad that Scroll Technologies and Eaton-Aeroquip have taken advantage \nof this resource and become valuable corporate-citizens in my state. I \nam proud to honor their achievements in the U.S. Senate today. I hope \ntheir well-earned success sends a signal to other companies in Arkansas \nand the nation that Arkansas is a good place for industry to do \nbusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13993-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ST. JOSEPH'S MERCY OF MACOMB 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate St. Joseph's Mercy of Macomb Hospital as they gather in \ncelebration of their 100th Anniversary.\n  St. Joseph's Mercy of Macomb has set a pioneering tradition in health \ncare since it was founded in 1899. One year after its beginning, the \nhospital opened a 50 bed facility for treatment of the acutely ill. \nWith its healing waters and mineral baths it attracted patients world \nwide. St. Joseph's Mercy continued to take great strides in healthcare \nby establishing a disabled children's clinic, physical therapy \ndepartment and the area's first alcoholism treatment center which was \none of the first to recognize mental illness as a disease. Continuing \nto provide the best quality of healthcare for the people of Macomb \nCounty, in 1990 St. Joseph's became partners with Mercy Health systems \nand Henry Ford Health System.\n  What is truly remarkable about the people involved in St. Joseph's \nMercy is the commitment they have to removing barriers to better health \nand making services available close to home for people of all ages. St. \nJoseph's Mercy has become a strong force in the community--working with \nparishes and schools to create healthcare teams and reaching out with \nHomeCare and neighborhood based healthcare centers. St. Joseph's Mercy \nis working hard to plan for the future of healthcare needs with \ncritical, life saving initiatives and community outreach activities all \ndesigned to create a healthier Macomb County.\n  The accomplishments this group has made in the past 100 years are to \nbe commended. St. Joseph's Mercy has made a hospital much more than \nfour walls filled with medical equipment. They have taken their guiding \nspirit and reached out to the community delivering a century of caring \nand charity.\n  It is my hope that the St. Joseph's Mercy of Macomb will continue to \nprovide excellent healthcare that knows no bounds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13993-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       GEORGETOWN-RIDGE FARM HIGH SCHOOL WINS ODYSSEY WORLD TITLE\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize six \nstudents at Georgetown-Ridge Farm High School who captured the \nEnvironmental Challenge division title at the Odyssey of the Mind's \nworld competition in Knoxville, Tennessee. These Georgetown-Ridge Farm \nHigh School students, under the tutelage of their coach, Jeannine \nPatterson, beat out 54 teams representing other states and countries to \nwin first place.\n  While this is the third consecutive year in which a Georgetown-Ridge \nFarm High School team has advanced a team to the world competition, \nstudents Ryan Frohock, Lynsey Hart, Manda Paige, Derek Galyen, Chelsey \nSpurlock, and James Chandler are the first to win the world \ncompetition, which consists of a long-term problem and a spontaneous \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, we often heap praise upon athletes who demonstrate a \nspecial ability to throw a ball, catch a pass, or run extremely fast. \nIntellectual accomplishments, such as the one achieved by these six \nGeorgetown-Ridge Farm students, however, are rarely acknowledged. But \ncapturing a world title in a competition that involves both creativity \nand intellect clearly merits the highest commendation we can bestow \nupon these students. It is important that this achievement receive its \ndue recognition, and I congratulate the six students at Georgetown-\nRidge High School who won the Environmental Challenge world title at \nthe Odyssey of the Mind's world competition, as well as their teachers, \nparents, and friends, all of whom played a role in their victory in \nKnoxville, Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13993-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13993-S13994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT STEVE REEVES AND OFFICER STEPHEN GILNER\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has been said that ``Poor is a \nnation which has no heroes. Poorer still is the nation which has them, \nbut forgets them.'' I rise today before my colleagues to pay tribute to \ntwo fallen heroes, Sergeant Steve Reeves and Officer Stephen\n\n[[Page S13994]]\n\nGilner. These policemen were two of Cobb County's, and indeed \nAmerica's, finest. Unfortunately, in a tragic incident earlier this \nyear, they were killed in the line of duty.\n  These men dutifully served and protected the great citizens of \nGeorgia up until the last moments of their lives, when on July 23, \n1999, these heroes were struck down by gunfire.\n  Colleagues described Stephen Gilner as a wonderful human being who \nhad never been happier than when, after seven years in the Marine \nCorps, he was handed his police uniform and could make a career out of \nhelping people. In 1999, Officer Gilner was nominated for the Officer \nof the Year award after saving a man from a burning van. He died last \nsummer trying to save the life of a fellow officer. Officer Gilner \nleaves behind his wife Elisa and their daughter Nicole.\n  Sergeant Reeves had been with the Cobb County Police Department for \nfourteen years. Fellow officers remember Reeves for his sense of humor \nand his ability to remain calm under pressure. Just two months before \nthe tragic shooting claimed his life, Steve Reeves had been promoted to \nSergeant. The beloved hero was twice decorated--once for saving the \nlife of a fellow officer during a struggle with an armed suspect and \nagain for rescuing a family from their burning house while he was off-\nduty. Sergeant Reeves is survived by his wife, Beth, and two sons, \nClint and Chris.\n  The selfless bravery and public service displayed by these heroes are \nin the finest tradition of the United States. I am sure my colleagues \nin the Senate will join me as I extend my thoughts and prayers to \nElisa, Nicole, Beth, Clint and Chris. This tragic incident is the first \nof its kind in more than thirty five years where two police officers \nwere killed in the same incident in the Atlanta Metro area. Our prayers \nare sent up to these men in heaven who made the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir fellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13994-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DANIEL JACOB MILLER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to show appreciation \nand honor to Daniel Jacob Miller as he receives the Heroism Award \npresented by the Boy Scouts of America. Daniel is a true hero, good \nSamaritan and model citizen. On December 31, 1998, there was a tragic \nand massive automobile pile-up in Northern Michigan. The lone police \nofficer on the scene needed help and that is when Dan stepped up. The \nofficer asked if anyone had medical training and Dan, who had learned \nfirst aid training through the Boy Scouts, immediately offered his \nassistance. Dan's unselfish acts, putting his own life at risk helped \nsave the lives of a mother and her children and enabled the police \nofficer to tend to the many other seriously injured motorists.\n  What is most exceptional about Dan is that he genuinely cares about \nall people and their well being. After the devastating tornados which \nstruck Oklahoma last May, Dan instigated and helped organize a trip to \naid in the disaster clean-up. Dan's leadership was also apparent when \nhe taught fellow Boy Scouts how to operate a Ham Radio and assisted \nthem in getting certified in Ham Radio operations in case of a \ndisaster.\n  Dan is described as a quiet and reserved person who enjoys doing his \ngood deeds in secret and throughout his life he has continually put \nothers' needs before his own. Daniel Miller is an exemplary person, Boy \nScout and citizen. Time and time again his devotion and good will have \nblessed the lives of numerous people. It is my hope that many more \npeople follow the path that Dan has set himself on and continue to make \nthe state of Michigan and our nation a better place.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Boy Scouts \nof America for their dedication to teaching young people the skills \nthey need to assist in life-saving situations. The Boy Scout leaders \nwho so unselfishly give of their time to help young men could never \nunderstand the far reaches of their work. Daniel Miller gives us one \nincredible example of the importance of the training young men get \nthrough the Boy Scouts of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S13994-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13994-S14005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               YOUTH DRUG AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT\n\n  On November 3, 1999, the Senate passed S. 976, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 976\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CHAFEE COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES SYSTEM ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1866, introduced \nearlier today by Senator Smith of New Hampshire and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1866) to redesignate the Coastal Barrier \n     Resources System as the ``John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier \n     Resources System''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this bill would \nredesignate the Coastal Barrier Resources System as the ``John H. \nChafee Coastal Barrier Resources System.''\n  As you all know, my friend, the late Senator John Chafee, worked \ntirelessly to ensure that the natural resources of this nation are \nprotected. I can think of no tribute that is more fitting than to \nrename the Coastal Resources System after him. Whenever we discussed \nthe Coastal Barrier Resources Act it was not unusual for Senator Chafee \nto comment that ``There are times around here that we all do things \nright, and this is one of them.''\n  Senator Chafee is considered the father of the Coastal Barrier \nResources Act, and it epitomizes the common sense approach he took in \nprotecting our environment. When Senator Chafee introduced this \nlegislation in 1990 he recognized that the federal government didn't \nhave the financial resources to buy this land, as well as recognizing \nthe need for Congress to find a unique and different way to protect our \nsensitive coastal barriers.\n  The Coastal Barrier Resources Act does just that. The act prohibits \nthe Federal government from subsidizing flood insurance, and restricts \nother federal expenditures and financial assistance, such as beach \nreplenishment, that encourage the development of our coastal barriers. \nAll to often taxpayers are asked to subsidize the rebuilding of homes \nin these sensitive storm and flood prone areas not just once, but two, \nthree, even four times. Restricting funding for Federal programs will \nminimize loss of human life, reduce wasteful expenditure of Federal \nfunds, and protect the natural resources associated with coastal \nbarriers.\n  As I said last week on the floor, this act is vintage Chafee: \nbalanced, fiscally prudent, and environmentally protective.\n  The Coastal Barrier Resources System protects approximately 3 million \nacres and 2,500 shoreline miles from development subsidized by the \nfederal government. Development of coastal barrier land decreases their \nability to absorb the force of storms, buffer the mainland, and provide \ncritical habitat to numerous plant and animal species. The devastating \nfloods of Hurricane Floyd are yet another reminder of the \nsusceptibility of coastal development to the power of nature.\n\n[[Page S14006]]\n\n  Senator Chafee was instrumental in reauthorizing the legislation in \n1990 and had recently introduced a new reauthorization measure. By \nrenaming the Coastal Barrier Resources Act after Senator Chafee, this \nlegislation honors the invaluable contributions the Senator made to the \nenvironment during his tenure in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement in support of \nthis legislation from the Coast Alliance, a network of more than 500 \norganizations working to protect America's coastal resources, be \nprinted in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In closing I would like to leave you with \na quote from President Teddy Roosevelt that Senator Chafee used in 1990 \nwhen he introduced the bill:\n\n       The prosperity of our people depends on the energy and \n     intelligence with which our natural resources are used. It is \n     equally clear that these resources are the final basis of \n     national power and perpetuity.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nStatement of Jacqueline Savitz, Executive Director, Coast Alliance, on \n          the John Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System Act\n\n       The Coast Alliance leads a network composed of over 500 \n     organizations along America's coasts working to protect our \n     priceless coastal resources. The Alliance worked with Senator \n     John Chafee to help pass the Coastal Barrier Resources Act in \n     1982 and to expand it in 1990. The Alliance has continuously \n     defended and built support for the Coastal Barrier Resources \n     System since that time. Coast Alliance strongly supports this \n     bill to rename the Coastal Barrier Resource System in Senator \n     Chafee's honor.\n       Senator John Chafee's work to create and protect the CBRS \n     was unequaled, leaving a precious legacy for this and \n     hopefully future generations. The Coast Alliance commends the \n     cosponsors of this bill for recognizing Senator Chafee's work \n     by renaming the Act and the System. The John H. Chafee \n     Coastal Barrier Resource Act should stand as a testament to \n     the vision and perseverance of Senator Chafee in defense of \n     barrier islands.\n       Prior to his death, Senator Chafee authored a bill to \n     reauthorize the Act and included provisions that would allow \n     for citizens to make voluntary additions to the System. Coast \n     Alliance urges the Environment and Public Works Committee and \n     the Senate to make quick work of Chafee's bill, passing it as \n     he wrote it, and as soon as is feasible.\n       Finally, Coast Alliance wishes to recognize that Senator \n     Chafee's appreciation of nature extended beyond barrier \n     islands, and his work to protect our National Wildlife \n     Refuges also should be recognized. Coast Alliance urges that \n     the Committee consider adding to its memorial by naming a \n     National Wildlife Refuge in Senator John Chafee's memory.\n       The Board of Directors and staff of the Coast Alliance wish \n     to convey their sympathy to the Chafee family, and to the \n     Senator's colleagues and staff. We thank Chairman Smith and \n     the Environment and Public Work Committee for their \n     leadership on this bill.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this bill is a fitting tribute to our \nbeloved former chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nthe late Senator John Chafee. I commend our new Chairman, Senator \nSmith, for conceiving of this tribute, and am pleased to join him and \nothers in introducing the bill.\n  Over the past week or so, many of us have spoken of the sadness we \nfeel at Senator Chafee's passing. We have spoken of his contributions \nto legislative debates, and in particular the work he did to improve \nour major environmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean \nWater Act, and Endangered Species Act.\n  The bill we are introducing today shows another side of Senator \nChafee's work. He wasn't just interested in issues that bring headlines \nand accolades. When he came to work each morning, he tried to make \nthings better, however he could, in ways both large and small.\n  The Coastal Barriers Resources System was one of those relatively \nsmall, but significant, accomplishments. Very few people have heard \nabout it. But it's made a difference.\n  Senator Chafee proposed the Coastal Barriers Resources Act in 1981. \nIt was enacted into law in 1982 and reauthorized in 1990.\n  The act establishes the Coastal Barrier Resources System, which \ncomprises about 3 million acres of fragile coastal habitat covering \n2,500 shoreline miles. Within the system, certain types of federal \nassistance, such as flood insurance and funding to replenish beaches, \nis prohibited. If someone wants to build in one of these areas, such as \nalong a beach that is highly edible and in the frequent path of \nhurricanes, fine.\n  But taxpayers will not help foot the bill.\n  In this way, the act promotes two simple, common-sense ideas: \nconservation and thrift.\n  It promotes conservation because coastal barriers are very important \nand fragile ecosystems. Senator Chafee put it this way, at the first \nhearing on his bill, in Providence in 1982. He said:\n\n       These beaches and islands are places of incredible beauty \n     that deserve to be protected so that they can be open for \n     enjoyment by everybody, all the citizens of our country.\n\nHe continued:\n\n       The grassy dunes, salt marshes, and tidal estuaries of the \n     barrier islands [also] provide essential areas where healthy \n     wildlife populations can find shelter, food and a tranquil \n     place to raise their young.\n\n  By discouraging development in these areas, the Coastal Barrier \nResources Act promotes conservation.\n  The act also promotes thrift. Simply put, it's a waste of taxpayers' \nmoney to subsidize development that not only harms the environment, but \nthat also is likely, at some point, to be swept out to sea.\n  When he signed the act into law, President Reagan said that it ``will \nsave American taxpayers millions of dollars.'' and that's turned out to \nbe the case.\n  Conservation and thrift. Good Yankee virtues, characteristic of John \nChafee.\n  One more thing. In his eulogy last Saturday, former Senator Danforth \ntalked about how John Chafee tried to bring people together.\n  This is yet another example. When all the painstaking work was done, \nthe Coastal Barrier Resources Act reflected a bipartisan consensus. It \nwas supported by virtually everyone--from the National Taxpayers Union, \nto the Red Cross, to the major environmental groups. It was enacted \nwith only four dissenting votes in the entire Congress.\n  It brought people together.\n  Mr. President, two weeks ago, Senator John Chafee introduced a bill \nto reauthorize the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. It turned out to be \nthe very last bill that he introduced.\n  The bill that we are introducing today takes a further step. It names \nthe system that he created, and nurtured, the John H. Chafee Coastal \nBarrier Resources System.\n  It is a modest, but fitting, tribute.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I applaud Senator Smith, the new chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, for this effort on \nbehalf of the Senate to honor our late friend, John Chafee.\n  Although not widely-known,the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) \nstatute is an important component of our national commitment to \nbalancing the needs of our environment, minimizing risks to human life, \nand fiscal responsibility. Being such a careful balance, the act \nreflects John Chafee's approach to legislating--fair, deliberate, and \nenvironmentally conscious.\n  In 1982, the then-chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nSubcommittee on Environmental Pollution, Senator Chafee, became the \nleading champion of efforts to address problems caused by development \non highly erodible coastal areas. The CBRA concept took a unique \napproach to protecting these coastal areas, not by instituting a wide \nrange of new federal regulations as some suggested, but by prohibiting \ncertain federal spending that could promote development that would not \notherwise take place.\n  Subsequent reauthorization of the act in 1990 significantly expanded \nthe CBRA System and incorporated ``Otherwise Protected Areas'' into the \nprotective umbrella. Today, the CBRA System includes 585 units and 274 \nOPAs, comprising over 3 million acres of coastal barriers.\n  CBRA does not prohibit development in coastal areas, nor deny private \nor non-federal funds from being spent even with the CBRA System. It \ndoes, however, protect taxpayer dollars--including flood insurance, \nloans, grants, and assisting infrastructure projects--from being spent \non development projects in areas where the very instability of the \nterrain makes development a risky proposition. It also discourages \ndevelopment in areas where\n\n[[Page S14007]]\n\nhuman life is at increased risk from the full force of coastal weather \nevents.\n  A General Accounting Office report from 1992 underscores the \nsuccesses and challenges of the system. Although CBRA's restrictions \nhave discouraged development in some units, saving taxpayer dollars, \nother units have seen development pressures result in new construction \nprojects.\n  Senator Chafee's long leadership on this issue has demonstrated the \nvitality of the idea of protecting important environmental areas \nwithout putting restrictions on private actions. As Chairman of the \nsuccessor subcommittee with jurisdiction over CBRA and a staunch \ndefender of creative solutions to problems affecting our environment, I \nlook forward to helping advance John Chafee's legacy by supporting this \nmeasure and working to enact his last introduced bill, S. 1752.\n  Mr. President, S. 1752, the Coastal Barrier Resources Reauthorization \nAct, was introduced by our late Chairman before his passing and would \nupdate the underlying law for the 21st Century by coupling current \nmapping technology with new advances in digital cartography and by \nestablishing statutory clarity in describing which areas are covered by \nthe CBRA System.\n  In closing, I commend Senator Smith and Senator Baucus for their \ncommitment to honoring John Chafee by naming the CBRA System for him. \nJohn Chafee was truly a man of vision with a gentle spirit that made \nthe difficult tasks in Congress that much more easy. His presence had a \ncalming influence when so often discussions became overheated in this \nChamber or in the Environment and Public Works Committee. No one can \nreplace him, but others should and will try to follow his example. He \nwill be truly missed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to this bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1866) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr President, I am delighted that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 1754, the ``Denying Safe Haven to International and War \nCriminals Act of 1999,'' along with a technical amendment that strikes \nseveral provisions in the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee that \nwould have had the effect of altering the applicability of current law \nin certain instances. Senator Hatch and I introduced this bill on \nOctober 20, 1999, with a number of provisions that I have long \nsupported. The legislation will give United States law enforcement \nagencies important tools to help them combat international crime by \nfacilitating international cooperation in the prosecution of criminal \ncases and ensuring that human rights abusers are denied safe haven in \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American \ninterests abroad are part of our modern reality. Furthermore, organized \ncriminal activity does not recognize national boundaries. With \nimprovements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with \nease. They can transfer funds with the push of a button, or use \ncomputers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens and \nbusinesses from any spot on the globe. They can commit crimes here or \nabroad and flee quickly to another jurisdiction or country. The playing \nfield keeps changing, and we need to change with it.\n  This bill will help make needed modifications in our laws, not with \nsweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at \nspecific problems faced by law enforcement. We cannot stop \ninternational crime without international cooperation, and this bill \ngives additional tools to investigators and prosecutors to promote such \ncooperation, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international \ncriminals, including human rights abusers, and terrorists now enjoy.\n  Regarding the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act (Title III), this \nbill contains as its last title the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation \nAct,'' which I introduced as S. 1375, on July 15, 1999, with Senator \nKohl. Senator Lieberman is also a cosponsor. This legislation has \ngarnered bipartisan support both in the Senate and the House, where the \nmeasure has been introduced by Representatives Foley, Franks and \nAckerman as H.R. 2642 and H.R. 3058.\n  I have been appalled that this country has become a safe haven for \nthose who exercised power in foreign countries to terrorize, rape, and \ntorture innocent civilians. For example, three Ethiopian refugees \nproved in an American court that Kelbessa Negewo, a\n\n[[Page S14010]]\n\nformer senior government official in Ethiopia engaged in numerous acts \nof torture and human rights abuses against them in the late 1970's when \nthey lived in that country. The court's descriptions of the abuse are \nchilling, and included whipping a naked woman with a wire for hours and \nthreatening her with death in the presence of several men. The court's \naward of compensatory and punitive damages in the amount of $1,500,000 \nto the plaintiffs was subsequently affirmed by an appellate court. See \nAbebe-Jira v. Negewo, 72 F.3d 844 (11th Cir. 1996). Yet, while Negewo's \ncase was on appeal, the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted \nhim citizenship.\n  As Professor William Aceves of California Western School of Law has \nnoted, this case reveals ``a glaring and troubling limitation in \ncurrent immigration law and practice. This case is not unique. Other \naliens who have committed gross human rights violations have also \ngained entry into the United States and been granted immigration \nrelief.'' The Rutland Herald got it right when it opined on October 31, \n1999, that:\n\n       For the U.S. commitment to human rights to mean anything, \n     U.S. policies must be strong and consistent. It is not enough \n     to denounce war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo or elsewhere and \n     then wink as the perpetrators of torture and mass murder slip \n     across the border to find a home in America.\n\n  The Immigration and Nationality Act currently provides that (i) \nparticipants in Nazi persecutions during the time period from March 23, \n1933 to May 8, 1945, and (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, are \ninadmissible to the United States and deportable. See 8 U.S.C. \nSec. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i) and Sec. 1227(a)(4)(D). This legislation would \namend these sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act by \nexpanding the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover \naliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad.\n  ``Torture'' is already defined in the Federal criminal code, 18 \nU.S.C. Sec.  2340, in a law passed as part of the implementing \nlegislation for the ``Convention Against Torture,'' under which the \nUnited States has an affirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its \nboundaries regardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C. \nSec.  2340A (1994). As defined in the federal criminal code, torture \nmeans any act committed by a person acting under the color of law \nspecifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or \nsuffering upon another person within his custody or physical control. \nThis could include prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from \nthe infliction or threat to inflict physical pain, threats to kill \nanother person, or the administration of mind-altering substances or \nprocedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality \nof another person. Under this definition, torturers include both those \nwho issue the orders to torture innocent people as well as those who \nimplement those orders.\n  The legislation would also amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n8 U.S.C. Sec.  1103, by directing the Attorney General to establish an \nOffice of Special Investigations (OSI) within the Department of Justice \nwith authorization to investigate, remove, denaturalize, or prosecute \nany alien who has participated in torture or genocide abroad. Attorney \nGeneral Civiletti established OSI in 1979 within the Criminal Division \nof the Department of Justice, consolidating within it all \n``investigative and litigation activities involving individuals, who \nprior to and during World War II, under the supervision of or in \nassociation with the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other \naffiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered, incited, \nassisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person \nbecause of race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.'' \n(Attorney Gen. Order No. 851-79). The OSI's mission continues to be \nlimited by that Attorney General Order.\n  The legislation would provide statutory authorization for Office of \nSpecial Investigation, and would expand its jurisdiction to authorize \ninvestigations, prosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated \nin torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI in \nhunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the effectiveness of \ncentralized resources and expertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and \nit is time to update its mission. The knowledge of the people, politics \nand pathologies of particular regimes engaged in genocide and human \nrights abuses is often necessary for effective prosecutions of these \ncases and may best be accomplished by the concentrated efforts of a \nsingle office, rather than in piecemeal litigation around the country \nor in offices that have more diverse missions.\n\n  I appreciate that this part of the legislation has proven \ncontroversial within the Department of Justice, but others have \nconcurred in my judgment that the OSI is an appropriate component of \nthe Department to address the new responsibilities proposed in the \nbill. Professor Aceves, who has studied these matters extensively, has \nconcluded that OSI's ``methodology for pursuing Nazi war criminals can \nbe applied with equal rigor to other perpetrators of human rights \nviolations. As the number of Nazi war criminals inevitably declines, \nthe OSI can begin to enforce U.S. immigration laws against perpetrators \nof genocide and other gross violations of human rights.''\n  Similarly, the Rutland Herald recently noted that the INS has never \ndeported an immigrant on the basis of human rights abuses, while the \nOSI has deported 48 ex-Nazis and stripped 61 of U.S. citizenship, while \nmaintaining a list of 60,000 suspected war criminals with the aim of \nbarring them from entry. Based on this record, the Rutland Herald \nconcluded that the legislation correctly looks to OSI to carry out the \nadditional responsibilities called for in the bill, noting that:\n\n       It resolves a turf war between the INS and the OSI in favor \n     of the OSI, which is as it should be. The victims of human \n     rights abuses are often victimized again when, seeking refuge \n     in the United States, they are confronted by the draconian \n     policies of the INS. It's a better idea to give the job of \n     finding war criminals to the office that has shown it knows \n     how to do the job.\n\n  Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice \nremains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from \nthe OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the \nbill for OSI's expanded duties. I would like to recognize the reporting \nof Boston Globe reporter Steve Fainaru, whose ground-breaking series \nhas illuminated the need for a more focused response to this problem.\n  Regarding the sections Denying Safe Haven to International Criminals \nand Promoting Global Cooperation (Title I and II), I initially \nintroduced title I, section 102 of this bill, regarding fugitive \ndisentitlement, on April 30, 1998, in S. 2011, the ``Money Laundering \nEnforcement and Combating Drugs in Prisons Act of 1998,'' with Senators \nDaschle, Kohl, Feinstein and Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I \nintroduced with Senator Biden, on behalf of the Administration, S. \n2303, the ``International Crime Control Act of 1998,'' which contains \nmost of the provisions set forth in titles I and II of this bill. \nVirtually all of the provisions in these two titles of the bill were \nalso included in another major anti-crime bill, S. 2484, the ``Safe \nSchools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' which I \nintroduced on September 16, 1998, along with Senators Daschle, Biden, \nMoseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Bingaman, Reid, \nMurray, Dorgan, and Torricelli. In addition, Senator Hatch and I \nincluded title II, section 201 of this bill, regarding streamlined \nprocedures for MLAT requests in S. 2536, our ``International Crime and \nAnti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998,'' which passed the Senate last \nOctober 15, 1998.\n  We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete \nimprovements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions \nmay be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law \nenforcement priority.\n  Title I sets forth important proposals for combating international \ncrime and denying safe havens to international criminals. The \nsubstitute amendment adopted by the Judiciary Committee to the original \nbill removed sections 1 and 2, which set forth detailed procedures and \nsafeguards for proceeding with extradition for offenses not covered in \na treaty.\n  Section 101 of the bill considered by the Senate today would add a \nnew section 4116 to title 18, United States Code, authorizing the \nAttorney General to request the temporary transfer to the United States \nof a person, who is in pretrial detention or custody in a\n\n[[Page S14011]]\n\nforeign country, to face prosecution, if the Attorney General, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, determines that such transfer \nwould be consistent with the international obligations of the United \nStates. The section would also authorize the Attorney General to \ntransfer temporarily to a foreign country a person, who is in pretrial \ndetention or custody in the United States and found extraditable to the \nforeign country, to face prosecution in the foreign country, if the \nAttorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, \ndetermines that such transfer would be consistent with the \ninternational obligations of the United States. Consent of state \nauthorities would be required for persons in state custody.\n  Section 102 is designed to stop drug kingpins, terrorists and other \ninternational fugitives from using our courts to fight to keep the \nproceeds of the very crimes for which they are wanted. Criminals should \nnot be able to use our courts at the same time they are evading our \nlaws. Specifically, this section adds a new section 2466 to title 28, \nUnited States Code, that would bar a person, who purposely leaves the \nUnited States or declines to submit to or otherwise evades U.S. \njurisdiction where a criminal case is pending against the person, from \nparticipating as a party in a civil action over a related civil or \ncriminal forfeiture claim. The Supreme Court recently decided that a \nprevious judge-made rule to the same effect required a statutory basis. \nThis section provides that basis.\n  Section 103 would amend section 4100(b) of title 18, United States \nCode, to permit transfer, on a case-by-case basis, of prisoners to \ntheir home country to serve their sentences, where such transfer is \nprovided by treaty. Under this section, the prisoner need not consent \nto the transfer.\n  Section 104 would add a new section 4087 to title 18, United States \nCode, that would provide a statutory basis for holding and transferring \nprisoners who are sent from one foreign country to another through \nUnited States airports, at the discretion of the Attorney General.\n  Title II of the bill is designed to promote global cooperation in the \nfight against international crime. Section 201 would permit United \nStates courts involved in multi-district litigation to enforce mutual \nlegal assistance treaties and other agreements to execute foreign \nrequests for assistance in criminal matters in all districts involved \nin the litigation. Specifically, this provision would add a new section \n1785 to title 18, United States Code, that would authorize the Attorney \nGeneral to present requests from foreign governments for assistance in \ncriminal cases pursuant to mutual legal assistance treaties and other \nagreements when the enforcement involves multiple districts. Compulsory \nmeasures may be used to require persons to produce testimony or \nevidence where they reside or the evidence is located, or the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. A person ordered to \nproduce testimony or evidence outside the jurisdiction of residence may \npetition to appear in the district where the person resides.\n  Section 202 outlines procedures for the temporary transfer of \nincarcerated witnesses. Mutual legal assistance treaties (``MLATS'') \ngenerally already provide a mechanism for the United States to send and \nreceive persons in custody who are needed as witnesses, either in our \ncourts or foreign courts for criminal cases. These witnesses are often \ncooperating to obtain a lighter sentence. Section 3508 of title 18, \nUnited States Code, enacted in 1988, already provides the authority, \nabsent such a MLAT, for the Attorney General to request foreign \nwitnesses, who are in custody, to come to the United States to testify \nin criminal cases here, and to assure their expeditious return to the \nforeign country. The bill would amend section 3508 to permit the \nAttorney General, as a matter of comity and reciprocity, to send United \nStates prisoners abroad to testify, according to the terms and \nconditions of the MLAT. If there is no MLAT, the Attorney General may \nonly send a United States prisoner abroad to testify with the \nprisoner's consent and, where applicable, the State holding the \nprisoner. Decisions of the Attorney General respecting such transfers \nare to be made in conjunction with the Secretary of State.\n  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. \nThey are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, for his help in making this bill a reality. \nWorking together, we were able to pass bipartisan legislation that will \naccomplish what all of us want, a safer and more secure America.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the committee amendment, as amended, be agreed \nto, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2510) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1754), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1754\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (ii) 27 percent for all other households in the United \n     States; and\n       (B) overcrowding in the Native Hawaiian population is 36 \n     percent as compared to 3 percent for all other households in \n     the United States;\n       (7) among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of \n     Native Hawaiians, as that term is defined in section 801 of \n     the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \n     Act of 1996, as added by section 3 of this Act, eligible to \n     reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands are the most severe, as--\n       (A) the percentage of overcrowding in Native Hawaiian \n     households on the Hawaiian Home Lands is 36 percent; and\n       (B) approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, which constitute \n     95 percent of the Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside \n     on the Hawaiian Home Lands, are in need of housing;\n       (8) applying the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development guidelines--\n       (A) 70.8 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or \n     who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     incomes that fall below the median family income; and\n       (B) 50 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who \n     are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     incomes below 30 percent of the median family income;\n       (9) \\1/3\\ of those Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands pay more than 30 percent of \n     their income for shelter, and \\1/2\\ of those Native Hawaiians \n     face overcrowding;\n       (10) the extraordinarily severe housing needs of Native \n     Hawaiians demonstrate that Native Hawaiians who either reside \n     on, or are eligible to reside on, Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     been denied equal access to Federal low-income housing \n     assistance programs available to other qualified residents of \n     the United States, and that a more effective means of \n     addressing their housing needs must be authorized;\n       (11) consistent with the recommendations of the National \n     Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Housing, and in order to address the continuing \n     prevalence of extraordinarily severe housing needs among \n     Native Hawaiians who either reside or are eligible to reside \n     on the Hawaiian Home Lands, Congress finds it necessary to \n     extend the Federal low-income housing assistance available to \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives under the Native American \n     Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 \n     U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) to those Native Hawaiians;\n       (12) under the treatymaking power of the United States, \n     Congress had the constitutional\n\n[[Page S14015]]\n\n     authority to confirm a treaty between the United States and \n     the government that represented the Hawaiian people, and from \n     1826 until 1893, the United States recognized the \n     independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, extended full \n     diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government, and \n     entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian \n     monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, \n     1849, 1875, and 1887;\n       (13) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty \n     over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never \n     relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign \n     lands;\n       (B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their race, but because of their unique status as \n     the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom \n     the United States has established a trust relationship;\n       (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii;\n       (D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is comparable \n     to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; and\n       (E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United States \n     have--\n       (i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal \n     affairs; and\n       (ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n     governance that has never been extinguished;\n       (14) the political relationship between the United States \n     and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and \n     reaffirmed by the United States as evidenced by the inclusion \n     of Native Hawaiians in--\n       (A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     2291 et seq.);\n       (B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1996 et seq.);\n       (C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 80q et seq.);\n       (D) the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation \n     Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);\n       (E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.);\n       (F) the Native American Languages Act of 1992 (106 Stat. \n     3434);\n       (G) the American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian \n     Culture and Arts Development Act (20 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.);\n       (H) the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1501 et \n     seq.); and\n       (I) the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et \n     seq.); and\n       (15) in the area of housing, the United States has \n     recognized and reaffirmed the political relationship with the \n     Native Hawaiian people through--\n       (A) the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, \n     1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), which set aside approximately \n     200,000 acres of public lands that became known as Hawaiian \n     Home Lands in the Territory of Hawaii that had been ceded to \n     the United States for homesteading by Native Hawaiians in \n     order to rehabilitate a landless and dying people;\n       (B) the enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', \n     approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4)--\n       (i) by ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public \n     lands formerly held by the United States, and mandating that \n     those lands be held in public trust, for the betterment of \n     the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as that term is defined \n     in section 201 of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 \n     Stat. 108 et seq.); and\n       (ii) by transferring the United States responsibility for \n     the administration of Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands which comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), enacted by the \n     legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting the rights of \n     beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (C) the authorization of mortgage loans insured by the \n     Federal Housing Administration for the purchase, \n     construction, or refinancing of homes on Hawaiian Home Lands \n     under the Act of June 27, 1934 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``National Housing Act'' (42 Stat. 1246 et seq., chapter 847; \n     12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.));\n       (D) authorizing Native Hawaiian representation on the \n     National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and \n     Native Hawaiian Housing under Public Law 101-235;\n       (E) the inclusion of Native Hawaiians in the definition \n     under section 3764 of title 38, United States Code, \n     applicable to subchapter V of chapter 37 of title 38, United \n     States Code (relating to a housing loan program for Native \n     American veterans); and\n       (F) the enactment of the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act \n     (109 Stat. 357; 48 U.S.C. 491, note prec.) which establishes \n     a process for the conveyance of Federal lands to the \n     Department of Hawaiian Homes Lands that are equivalent in \n     value to lands acquired by the United States from the \n     Hawaiian Home Lands inventory.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has undertaken a responsibility to \n     promote the general welfare of the United States by--\n       (A) employing its resources to remedy the unsafe and \n     unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of \n     decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of lower \n     income; and\n       (B) developing effective partnerships with governmental and \n     private entities to accomplish the objectives referred to in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (2) the United States has a special responsibility for the \n     welfare of the Native peoples of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians;\n       (3) pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), the United \n     States set aside 200,000 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii in order to \n     establish a homeland for the native people of Hawaii--Native \n     Hawaiians;\n       (4) despite the intent of Congress in 1920 to address the \n     housing needs of Native Hawaiians through the enactment of \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et \n     seq.), Native Hawaiians eligible to reside on the Hawaiian \n     home lands have been foreclosed from participating in Federal \n     housing assistance programs available to all other eligible \n     families in the United States;\n       (5) although Federal housing assistance programs have been \n     administered on a racially neutral basis in the State of \n     Hawaii, Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet \n     need for housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the \n     United States;\n       (6) among the Native American population of the United \n     States, Native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of \n     housing problems in the United States, as the percentage--\n       (A) of housing problems in the Native Hawaiian population \n     is 49 percent, as compared to--\n       (i) 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska Native \n     households in Indian country; and\n       (ii) 27 percent for all other households in the United \n     States; and\n       (B) overcrowding in the Native Hawaiian population is 36 \n     percent as compared to 3 percent for all other households in \n     the United States;\n       (7) among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of \n     Native Hawaiians, as that term is defined in section 801 of \n     the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \n     Act of 1996, as added by section 3 of this Act, eligible to \n     reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands are the most severe, as--\n       (A) the percentage of overcrowding in Native Hawaiian \n     households on the Hawaiian Home Lands is 36 percent; and\n       (B) approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, which constitute \n     95 percent of the Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside \n     on the Hawaiian Home Lands, are in need of housing;\n       (8) applying the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development guidelines--\n       (A) 70.8 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or \n     who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     incomes that fall below the median family income; and\n       (B) 50 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who \n     are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     incomes below 30 percent of the median family income;\n       (9) \\1/3\\ of those Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands pay more than 30 percent of \n     their income for shelter, and \\1/2\\ of those Native Hawaiians \n     face overcrowding;\n       (10) the extraordinarily severe housing needs of Native \n     Hawaiians demonstrate that Native Hawaiians who either reside \n     on, or are eligible to reside on, Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     been denied equal access to Federal low-income housing \n     assistance programs available to other qualified residents of \n     the United States, and that a more effective means of \n     addressing their housing needs must be authorized;\n       (11) consistent with the recommendations of the National \n     Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Housing, and in order to address the continuing \n     prevalence of extraordinarily severe housing needs among \n     Native Hawaiians who either reside or are eligible to reside \n     on the Hawaiian Home Lands, Congress finds it necessary to \n     extend the Federal low-income housing assistance available to \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives under the Native American \n     Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 \n     U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) to those Native Hawaiians;\n       (12) under the treatymaking power of the United States, \n     Congress had the constitutional authority to confirm a treaty \n     between the United States and the government that represented \n     the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, the United \n     States recognized the independence of the Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     extended full diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian \n     Government, and entered into treaties and conventions with \n     the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in \n     1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887;\n\n[[Page S14023]]\n\n       (13) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty \n     over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never \n     relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign \n     lands;\n       (B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their race, but because of their unique status as \n     the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom \n     the United States has established a trust relationship;\n       (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii;\n       (D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is comparable \n     to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to urge passage of S. 438, The \nChippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved \nWater Rights Settlement Act of 1999, introduced by myself and Senator \nBaucus of Montana. S. 438 is the ratification of an agreement among the \nUnited States, the State of Montana and the Chippewa Cree Tribe \nsettling the water rights of the Tribe in Montana. This represents a \nfair and equitable settlement that will enhance the ability of the \nTribe to develop a sustainable economy while protecting existing \ninvestments in water use by off-Reservation ranchers who rely on water \nfor their livelihoods.\n  The Settlement was negotiated with extensive involvement by the Tribe \nand its members, the State of Montana, the Administration, and the \nwater users who own private land on streams shared with the \nReservation. It has the support of all those affected and received the \noverwhelming support of the Montana Legislature when presented for \nratification in 1997.\n  It is a tribute to the Governor of Montana, Marc Racicot, represented \nby the Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission; the chairman of the \nTribe, Bert Corcoran and the Tribe Negotiating Team; David Hayes, \nActing Deputy Secretary of the Interior, the Federal negotiating team; \nand the water users on Big Sandy and Beaver Creeks in the Milk River \nvalley of Montana, that this Compact represents a truly local solution \nthat takes into account the needs and sovereign rights of each party.\n  In addition to ratifying the Settlement, the bill provides the \nnecessary authorization for funding to develop the water resources on \nthe Reservation and to assure a safe drinking water supply for the \nTribe. For several years we have worked closely with the Senate Indian \nAffairs and Energy Committees to fashion a bill that is consistent with \nfederal policy toward Indian tribes. Thanks to the substantial efforts \nof the Committees, I believe we have accomplished that goal.\n  This is the first Indian water right settlement to come before \nCongress in many years. in approving the Chippewa Cree Settlement Act, \nwe have the opportunity to send the message to western States that we \nendorse negotiation as the preferred method of Indian water right \nquantification, and that we will defer to States and Tribes to fashion \ntheir own approach to the allocation of water.\n  In closing, I believe that the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's \nReservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act is an historic \nagreement. This is truly a local solution that takes into account the \nneeds and sovereign rights of each party. Just as the mentioned parties \nhave worked closely together to get us to the submission of this bill \ntoday, I want to thank all members of Congress with whom I worked \nclosely to ensure passage of this important bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate will pass \nthe Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Reserved Water \nRights Settlement. The legislation ratifies the Compact approved by the \nState and the Tribe in 1997. I was proud to sponsor this legislation in \nthe 105th with Senator Burns as a co-sponsor, and had the 2nd Session \nof that Congress lasted a few more weeks, I believe the bill would have \nbeen approved by the Senate. Once again this year, Senator Burns and I \njointly introduced this legislation. The passage of this bill is the \nculmination of 16 years of extensive technical studies and six years of \nrather intensive negotiations in our state involving the Chippewa Cree \nTribe, the Montana State government, off-Reservation county and \nmunicipal governments in north-central Montana, local ranchers, and the \nUnited States Departments of Justice and Interior.\n  The 122,000-acre Rocky Boy's Reservation sits west of Havre, Montana \non several tributaries of the Milk River on what was formerly the Fort \nAssiniboine Military Reserve. Unfortunately, the portion of the land \nreserved for the Chippewa Cree is rough and arid. Without irrigation, \nmuch of the land is not suitable for farming. Recent studies have \ndemonstrated that the Reservation could not sustain the membership of \nthe Chippewa Cree Tribe as a permanent homeland without an infusion of \nadditional water. The development of a viable reservation economy calls \nfor more water for drinking purposes, as well as for agriculture and \nother municipal uses. In 1982, acting in its fiduciary capacity as \ntrustee for the Tribe, the United States filed a claim for the water \nrights of the Chippewa Cree in the State of Montana general stream \nadjudication. Were it not for the negotiated settlement represented by \nthis legislation, divisive and costly litigation would be pending \nbetween the State, the Tribe, the United States and non-Indian ranchers \nfor many years to come. Fortunately, in 1979, the Montana legislature \narticulated a policy in favor of negotiation and established the \nMontana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission to negotiate compacts \nfor the equitable division and apportionment of waters between the \nstate and its people and several Indian tribes claiming reserved water \nrights within the state.\n  From the initial meeting in 1992, to the conclusion of an agreed on \nwater rights Compact in 1997, the State, the Federal Government and the \nTribe acted in good faith and worked together to explore options. This \nculminated in passage of a resolution by the Chippewa Cree Tribal \nCouncil to ratify the Compact on January 9, 1997. Following \noverwhelming approval by the Montana Legislature and appropriation of \nfunds for implementation, Governor Marc Racicot signed the Compact into \nstate law on April 14, 1997. Subsequent negotiation, in which staff \nfrom my office assisted the State and Tribe, resulted in approval by \nthe United States Departments of the Interior and Justice and drafting \nof this bill by the three parties.\n  The litigation filed in State water court in 1982 is stayed pending \nthe outcome of this bill. Once passed, the United States, the Tribe and \nthe State of Montana will petition the Montana Water Court to enter a \ndecree reflecting the water rights of the Tribe.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this very positive legislation. \nAfter years of hard work and negotiations, we have a victory to be \nthankful for at last.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read the third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2512) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 438), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 438\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in fulfillment of its trust responsibility to Indian \n     tribes and to promote tribal sovereignty and economic self-\n     sufficiency, it is the policy of the United States to settle \n     the water rights claims of the tribes without lengthy and \n     costly litigation;\n       (2) the Rocky Boy's Reservation was established as a \n     homeland for the Chippewa Cree Tribe;\n       (3) adequate water for the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky \n     Boy's Reservation is important to a permanent, sustainable, \n     and sovereign homeland for the Tribe and its members;\n       (4) the sovereignty of the Chippewa Cree Tribe and the \n     economy of the Reservation depend on the development of the \n     water resources of the Reservation;\n       (5) the planning, design, and construction of the \n     facilities needed to utilize water supplies effectively are \n     necessary to the development of a viable Reservation economy \n     and to implementation of the Chippewa Cree-Montana Water \n     Rights Compact;\n       (6) the Rocky Boy's Reservation is located in a water-short \n     area of Montana and it is appropriate that the Act provide \n     funding for\n\n[[Page S14033]]\n\n     the development of additional water supplies, including \n     domestic water, to meet the needs of the Chippewa Cree Tribe;\n       (7) proceedings to determine the full extent of the water \n     rights of the Chippewa Cree Tribe are currently pending \n     before the Montana Water Court as a part of In the Matter of \n     the Adjudication of All Rights to the Use of Water, Both \n     Surface and Underground, within the State of Montana;\n       (8) recognizing that final resolution of the general stream \n     adjudication will take many years and entail great expense to \n     all parties, prolong uncertainty as to the availability of \n     water supplies, and seriously impair the long-term economic \n     planning and development of all parties, the Chippewa Cree \n     Tribe and the State of Montana entered into the Compact on \n     April 14, 1997; and\n       (9) the allocation of water resources from the Tiber \n     Reservoir to the Chippewa Cree Tribe under this Act is \n     uniquely suited to the geographic, social, and economic \n     characteristics of the area and situation involved.\n\n      SEC. 3.

AUTHORITY FOR RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Broadcasting Board of Governors shall \n     further the open communication of information and ideas \n     through the increased use of radio and television \n     broadcasting to Yugoslavia in both the Serbo-Croatian and \n     Albanian languages.\n       (b) Implementation.--Radio and television broadcasting \n     under subsection (a) shall be carried out by the Voice of \n     America and, in addition, radio broadcasting under that \n     subsection shall be carried out by RFE/RL, Incorporated. \n     Subsection (a) shall be carried out in accordance with all \n     the respective Voice of America and RFE/RL, Incorporated, \n     standards to ensure that radio and television broadcasting to \n     Yugoslavia serves as a consistently reliable and \n     authoritative source of accurate, objective, and \n     comprehensive news.\n       (c) Statutory Construction.--The implementation of \n     subsection (a) may not be construed as a replacement for the \n     strengthening of indigenous independent media called for in \n     section 102(a)(3)(C). To the maximum extent practicable, the \n     two efforts (strengthening independent media and increasing \n     broadcasts into Serbia) shall be carried out in such a way \n     that they mutually support each other.\n\n       TITLE II--ASSISTANCE TO THE VICTIMS OF SERBIAN OPPRESSION\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Beginning in February 1998 and ending in June 1999, the \n     armed forces of Yugoslavia and the Serbian Interior Ministry \n     police force engaged in a brutal crackdown against the ethnic \n     Albanian population in Kosovo.\n       (2) As a result of the attack by Yugoslav and Serbian \n     forces against the Albanian population of Kosovo, more than \n     10,000 individuals have been killed and 1,500,000 individuals \n     were displaced from their homes.\n       (3) The majority of the individuals displaced by the \n     conflict in Kosovo was left homeless or was forced to find \n     temporary shelter in Kosovo or outside the country.\n       (4) The activities of the Yugoslav armed forces and the \n     police force of the Serbian Interior Ministry resulted in the \n     widespread destruction of agricultural crops, livestock, and \n     property, as well as the poisoning of wells and water \n     supplies, and the looting of humanitarian goods provided by \n     the international community.\n\n     SEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflict \n     in Kosovo, including refugees and internally displaced \n     persons, and all assistance to rebuild damaged property in \n     Kosovo, should be the responsibility of the Government of \n     Yugoslavia and the Government of Serbia;\n       (2) under the direction of President Milosevic, neither the \n     Government of Yugoslavia nor the Government of Serbia has \n     provided the resources to assist innocent, civilian victims \n     of oppression in Kosovo; and\n       (3) because neither the Government of Yugoslavia nor the \n     Government of Serbia has fulfilled the responsibilities of a \n     sovereign government toward the people in Kosovo, the \n     international community offers the only recourse for \n     humanitarian assistance to victims of oppression in Kosovo.\n\n     SEC. 203. ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The President is authorized to furnish \n     assistance under section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2292) and the Migration and Refugee \n     Assistance Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.), as \n     appropriate, for--\n       (1) relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in Kosovo;

and\n       (2) the President should encourage all other European \n     countries to diminish their level of diplomatic relations \n     with Yugoslavia.\n       (i) International Financial Institution Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``international financial institution'' \n     includes the International Monetary Fund, the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \n     Development Association, the International Finance \n     Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency, and \n     the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\n     SEC. 302.

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER \n                   YUGOSLAVIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 827, which \n     was adopted May 25, 1993, established the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to prosecute \n     persons responsible for serious violations of international \n     humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former \n     Yugoslavia since January 1, 1991.\n       (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 requires \n     full cooperation by all countries with the Tribunal, \n     including the obligation of countries to comply with requests \n     of the Tribunal for assistance or orders.\n       (3) The Government of Yugoslavia has disregarded its \n     international obligations with regard to the Tribunal, \n     including its obligation to transfer or facilitate the \n     transfer to the Tribunal of any person on the territory of \n     Yugoslavia who has been indicted for war crimes or other \n     crimes against humanity under the jurisdiction of the \n     Tribunal.\n       (4) The Government of Yugoslavia publicly rejected the \n     Tribunal's jurisdiction over events in Kosovo and has impeded \n     the investigation of representatives from the Tribunal, \n     including denying those representatives visas for entry into \n     Yugoslavia, in their efforts to gather information about \n     alleged crimes against humanity in Kosovo under the \n     jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n       (5) The Tribunal has indicted President Slobodan Milosevic \n     for--\n       (A) crimes against humanity, specifically murder, \n     deportations, and persecutions; and\n       (B) violations of the laws and customs of war.\n       (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States to \n     support fully and completely the investigation of President \n     Slobodan Milosevic by the International Criminal Tribunal for \n     the former Yugoslavia for genocide, crimes against humanity, \n     war crimes, and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.\n       (c) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), it is the sense \n     of Congress that the United States Government should gather \n     all information that the intelligence community (as defined \n     in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. 401a(4)) collects or has collected to support an \n     investigation of President Slobodan Milosevic for genocide, \n     crimes against humanity, war crimes, and grave breaches of \n     the Geneva Convention by the International Criminal Tribunal \n     for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and that the Department of \n     State should provide all appropriate information to the \n     Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY under procedures \n     established by the Director of Central Intelligence that are \n     necessary to ensure adequate protection of intelligence \n     sources and methods.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not less than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, \n     the President shall submit a report, in classified form if \n     necessary, to the appropriate congressional committees that \n     describes the information that was provided by the Department \n     of State to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for the purposes \n     of subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 502. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO ETHNIC HUNGARIANS \n                   OF VOJVODINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) approximately 350,000 ethnic Hungarians reside in the \n     province of Vojvodina, part of Serbia, in traditional \n     settlements in existence for centuries;\n       (2) this community has taken no side in any of the Balkan \n     conflicts since 1990, but has maintained a consistent \n     position of nonviolence, while seeking to protect its \n     existence through the meager opportunities afforded under the \n     existing political system;\n       (3) the Serbian leadership deprived Vojvodina of its \n     autonomous status at the same time as it did the same to the \n     province of Kosovo;\n       (4) this population is subject to continuous harassment, \n     intimidation, and threatening suggestions that they leave the \n     land of their ancestors; and\n       (5) during the past 10 years this form of ethnic cleansing \n     has already driven 50,000 ethnic Hungarians out of the \n     province of Vojvodina.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should--\n       (1) condemn harassment, threats, and intimidation against \n     any ethnic group in Yugoslavia as the usual precursor of \n     violent ethnic cleansing;\n       (2) express deep concern over the reports on recent \n     threats, intimidation, and even violent incidents against the \n     ethnic Hungarian inhabitants of the province of Vojvodina;\n       (3) call on the Secretary of State to regularly monitor the \n     situation of the Hungarian ethnic group in Vojvodina; and\n       (4) call on the NATO allies of the United States, during \n     any negotiation on the future status of Kosovo, also to pay \n     substantial attention to establishing satisfactory guarantees \n     for the rights of the ethnic Hungarian community of \n     Vojvodina, and of other ethnic minorities in the province, \n     including consulting with elected leaders about their \n     proposal for self-administration.\n\n     SEC. 503. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR \n                   PROPERTIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The international judicial system, as currently \n     structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful \n     confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the \n     use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and \n     private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the \n     property.\n       (2) Since the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia, the Government of Yugoslavia has exclusively \n     used, and benefited from the use of, properties located in \n     the United States that were owned by the Socialist Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (3) The Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the \n     Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Slovenia have been \n     blocked by the Government of Yugoslavia from using, or \n     benefiting from the use of, any property located in the \n     United States that was previously owned by the Socialist \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The continued occupation and use by officials of \n     Yugoslavia of that property without prompt, adequate, and \n     effective compensation under the applicable principles of \n     international law to the Governments of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of \n     Macedonia, and Slovenia are unjust and unreasonable.\n       (b) Policy on Negotiations Regarding Properties.--It is the \n     policy of the United States to insist that the Government of \n     Yugoslavia has a responsibility to, and should, actively and \n     cooperatively engage in good faith negotiations with the \n     Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former \n     Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Slovenia for resolution \n     of the outstanding property issues resulting from the \n     dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \n     including the disposition of the following properties located \n     in the United States:\n       (1) 2222 Decatur Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (2) 2410 California Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (3) 1907 Quincy Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (4) 3600 Edmonds Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (5) 2221 R Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (6) 854 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY.\n       (7) 730 Park Avenue, New York, NY.\n       (c) Sense of Congress on Return of Properties.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that, if the Government of Yugoslavia \n     refuses to engage in good faith negotiations on the status of \n     the properties listed in subsection (b), the President should \n     take steps to ensure that the interests of the Governments of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic \n     of Macedonia, and Slovenia are protected in accordance with \n     international law.\n\n     SEC. 504. TRANSITION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     once the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic has been \n     replaced by a government that is committed to democratic \n     principles and the rule of law, and that respects \n     internationally recognized human rights, the President of the \n     United States should support the transition to democracy in \n     Yugoslavia by providing immediate and substantial assistance, \n     including facilitating its integration into international \n     organizations.\n       (b) Authorization of Assistance.--The President is \n     authorized to furnish assistance to Yugoslavia if he \n     determines, and so certifies to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the Government of Yugoslavia is committed to \n     democratic principles and the rule of law and respects \n     internationally recognized human rights.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--\n       (1) Development of plan.--The President shall develop a \n     plan for providing assistance to Yugoslavia in accordance \n     with this section.\n\n[[Page S14040]]\n\n      Such assistance would be provided at such time as the \n     President determines that the Government of Yugoslavia is \n     committed to democratic principles and the rule of law and \n     respects internationally recognized human rights.\n       (2) Strategy.--The plan developed under paragraph (1) shall \n     include a strategy for distributing assistance to Yugoslavia \n     under the plan.\n       (3) Diplomatic efforts.--The President shall take the \n     necessary steps--\n       (A) to seek to obtain the agreement of other countries and \n     international financial institutions and other multilateral \n     organizations to provide assistance to Yugoslavia after the \n     President determines that the Government of Yugoslavia is \n     committed to democratic principles, the rule of law, and that \n     respects internationally recognized human rights; and\n       (B) to work with such countries, institutions, and \n     organizations to coordinate all such assistance programs.\n       (4) Communication of plan.--The President shall take the \n     necessary steps to communicate to the people of Yugoslavia \n     the plan for assistance developed under this section.\n       (5) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report describing in \n     detail the plan required to be developed by paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering the Serbia \nDemocratization Act, which I introduced on March 25 with eleven other \nSenators, and which was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee on \nAugust 5.\n  The purpose of the legislation is clear: to undermine and ultimately \neradicate the murderous regime of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan \nMilosevic.\n  Just one day before I introduced this legislation, NATO began its air \ncampaign against Yugoslavia in response to that country's brutal \ntreatment of the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo. After NATO bombs \nstarted falling, Yugoslav army, police, and paramilitary forces \ncontrolled by Mr. Milosevic slaughtered thousands more Kosovar \nAlbanians. More than one million were forced to flee Kosovo to \nneighboring counties. And hundreds of thousands more Kosovars eluded \nSerb forces by hiding in the hills.\n  This brutality was conceived, directed, and carried out under the \norders of Slobodan Milosevic. As you know, Mr. President, the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted this \nmadman as a war criminal for his activities in Kosovo. And if I might \nadd, I have no doubt of his culpability for the ethnic cleansing and \nmass murder in Bosnia during the war there.\n  Now that the NATO bombs have stopped falling and there is hope for a \npeaceful future for the people of Kosovo, we must look to the next \nstep. A ``Marshall Plan'' for the Balkans has been proposed. The \nEuropean Union, the United States, and other allies have negotiated a \nso-called ``Stability Pact'' for Southeastern Europe, designed to \nencourage cooperation between countries in the region and target \nforeign assistance most effectively.\n  But no matter what kind of proposals put forth by the United States \nand our allies for this region, I am convinced that until the Balkans \nis rid of the dictatorial rule of Mr. Milosevic, we will be forced to \nconfront crises that he manufactures well into the future. There is but \none hope for stability in the Balkans, and that is the removal of \nMilosevic from power.\n  To achieve that objective is why I encourage the Senate to pass this \nlegislation today. The United States should provide extensive support \nfor democratic forces, including independent media, and non-\ngovernmental organizations in Serbia. Just as the United States did \nduring the days of the cold war, it is in our interests to identify and \ngive aid to those forces in Serbia that share our values and our goals. \nWe should make clear that unless and until the government of Yugoslavia \nis based on democratic principles and the rule of law and respects \ninternationally recognized human rights, the United States will \nmaintain the sanctions regime that we have in place today.\n  But Mr. President, when the Serbian people have a government in \nBelgrade based on these important principles--the government that they \ndeserve--this legislation calls for substantial support by the United \nStates to assist their transition to democracy, including by helping \nYugoslavia integrate into international institutions.\n  I am pleased that the Clinton administration agrees with me on the \nimportance of assisting the democratic opposition in Serbia. Let me \nemphasize, however, that we need to act quickly. We missed an \nopportunity to encourage democratic change in Serbia three years ago, \nwhen tens of thousands of Serbian citizens took to the streets, \ndemanding political change. We must not lose another chance to help \nthose in Serbia who are trying to help themselves.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Serbia Democratization Act.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to support, along with the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina and several other colleagues, the \nSerbia Democratization Act of 1999.\n  Mr. President, the last year has removed any lingering doubt that \nSlobodan Milosevic, rather than being part of the solution of the \nproblems in the Balkans, is the problem. Milosevic has started, and \nlost, four wars during this decade: first with Slovenia, then with \nCroatia, then with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and finally with NATO over \nKosovo. I would not be surprised if he were soon to make Montenegro, \nwith its democratic-reformist government, the fifth target of his \naggression.\n  Earlier this year, Milosevic was indicted as a war criminal by the \nInternational Tribunal at The Hague. As my colleagues have heard me \nrecount, I told Milosevic to his face way back in 1993 in Belgrade that \nhe was a war criminal and should be tried at The Hague. So in one sense \nI am gratified that he finally has been officially charged. On the \nother hand, I know that as long as Milosevic remains in power in Serbia \nand Yugoslavia, there is no chance for lasting peace and reconstruction \nin the Balkans.\n  In short, Milosevic must be replaced by a democratic government. This \nis no small order. Serbia is not exactly overflowing with genuine \ndemocrats, although there certainly are some. The problem is that many \nof them squabble among themselves, thereby wasting precious energy that \nshould be devoted to unseating Milosevic.\n  Moreover, Milosevic runs an authoritarian state, ruthlessly \nsuppressing dissent, threatening his opponents--even sometimes \nattempting to assassinate them, purging the army and police, and \ncynically dominating the electronic media so as to misinform the \nSerbian public.\n  Clearly it is in the national interest of the United States to use \nevery legal means to undercut Milosevic and to assist the democratic \nopposition in Serbia.\n  With that in mind, we have introduced S. 720, the ``Serbia \nDemocratization Act of 1999.'' The following are the major provisions \nof the legislation.\n  The Act supports the democratic opposition by authorizing one hundred \nmillion dollars for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for the purpose of \npromoting democracy and civil society in Serbia and for assisting the \nGovernment of Montenegro. It also authorizes increased broadcasting to \nYugoslavia by the Voice of America and by Radio Free Europe/Radio \nLiberty.\n  The Act offers assistance to the victims of Serbian oppression by \nauthorizing the President to use authorities in the Foreign Assistance \nAct of 1961 to provide humanitarian assistance to individuals living in \nKosovo and to refugees currently residing in surrounding countries.\n  The legislation codifies the so-called ``outer wall'' of sanctions \nagainst Yugoslavia by multilateral organizations, including \ninternational financial institutions.\n  It also authorizes other measures against Yugoslavia, including \nblocking Yugoslavia's assets in the United States; prohibiting the \nissuance of visas and admission to the United States; and prohibiting \nstrategic exports to Yugoslavia, loans and investment, and military-to-\nmilitary cooperation.\n  The legislation also contains miscellaneous provisions, including \nrequiring cooperation by Yugoslavia with the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and a sense of the Congress \ndeclaration on the ownership and use of diplomatic and consular \nproperties in the United States.\n  Mr. President, a good deal has been written in recent days about \npossibly easing the sanctions regime against Yugoslavia out of concern \nfor its people. I do not believe that such a move would be in the \ninterest either of the Yugoslav people, or of the United States.\n\n[[Page S14041]]\n\n  A look at the precedent set in the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is instructive. After the Dayton Accords were signed in \nlate 1995, the Congress passed legislation in which no assistance could \nbe given to the Republika Srpska, which was then ruled by the war \ncriminal Radovan Karadzic and his gangster clique in Pale. Meanwhile \nthe Muslim-Croat Federation could receive assistance.\n  Within two years a majority of the population of the Republika Srpska \nhad observed the modest, but real economic recovery in the Federation \nand realized the futility of sticking with Karadzic and company. The \nresult was, first the presidency of Mrs. Biljana Plavsic, and later the \nreformist government of Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, which is still \nclinging to power in the new capital of Banja Luka.\n  I believe that if we keep up the pressure on the indicted war \ncriminal Milosevic, a similar process will eventually occur in Serbia. \nConversely, if we were to loosen the legitimate sanctions on \nYugoslavia, it would constitute a stunning triumph for Milosevic.\n  Mr. President, this week a delegation of leaders of the Alliance for \nChange, an umbrella organization representing more than forty \ndemocratic political parties and groups in Serbia, has been visiting \nWashington. I met with this group. They asked only that we lift \nsanctions against Serbia after a free and fair election results in \nMilosevic's fall from power. They are confident of victory in such an \nelection; I hope they are right.\n  It is in this spirit, Mr. President, that we must hold out carrots to \nthe potential democratic successors of Milosevic. Therefore, in a move \nto facilitate the transition to democracy, the Act authorizes the \nPresident to furnish assistance to Yugoslavia if he determines and \ncertifies to the appropriate Congressional committees that the \nGovernment of Yugoslavia is ``committed to democratic principles, the \nrule of law, and is committed to respect internationally recognized \nhuman rights.''\n  The Act also contains a national interest waiver for the President. \nThe President may also waive the Act's provisions if he certifies that \n``significant progress has been made in Yugoslavia in establishing a \ngovernment based on democratic principles and the rule of law, and that \nrespects internationally recognized human rights.''\n  In the meantime, I approve of our government's political support of a \npilot program run by the European Union whereby emergency heating oil \nshipments are made to two Serbian cities that are governed by opponents \nof Milosevic. If the project succeeds--that is, if the oil is delivered \nand Milosevic does not succeed in taking credit for the shipments--the \nUnited States might join in financing the program, which would be \nextended to other cities.\n  With regard to direct, material help to the anti-Milosevic forces, \nthere are many genuine democratic organizations at the grassroots level \nand in the media in Serbia who could make a measurable difference if \nthey had the means to spread their message. The United States Agency \nfor International Development is already modestly supporting some of \nthese organizations, and it has drawn up a list of additional potential \nrecipients.\n  In addition, through the SEED Act our State Department has recently \nmade funds available through non-governmental organizations in \nSlovakia--a novel and promising approach. I believe that we can also \nutilize the democratic government in Romania to assist the democratic \nopposition in Serbia.\n  I believe the time is ripe for simultaneously maintaining the \npressure on the criminal Milosevic regime, and for increasing our \nmaterial support to the democratic opposition.\n  The Serbia Democratication Act of 1999 does just that, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for its adoption.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 720), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 720\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, has \n     consistently engaged in undemocratic methods of governing.\n       (2) Yugoslavia has passed and implemented a law strictly \n     limiting freedom of the press and has acted to intimidate and \n     prevent independent media from operating inside Yugoslavia.\n       (3) Although the Yugoslav and Serbian constitutions provide \n     for the right of citizens to change their government, \n     citizens of Serbia in practice are prevented from exercising \n     that right by the Milosevic regime's domination of the mass \n     media and manipulation of the electoral process.\n       (4) The Yugoslav government has orchestrated attacks on \n     academics at institutes and universities throughout the \n     country in an effort to prevent the dissemination of opinions \n     that differ from official state propaganda.\n       (5) The Yugoslav government prevents the formation of \n     nonviolent, democratic opposition through restrictions on \n     freedom of assembly and association.\n       (6) The Yugoslav government uses control and intimidation \n     to control the judiciary and manipulates the country's legal \n     framework to suit the regime's immediate political interests.\n\n[[Page S14042]]\n\n       (7) The Government of Serbia and the Government of \n     Yugoslavia, under the direction of President Milosevic, have \n     obstructed the efforts of the Government of Montenegro to \n     pursue democratic and free-market policies.\n       (8) At great risk, the Government of Montenegro has \n     withstood efforts by President Milosevic to interfere with \n     its government and supported the goals of the United States \n     in the conflict in Kosovo.\n       (9) The people of Serbia who do not endorse the \n     undemocratic actions of the Milosevic government should not \n     be the target of criticism that is rightly directed at the \n     Milosevic regime.\n       (b) Policy.--\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to encourage the \n     development of a government in Yugoslavia based on democratic \n     principles and the rule of law and that respects \n     internationally recognized human rights.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the United States should actively support the \n     democratic opposition in Yugoslavia, including political \n     parties and independent trade unions, to develop a legitimate \n     and viable alternative to the Milosevic regime;\n       (B) all United States Government officials, including \n     individuals from the private sector acting on behalf of the \n     United States Government, should attempt to meet regularly \n     with representatives of democratic opposition organizations \n     of Yugoslavia and minimize to the extent practicable any \n     direct contacts with government officials from Yugoslavia, \n     particularly President Slobodan Milosevic, who perpetuate the \n     nondemocratic regime in Yugoslavia; and\n       (C) the United States should emphasize to all political \n     leaders in Yugoslavia the importance of respecting \n     internationally recognized human rights for all individuals \n     residing in Yugoslavia.\n\n     SEC. 102.

AUTHORITY FOR RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTING.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Broadcasting Board of Governors shall \n     further the open communication of information and ideas \n     through the increased use of radio and television \n     broadcasting to Yugoslavia in both the Serbo-Croatian and \n     Albanian languages.\n       (b) Implementation.--Radio and television broadcasting \n     under subsection (a) shall be carried out by the Voice of \n     America and, in addition, radio broadcasting under that \n     subsection shall be carried out by RFE/RL, Incorporated. \n     Subsection (a) shall be carried out in accordance with all \n     the respective Voice of America and RFE/RL, Incorporated, \n     standards to ensure that radio and television broadcasting to \n     Yugoslavia serves as a consistently reliable and \n     authoritative source of accurate, objective, and \n     comprehensive news.\n       (c) Statutory Construction.--The implementation of \n     subsection (a) may not be construed as a replacement for the \n     strengthening of indigenous independent media called for in \n     section 102(a)(3)(C). To the maximum extent practicable, the \n     two efforts (strengthening independent media and increasing \n     broadcasts into Serbia) shall be carried out in such a way \n     that they mutually support each other.\n\n       TITLE II--ASSISTANCE TO THE VICTIMS OF SERBIAN OPPRESSION\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Beginning in February 1998 and ending in June 1999, the \n     armed forces of Yugoslavia and the Serbian Interior Ministry \n     police force engaged in a brutal crackdown against the ethnic \n     Albanian population in Kosovo.\n       (2) As a result of the attack by Yugoslav and Serbian \n     forces against the Albanian population of Kosovo, more than \n     10,000 individuals have been killed and 1,500,000 individuals \n     were displaced from their homes.\n       (3) The majority of the individuals displaced by the \n     conflict in Kosovo was left homeless or was forced to find \n     temporary shelter in Kosovo or outside the country.\n       (4) The activities of the Yugoslav armed forces and the \n     police force of the Serbian Interior Ministry resulted in the \n     widespread destruction of agricultural crops, livestock, and \n     property, as well as the poisoning of wells and water \n     supplies, and the looting of humanitarian goods provided by \n     the international community.\n\n     SEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflict \n     in Kosovo, including refugees and internally displaced \n     persons, and all assistance to rebuild damaged property in \n     Kosovo, should be the responsibility of the Government of \n     Yugoslavia and the Government of Serbia;\n       (2) under the direction of President Milosevic, neither the \n     Government of Yugoslavia nor the Government of Serbia has \n     provided the resources to assist innocent, civilian victims \n     of oppression in Kosovo; and\n       (3) because neither the Government of Yugoslavia nor the \n     Government of Serbia has fulfilled the responsibilities of a \n     sovereign government toward the people in Kosovo, the \n     international community offers the only recourse for \n     humanitarian assistance to victims of oppression in Kosovo.\n\n     SEC. 203.

and\n       (2) the President should encourage all other European \n     countries to diminish their level of diplomatic relations \n     with Yugoslavia.\n       (i) International Financial Institution Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``international financial institution'' \n     includes the International Monetary Fund, the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \n     Development Association, the International Finance \n     Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency, and \n     the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\n     SEC. 302.

THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER \n                   YUGOSLAVIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 827, which \n     was adopted May 25, 1993, established the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to prosecute \n     persons responsible for serious violations of international \n     humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former \n     Yugoslavia since January 1, 1991.\n       (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 requires \n     full cooperation by all countries with the Tribunal, \n     including the obligation of countries to comply with requests \n     of the Tribunal for assistance or orders.\n       (3) The Government of Yugoslavia has disregarded its \n     international obligations with regard to the Tribunal, \n     including its obligation to transfer or facilitate the \n     transfer to the Tribunal of any person on the territory of \n     Yugoslavia who has been indicted for war crimes or other \n     crimes against humanity under the jurisdiction of the \n     Tribunal.\n       (4) The Government of Yugoslavia publicly rejected the \n     Tribunal's jurisdiction over events in Kosovo and has impeded \n     the investigation of representatives from the Tribunal, \n     including denying those representatives visas for entry into \n     Yugoslavia, in their efforts to gather information about \n     alleged crimes against humanity in Kosovo under the \n     jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n       (5) The Tribunal has indicted President Slobodan Milosevic \n     for--\n       (A) crimes against humanity, specifically murder, \n     deportations, and persecutions; and\n       (B) violations of the laws and customs of war.\n       (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States to \n     support fully and completely the investigation of President \n     Slobodan Milosevic by the International Criminal Tribunal for \n     the former Yugoslavia for genocide, crimes against humanity, \n     war crimes, and grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.\n       (c) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), it is the sense \n     of Congress that the United States Government should gather \n     all information that the intelligence community (as defined \n     in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. 401a(4)) collects or has collected to support an \n     investigation of President Slobodan Milosevic for genocide, \n     crimes against humanity, war crimes, and grave breaches of \n     the Geneva Convention by the International Criminal Tribunal \n     for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and that the Department of \n     State should provide all appropriate information to the \n     Office of the Prosecutor of the ICTY under procedures \n     established by the Director of Central Intelligence that are \n     necessary to ensure adequate protection of intelligence \n     sources and methods.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not less than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, \n     the President shall submit a report, in classified form if \n     necessary, to the appropriate congressional committees that \n     describes the information that was provided by the Department \n     of State to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for the purposes \n     of subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 502. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO ETHNIC HUNGARIANS \n                   OF VOJVODINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) approximately 350,000 ethnic Hungarians reside in the \n     province of Vojvodina, part of Serbia, in traditional \n     settlements in existence for centuries;\n       (2) this community has taken no side in any of the Balkan \n     conflicts since 1990, but has maintained a consistent \n     position of nonviolence, while seeking to protect its \n     existence through the meager opportunities afforded under the \n     existing political system;\n       (3) the Serbian leadership deprived Vojvodina of its \n     autonomous status at the same time as it did the same to the \n     province of Kosovo;\n       (4) this population is subject to continuous harassment, \n     intimidation, and threatening suggestions that they leave the \n     land of their ancestors; and\n       (5) during the past 10 years this form of ethnic cleansing \n     has already driven 50,000 ethnic Hungarians out of the \n     province of Vojvodina.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should--\n       (1) condemn harassment, threats, and intimidation against \n     any ethnic group in Yugoslavia as the usual precursor of \n     violent ethnic cleansing;\n       (2) express deep concern over the reports on recent \n     threats, intimidation, and even violent incidents against the \n     ethnic Hungarian inhabitants of the province of Vojvodina;\n       (3) call on the Secretary of State to regularly monitor the \n     situation of the Hungarian ethnic group in Vojvodina; and\n       (4) call on the NATO allies of the United States, during \n     any negotiation on the future status of Kosovo, also to pay \n     substantial attention to establishing satisfactory guarantees \n     for the rights of the ethnic Hungarian community of \n     Vojvodina, and of other ethnic minorities in the province, \n     including consulting with elected leaders about their \n     proposal for self-administration.\n\n     SEC. 503. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR \n                   PROPERTIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The international judicial system, as currently \n     structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful \n     confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the \n     use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and \n     private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the \n     property.\n       (2) Since the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia, the Government of Yugoslavia has exclusively \n     used, and benefited from the use of, properties located in \n     the United States that were owned by the Socialist Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (3) The Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the \n     Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Slovenia have been \n     blocked by the Government of Yugoslavia from using, or \n     benefiting from the use of, any property located in the \n     United States that was previously owned by the Socialist \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The continued occupation and use by officials of \n     Yugoslavia of that property without prompt, adequate, and \n     effective compensation under the applicable principles of \n     international law to the Governments of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of \n     Macedonia, and Slovenia are unjust and unreasonable.\n       (b) Policy on Negotiations Regarding Properties.--It is the \n     policy of the United States to insist that the Government of \n     Yugoslavia has a responsibility to, and should, actively and \n     cooperatively engage in good faith negotiations with the \n     Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former \n     Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Slovenia for resolution \n     of the outstanding property issues resulting from the \n     dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \n     including the disposition of the following properties located \n     in the United States:\n       (1) 2222 Decatur Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (2) 2410 California Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (3) 1907 Quincy Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (4) 3600 Edmonds Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (5) 2221 R Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       (6) 854 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY.\n       (7) 730 Park Avenue, New York, NY.\n       (c) Sense of Congress on Return of Properties.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that, if\n\n[[Page S14045]]\n\n     the Government of Yugoslavia refuses to engage in good faith \n     negotiations on the status of the properties listed in \n     subsection (b), the President should take steps to ensure \n     that the interests of the Governments of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of \n     Macedonia, and Slovenia are protected in accordance with \n     international law.\n\n     SEC. 504. TRANSITION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     once the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic has been \n     replaced by a government that is committed to democratic \n     principles and the rule of law, and that respects \n     internationally recognized human rights, the President of the \n     United States should support the transition to democracy in \n     Yugoslavia by providing immediate and substantial assistance, \n     including facilitating its integration into international \n     organizations.\n       (b) Authorization of Assistance.--The President is \n     authorized to furnish assistance to Yugoslavia if he \n     determines, and so certifies to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the Government of Yugoslavia is committed to \n     democratic principles and the rule of law and respects \n     internationally recognized human rights.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--\n       (1) Development of plan.--The President shall develop a \n     plan for providing assistance to Yugoslavia in accordance \n     with this section. Such assistance would be provided at such \n     time as the President determines that the Government of \n     Yugoslavia is committed to democratic principles and the rule \n     of law and respects internationally recognized human rights.\n       (2) Strategy.--The plan developed under paragraph (1) shall \n     include a strategy for distributing assistance to Yugoslavia \n     under the plan.\n       (3) Diplomatic efforts.--The President shall take the \n     necessary steps--\n       (A) to seek to obtain the agreement of other countries and \n     international financial institutions and other multilateral \n     organizations to provide assistance to Yugoslavia after the \n     President determines that the Government of Yugoslavia is \n     committed to democratic principles, the rule of law, and that \n     respects internationally recognized human rights; and\n       (B) to work with such countries, institutions, and \n     organizations to coordinate all such assistance programs.\n       (4) Communication of plan.--The President shall take the \n     necessary steps to communicate to the people of Yugoslavia \n     the plan for assistance developed under this section.\n       (5) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report describing in \n     detail the plan required to be developed by paragraph (1).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/04/senate-section/article/S14045-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14045-S14046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FREEDOM TO E-FILE ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge passage of S. \n777, the Freedom to E-File Act. I appreciate Agriculture Secretary \nGlickman, Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and my other Colleagues \non the Agriculture Committee for their hard work in helping craft the \nconsensus substitute amendment being offered on the floor today. This \nlegislation will streamline the process our farmers follow when filing \npaper work with the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Currently, when \nfarmers are required to fill out USDA paper work, they are required to \ntravel to their local USDA county offices, complete the paper work, \nwait in long lines and file these documents in paper form. This process \nis very inefficient and time consuming.\n  This bill simply requires USDA to develop a system for farmers to \naccess and file this information over the internet. The ``Freedom to E-\nfile Act'' simply makes good common sense. As our society has become \nmore technologically advanced so have our farmers. In fact, a 1998 \nNovartis survey found that over 72 percent of all farmers with 500 \nacres or more had personal computers. Overall, over fifty percent of \nall farmers surveyed had computers.\n\n[[Page S14046]]\n\n  According to a Farm Journal study entitled, ``AgWeb 1999: Internet \nand e-Commerce in Production Agriculture,'' farmer internet usage will \nhave more than doubled by the end of 1999 compared to 1997. The author \nconcluded, ``the computer and the internet have become just as \nimportant to farmers as the tractor and good weather.'' The bill we \npass today clearly recognizes this reality. The study also notes that \nover two-thirds of all commercial farmers own at least one computer and \nthese farmers spend at least two hours per week on average utilizing \nthe internet for agricultural purposes.\n  Our agriculturists use computers not only for financial management \nand market information but for sophisticated precision agriculture \nmanagement systems. These sophisticated small business owners could \neasily file necessary farm program paperwork from their homes and \noffices if only this option was available.\n  Farmers are often frustrated with the long lines at county USDA \noffices, especially during their most hectic times such as harvest \nseason. Our nation's farmers are clearly overburdened by government-\nmandated paperwork. This bill is the first step in the right direction \ntoward regulatory reform for our U.S. food producers.\n  The Freedom to E-File Act has been popular among agricultural groups \nand within the United States Senate. The American Farm Bureau \nFederation, our nation's largest farm organization, stated that while \nS. 777 is a simple bill, ``the impact it will have on farmers and \nranchers should be immense.'' The bill has approximately twenty \nbipartisan co-sponsors, including Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar \nand Minority Leader Daschle. The Secretary of Agriculture also supports \nthe Freedom to E-File Act.\n  I commend my colleague, Congressman Ray LaHood, for championing the \ncompanion to this bill in the House of Representatives. I hope that the \nHouse will pass this important legislation prior to the end of this \nsession, and look forward to the President's signature. I thank the \npresiding officer and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as \namended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 777), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, one of the singular most important issues \nfacing us today is education. Affordable higher education is an \nopportunity that must be made available to all of our young people. To \nthat end, public and private scholarships, grants and loans have long \nassisted our nation's students in pursuing college degrees.\n  Phony scholarship offerings, scams and frauds do great harm to our \nnation's students. No student seeking to attend a college or university \nshould have to worry about whether a scholarship offering is legitimate \nor wonder whether the business to which he or she has mailed an \napplication fee actually exists. I am glad to join in the effort of \nSenators Abraham and Feingold to add to the arsenal of our current laws \nto combat these types of frauds.\n  I commented at a Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill earlier \nthis month that the goals of this legislation are laudable. We need to \ndo more to combat scholarship scams and promote the dissemination of \ninformation about legitimate sources of higher education funding. \nNevertheless, I raised questions about whether the original bill \nreflected the most effective way to pursue the goals we all share. I am \npleased to join as a cosponsor of the substitute amendment that \naddresses the concerns I raised.\n  For instance, the original bill proposed raising the long-standing \nstatutory maximum punishment of five years for mail and wire fraud to \nten years in cases of scholarship scams. In light of the fact that \nscholarship scams often involve more than one victim and may result in \nmultiple charges, raising the statutory penalties may not be necessary \nto effectuate punishment goals. I suggested that a more appropriate and \neffective solution to ensure adequate punishment may be to direct the \nSentencing Commission to consider a guideline enhancement for cases \ninvolving fraudulent scholarship offerings. The substitute amendment \nmakes this change and directs the Sentencing Commission to amend the \nsentencing guidelines to provide enhanced penalties for any offenses \ninvolving scholarship scams such that those penalties are comparable to \nthe base offense level for misrepresentation that the defendant was \nacting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious, or political \norganization, or a government agency. In effect, this amendment directs \nthe Sentencing Commission to increase the guideline offense levels by 2 \nlevels.\n  The substitute amendment is an improvement since it avoids \ncomplicating the wire and mail fraud statutes with different penalties \ndepending on the nature of the underlying fraud.\n  The substitute amendment directs the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of Education, in consultation with the Federal Trade \nCommission to report to Congress on the nature and quantity of \nincidents of scholarship scams. This report will assist the Judiciary \nCommittee in monitoring whether additional legislative steps are needed \nin this area.\n  The substitute amendment makes important improvements in the original \nbill, and I urge the Congress to pass this legislation promptly.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the committee amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be considered read the third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1455) as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1455\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
