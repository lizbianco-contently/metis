Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. Con. Res. 20, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 20) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal years 2000 through 2009.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n  Pending:\n\n       Specter/Harkin amendment No. 157, to provide for funding of \n     biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health.\n       Craig amendment No. 146, to modify the pay-as-you-go \n     requirement of the budget process to require that direct \n     spending increases be offset only with direct spending \n     decreases.\n       Dodd amendment No. 160, to increase the mandatory spending \n     in the Child Care and Development Block Grant by $7.5 billion \n     over five years, the amendment reduces the resolution's tax \n     cut and leaves adequate room in the revenue instructions for \n     targeted tax cuts that help families with the costs of caring \n     for their children, and that such relief would assist all \n     working families with employment related child care expenses, \n     as well as families in which one parent stays home to care \n     for an infant.\n       Voinovich amendment No. 161, to use on-budget surplus to \n     repay the debt instead of tax cuts.\n       Reed amendment No. 162, to provide for certain Federal \n     revenues, total new budget authority, and total budget \n     outlays.\n       Crapo/Grams amendment No. 163, to create a reserve fund to \n     lock in additional non-Social Security surplus in the \n     outyears for tax relief and/or debt reduction.\n       Graham amendment No. 164, to express the sense of the \n     Senate that funds recovered from any Federal tobacco-related \n     litigation should be set-aside for the purpose of first \n     strengthening the medicare trust fund and second to fund a \n     medicare prescription drug benefit.\n       Graham amendment No. 165, to express the sense of the \n     Senate that the Congress and the President should offset \n     inappropriate emergency funding from fiscal year 1999 in \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       Lautenberg amendment No. 166, to express the sense of the \n     Senate on saving Social Security and Medicare, reducing the \n     public debt, and targeting tax relief to middle-income \n     working families.\n       Lautenberg (for Schumer) amendment No. 167, to express the \n     sense of the Senate that the Community Oriented Policing \n     Services (COPS) Program should be reauthorized in order to \n     provide continued Federal funding for the hiring, deployment, \n     and retention of community law enforcement officers.\n       Lautenberg (for Feinstein) amendment No. 168, to express \n     the sense of the Senate regarding school construction grants, \n     and reducing school sizes and class sizes.\n       Lautenberg (for Feinstein) amendment No. 169, to express \n     the sense of the Senate on the social promotion of elementary \n     and secondary school students.\n       Lautenberg (for Reid) amendment No. 170, to express the \n     sense of the Senate regarding social security ``notch \n     babies'', those individuals born between the years 1917 and \n     1926.\n       Lautenberg (for Boxer) amendment No. 171, to ensure that \n     the President's after school initiative is fully funded for \n     fiscal year 2000.\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\n       Lautenberg (for Murray) amendment No. 172, to fully fund \n     the Class Size Initiative, the amendment reduces the \n     resolution's tax cut by ten billion dollars, leaving adequate \n     room in the revenue reconciliation instructions for targeted \n     tax cuts that help those in need and tax breaks for \n     communities to modernize and rebuild crumbling schools.\n       Lautenberg (for Murray) amendment No. 173, to express the \n     sense of the Senate on women and Social Security reform.\n       Lautenberg (for Hollings) amendment No. 174, to continue \n     Federal spending at the current services baseline levels and \n     pay down the Federal debt.\n       Lautenberg (for Boxer) amendment No. 175, to ensure that \n     the substantial majority of any income tax cuts go to middle \n     and lower income taxpayers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 157\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Yesterday \nevening, the pending amendment which had been offered on behalf of \nSenator Harkin and myself, as principal sponsors, on the National \nInstitutes of Health, was debated shortly before 8 p.m., when voting \nstarted on four items. I believe the order was that we would resume \nconsideration today with that pending amendment. My inquiry is, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator has 5 \nminutes 20 seconds remaining under his control.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President. That seems not \ncorrect to me. I debated this issue for maybe 10 minutes at the most \nyesterday. Isn't there an hour allotted to each side on each amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amount allocated \nto the amendment was reduced to a half-hour for each side for all \nfirst-degree amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. A half-hour for each side for all first-degree \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We did not use 24 minutes yesterday, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania spoke from 7:40 \nto 7:55. The Senator from Iowa spoke from 9:28 to 9:38.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I am advised by my staff that it would \nbe appropriate to ask for some time off the bill. I ask for an \nadditional 15 minutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, to briefly recapitulate, this amendment seeks to add \n$1.4 billion to the allocation for the National Institutes of Health. \nThe NIH is the crown jewel of the Federal Government, having made \nreally phenomenal advances on medical research in its drive to conquer \nso many of the maladies confronting mankind today.\n  Last year the budget for NIH was increased by $2 billion and, in the \nview of the Members, at least the chairman and the ranking, on the \nappropriations subcommittee having jurisdiction over the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, $2 billion are absolutely necessary by way \nof increase of the existing budget for NIH, which now is $15.6 billion. \nThere have been really remarkable advances in so many lines, with the \nresearch on stem cells having been completed, posing the opportunity \nfor curing so many of the very, very serious ailments.\n  Testimony was given before the appropriations subcommittee that with \ndiseases like Parkinson's, the cure may be in the range of 5 to 10 \nyears. Great strides have been made on Alzheimer's, on cancer, and so \nmany very other serious matters. We have an offset to cover the $1.4 \nbillion by changing the rules on deductibility from the tobacco \nsettlement.\n  Madam President, after consulting with the managers on the second \nslot, which had been reserved, it is my intention to offer a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution on behalf of Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Sessions, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Schumer, and myself which \nwould increase the funding to the Department of Justice on the \nprosecution of gun cases from $5 to $50 million. We have seen examples, \nin Richmond, VA, in Philadelphia, PA, and in Boston, MA, where gun \ncases have been handled with great success. This follows the passage in \n1984 of the armed career criminal bill which provided that any career \ncriminal, someone with three or four major convictions, found in \npossession of a firearm, would receive a sentence up to life \nimprisonment.\n  In 1988, there was an experiment with a program called Trigger Lock \nin the Eastern District of Pennsylvania which produced extraordinary \nresults, again, focusing on guns. It was a national model. More \nrecently, in Richmond, VA, there has been experience with prosecutions \nas to guns and also a special program again in the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, coordinated with New Jersey across the river, with $1.5 \nmillion going to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and $800,000 to \nNew Jersey--again, very remarkable results.\n\n  In this year's budget, the Department of Justice has allocated only \n$5 million to this important function. An important hearing was held on \nMonday of this week, presided over jointly by Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Sessions, on two Judiciary Committee subcommittees. And there \nthe evidence was very forceful about the effectiveness of this gun \nprogram.\n  Madam President, I am not going to offer this amendment at this time, \nbut I did want to utilize just a few moments, as I have, this morning \nto explain the purpose of the amendment. It will be offered in due \ncourse.\n  How much time remains, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I wonder if I might make an inquiry of \nthe distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, if I might have the \nattention of Senator Domenici.\n  The second slot was reserved, Mr. Chairman, and has been used for a \nsense of the Senate on guns, as I have just explained. I wonder if it \nwould be acceptable to the managers if the amendment was sent to the \ndesk and offered at this time, or would it be preferable to wait until \na later point to make the submission for the Record?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, if you are asking me, it would be \npreferable to wait, if you would.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be glad to accommodate the chairman's schedule.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair, and I also thank the Chair for the \nadditional time. And I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 176\n\n      (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the \n         modernization and improvement of the medicare program)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the previous amendments \nwill be set aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] for himself, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mr. Frist, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n     Nickles, Mr. Grassley and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 176.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MODERNIZATION \n                   AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health insurance coverage provided under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is an integral part of the financial \n     security for retired and disabled individuals, as such \n     coverage protects those individuals against the financially \n     ruinous costs of a major illness.\n       (2) Expenditures under the medicare program for hospital, \n     physician, and other essential health care services that are \n     provided to nearly 39,000,000 retired and disabled \n     individuals will be $232,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2000.\n       (3) During the nearly 35 years since the medicare program \n     was established, the Nation's health care delivery and \n     financing system has undergone major transformations. \n     However, the medicare program has not kept pace with such \n     transformations.\n       (4) Former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert \n     Reischauer has described the medicare program as it exists \n     today as failing on the following 4 key dimensions (known as \n     the ``Four I's''):\n       (A) The program is inefficient.\n       (B) The program is inequitable.\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\n       (C) The program is inadequate.\n       (D) The program is insolvent.\n       (5) The President's budget framework does not devote 15 \n     percent of the budget surpluses to the medicare program. The \n     federal budget process does not provide a mechanism for \n     setting aside current surpluses for future obligations. As a \n     result, the notion of saving 15 percent of the surplus for \n     the medicare program cannot practically be carried out.\n       (6) The President's budget framework would transfer to the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund more than \n     $900,000,000,000 over 15 years in new IOUs that must be \n     redeemed later by raising taxes on American workers, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public, and these new \n     IOUs would increase the gross debt of the Federal Government \n     by the amounts transferred.\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that the \n     transfers described in paragraph (6), which are strictly \n     intragovernmental, have no effect on the unified budget \n     surpluses or the on-budget surpluses and therefore have no \n     effect on the debt held by the public.\n       (8) The President's budget framework does not provide \n     access to, or financing for, prescription drugs.\n       (9) The Comptroller General of the United States has stated \n     that the President's medicare proposal does not constitute \n     reform of the program and ``is likely to create a public \n     misperception that something meaningful is being done to \n     reform the Medicare program''.\n       (10) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted changes to the \n     medicare program which strengthen and extend the solvency of \n     that program.\n       (11) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that \n     without the changes made to the medicare program by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the depletion of the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would now be imminent.\n       (12) The President's budget proposes to cut medicare \n     program spending by $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, primarily \n     through reductions in payments to providers under that \n     program.\n       (13) While the recommendations by Senator John Breaux and \n     Representative William Thomas received the bipartisan support \n     of a majority of members on the National Bipartisan \n     Commission on the Future of Medicare, all of the President's \n     appointees to that commission opposed the bipartisan reform \n     plan.\n       (14) The Breaux-Thomas recommendations provide for new \n     prescription drug coverage for the neediest beneficiaries \n     within a plan that substantially improves the solvency of the \n     medicare program without transferring new IOUs to the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes, cutting benefits, or borrowing more from the \n     public.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions contained in this budget resolution \n     assume the following:\n       (1) This resolution does not adopt the President's \n     proposals to reduce medicare program spending by \n     $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, nor does this resolution adopt \n     the President's proposal to spend $10,000,000,000 of medicare \n     program funds on unrelated programs.\n       (2) Congress will not transfer to the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund new IOUs that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes on American workers, cutting benefits, or \n     borrowing more from the public.\n       (3) Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend \n     the solvency of the medicare program and to ensure that \n     benefits under that program will be available to \n     beneficiaries in the future.\n       (4) The American public will be well and fairly served in \n     this undertaking if the medicare program reform proposals are \n     considered within a framework that is based on the following \n     5 key principles offered in testimony to the Senate Committee \n     on Finance by the Comptroller General of the United States:\n       (A) Affordability.\n       (B) Equity.\n       (C) Adequacy.\n       (D) Feasibility.\n       (E) Public acceptance.\n       (5) The recommendations by Senator Breaux and Congressman \n     Thomas provide for new prescription drug coverage for the \n     neediest beneficiaries within a plan that substantially \n     improves the solvency of the medicare program without \n     transferring to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund new \n     IOUs that must be redeemed later by raising taxes, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public.\n       (6) Congress should move expeditiously to consider the \n     bipartisan recommendations of the Chairmen of the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n       (7) Congress should continue to work with the President as \n     he develops and presents his plan to fix the problems of the \n     medicare program.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, this amendment is sponsored by myself, Mr. \nBreaux, Mr. Frist, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Nickles, \nMr. Grassley, and Mr. Hatch.\n  Madam President, one of the most important bipartisan efforts we will \nundertake in the months ahead will be to address the challenges \nconfronting the Medicare program--a program whose reach and importance \nin the lives of Americans cannot be overstated. In years past we have \nlooked at the demographics, studied the statistics, and struggled with \na sense of vulnerability concerning Medicare and its future.\n  Our population is aging. Health care costs seem to be growing \nexponentially. New and necessary technologies are becoming more \nexpensive. And the financial base of the Medicare program provided by \nworking Americans is shrinking in proportion to the number of seniors \nwho depend on it. In less than 10 years, the population of Medicare \nbeneficiaries will begin growing at a rate unseen in the program's \nhistory.\n  In the past, the Medicare population has grown by about 1 percent a \nyear. Beginning very soon, that growth rate will begin to double. In \njust 10 years, the Medicare program will be required to serve a \npopulation that is 20 percent larger than it is today--that is, 46 \nmillion seniors--and at that point the baby-boom generation will have \nonly just begun to retire.\n  Concerning the growth in the cost of health care services, Gene \nSteuerle of the Urban Institute recently testified before the Finance \nCommittee that an average couple retiring now receives about $250,000 \nin lifetime Medicare benefits. Once the baby-boom generation is in full \nretirement, that amount will double. As a result, we will need to \ndedicate a larger and larger portion of the Nation's budget to pay for \nMedicare. Medicare is expected to consume an expanding share of the \nNation's economy.\n  In 1998, Medicare spending was an estimated 2.6 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. It is projected to grow to $518 billion--or 3.5 \npercent of GDP--in 2010. By 2030, Medicare is forecasted to grow to \n$2.2 trillion, representing 5.9 percent of the GDP.\n  It is good news that people are living longer, that they are spending \nalmost a decade more in retirement than they were when the Medicare \nprogram began. These are demographics we have worked long and hard to \nbring to pass and we should celebrate them.\n  However, these were, and continue to be, serious challenges to the \nMedicare trust fund. The balance in the Part A Hospital Insurance Trust \nFund is declining. The end-of-year balance began to drop in 1995, when \npayments from the trust fund began to exceed income to the trust fund. \nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 helped to delay the bankruptcy of the \ntrust fund for a few years, but it will still occur in our lifetimes if \nsomething is not done now.\n  As I said, each of these represents a serious concern, Madam \nPresident. But as of late, there appears to be a growing sense of \noptimism that we can take the favorable economic conditions our Nation \nis enjoying and, with bipartisan leadership, we can find long-term \nsolutions to these pressing challenges.\n  Not only is there consensus on both sides of the aisle that something \nmust be done, but there is growing confidence that something can be \ndone. An important component of the answer, we have come to see, rests \nin the potential of a strong economy and with the willingness of the \nAmerican people.\n  Toward meeting the challenges confronting Medicare, we must be guided \nby five specific criteria:\n  First, our efforts, if they are to succeed, must have bipartisan \nsupport, and they will require leadership from the White House. \nPresident Clinton must articulate his strategy for securing and \nstrengthening the Medicare program.\n  Second, we must assure that the measures we adopt do not undermine \nthe economic growth our Nation needs to continue providing jobs, \nopportunity, and security for Americans now and in the future.\n  Third, we must see that our policies are fair, that those who are \nbeing called upon to strengthen the system in the short term have the \nconfidence of knowing that the system will be there for them in the \nlong run.\n  Fourth, reform measures must be holistic in nature, taking into \naccount the challenges we have to preserve and strengthen Social \nSecurity and to coordinate other programs that can serve the same \nconstituency benefited by the Medicare and Social Security programs.\n  Fifth, our reform efforts must find acceptance with the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nThey must take what has been a good program and make it better--make it \nbetter by making it financially sound and easily accessible to those \nwho depend on it.\n  I am hopeful that the President will provide the genuine leadership \nrequired to address the future of Medicare. I encourage him and his \nadministration to come work with us on the Finance Committee. We look \nforward to working with them. Certainly there are few issues as \nimportnt as this one.\n  It demands our immediate attention, and the best effort we have to \noffer. Our work must go beyond the few items he included in his budget. \nIt must take into account the long-term needs of the program, a careful \nanalysis of benefit expansion, such as pharmaceutical drugs, and other \nconcerns.\n  We must look at how we can best serve the Medicare program in a way \nthat the reforms we offer will positively affect Medicaid. Too often \nlost in the debate over Medicare reform is the direct impact that \nMedicare changes will have on Medicaid. These two programs are most \nobviously linked through the 5.4 million low-income elderly and \ndisabled individuals who are eligible for both. For this dually \neligible population, Mediaid essentially serves as a source of \nwraparound benefits, providing among other important services nursing \nhome care and prescription drugs.\n  In addition, nearly 600,000 low-income Medicare beneficiaries receive \nMediaid financial support to meet Medicare's cost-sharing requirements.\n  Together, these six million individuals represent 16 percent of the \nMedicare population, but they consume 30 percent of all Medicare \nspending and 35 percent of all Medicaid spending. Medicare reform \nproposals that would impact these low-income populations must be very \ncarefully undertaken to avoid simply shifting costs or responsibilties \nfrom one program to the other.\n  As we face the challenges of reforming the Medicare program, we must \nexplore opportunities to substantially improve the health care \nexperiences of these dually eligible populations. Currently, efforts to \ncoordinate the services covered by the two programs are stymied by \nbarriers to integration.\n  These barriers include the need for complicated waivers, arbitrary \nrestrictions on mingling Medicare and Medicaid dollars, and \ndifficulties in coordinating program oversight. A reform process \nundertaken by this Senate presents an opportunity to better meet the \nneeds of a very vulnerable population.\n  Immediately after passage of this budget, I will begin, as chairman \nof the committee that has jurisdiction over the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, the process of developing a bipartisan, consensus proposal \nfor real Medicare reform. In developing this plan, the Finance \nCommittee will conduct a series of hearings to take testimony from \nMedicare consumers, trustees, providers, and other experts who are \nintricately involved with this program and who are in a position to \nmake worthy recommendations on how to proceed with improving the \nMedicare program.\n  We will indeed carefully study the recommendations of the bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare led by Senator Breaux. Senator \nBreaux and the other members of the bipartisan Commission on the Future \nof Medicare worked very hard and committed a great deal of time during \nthe past year to try to find a solution to the impending Medicare \ncrisis. They deserve our appreciation for their efforts. The \ndiscussions that they had has certainly furthered the Medicare debate \nand will be invaluable to us as we proceed with this important work. In \naddition to these measures, the committee will also take into \nconsideration the many concerns and proposals of Senators--on both \nsides of the aisle--for improving this program which is so important \nfor all of those we represent and are here to serve.\n  Our effort to lay a solid foundation for the future of Medicare will \nbe a major undertaking. I believe that the budget resolution we are \nconsidering now provides the necessary framework. The budget committee \nhas set aside on-budget surplus funds of up to $133 billion that--if \nneeded--can be used for Medicare reform, including prescription drug \nbenefits. Once we have achieved a bipartisan agreement on a \ncomprehensive Medicare plan, we may indeed find it necessary to revisit \nthis budgetary framework--and I expect that we would be able to obtain \nthe necessary votes to proceed with such adjustments.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to set aside attempts to legislate \nMedicare reform in the budget resolution. This is not the time or place \nfor such a complex undertaking. Instead, I urge that we work together \nover the next few months on a Medicare reform plan. Such a plan should \nprovide the nation's current and future seniors the assurance of health \ncare that is comprehensive in benefits, superior in quality and \nfinancially sustainable. This is important to them. It is important to \nthe future. And it is something that can and will be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, how much time has the Senator used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Roth is in control of 15 more minutes, so if \nthe Senator desires to yield time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I want to ask a couple of questions, \nif I may, because I'm struck by a paragraph on page 5, beginning with \nline 8:\n\n       This resolution does not adopt the President's proposal to \n     reduce medicare spending by $19,400,000,00 over 10 years, nor \n     does the resolution adopt the President's proposal to spend \n     $10,000,000,000 of medicare program. . .\n\n  That is followed by:\n\n       Congress will not transfer to the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund new IOUs that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes on American workers, cutting benefits, or \n     borrowing more from the public.\n\n  Would that preclude any use of surpluses if there were additional \nsurpluses that arose?\n  How can you attribute a tax increase, or more borrowing, directly to \nthis? This is out of the general revenues, and I am curious how the \nconnection is made and whether or not a surplus would be able to be \nused.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to my distinguished colleague that if there are \nsurpluses in the budget, they could be used for Medicare.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So we are specifically targeting raising taxes. Could \nthis be competitive by using--and this is said with all due respect to \nthe distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. If tax cuts are \nput into place, or attempted to be put into place, would the response \nbe, then--and if we prohibit that by virtue of an agreement here and in \nthe House, would that be considered raising taxes if we didn't cut \ntaxes? Would that, in turn, be considered a tax increase?\n  Mr. ROTH. If I understand your question, no. If we fail to make a tax \ncut, I don't see that in and of itself being considered a tax increase.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So that it is possible that there could be a \ncompetitive environment where tax cuts are competing with our capacity \nto continue to fund Medicare. You know, we have a debate about these \ntransfers and whether IOUs are really significant. If we transferred $1 \nbillion in cash to the Medicare trust fund--the insurance trust fund, \nand they were to go out into the public marketplace and buy $1 billion \nworth of insurance bonds, or what have you, those IOUs would have \nestablished their value--that cash, rather, I am sorry, would have \nestablished its value.\n  Why wouldn't an IOU from the Federal Government, which is where so \nmany companies and individuals put their money because it is the full \nfaith and credit of our Nation, thereby guaranteed by strength more \nthere than anyplace else--why wouldn't those IOUs be considered the \nsame as a cash transfer? It is true that they are going to come out of \ngeneral revenues to be paid for, but it would also ensure that no \npressure on the Appropriations Committee could say, all right, we are \nnot going to be able to fund that, and then a later Congress says, OK, \nwe are going to have to cut back on benefits by raising age or raising \ndeductible, raising copays, or what have you. This at least ensures \nthat that money will be there; those funds will be there off into the \nfuture; am I correct or not on that?\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Well, let me answer you in general, and then I will ask the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nCommittee. But it is our position that there are adequate funds both to \nprovide reform of the Medicare program, to ensure its solvency in the \nlong term, as well as to provide for a tax cut and, of course, protect \nand strengthen Social Security. As to the specifics, I yield to my \ndistinguished colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to Senator \nKennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am interested in asking, is there \nanything in this proposal of the Senator from Delaware that will \nprovide the additional funding for Medicare, as we are attempting to \nmove forward, to try to bring about the reforms? These two members of \nthe Budget Committee are here. I am interested in understanding, as we \nare trying, in the final hours of the budget debate, to make sure the \nbudget is going to have the additional 15 percent so that we can put it \non a sound financial basis. I am wondering if there is any indication \nin this proposal that the Senator from Delaware wants to make sure of \nthe financial security of Medicare before tax cuts, before we are going \nto go ahead with tax cuts. Is there anything in this resolution I have \njust received--maybe the Senator from North Dakota or the Senator from \nNew Jersey can show me anyplace in here where this resolution says, all \nright, let's move ahead with the reform of Medicare before we go ahead \nand provide these major tax cuts. Is there anything in this resolution \nthat the ranking minority member can tell the membership?\n  That is really what I think has been the heart of the debate of the \nproposal of the Senator from North Dakota and others--that we are going \nto put in place a sound, solid solvency for the Medicare system before \nwe go to tax cuts. And now that we have a new resolution, I am just \nwondering whether this resolution says we are going to defer the tax \ncuts, we are going to make sure of the financial stability of the \nMedicare system and move toward perhaps even a consideration of the \nBreaux proposal as we consider reforms in the future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask the Senator from North Dakota \nto oblige, or we will refer it to the author of it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Maybe you should ask the author of the proposal. I ask \nthe author of the proposal whether there is any provision in this part \nthat says we are going to defer tax cuts for wealthy individuals, \nacross-the-board tax cuts that are mentioned in the report of the \nbudget--that we are going to defer that until we get Medicare on a \nsound financial basis? Is there any reference to that in the proposal? \nOr if we accept this proposal, is it still the position that we are \nstill going to go ahead and have the tax cuts now in the budget?\n  Mr. ROTH. In answer to my friend and colleague, I say there is no \nlanguage in the budget resolution that sets these priorities. But as I \nsaid earlier, it is my intent, as chairman of the Finance Committee, \nwhich has jurisdiction over these matters, to begin hearings and to \ndevelop a consensus on Medicare when we return from the Easter recess. \nThis will be a bipartisan effort. There is no way we can get anything \ndone unless we are able to develop, as I said, a bipartisan consensus. \nIt is my intent to move as expeditiously as possible upon our return.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just to clarify it further, then, it is the position of \nthe Senator from Delaware to go ahead and pass a budget resolution that \ncommits us on a course for significant tax cuts prior to the time that \nwe are going to have the hearings in the Finance Committee to develop a \nbipartisan proposal on Medicare; that is his position? Or are you going \nto recommend that we defer the tax cuts until we have the kind of \nhearings the Senator has suggested and really shape a proposal to put \nMedicare on both a sound fiscal basis and also to deal with some of the \ninadequacies of Medicare, like the prescription drug issue?\n  Mr. ROTH. Well, as I indicated, it is the intent of the chairman to \nproceed expeditiously, upon our return, with hearings and developing a \nprogram on Medicare. As far as tax cuts are concerned, I don't intend \nto begin work on them probably until sometime early fall. But it is my \nintention to work immediately on Medicare.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts asked \nthe very question that I was trying to find out about. And that is that \nit has the appearance of another attempt to limit the development of a \nsolvent Medicare program in deference to the possibility of across-the-\nboard taxes. That is the sense, with all due expect, that I get out of \nthis. I don't know whether the Senator from Massachusetts views it the \nsame way. But it would be good if we could kind of straighten that out \nbefore a vote occurs on it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just ask, because I see others on their feet, \non page 2 of the proposal, at the bottom, line 22 says, ``The \nPresident's budget framework does not devote 15-percent budget \nsurpluses to the Medicare Program.''\n  This has been the intention of the Senator from New Jersey and the \nSenator from North Dakota. It is a goal I support--that we provide at \n15 percent. The Senator's resolution says it does not devote the 15 \npercent. Would the Senator tell us whether he would support the 15-\npercent allocation? He has it in the resolution, saying that the \nFederal budget does not devote the 15 percent. Does the Senator want us \nto devote that 15 percent, or not?\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, let me just point out that as far as the \nso-called 15 percent is concerned, the Comptroller General said that \nthe President's proposal does nothing to alter the imbalance between \nthe program's tax receipts and benefits payments. It has been cash \ndeficits since 1992, and remains a cash deficit even with the new \nTreasury securities. Thus, the President's proposal does provide \nadditional claims on the Treasury, not additional cash to pay benefits.\n  Let me make it very clear, under this resolution we intend to do \nthree things: To strengthen and preserve Social Security, to reform \nMedicare, and to provide a major tax cut for the working people of \nAmerica.\n\n  Let me stress that this resolution has been carefully crafted by the \nchairman and others on the Budget Committee to do exactly that. That is \nour intent, and we shall follow through on the policies laid down in \nthis resolution.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Louisiana may care to comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, before that, may I ask that Senator \nThompson be added as a cosponsor? I did include Senator Grassley and \nSenator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I support the Senator's sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. I will start off by saying that sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions are pretty senseless, because it really is not making law; \nit is just an expression of what people think. To that extent, it is \nvery important.\n  Let me just start off by saying that if the debate on Medicare is \nwhether we want a tax cut or whether we want to reform Medicare, we \nwill never reform Medicare. Medicare has been here since 1965, and it \nhas been a political football every year. Every year that we run out of \nmoney with Medicare, we fix it by using the SOS approach--same old, \nsame old. Every year when there was a shortfall, we simply tried to \nreduce reimbursements to doctors and hospitals and said, ``Well, we \nfixed it because we gave them less money to treat 40 million Americans \nwho need health care in this country.''\n  The President's budget this year again talks about approximately $20 \nbillion in further cuts to the Medicare program. That is $20 billion \nless that is going to be available to provide medical benefits to 40 \nmillion seniors. That, I would suggest, is not reform. That, I would \nsuggest, doesn't fix anything. That, I would suggest, just makes the \nproblem greater and not less.\n  The reason I call into question the concept that a 15-percent \ntransfer of the surplus in the form of IOUs to the\n\n[[Page S3314]]\n\nMedicare trust fund is not what it seems to be is that, in fact, it is \nnot.\n  The GAO came to the Senate Finance Committee and they testified very \nspecifically on this proposal. What they said, in bipartisan, \nunequivocal economic language that I think everyone can understand, is \nthe following. They said this transfer ``. . . has no effect on the \ncurrent and projected cash-flow deficits that have faced the [Medicare \nprogram] since 1992--deficits that taxpayers will continue to finance \nthrough higher taxes, lower spending elsewhere or lower pay downs of \npublicly-held debt than the baseline. Importantly, the President's \nproposal would not provide any new money to pay for medical services.''\n\n  So the concept of saying we are going to fix Medicare by taking 15 \npercent of the surplus and putting IOUs in the trust fund and that \nsomehow we have fixed the problem is nonsensical. It does not make any \nsense economically. It is not good policy. It gives us a false sense of \nsecurity that somehow we have solved Medicare by loading up the trust \nfund with IOUs. That is not reform. That is not saving the program. \nThat is not giving the program one nickel more in money. It is merely \ngiving the trust fund more IOUs. We are in effect transferring publicly \nheld debt from one account and putting it in another account and saying \nwe fixed the program.\n  I could not live with that, because I don't think it does anything. \nIt doesn't help the program. It doesn't hurt the program, but it \ndoesn't fix the program.\n  This resolution says in essence that we are going to have to work in \na bipartisan fashion to look at real reform. Our National Bipartisan \nCommission worked on this for a year. We have a recommendation which \nwill be submitted in the form of legislation. We will have hearings in \nthe Senate Finance Committee. I would like them to report on exactly \nwhat we send over there. But if they don't, hopefully it will be \nsomething similar. Hopefully, it will be real reform. Hopefully, it \nwill be something that we can quit arguing about--whether we want tax \ncuts, or whether we want to save Medicare.\n  The program needs more money. There is no question about that. But it \ndesperately needs reform. The 1965 model runs like a 1965 car, and \nputting more gas in an old car, it is still an old car. And putting \nmore IOUs in the Medicare trust fund doesn't make it a modern, \nefficient delivery system for health care in this country.\n  I think the resolution is a good resolution. It is offered in a \nbipartisan fashion. It is a sense of the Senate. Big deal. I don't \nthink it will change public policy. But it is so important that it \nneeds a discussion on how we solve this particular issue. It says that \nCongress should move expeditiously in a bipartisan fashion to reform \nthe program. Yes; we should. It says that Congress should continue to \nwork with the President as he develops and presents his plan to fix the \nproblem with the Medicare program. Yes; he should.\n  We are not going to fix it. We are going to be looking for issues to \nbeat each other over the head once again. That is the old way of doing \nit. That is old politics. And people are sick and tired of it on both \nsides of the political spectrum outside of Washington. Maybe in \nWashington we love to play political games. We beat them up, they beat \nus up, and nothing gets done. We end up arguing about failure: It is \ntheir fault we didn't fix it. No; it is your fault we didn't fix it. \nAnd absolutely nothing is ever fixed with that kind of a procedure.\n  How much better would it would be for us to gather and work together \nand fix it? And we can always argue the political argument about who \nfixed it: We fixed it. No; they fixed it. But at least we are arguing \nabout success about fixing something instead of trying to argue about \nwhose fault it is that nothing gets done on something as important as \nMedicare, and trying to figure out which wedge issue we are going to \nuse this week and which wedge issue they are going to use next week. Is \nit not time that we kind of come together and say, ``Look, we have a \nbig problem''?\n\n  Today, we spend more money in Medicare than we take in in revenues to \npay for it. Today, not in 20 years. Today. If you use all of the \nrevenues in the trust fund, plus the revenues coming in, we are totally \ninsolvent in the year 2008. My fear is that in the year 2007 we are \ngoing to still be arguing about whether we want to fix Medicare or \nwhether we want to have a tax cut. That is not the appropriate \nargument. That is not the discussion we should be engaged in. We can \nargue whether we need a tax cut, and how we should craft it, and who \nshould benefit from it. That is a separate argument.\n  We should concentrate now on how to reform Medicare in a bipartisan \nfashion. I think this sense-of-the-Senate resolution suggests that.\n  It makes the point that the 15-percent surplus is nothing more than \nIOUs in the trust fund. It does not add a nickel to the trust fund. \nThat is a correct statement, and that is why I support the resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I yield myself 2 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President and fellow Senators, we have before us \na historic resolution, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with historic \nand brave Senators on it. If we adopt this and follow it, we will save \nthe Medicare program instead of arguing about it. The basic contention \nhere, plain and simple, is that prominent Democrat Senators are joining \nwith Republicans saying let's quit arguing; let's fix it.\n  That is the principal thrust of this resolution. I say to Senator \nBreaux, Senator Kerrey, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and \nSenator Frist, you are to be commended and lauded, because I predict on \nthis day we have started down a short path before the year ends of \nfixing Medicare for the seniors permanently. We do not have to sit \naround here and argue about IOUs that the President wants to transfer \nto a trust fund without dedicating any revenue to the trust fund.\n  How do you fix a trust fund by putting in IOUs when it is all based \non revenues coming into the trust fund to pay the bills?\n  I join Senators--I am the fifth Member--as the Budget chairman, \nbecause I believe you are on the way, on the road to real success for \nour seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 176, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I send a modification to the desk. On page \n4, line 15, subparagraph 13 will read:\n\n       The recommendations by Senator John Breaux and \n     Representative William Thomas received the bipartisan support \n     of a majority of members on the National Bipartisan \n     Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n\n  We delete the words with respect to the Presidential appointees.\n  Just let me say as a followthrough on the statement by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator stated it \nexactly correct. We are on the road to real reform. We want to make \nsure that this Medicare program exists not only for the seniors today \nbut indefinitely in the future. I pledge to the Senator that that is \nwhat my committee will do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 176), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MODERNIZATION \n                   AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health insurance coverage provided under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is an integral part of the financial \n     security for retired and disabled individuals, as such \n     coverage protects those individuals against the financially \n     ruinous costs of a major illness.\n       (2) Expenditures under the medicare program for hospital, \n     physician, and other essential health care services that are \n     provided to nearly 39,000,000 retired and disabled \n     individuals will be $232,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2000.\n       (3) During the nearly 35 years since the medicare program \n     was established, the Nation's health care delivery and \n     financing system has undergone major transformations.\n\n[[Page S3315]]\n\n      However, the medicare program has not kept pace with such \n     transformations.\n       (4) Former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert \n     Reischauer has described the medicare program as it exists \n     today as failing on the following 4 key dimensions (known as \n     the ``Four I's''):\n       (A) The program is inefficient.\n       (B) The program is inequitable.\n       (C) The program is inadequate.\n       (D) The program is insolvent.\n       (5) The President's budget framework does not devote 15 \n     percent of the budget surpluses to the medicare program. The \n     federal budget process does not provide a mechanism for \n     setting aside current surpluses for future obligations. As a \n     result, the notion of saving 15 percent of the surplus for \n     the medicare program cannot practically be carried out.\n       (6) The President's budget framework would transfer to the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund more than \n     $900,000,000,000 over 15 years in new IOUs that must be \n     redeemed later by raising taxes on American workers, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public, and these new \n     IOUs would increase the gross debt of the Federal Government \n     by the amounts transferred.\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that the \n     transfers described in paragraph (6), which are strictly \n     intragovernmental, have no effect on the unified budget \n     surpluses or the on-budget surpluses and therefore have no \n     effect on the debt held by the public.\n       (8) The President's budget framework does not provide \n     access to, or financing for, prescription drugs.\n       (9) The Comptroller General of the United States has stated \n     that the President's medicare proposal does not constitute \n     reform of the program and ``is likely to create a public \n     misperception that something meaningful is being done to \n     reform the Medicare program''.\n       (10) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted changes to the \n     medicare program which strengthen and extend the solvency of \n     that program.\n       (11) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that \n     without the changes made to the medicare program by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the depletion of the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would now be imminent.\n       (12) The President's budget proposes to cut medicare \n     program spending by $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, primarily \n     through reductions in payments to providers under that \n     program.\n       (13) The recommendations by Senator John Breaux and \n     Representative William Thomas received the bipartisan support \n     of a majority of members on the National Bipartisan \n     Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n       (14) The Breaux-Thomas recommendations provide for new \n     prescription drug coverage for the neediest beneficiaries \n     within a plan that substantially improves the solvency of the \n     medicare program without transferring new IOUs to the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes, cutting benefits, or borrowing more from the \n     public.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions contained in this budget resolution \n     assume the following:\n       (1) This resolution does not adopt the President's \n     proposals to reduce medicare program spending by \n     $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, nor does this resolution adopt \n     the President's proposal to spend $10,000,000,000 of medicare \n     program funds on unrelated programs.\n       (2) Congress will not transfer to the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund new IOUs that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes on American workers, cutting benefits, or \n     borrowing more from the public.\n       (3) Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend \n     the solvency of the medicare program and to ensure that \n     benefits under that program will be available to \n     beneficiaries in the future.\n       (4) The American public will be well and fairly served in \n     this undertaking if the medicare program reform proposals are \n     considered within a framework that is based on the following \n     5 key principles offered in testimony to the Senate Committee \n     on Finance by the Comptroller General of the United States:\n       (A) Affordability.\n       (B) Equity.\n       (C) Adequacy.\n       (D) Feasibility.\n       (E) Public acceptance.\n       (5) The recommendations by Senator Breaux and Congressman \n     Thomas provide for new prescription drug coverage for the \n     neediest beneficiaries within a plan that substantially \n     improves the solvency of the medicare program without \n     transferring to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund new \n     IOUs that must be redeemed later by raising taxes, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public.\n       (6) Congress should move expeditiously to consider the \n     bipartisan recommendations of the Chairmen of the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n       (7) Congress should continue to work with the President as \n     he develops and presents his plan to fix the problems of the \n     medicare program.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a UC?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to seek the yeas and nays on an additional amendment that is \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 161, the \nVoinovich amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As a member of the Budget Committee and a member of the \nFinance Committee and somebody who was worked and voted for Medicare \nreform in the Finance Committee as part of a group cochaired by Senator \nBreaux along with Senator Chafee, I believe we must have reform of the \nMedicare program. There is no question about that. I applaud the \nefforts of Senator Breaux. Nobody has worked harder over a longer \nperiod of time to try to get the job done.\n  As a part of the centrist coalition, I voted in the Finance Committee \nfor a series of difficult steps to begin the process of reforming the \nMedicare program.\n  I think my record on the question of being willing to cast tough \nvotes to reform Medicare is beyond question. But I must say, as I look \nat this amendment that has been offered by the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee, I have real doubts about this. It looks to me \nto be a political statement as much as it is an interest in reforming \nMedicare. When I see in the resolution the suggestion that the \nPresident's budget framework does not devote 15 percent of the budget \nsurplus to the Medicare program, I do not think that is a true \nstatement. I have read the President's framework, and it says very \nclearly that of the surpluses over the next 15 years, 15 percent is \ndedicated to Medicare. He does it by making a transfer to the trust \nfund.\n  People get up and quote the Comptroller General all of the time \naround here, only they leave out something very important that he said. \nThe Comptroller said in his statement before the Finance Committee that \nthe President's proposal ``provides a grant of a new set of Treasury \nsecurities for the Medicare Hospital Insurance Program which would \nextend the life of the trust fund from 2008 to 2020.''\n  That is the testimony of the Comptroller General before the Senate \nFinance Committee. Others have stood in the Chamber and said that he \ndenigrated the proposal. Well, he certainly did raise questions about \nit in certain ways, but he also made the very clear statement that the \nPresident's proposal does extend the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund from 2008 to 2020.\n  Those who stand in this Chamber and tell our colleagues and the \nAmerican people that the President's proposal does not do anything are \nnot telling the truth. To just be selective in their quotations of the \nComptroller General does a disservice to this body and a disservice to \nanybody else who is listening.\n\n  Let's be direct and honest. The President's proposal is to reserve 15 \npercent of the surpluses over the next 15 years for Medicare. That is a \nbreak in policy, without question. It is a change. We should debate the \nwisdom of that change. But to stand up here and say it makes no \ndifference, that is not factual and it is not honest as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to complete the thought and then I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  As I read this resolution, it is suggesting that it makes no sense to \nmake any transfer from the general fund to the HI trust fund. I do not \nagree with that. I think that is flat wrong. You can question the \npolicy. You can say, gee, we should not be doing that, but to suggest \nthat in this resolution, to\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nadopt in this resolution that we are just going to be opposed to a \ntransfer I think is a mistake. That has the cart before the horse.\n  As I go through this resolution, there are other things that trouble \nme. I, for one, value the work of the Medicare Commission. I value the \nwork of Senator Breaux, Mr. Thomas, and the others who served there, \nbut as I read this resolution it is suggesting that what they came up \nwith in terms of a proposal is what we ought to adopt. I am not \nprepared to say that because they also proposed a dramatic change in \npolicy. They proposed, instead of what we know now as the Medicare \nprogram, a system of vouchers. People would be able to go out in the \nmarketplace and buy insurance, and they would get from the Federal \nGovernment, instead of the coverage provided by Medicare, a voucher for \na certain amount of money to go out and purchase insurance.\n  That may be an excellent idea. I do not know. I think we are a long \nway from making a determination that that is the right course. We have \nnot completed a hearing process in the Finance Committee on that \nquestion. As I read this resolution, it is fundamentally endorsing that \napproach.\n  Also included in the recommendation of the Commission is an increase \nin the age of eligibility. That may be necessary, but I do not think we \nought to conclude that in the Chamber here today.\n  So, Madam President, I respect those who bring the amendment before \nus but I, for one, would not vote for it. I do not think saying, in \neffect, that we should not make a transfer from the general fund to \nstrengthen Medicare is something we ought to be saying. In fact, I \noffered an amendment last night that said just the opposite, that we \nought to, as part of a reform proposal, put more resources into the \nMedicare plan. I think it needs more resources.\n  I also believe it has to be reformed. I think we need both. I am \ncertainly not going to vote for an amendment that suggests that what \nthe President has proposed is wrong. I also think, as I indicated, that \nsome of the statements here are just factually incorrect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I do not necessarily disagree with \neverything the distinguished Senator from North Dakota has pointed out. \nIt is important for everyone to understand that the suggestion of the \nadministration of 15 percent of the surplus in the form of IOUs into \nthe Medicare trust fund does not give the trust fund one nickel, one \ndime, one dollar more money. It only gives the trust fund IOUs in the \nform of Treasury securities on which, in the future, Medicare can go to \nthe general fund and make a claim. That is all it does.\n  Basically, that is the same situation as we have today because it is \nan entitlement program. People are entitled to it. The question I have \nis, are we going to have no limit on how much of the general fund is \ngoing to be used to finance Medicare?\n  Madam President, 37 percent of the money today comes out of general \nrevenues. It was supposed to start off as a payroll tax and that was \nhow it was to be funded. Are we going to go to 40 percent without any \nconcern? Are we going to go to 50 percent without any concern? How much \nof the general revenues are going to finance Medicare to the detriment \nof the national defense or anything else that we have as a nation?\n  I suggest to use this transfer of IOUs without making formal \ndecisions and having serious debate about it is not good policy because \nit doesn't help Medicare at all. That is why it is important to \nunderstand it does not provide any new money to the Medicare program at \nall.\n  We should have that debate. We suggested a way of looking at it, but \nI think just saying 15 percent of the surplus solves the Medicare \nproblem to the year 2030 is very, very erroneous. It is incorrect. We \nshould not rely on that as a way of saving Medicare.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nMassachusetts consumes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from North Dakota \nwill respond to a question? I listened to my friend from Louisiana. He \ntalked about the IOUs. I find it somewhat difficult to understand how \nthe IOUs can be used for a tax cut of some, I guess, $778 billion but \ncannot be used for the Medicare trust system.\n  I have in my hand, from the Office of the Actuary of the Department \nof Health and Human Services in his submission to the Finance \nCommittee--he is the chief actuary for HHS, and I will make this part \nof the Record--but it says, under this budget proposal, referring to \nthe President's proposal, it would postpone the exhaustion of the trust \nfund for an estimated 12 years.\n  I guess we have Members of the Senate saying these are IOUs and you \nare not going to really do anything by getting that kind of IOU for the \nMedicare trust fund. Here we have the chief actuary for HHS saying \nexactly the opposite, that it will extend it to the year 2020. I fail \nto follow the logic, where you have the IOUs and they are going to be \nused by our majority, our Republican friends, for tax breaks for \nwealthy individuals. I wonder if he can help clarify this dichotomy for \nme?\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter dated January 27, 1999, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Health &\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                  Baltimore, MD, January 27, 1999.\n     From: Richard S. Foster, Office of the Actuary.\n     Subject: Estimated year of exhaustion for the HI Trust Fund \n         under a proposal to augment HI financing with general \n         fund transfers.\n     To: Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request for the estimated \n     year of exhaustion for the Hospital Insurance trust fund \n     under a legislative proposal developed for the President's \n     Fiscal Year 2000 Budget. At this time, we do not know the \n     full specifics of this proposal. It is our understanding that \n     the proposal would create a new transfer of revenues from the \n     general fund of the U.S. Treasury to the HI trust fund for \n     each year from 2000 through 2014. The transfer amount each \n     year would be set equal to a specified percentage of the HI \n     taxable payroll for the year.\\1\\ The applicable percentages \n     would be specified in the legislation and would equal 15 \n     percent of the unified budget surpluses projected for the \n     President's Fiscal Year 2000 Budget, expressed as a \n     percentage of the projected HI taxable payrolls.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ ``HI taxable payroll'' is the total amount of all wages, \n     salaries, and net income from self-employment that is subject \n     to the HI payroll tax under the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act (FICA) and the Self-Employment \n     Contributions Act (SECA).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Under the proposal, the future transfers from the general \n     fund would depend only the specified percentages of HI \n     taxable payroll and would not be affected if actual future \n     unified budget surpluses differed from the Fiscal Year 2000 \n     Budget projections. We understand that, in contrast to the \n     associated proposal for the Social Security program, there \n     would be no change in current-law investment practices for \n     the HI trust fund. Similarly, the estimates in this \n     memorandum reflect Medicare's current benefit provisions as \n     specified under present law.\n       We were provided with projected additional HI revenues \n     under this proposal based on the intermediate set of \n     assumptions from the 1998 Trustees Report, as estimated by \n     the Office of Management and Budget and the Social Security \n     Administration's Office of the Chief Actuary. These amounts \n     are listed below (in billions):\n\n                                                                                          CALENDAR YEAR\n                                                                                      [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007      2008      2009      2010      2011      2012      2013      2014     2000-2004   2000-2009   2000-2014\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n$17.6....    $19.6      $27.2      $26.0      $29.5      $32.6      $40.0      $45.4      $50.0     $55.7     $60.9     $65.9     $70.2     $73.7     $75.5     $119.9      $343.8      $689.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S3317]]\n\n       Based on the intermediate assumptions and the projected \n     general fund transfers listed above (15% of surplus), we \n     estimate that the assets of the HI trust fund would be \n     depleted in calendar year 2020 under this proposal, as \n     compared to 2008 under present law. Thus, this Budget \n     proposal would postpone the year of exhaustion by an \n     estimated 12 years.\n       This estimate is subject to change if our understanding of \n     the proposal is incorrect. In addition, it is important to \n     note that the financial operations of the HI trust fund will \n     depend heavily on future economic, demographic, and health \n     cost trends. For this reason, the estimated year of depletion \n     under this proposal is very sensitive to the underlying \n     assumptions. In particular, under adverse conditions such as \n     those assumed by the Trustees in their ``high cost'' \n     assumptions, asset depletion could occur significantly \n     earlier than the intermediate estimate. Conversely, favorable \n     trends would delay the year of exhaustion. The intermediate \n     assumptions represent a reasonable basis for planning.\n       The estimated year of exhaustion is only one of a number of \n     measures and tests used to evaluate the financial status of \n     the HI trust fund. If you would like additional information \n     on the estimated impact of this proposal, we would be happy \n     to provide it.\n                                        Richard S. Foster, F.S.A.,\n                                                    Chief Actuary.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Massachusetts makes an interesting \npoint. We have to be very careful in our use of language around here. \nWhen people talk about Government instruments as being IOUs, I suppose \nin a way that is true. But it probably leaves people with a \nmisimpression. These are Government bonds, U.S. Government bonds. There \nis no more valued instrument in the world than a U.S. Government bond. \nI would love to have somebody give me Government bonds worth $700 \nbillion. The suggestion that that has no value is an absurdity. It is \nan absurdity. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. \nGovernment. There has never, ever been a default on an obligation of \nthe U.S. Government. So this kind of careless use of language I think \nmisleads people.\n  Of course they have value. They have exactly the value that is on \ntheir face. These are bonds that have $700 billion worth of value, plus \nthey earn interest. The fact is, this suggestion that it doesn't make \nany difference if you transfer these instruments, these bonds, to the \ntrust fund is just wrong. They extend the solvency of the Medicare \ntrust fund by 12 years.\n  Is that the only thing we should do? Certainly not. Senator Breaux is \nexactly right. That is not the only thing we should do. Maybe it is not \neven the first thing we should do. But we have to decide on a budget \nresolution right now. We do not have the luxury of waiting until the \nreform plan is passed. We have to make a decision how resources are \ngoing to be used around here. What we are suggesting is the resources \nought to be used in a certain priority order.\n  The first priority is using every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security. Then we are saying, in the non-Social \nSecurity surplus, the next priority ought to be to strengthen Medicare. \nWe think that is a priority of the American people. Yes, there ought to \nbe reform as well, and then we ought to also have some resources that \nare available for high-priority domestic needs like education and \ndefense--and, yes, tax relief. But the first priority of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus is not tax relief, especially tax cuts that are \ndesigned to go to the wealthiest among us.\n  We had, yesterday, a discussion of what some on the other side want \nin terms of an across-the-board cut. To those who are earning $800,000 \na year, they would give $20,000. To those earning less than $38,000 a \nyear on average, they would give $99. I think it is a higher priority \nfor the American people to strengthen Social Security and extend its \nsolvency than to go out and give back $20,000 to somebody who is making \nalmost $1 million a year. That is a question of priorities. It is the \ndifference between us. The Senator from Massachusetts is right on this \nquestion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, and the Senator could correct me--\nmaybe this is better directed to the Senator from Louisiana--even with \nthe Commission's recommendation--according to the Commission's own \nreport, that will only extend the solvency of the Medicare system 3 to \n4 years, on the one hand, even if we went ahead.\n  I am not disputing that there may be recommendations filed by the \nCommission that may be worthwhile. But on the one hand we have the \nopportunity to extend it 12 years under the transfer. On the other \nhand, even if we accept the Medicare Commission, it is only 3 or 4 \nyears.\n  So as I understand the position of the Senator, we ought to have the \nlonger extension, we ought to consider the Breaux commission report, \nand then move ahead and take what steps we need to take in order to \nstrengthen and improve the program, which would certainly include the \nprescription drugs.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope people think very carefully about \nthis amendment as drafted. Because it seems to me, if they vote for it, \nthey are saying they do not want to do anything to extend the solvency \nof the Medicare trust fund. They are adopting, it seems to me, a view \nthat, at least with respect to the surpluses that are projected over \nthe next 15 years, they do not want to dedicate any of that money to \nextend the Medicare trust fund solvency, and the fact is the Medicare \ntrust fund is in more immediate danger than is the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  We expect insolvency in the Medicare trust fund by 2008. That is why \nsome of us feel strongly that we ought to keep alive the possibility of \ntransferring some of these surpluses that we now project to strengthen \nand preserve the Medicare system.\n  Beyond that, I think we have to ask the question, are we ready to say \nthat the solution we want to adopt is what the National Commission on \nthe Future of Medicare adopted? They couldn't reach agreement in terms \nof the supermajority that was required of them to make a \nrecommendation. It seems to me we ought to keep our powder dry until we \nconsider all of the options that we might want to adopt to reform \nMedicare.\n  Again, I say this with the greatest of respect for Senator Breaux and \nSenator Kerrey and other Members who served on that Commission, along \nwith Mr. Thomas and others. I have real concerns about what is included \nin this amendment. Part of it, I think, is just factually wrong. The \nsuggestion that the President is not reserving 15 percent in his \nframework for Medicare defies the facts. It defies what is clearly in \nhis plan. I do not think it is wise to adopt something that makes false \nstatements.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I have 5 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. \nLet me first say that sometimes what happens is, you find out about an \namendment and you don't have time to really prepare. I have just a \ncouple of observations, nothing really well rehearsed or well prepared \nabout this amendment.\n  Let me just say to my good friend from Delaware that not only do I \nthink the amendment doesn't give justice to some of the President's \nproposals, I want to express some very serious reservations about the \nwork of the Commission. It is out of respect for my colleague from \nLouisiana, but it is just honest disagreement.\n  I will say this right away: I have respect for Senators who are \nwilling to stake out a position that they think is the right thing to \ndo. Even if there is lots of opposition, they have the courage to do \nso. Senator Breaux is that kind of Senator.\n  For my own part, there are at least two major concerns that I have \nand that I think should be laid out in this Senate discussion. One is I \nreally do worry a lot about the effort to, if you will, voucherize \nMedicare. It worries me that we will create a system where those people \nwho are wealthier and probably healthier can opt out for additional \nkind of coverage, additional plans and, therefore, I think you get\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\ninto the problem of adverse risk selection. I think the very thing that \nhas made Medicare such a stirring success for our country, which is \nsort of we are all in this together, we all pay into it, I think we do \nserious damage to that principle. I worry that the Medicare system will \nend up being a system where really what you had left were those that \nwere the frailest and the sickest of our elderly, and we could not \nsustain it economically. I think that does serious damage to the \nuniversality principle of Medicare.\n  The second point I want to make is that I think the reliance on \nmanaged care is profoundly mistaken. I think the record of managed care \nin rural American is a not a good one. I think the reason we are going \nto have a major debate on patients' protection, I say to my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, is that many people feel that what has happened is \nthat with the eight or nine largest insurance companies owning and \ncontrolling well over 60 percent of the managed care plans, what you \nhave going on in the country is bottom line medicine, where the bottom \nline is the only line. It has become increasingly corporatized and \nbureacratized and not at all user-friendly.\n\n  I think senior citizens will not do well with a system that relies so \nmuch on managed care.\n  Finally, I want to express my major opposition--and before Senators \nvote on this, I think they should think about this question--to \nextending the age from 65 to 67. With all due respect, I don't think we \nshould create yet another group of people who have no health insurance \ncoverage or another group of citizens, in this particular case, 65 to \n67, who maybe will purchase the coverage, but they won't be able to \nafford it.\n  I think that it is a grave mistake to support this amendment that my \ncolleague from Delaware has brought to the floor. Frankly, I think we \nshould be talking about Medicare for all--universal coverage. I \ncertainly think we should be talking about expanding Medicare to \ninclude prescription drug coverage for senior citizens. I have \nintroduced a bill with Barney Frank on the House side to do this, and \nother colleagues have done this. I think, out of respect for my \ncolleague, it is an honest difference of opinion.\n  I think this amendment, supporting the work of the Commission, goes \nin the wrong direction. A, it voucherizes Medicare; leads to adverse \nrisk selection; no longer has the principle of universality applying; \nthose people who are sickest and poorest will be left in, and the \nsystem will not sustain itself. That is a mistake. B, the reliance on \nmanaged care is mistaken. C, in no way, shape, or form, should we \nextend the age from 65 to 67.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I say to \nmy colleagues from Delaware and Louisiana, I have listened to this. I \nregret to say we are going to be voting on this, because there are a \nlot of things in this Commission report that I think warrant the \nsupport of our colleagues, and things where obviously, as my colleagues \nfrom Massachusetts and Minnesota and others have pointed out, there is \nserious disagreement as well.\n  My concern is that we are going to have a vote on this resolution, \nand it kind of hardens positions a lot earlier than we should be. This \nis very serious work. When you get involved in this kind of a vote, \npeople casting positions on a resolution that has no value in law, it \nseems to me it is not in the best interest, as we try to grapple with a \nvery serious and complex set of questions.\n  I am caught in a situation where there are a lot of things the \nCommission did I like. There are things the Commission did I disagreed \nwith. If forced to vote up or down, I guess I have to vote no, but I \ndon't want my vote ``no'' to be construed as disagreeing with \neverything the Commission has done. If I thought the vote really was \ngoing to change the Medicare system, that would heighten the value of \nthe vote, I suppose, to some degree. But since it doesn't have any real \nimpact in law, and I am being asked, as a Member, to make a choice on \nthis, I don't think it is really smart or wise for us to be put in that \nposition on something as important and as complex, where there are \nserious disagreements over how we ought to proceed.\n\n  I don't know procedurally what is possible, but this has been an \ninteresting discussion. I suggest that maybe there is some way this \ncould be vitiated and considered an interesting discussion and debate. \nBut let's not ask Members to vote on a resolution that casts us in a \nposition of making choices on a Commission where there will be a lot of \nlegitimate disagreements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues for listening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I point out to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Connecticut that we are not voting up or down the work of the \nBipartisan Commission. We very clearly say in this resolution:\n\n       Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend the \n     solvency of the Medicare program and to ensure that benefits \n     under this program will be available to beneficiaries in the \n     future.\n\n  We go on, on the next page, paragraph 6:\n\n       Congress should move expeditiously to consider the \n     bipartisan recommendation of the chairman of the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n\n  Paragraph 7:\n\n       Congress should continue to work with the President as he \n     develops and presents his plan to fix the problems of the \n     Medicare program.\n\n  Mr. President, what I am saying is, we ought to forget this debate, \ntrying to argue about surpluses and so forth.\n  What we want to do is to get on with the job, to work in a bipartisan \nspirit. I think the Finance Committee is known for working in a \nbipartisan spirit. I say to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, when I say that we are going to start work on this after the \nrecess, that is what I mean and that is what we will do. I think the \ndistinguished Senator knows me well enough to know that I am a man of \nmy word.\n  I ask that we proceed. Let us get the job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have respect for the Senate Finance \nchairman. When he says he is going to do something, my experience with \nhim is, he does it. That is not at issue here or at question.\n  But I must tell you, I do not read this as a bipartisan amendment. \nThere may be some Democrats who are on it--and I can understand why \nthey are on it--but I tell you, this does not look, to me, like a real \nbipartisan message that is being sent with this amendment. It looks, to \nme, like a lot of bash-the-President's proposal and suggestions that \nwhat is at the heart of the President's proposal, to transfer some \nresources from the general fund to strengthen Medicare, has no merit \nand that the answer is what the bipartisan reform Commission came up \nwith--which did not achieve the necessary agreement of that Commission \nto make a recommendation.\n  Frankly, I do not think this body should be in a position now to \ndecide that is the answer. I do not think a plan to----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Right here:\n\n       (6) Congress should move expeditiously to consider the \n     bipartisan recommendations of the chairmen of the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n\n  That sounds to me like an endorsement of the Commission's proposal. \nAm I wrong or right about that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It reads that way to me. I read the whole thing in its \ntotality.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. People can disagree, but then a vote for this would be \nan endorsement of any number of the different recommendations. That \nmight be good for some, but I want to make it clear to colleagues, if \nyou move the Medicare age up from 65 to 67, you go forward with the \nnotion of ``voucherizing'' Medicare, which is very different from \nMedicare today. To me, this is an up-or-down vote on these \nrecommendations. I could not possibly\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nvote for this right now. I hope other Senators will seriously consider \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just reclaim my time.\n  Mr. President, I hope colleagues will resist this amendment. I think \nsome of the statements in here are inaccurate. I think it sends a \nmessage which is not the message that should be sent at this time. I \nsay that as somebody who is committed to reforming Medicare, as well as \none who is committed to putting additional resources into the program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Roth amendment. \nI recognize, as I know all of my colleagues do, that Medicare is facing \nvery serious financial problems. I agree with the proponents of this \namendment that Congress must act carefully and expeditiously, in a \nbipartisan way, to make the structural reforms necessary to preserve \nMedicare for both current and future seniors. And I want to commend \nSenator Breaux and all of the members of the Bipartisan Commission on \nthe Future of Medicare, for working so hard in this effort and creating \na starting point for reform.\n  However, at this point, that's what the Breaux plan is--a starting \npoint. I do not necessarily agree with every piece of the Breaux plan, \nbut frankly, it is just too early for the Senate to endorse it. The \nCommission only finished its work last week, and most of us have not \nhad a chance to study the plan in detail. In addition, the Roth \namendment dismisses too quickly the President's proposal to devote 15% \nof the surplus to Medicare. Even with enactment of structural reforms, \nit is likely that more money will be needed for Medicare, and we \nshouldn't have to cut other health and education programs to find it. \nEven more importantly, in order for Medicare reform to be truly \nsuccessful, it is essential that we all work cooperatively with one \nanother--and with the President. It is unnecessary to pass an amendment \nthat blasts the President's proposal without giving it full \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, while I believe we must address Medicare reform, the \nBudget Resolution is not an appropriate nor meaningful place to do it. \nThe Roth amendment would tie the Senate's hands. It would force us to \ndeclare right now that the Breaux plan is the best plan, and that we \nwill not put even a fraction of the surplus into Medicare. I think that \nwould be a mistake. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Roth \namendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, through his work on the Medicare Commission, \nSenator Breaux has offered some very strong recommendations to deal \nwith our long-term problems in Medicare, and I hope that the Finance \nCommittee will act expeditiously in considering these and other reform \nelements. While I share many of the sentiments expressed in this \namendment, I don't believe it will bring us closer toward finding \ncommon ground on the Medicare question. Realization of comprehensive \nMedicare reform will require a genuine bipartisan effort from all \nparties involved, and we ought to be working to keep the political \ntension surrounding this debate to a minimum. I'm concerned that the \nwording of the amendment offered by Senator Roth will further divide us \nrather than bring us together on this important issue. For this reason, \nI will oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We would like to proceed, if we can, with the Kennedy \namendment. I ask the Senator, you are on that same amendment, are not \nyou?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just say, we can leave time for more debate on \nthis. The problem is, we are going to run out of time, and people are \nnot going to get any time on a score of amendments that they think are \nvery, very important, also. From my standpoint, you have control of \nplenty of the time. If we can get on with the next one, you can reclaim \ntime and use it off the bill if there is somebody who wants to discuss \nthis issue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we would be pleased to go to the next \namendment and lay this one aside. If someone wants to return to it \nlater, we can provide time to them. But we are ready to move on.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me ask, in terms of time, we still have how much \ntime on the bill? Something like 8 and a half hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct; approximately 8 and a \nhalf hours.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight hours 29 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the time been yielded on the amendment itself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 3 minutes 14 \nseconds; the distinguished Senator from North Dakota has 5 minutes 13 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not going to ask them to yield back their time. I \nask unanimous consent that we set this aside temporarily while the \nKennedy amendment proceeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could ask the floor managers, the Senator from New \nYork would like to have general time for 15 minutes, and then we will \nmove ahead with this amendment. We will try to move it along rapidly \nand not take all the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, we will not take it off yours, \nbut take it off the bill. We will charge it equally.\n  How much time, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fifteen minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleagues, the Senators from New Mexico, \nNorth Dakota, and Massachusetts, for allowing me to make this address, \nwhich is of real importance to the people in my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3319-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3319-S3321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PROTECT ME AND RESPECT ME\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, like many New Yorkers, I have spent a \ngreat deal of time in the aftermath of the Amadou Diallo killing \nreflecting about our city, our police, our country, and our people.\n  During my career, I think I have been considered a friend of both law \nenforcement and the minority community. But I have always been troubled \nby the rift between minorities and the police. And I have always felt \nthat this rift has caused pain and harm to both communities.\n  There are men, women and children, black and white, alive today \nbecause of the work of the New York City Police Department--their fine \nwork. New Yorkers are proud of that fact. Most cops are decent, \nhonorable, and hardworking--and it is wrong to judge all cops by the \nactions of the bad few.\n  But what we all must realize is that the momentous drop in crime and \nthe model behavior of many officers does not undo the plain truth that \nblack men and women in New York City who have never broken the law and \nwho should have absolutely no reason to fear law enforcement, are all \ntoo often hassled and made to feel like lawbreakers, and that it is \ndifferent for minorities than for the average white person in the city.\n  Many whites seem to feel that widespread frisking and patting down is \na small price to pay for a steep reduction in crime. But most white \npeople have never been frisked and have no conception of how pervasive \nthe practice is.\n  But if you talk to black stockbrokers on Wall Street and black \nlawyers downtown--people who wear a suit and a tie every day--to a \nperson they have a story of being stopped, frisked, and harassed by a \npolice officer.\n  If you talk to minority co-workers or attend services at African \nAmerican churches and ask the men and women from the congregation about \ntheir interaction with the police--they talk about how they or their \nlaw-abiding children were stopped, questioned and searched by the \npolice.\n  And they will tell you, as they have said to me, that they know this \ndoesn't happen as often to white people. They know that white people \nare treated differently.\n  All people, black and white, want very much for their neighborhoods \nto\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nbe safe and to feel confident that when they send their children or \ngrandchildren to the corner store for a carton of milk they will come \nhome safely. But in addition to these feelings, minorities are \nhumiliated and angered by the indignity of being treated all too often \nas presumptive criminals.\n  And if you take the time to listen, the views of minorities about the \nrelationship they want to have with the police can be summed up in five \nwords: ``Protect me, and respect me.''\n  This poem was left on the shallow doorway where Amidou Diallo was \nkilled:\n\n     When you look at me what do you see;\n     Am I innocent until proven guilty;\n     Am I your enemy;\n     Or were you sent here to protect me.\n\n  Protect me and respect me.\n  Whatever facts emerge from the killing of Amidou Diallo, or for that \nmatter, the killing of a Syracuse man, Johnny Gammage, by the \nPittsburgh police--whether it is guilty, not guilty, suspension, or \nremoval--our society must deal with the underlying problem of race and \nlaw enforcement.\n  There has been a great deal of rhetoric and anger in the aftermath of \nthe Diallo shooting, I can understand why. But I wish to take a \ndifferent approach.\n  I offer today, what I believe are constructive solutions that \ntranscend any one set of circumstances and will allow both the \n``protect me and respect me'' parts of the equation to coexist and even \nflourish.\n  First, for the sake of the city and for the sake of the police force, \nthe NYPD must immediately put in place a system that more quickly gets \nbad cops off the street.\n  It was well known among police, for example, that Justin Volpe, one \nof the cops who turtured Abner Louima was a bad, bad seed with multiple \ncomplaints against him. It was well known that officer Francis Livoti \nwas a ticking time bomb for years before he strangled Anthony Baez in \n1994.\n  The force knew it and did nothing about it. That attitude of silence, \nprotecting your own, sweeping problems under the rug has got to end, \nnot only for the sake of future victims, but for the police department \nitself.\n  The tens of thousands of good, honest, hardworking officers pay a \nprice when the Volpes are not removed. For that reason, it is in their \ninterest to end any policy of silence.\n  The mayor, the police chief, police union leaders, community leaders \nand church leaders should all urge police officers to come forward when \nthere is a bad element on the force. It should be an honorable action, \nnot a shameful action, to come forward.\n  Second, minority recruitment at the NYPD must improve. The force is \nmore than two-thirds white; the city is nearly three-fifths minority.\n  When mostly white cops patrol high-density, minority neighborhoods \nresentment is bound to follow.\n  The city should at last fully fund the Cadet Corps to recruit \nqualified, college educated minority applicants through the City \nUniversity. The program is on the books, but until this crisis was \nbasically ignored.\n  Also, the city should take advantage of a program created last year \nby Reverend Johnny Ray Youngblood and me to recruit and train young \nminority applicants through the churches and to help them become police \nofficers who will patrol the neighborhood from where they came.\n  Next, beyond minority recruitment, New York City should look to what \nworks in other places.\n  Two efforts stand out: Boston's Ten-Point Coalition and the \nmilitary's Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute.\n  Boston had the same problems as New York: a rift between police and \nthe African-American community; several high profile incidents of abuse \nby certain officers; and clergy that took on the role of police \ncritics.\n  Their hatred exploded into the open with the stabbing death of Carol \nStuart, a pregnant white woman. The husband, Charles Stuart, told \npolice that a black man committed the crime.\n  The Boston Police hit the streets in full force. They stopped and \nsearched every black male that fit the general description. The \nneighborhood residents complained about the tactics, but the crime was \nso horrible no one listened.\n  They arrested William Bennett, a black man. Carol Stuart's husband, \nit was learned months later, was the killer. Bennett was innocent.\n  And Boston was on the verge of a meltdown.\n  With no place else to go, the police and the clergy agreed to stop \nfighting and to sit down to develop a plan to stop crime on the one \nhand, and preserve dignity on the other.\n  They initiated a five-point contract.\n  The heart of it was this: The ministers and respected community \nleaders agreed to help identify those in the neighborhood who were the \nreal troublemakers. They took the responsibility of telling the police \nwho was dealing drugs and committing violent crime.\n  The flip side is that when ministers and community leaders took \nresponsibility and identified the troublemakers, others were left \nalone. And because most crime in each neighborhood is caused by just a \nfew people, the use of the standard stop in frisk procedure that the \ncommunity found so oppressive greatly diminished.\n  If an officer is abusive or disrespectful, ministers and community \nleaders have an open line to the police. If the police did not act, or \nif they refused to address the problem, the ministers and community \nleaders were free to go to the media.\n  The plan worked. The crime rate in Boston has dropped even faster \nthan in New York. Serious youth crime is almost non-existent. And the \nimportant but difficult relationship between police and the minority \ncommunity is vastly improved.\n  Last month in the Bronx, 100 members of the clergy met in the office \nof the Bronx Borough President and said they have always wanted to work \nwith the police. They said, ``We could be a resource. But they're not \nusing us. The police don't even know us. They don't come and talk to \nus.''\n  The Boston model will work in New York and we should move quickly to \nimplement it here.\n  The military--and our prayers are with the American soldiers fighting \nover Kosovo--has also found a way to confront bigotry while increasing \neffectiveness.\n  The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, developed in the \nearly 1970s to confront segregation and racial hostility among soldiers \nin Vietnam, is one of the reasons that the armed forces is the most \nintegrated institution in America.\n  The military learned that unless bigotry was ended in the armed \nforces, America could not have an effective military. So by necessity \nthey developed a program that lasts to this day.\n  Officers and supervisors take a course to confront their own \nstereotypes and to identify problems within their unit. They have a \nsimple goal: change people's behavior. The rule is that if you've got a \nproblem with race, it better not show up in your words or actions.\n  The thrust of the program is this: DEOMI, as it is called, \ncontinuously surveys enlisted soldiers and officers about race \nrelations on their base. The results are made known only to the \ncommanding officer and to people at DEOMI. When there is a problem on a \nbase, a mobile team of trainers moves in to solve it.\n  The model has been so successful that DEOMI has signed contracts to \nwork with police organizations. New York City should sign a contract as \nsoon as possible.\n  In conclusion, this has been one of the most trying and emotional \ntimes in New York in years. We are a city, right now, divided. No good \nhas ever come from divisiveness. No job was ever created. No street \nmade safer. No school made better by pulling ourselves apart.\n  I worry about two things:\n  First, is that division in ours, the most diverse city on earth, has \nthe potential to pull us down.\n  Second, failure to deal with this problem will ultimately weaken our \nefforts to fight crime and perhaps, forfeit the gains we made in crime \nreduction. That is unacceptable and unnecessary given that options \nabound if we choose them.\n  New York City is undoubtedly a safer place in every neighborhood from \nthe far end of the Bronx to the tip of the Rockaways. But it is not \nnecessarily a better place for every neighborhood.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King taught us that ``we are tied together in the \nsingle garment of destiny, caught in an inescapable network of \nmutuality. And\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nwhatever affects one directly affects all directly.''\n  The killing of Amdiou Diallo; the killing of Johnny Gammage affects \nus all directly.\n  We all love our city. Let's each side--as hard as it is to do--put \naside our frustration and distrust so we can move past confrontation \nand collaborate constructively on solutions that protect and respect.\n  I again thank the Chairman and my colleagues for their consideration \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from New \nYork on his maiden speech here in the Senate Chamber. The first speech \nby any member is one of the most important, and I think the Senator \nfrom New York chose well when he chose this subject. Obviously, it is a \nmatter of urgent concern in New York, and the Senator has spoken \nmovingly and persuasively about what must be done to respond to the \ncrisis there. I want to thank the Senator from New York for bringing \nthis to the attention of his colleagues and for doing a masterful job \nof informing us of what is facing the people of New York.\n  I again thank and commend the Senator on his initial speech here in \nthe Chamber. In my 12 years in the Senate, I believe the Senator from \nNew York is one of the most impressive new members and we are very \nhappy to have him here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3321-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3321-S3327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EXTENDING THE SOLVENCY OF \n                   MEDICARE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this \n     resolution assume that the savings from the amendment \n     reducing tax breaks for the wealthiest taxpayers should be \n     reserved to strengthen and extend the solvency of the \n     Medicare program.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over these past 2 days, we have had some \ngood debates and discussions about what is in the budget, and also what \nis not in the budget; and the particular emphasis and thrust of these \nvarious debates and discussions have been primarily on the issues of \nMedicare and Social Security.\n  The thrust of the amendment that I offer today, on behalf of myself \nand others, is targeted on the issue of Medicare. It basically gives an \nopportunity for the Senate of the United States to say we are going to \ndeal with the shortfalls in terms of the financial situations in \nMedicare prior to the time that we are going to consider a tax cut for \nwealthy individuals in this country. That will be the real choice for \nthe Members here--whether we are going to say that at least meeting the \nfinancial obligations of Medicare comes before the tax breaks for \nwealthy individuals.\n  As we have seen over the past 2 days, there is broad agreement that \nwe not only need to provide financial security for the Medicare system, \nbut we are also going to have to deal with the serious kinds of changes \nin the Medicare system. One of the important changes, I believe, is to \nput in place an effective prescription drug benefit for the elderly.\n  In 1965, I remember being on the floor of the Senate when this issue \ncame up. At that time, most health care plans did not include a benefit \nprogram for prescription drugs. At that time, we were attempting to \nfollow what was a generally agreed benefit program. We did that. We did \nnot include prescription drugs. Now prescription drugs are part of \nabout 98 percent of all of the private company programs. We want to \nmake sure we have an effective prescription drug benefit, not only \nbecause most companies have that benefit, but because of the enormous \nneed our elderly have for getting prescription drugs at reasonable \nprices, and also because as we have all seen the breakthroughs in the \nuse of prescription drugs in relieving suffering, illness, and \nsickness.\n  So it is very simple, Mr. President. We are saying, let's move toward \nwhat has been recommended by the President, what we have referred to in \ngeneral debate on other Social Security and Medicare issues, that \nbefore we are going to expend, over the 10-year budget period, $778 \nbillion in tax cuts, we will put aside some $320 billion over the 10-\nyear period in order to meet the financial needs of Social Security. \nThat is basically what this amendment is all about.\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n  The fact is, Mr. President, if you look through the budget \nrecommendation that has come from the Budget Committee, there is not \none single penny in this budget resolution, in addition to current \nservices, being put aside for the protection and the continuity of the \nMedicare system--not one, not a single penny. There will be references \nout here during the course of the debate that we have put aside $190 \nbillion, which is a new infusion of resources. That really represents \ncurrent services. If you didn't do that, you would be having cuts in \nexisting Medicare benefits. That $190 billion, over the 10-year period, \nwhich is referred to by the Budget Committee members, is just the \ncurrent services program. To say we are going to keep what we are \ncurrently providing in the Medicare system, that has been understood \nand recognized.\n  Secondly, there is a reference by some on the Budget Committee that, \nwell, we have an additional $100 billion that can be used at some time \nfor the Medicare system. But as we have seen over the course of the \ndebate, those funds are also being designated, on the one hand, for \nnatural disasters. It has been pointed out by members of the Budget \nCommittee that they average about $9 billion to $10 billion a year over \na 10-year period. There is the $100 billion. When our Budget Committee \nfriends are asked how we are going to deal with the issues of natural \ndisasters, the response is that we have the $100 billion in there to \ndeal with natural disasters. If Budget Committee members are asked how \nare we going to provide additional funds for Medicare, they say, well, \nwe have a $100 billion reserve that can be used for Medicare. Then \nwhen they are asked, well, where in this program is there a \nprescription drug benefit, they say, oh, haven't you seen the part of \nthe Budget Act that is going to provide for prescription drugs? This is \nthe most overutilized $100 billion that we can possibly imagine.\n\n  As I pointed out in the Record, we will not see any of those funds \nrealized, really, for the first 5 years. There is effectively a deficit \nin the first year of more than $6 billion, and effectively zero for the \nnext 4 years is returned. So none of those funds are going to be \navailable to try to deal with Medicare or any of these other issues for \nat least 5 years. Mr. President, what we are saying is that the money \nis out there.\n  The other point that is made and has been recently debated is, you \nreally can't get the 15 percent of the budget surplus earmarked for \nMedicare because it will be IOUs. I think my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota addressed that issue in the earlier debate and discussion. \nI found it interesting that they can use the IOUs for tax breaks, but \nthey cannot use IOUs for Medicare. Clearly, you can use it for \nMedicare. That is what we are attempting to do.\n  The vote will be very clear: whether we, on the one hand, are going \nto set aside the $320 billion--over the 10-year period--of the $778 \nbillion and say we are going to do that first. After we set aside that \n$320 billion, there will still be $458 billion that will be remaining.\n  There is a difference in this body on whether that money should be \nused for the Republican tax cuts or whether we ought to use $273 \nbillion out of that for the President's tax cuts. We can debate that at \nanother time. But there will still be a generous amount of resources \navailable there for tax reduction.\n  This amendment assures that we put priorities first. That is a very \nsimple and fundamental concept--that is, whether we are going to put \ntax breaks first or whether we are going to be putting the protection \nof Medicare first. That is the choice. That is the issue that will be \nbefore the Senate. Without this particular amendment, we are not going \nto provide the needed financial resources in time for the preservation \nof Medicare.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think it is important to realize who those \nfunds we are talking about really belong to. The amounts I am talking \nabout--$320 billion in this amendment, or the GOP tax cut, $778 \nbillion--those are basically the revenues that have been paid in by \nhard-working men and women in recent years. They have been paying into \nthe Medicare system as well as into Social Security. That reflects the \nresources of hard-working men and women that are paid into the Federal \nGovernment. The question now is whether those resources that \neffectively have been paid in by working families, we are asking \nwhether we ought to use those resources to protect the Medicare system, \nor whether they ought to be used for tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals. I don't think there is really a question about what the \nanswer would be. This amendment gives the opportunity to do so. That is \nwhat we are attempting to do.\n  Now, Mr. President, let's look at who these people are. The average \nMedicare recipient's income is $10,000 a year, is 76 years old, lives \nalone, has one or more chronic diseases, and is paying 19 percent of \ntheir income primarily for prescription drugs.\n  That is the profile across this Nation of the Medicare recipient. \nWhen we talk about Medicare recipients on the higher end of the level, \nwe are talking about individuals who are getting $25,000. But the \noverwhelming number of Medicare recipients are below the $12,000 or \n$13,000 level. We now asking in the Senate whether we are going to \nprotect the health care system which they depend on prior to granting \nthe tax break. That is the issue. We couldn't be clearer.\n  As this chart shows, 80 percent of the Medicare expenditures are used \nfor recipients with annual incomes of $25,000 or less. These are not \nindividual incomes, these are household incomes. So you have 60 percent \nwith $15,000 or under, you have 21 percent with $25,000 or under. \nEffectively, 80 percent of all the expenditures are in that area--\nfamilies, individuals, elderly people, or elderly couples, who have \nworked hard, paid into the system.\n  As we have heard, the Medicare system has serious challenges, serious \nproblems. No one denies that. The issue is, given the fact that the \nsystem is going to face ``financial instability''--to use it lightly--\nby the year 2008, should we effectively put in place, as the President \nhas, the recommended resources that will stabilize that to the year \n2020, and then move ahead and implement the kinds of recommendations? \nThat is the issue. These are hard-working retirees who have devoted \ntheir lives to this country, built this country, and they depend upon \nthe Medicare system for their livelihood.\n  If we do nothing at all, what will the alternatives be? If we are \ngoing to try to keep the Medicare system functioning to the year 2020 \nwithout this, there will be $686 billion necessary in benefit cuts or \npremium hikes for these elderly people. If we do nothing at all, we are \ngoing to have to collect that amount in benefit cuts or premium hikes. \nThose aren't my figures, those are the figures that have been given by \nthe Commission, by the Budget Committee, by the independent actuaries, \nby the trustees. Those are the choices.\n  I doubt if there will be a clearer opportunity for us to go on the \nrecord on the issue of priorities. The budget items are issues of \nnational priorities, where we as the elected membership of the people \nfeel the priorities ought to be. We are saying to those who are going \nto support this amendment that we believe the priority ought to be to \nprovide financial security and stability for the Medicare system to the \nyear 2020 before we give tax breaks to wealthy individuals. It is as \nsimple as that.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from North Dakota \nmight want.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nthis amendment, because I think it puts into stark relief what the \nchoices are. Fundamentally, this debate is about what we do with the \nprojected surpluses over the next 15 years. On our side, we believe \nthat the best use of the surpluses is, first and foremost, to protect \nevery dollar of Social Security surplus for Social Security.\n  Then we turn our attention to Medicare, because we believe Medicare \nis also critically important to this country's future, and we recognize \nthat it is endangered. We recognize that in 2008 it will be insolvent \nunless we take action. So we say take, of the surplus over the next 15 \nyears, 15 percent of that surplus --15 percent of that total unified \nsurplus--over the next 15 years. Dedicate that to Medicare. That is \nsome $700 billion.\n  That still leaves resources for high-priority domestic needs like \neducation\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\nand health care, defense, and, yes, tax relief. It is much less in the \nway of resources available for a tax cut plan than in the Republican \npriority list, because they really only have two priorities. Their \npriorities are safeguarding Social Security, which we commend them for; \nbut their other priority is a massive tax cut. They don't provide an \nadditional dollar out of the surpluses that we now project over the \nnext 15 years to strengthen Medicare. We think that is a mistake.\n\n  We have heard the other side repeatedly saying that putting this \ntransfer of resources to Medicare will require raising taxes, benefit \ncuts, or increasing gross debt to pay for Medicare in the future. We \nhave heard that said repeatedly on that side of the aisle. I would like \nto give an alternative view, because I don't think that is right. It \nsounds right. If one were expecting budget deficits in the future, it \nwould be right. But that is not what we are anticipating.\n  The fact is, we now project that there will be a surplus for more \nthan a decade even after we dedicate part of the surplus to Medicare \nand Social Security. That is because by paying down the publicly held \ndebt, the President's plan reduces net interest costs to the Federal \nGovernment and increases economic growth. Therefore, even after we \nstart using the surplus to pay for Medicare and for Social Security, \nthere will still be a budget surplus, hence no need for benefit cuts or \nfor premium increases.\n  Mr. President, that is central to what we are proposing and what we \nare advocating. We believe it is critically important to put Social \nSecurity first, but also to put Medicare first, because it has made a \nprofound difference in the life of this Nation. We now know that \nwithout Medicare and Social Security, a significant chunk of our senior \npopulation would be below the poverty level. Two programs in the life \nof this country have lifted senior citizens out of poverty: Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  So we believe that is where the priority ought to be: Social \nSecurity, and Medicare. After they are taken care of--after they are \ntaken care of; after they are taken care of--then we can deal with \nother domestic priorities, certainly education and health care. And, \nyes, defense. And, yes, there would still be resources available for \ntax relief--not as much as the tax cut plan in the Republican budget \nresolution, because they don't provide one thin dime out of these \nprojected surpluses to strengthen Medicare. They provide resources for \nSocial Security surpluses to support Social Security. That is in our \nplan as well. Where we diverge is on the question of whether or not we \nare going to use some of these surpluses we now project to strengthen \nMedicare. That is really at the heart of this debate and this \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Kennedy's \namendment. This amendment will address critical needs and ensure that \neducation investments are a top budget priority in FY 2000.\n  Mr. President, as we know the problems facing education today are \ngreat. We need a strong commitment and partnership between federal, \nstate and local governments to meet the needs of all students. Senator \nKennedy's amendment will strengthen the effort to reduce class size, \nprovide the full 40% federal share of special education program costs \nand free up resources for other education priorities. Importantly, this \namendment is paid for in the budget we are now debating with a simple \n20% reduction in the $778 billion tax cut proposed by the majority.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, some of my colleagues who oppose this \namendment are in effect asking school districts to choose between \nproviding smaller class sizes and funding for special education. This \nis a false choice, Mr. President. Both special education and small \nclass size are important national priorities, both deserve funding and \nwe can responsibly fund these programs without busting the budget. \nForcing school districts to choose between these critically important \neducation programs will only dilute the effectiveness of both programs.\n  Mr. President, funding for smaller class sizes should not be a \npartisan issue. Last year when we agreed to fund a serious effort to \nreduce class size there was broad support for the program proclaimed on \nboth sides of the aisle. What has changed Mr. President? Only a few \nmonths after praising the class size program, some are now blocking \nclass size funds and have pit one valuable education program against \nanother all to fund a tax cut we cannot yet afford.\n  Mr. President, there is wide consensus, based on solid research, that \ninvesting in smaller class size is the right thing to do. Research \nshows that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal \nattention to students and spend less time on discipline, as a result \nstudents learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. \nMy own state of Wisconsin is doing its part to reduce class size. \nWisconsin's Student Achievement Guarantee in Education or SAGE class \nsize reduction program, has proven conclusively that smaller classes \nmake a difference in our children's education. Mr. President, SAGE \nofficials in Wisconsin want a partnership with the federal government. \nNow is the time when school districts in Wisconsin and in other states \nare making budget decisions, they need to know if Congress will meet \nits commitment to reduce class size over the next six years to plan \neffectively.\n  Again, Mr. President, I support Senator Kennedy's amendment because I \nbelieve Congress should meet both the commitment to help schools reduce \nclass size and increase funding for special education without busting \nthe budget. I hope my colleagues agree that we should not waste this \nunique opportunity to responsibly make the needed investments in \neducation today for our children's future.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from New Mexico--\nactually, if my colleague wants to respond, I will wait and follow his \nremarks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator, but I would not do that at this \npoint.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has \napproximately 8 minutes and 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes remaining on the majority \nside.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the other question I want to ask my \ncolleagues before I go on the time, I know the Senator from Indiana has \nbeen waiting to speak now. Would that happen after this debate? He has \nbeen waiting patiently. I don't want to precede him, but I wish to know \nwhat your plan is.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not choose to speak at this point.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is not my question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My question was, before I get started, I know the \nSenator from Indiana has been waiting patiently to speak, I think the \nfirst time he has had a chance to speak in the Chamber. I wonder if the \nSenator wants to wait until after this debate and then he can proceed?\n  Mr. BAYH. If the Senator has a point he wishes to make, please feel \nfree to go ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. BAYH. No more than 10 minutes--general debate, not on the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to put the \namendment aside and allow the Senator from Indiana to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the Chair. I express my appreciation to my \ncolleagues here today and find myself in agreement with what my \ncolleagues from North Dakota and Massachusetts have been saying on this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, my statement today is in the nature of general debate.\n  I rise to give my first public remarks on the floor of the United \nStates Senate.\n  I rise at this time because as debate on the last budget of the 20th \nCentury begins, we have an historic opportunity\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nto build a strong financial foundation for the 21st.\n  The projected budget surpluses give us a once in a generation \nopportunity we must not squander. We must seize this moment of good \nfortune and replace the debt and deficit, borrow and spend mentality of \nthe recent past with a more responsible approach. We must get our \npriorities right: preserve Social Security and Medicare, pay off our \ndebts, target tax cuts to help working families and make investments in \neducation and national defense.\n  I believe strongly that the first step toward this more prosperous \nfuture must be to save Social Security and stabilize Medicare. To \nachieve this, I wholeheartedly support preserving 100% of Social \nSecurity Trust Funds for Social Security and 40% of other surplus funds \nfor Medicare.\n  Let me address Social Security first. By ending once and for all the \nirresponsible practice of raiding the Social Security Trust Fund, we \nwill extend the life of Social Security by 17 years to the year 2049. \nWe owe it to our seniors to ensure that their Social Security will be \nsafe, and our younger workers have a right to know that the system will \nbe there for them one day. Using surplus funds to save Social Security \nfirst is the fiscally responsible, socially compassionate way to \nachieve this.\n  Medicare, quite frankly, presents an even more urgent challenge. \nWithout action, it will be insolvent in only eight years. To prevent \nthis, I support dedicating an additional $376 billion of the surplus \nover the next ten years to Medicare. This will more than double its \nsolvency, to 2020.\n  But let me be very clear. These investments alone are NOT the \ncomplete answer to either Social Security's or Medicare's problems. We \nmust be willing to make the difficult decisions needed to save these \nvital services, not just once, but once and for all.\n  It won't be easy. None of the solutions is popular. But using the \nsurplus to strengthen both Social Security and Medicare in the near \nterm will make long-term, systemic reforms possible. The American \npeople are much more likely to embrace difficult steps taken gradually \nthan they are the more draconian action that not using the surplus for \nMedicare would entail. Those who propose nothing for Medicare today, \ncourt fiscal disaster tomorrow. We must not let that happen, and under \nour approach it will not.\n  Our approach to saving Social Security and stabilizing Medicare has \nenormous benefits in addition to securing the future for our elderly \nand keeping commitments to our young. Doing so will also dramatically \nreduce the national debt.\n  Paying down the national debt has many virtues. Lower debt will \nreduce our interest payments. Last year, 15 cents of every tax dollar \nwent for nothing productive. It merely serviced our national debt. \nUnder the approach I favor, interest payments shrink to only 4 cents of \nevery tax dollar in ten years--a savings to taxpayers of $452 billion \ndollars. And if we continue this approach, the debt will fall to its \nlowest level--as a percentage of GDP--since 1917.\n  With spending under control, a balanced budget, and government no \nlonger borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars, interest rates will \nfall. This makes it easier for private businesses to invest. New \ninvestments mean greater productivity growth, higher wages, and more \nsecure jobs for America's working men and women. The bottom line is \nclear: a better standard of living for all Americans.\n  This isn't just my opinion. Last month, I had the opportunity to \nquestion the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, about \nthis very subject. He too believes that paying down the national debt \nis the best way to guarantee a stronger economy and a responsible \nfederal budget.\n  As one of the principal architects of our current economic good \nfortune, Alan Greenspan knows that paying down the national debt is \npreferable at this point in the economic cycle to either spending \nincreases or dramatic tax reductions the nation cannot afford. As the \nChairman told me, ``. . . all of the arguments that one can make for \ntax cuts you can make for reduction in debt, they are the same forces. \n. .'' In addition, by paying off our debts now, we preserve the \nnation's ability to borrow again in the event of a future emergency and \nhold open the option of more aggressive tax cuts should the economy \nslow. Simply put: paying down the national debt is the responsible, \nconservative, economically and fiscally sensible thing to do.\n  It is the just and morally responsible thing to do as well. It is not \nright to ask our children and grandchildren to pay our bills. No \ngeneration in American history has done so, and we must not become the \nfirst.\n  Our legacy to future generations must be more than an IOU. Paying \ndown the debt will keep faith with America's past and create promise \nfor America's future.\n  Saving Social Security and Medicare by paying down the national debt \nis a significant undertaking, but if we act prudently, there is room \nfor our nation's other important priorities, including targeted tax \ncuts. Throughout my public career, I have been a vigorous advocate for \ncutting the tax burden on American families. In fact, I believe that \nwhen it comes to tax cuts--the more aggressive, the better. As Governor \nof Indiana, I was proud to be able to give Hoosiers the largest tax cut \nin our state history.\n  I strongly support targeted tax cuts here on the Federal level as \nwell--tax cuts that will eliminate the marriage penalty, save family \nfarms and businesses from the ravages of the estate tax, help families \nmeet the expenses of child care or caring for an elderly parent, and \ncreate jobs and stimulate investment by reducing the tax on capital \ngains.\n  There must be a balance among our priorities. We can't pursue one to \nthe exclusion of all others. If we give into temptation, and recklessly \npursue immediate gratification today, we will surely regret it \ntomorrow. And therein lies the difference between what we accomplished \nin Indiana and what some now propose in Washington. Our Hoosier tax cut \nplan was conservative, fiscally responsible, like the approach I \nsupport today. We never threatened to throw fiscal caution to the winds \nor require massive cuts in vital services for children or law \nenforcement.\n  I will be the first to sponsor a tax cut bill--the bigger the \nbetter--but not one out of all proportion to our ability to pay for it, \nnor one that risks returning us to the days when America was drowning \nin a sea of red ink. We must cut taxes as aggressively as possible \nwhile still meeting our other important national priorities.\n  Included in these important priorities are additional investments for \nnational defense, education and law enforcement. These are the kind of \nareas where even modest investments today yield multiple benefits \ntomorrow.\n  Because I strongly believe that government must make investments--\nwithin its means, of course--in these important areas, I am troubled by \nthe current budget resolution that would force drastic and unwarranted \nacross the board budget cuts in many important domestic programs \nranging from Head Start to the FBI.\n  Mr. President, it is incumbent upon the Senate to resist the twin \ntemptations of immediate gratification and postponing difficult \ndecisions. Both parties, quite frankly, have been guilty of this for \ntoo long. Today it is the Budget Resolution that succumbs to these twin \ntemptations, indulging us immediately with all the things we want while \nputting off until tomorrow the things we would rather not do but know \nwe really must. This may be good politics. It is not good government.\n  Despite the fact that we will not achieve a bipartisan solution this \nweek, I am still heartened by how much closer both parties are today on \nfiscal issues than even in the recent past.\n  It seems to me there is a national consensus growing, a consensus \nthat cuts across party lines, that believes in some basic core \nprinciples: Saving Social Security and Medicare first, paying down the \nnational debt, making targeted tax cuts for working families, and \ninvesting in our future. We can start down the road toward \naccomplishing these goals--something that is well within the grasp of \nthis Senate--and, in so doing, build a better America. Also, we will be \nable to look our children and grandchildren squarely in the eye, secure \nin the knowledge that what we have done has not been just easiest for \nus, but also what is best for them.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity, and for the \nindulgence of my colleagues, and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Bayh for his \nwords. It is an honor to be on the floor while you are speaking, and I \nthank you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator suspend for just one moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be glad to, as long as I retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time, actually, is controlled by the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that John \nJennings, a fellow in Senator Bingaman's office, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the pendency of S. Con. Res. 20, the \nbudget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 8 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just yield myself a minute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my admiration and \nrespect to my friend and colleague from Indiana on his maiden speech. \nIt is an important speech because it deals with the economic future of \nour Nation. He brings a perspective to this issue as someone who has \nbeen an effective Governor and has had a broad reputation, not only in \nhis State but throughout the country, as someone who understands the \neconomics of his State well and has a reputation as a skilled Governor, \nmaking sure his State prospered and the benefits were going to go to \nthe people.\n  Now he speaks in the Senate as we are making a judgment, at a very \nimportant, critical time, given the change in our financial situation \nwith the size of the surplus, and he has given us a great deal to think \nabout. It is quite clear from his statement he has given it a good deal \nof thought.\n  I thank him for his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield time to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think this amendment that Senator \nKennedy has brought to the floor is a major, what I would call, \npolitical economy amendment. It is a major values amendment. This \namendment goes to the heart of what we are about as a nation, and we \nhave a couple of choices. Either we can go with this budget resolution, \nwhich goes in the direction of massive tax cuts for the years to come \ndisproportionately going to the highest-income citizens, with the \nMedicare trust fund expiring in the year 2008. Or we can take part of \nthis surplus and use that to strengthen the Medicare program that we \nhave in this country.\n  If we do not do that--I just want to be really clear, and I know I am \nright about this, even though I do not want to be right--what we are \ngoing to see is either a cut in benefits or we will see the age \nextended for eligibility for Medicare, or we will see other proposals \nwhich will do major damage to the idea of this program as being a \nuniversal, comprehensive health care coverage program for senior \ncitizens, albeit in my State of Minnesota only 35 percent of senior \ncitizens have any coverage at all for prescription drug benefits.\n  We need to expand Medicare, another reason to support the Kennedy \namendment and albeit Medicare does not do anything to cover \ncatastrophic expenses, which is a nightmare for people toward the end \nof their lives if they should have to be in a nursing home or if they \nlook for support from home-based health care.\n  But I would like to say to colleagues, as far as I am concerned in \nthis budget debate, this amendment is the heart-and-soul amendment. We \nhave a really clear choice. A budget resolution is a resolution; it \ngives us some general direction. My colleague from New Mexico \nundoubtedly will have a response. I wish I had time to respond to his \nresponse. But from my point of view, this is a values debate. We can, \nwith the surplus, as we look ahead, talk about tax cuts mainly going to \nthose who are most affluent, or we can say we are going to reserve part \nof this surplus to bolster Medicare, which is a critically important \nprogram, not just for about 680,000 seniors in Minnesota with an income \nprofile pretty low, not very high, but, in addition, for their children \nand their grandchildren.\n  This is a family values amendment. There ought to be nothing more \nimportant for us to do than to give general direction to the \nproposition and to the idea and to the core value that we are going to \nreserve part of this surplus to help bolster Medicare.\n  I can make a lot of other proposals. Mr. President, how much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just say to my colleagues, I would like to see \nalso, above and beyond support for this amendment, talk about how we \ncan strengthen Medicare in other areas.\n  We should double the NIH budget. My colleagues, Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin, are right, because the research and finding the cure \nfor some of the diseases in our country like Alzheimer's and diabetes \nand Parkinson's will do wonders toward reducing Medicare expenditures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will get a chance to speak more on \nthis. This is the critical vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from West \nVirginia wanted to address the Senate on a matter relating to the \nbudget. I am wondering whether there is some time he can use.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator from West Virginia like?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from West Virginia would like to have 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes off the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say I don't have any objection. \nObviously, even if I did, probably I couldn't do anything about it. But \nI do want to ask Senators if they would be somewhat helpful. I know, \nnow that Senator Kennedy has a chart up that describes the Democrat \nplan that doesn't exist, and a Republican plan that doesn't exist, that \neverybody wants to come to the floor and talk about this. I remind \neveryone and ask their indulgence and help: We have about 35 to 40 \namendments that people want to be heard on. They are legitimately as \ninterested as are colleagues on this issue, which we have already \ndebated three times on three amendments.\n  I am not going to argue about it. I say go ahead, we will give you 10 \nminutes, but when you take it off the bill, it means it is not \navailable for anyone at the end of this bill. So I ask we be a little \nbit helpful in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I understand \nthe point of the Senator. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  This particular Senator from West Virginia was a member of the \nMedicare Commission and I know, undoubtedly, several have spoken. But \nwhatever amendments may be remaining, there cannot be many as important \nas the disposition of Medicare. Medicare is something that is not that \nwell understood even though everybody knows what it is, and therefore \nit is subject to easy amendments and easy resolutions, and facts are \nentirely often lost.\n  There is, I understand, a resolution or whatever praising the \nMedicaid Commission for its bipartisan efforts\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nand the rest of it. Those of us who were on that Commission know that \nisn't and wasn't the case. It was not a bipartisan Commission; it was a \nCommission that was divided from the very beginning.\n  It was a Commission in which there was really no give and take. Just \nso my colleagues can understand, the plan, which was being changed \nevery 5 minutes, as certain Members sought to get votes here and there, \nwas not even finally given to my office until 4 o'clock the day before \nthe vote. I was in West Virginia so I didn't see the plan until an hour \nbefore the vote. It was really kind of a shambles of an operation.\n  But that isn't nearly as important as the fact that beneficiaries pay \nmore under this plan for the same or fewer benefits. It isn't nearly as \nimportant as the fact that the sick and the disabled were probably \ngoing to have to pay the most. The fact that this plan contemplates and \nits authors contemplate the numbers of years that 50 to 75 percent of \nall Medicare beneficiaries will belong to HMOs--of course, I don't \nbelieve that is ever going to happen. They do it, and it is reflected \nin their plan.\n  Just imagine for a moment what that would mean, because HMOs would \nnaturally attract the most wealthy and the most healthy. So what would \nthat mean for the people in my State who are left in fee-for-service \nmedicine? Fee-for-service would be a very small pot of money which \nwould have to cover an enormous amount of people.\n  The philosophy of the Medicare Commission fundamentally was that free \nenterprise can solve the problems of Medicare, and that is why they \nsaid 50 to 75 percent will join HMOs over the next 15 to 20 years. Of \ncourse, free enterprise had its chance to work with respect to people \nover 65 and did it so badly, that is the reason we created Medicare, in \norder not to leave it up to the market system in its entirety and to \nmake sure that every senior had health care coverage.\n  There was a lot of ideology involved in the Commission. There were a \nlot of people there primarily because of an ideological commitment, a \ncommitment that was there from the very beginning. It was very obvious. \nThere never really was any discussion of issues. There were speeches, \nbut not much discussion. Seniors, I think, had very little idea of what \nwas in the plan.\n  Those who remember catastrophic health care--if Congress puts forward \na plan and doesn't consult seniors and seniors aren't knowledgeable \nabout it, you can have it thrown right back in your face. Medicare is \nnot something you can fool around with.\n  Speaking for my own point of view, representing the State of West \nVirginia, the average senior in West Virginia has a total gross income \nfrom all sources, of $10,763. Then, from that amount you subtract \n$2,000 to pay for their Medigap or their out-of-pocket expenses for \nhealth care which they can't get from Medicare, primarily prescription \ndrugs. That means the average senior in the State has a gross income \nfor a year of about $8,500.\n  I will guarantee you, this Senator isn't fooling around with chances \non Medicare. There is no way that I am taking a chance on Medicare, \nthat I am betting on something that did not work prior to 1965, that \nsuddenly people say will work after this Medicare Commission presented \nits plan which did not pass and which was basically defeated on a \npartisan vote, which was very, very sad. It was fated from the \nbeginning, and it was very, very sad.\n  I have chaired four national commissions. This was the fifth one I \nhave been on. It was probably the worst experience I have had since I \nhave been in the Senate. I say that with regret, because I care \nenormously about health care, and I care enormously about the people \nwho ran the Commission. I thought they tried their very best, but it \nwas fated to fail from the very beginning because of the ideological \nbent that it carried with it. I think a measure here to praise it is \ntotally out of place.\n\n  I mentioned prescription drugs. Everybody understands that when the \nPresident was wise enough to put aside 15 percent to pay down the debt \nso the money would become available because of the lack of higher \ninterest payments for Medicare, that that was a very wise thing to do. \nThat also allows us to contemplate prescription drugs. The Medicare \nCommission wouldn't even consider the use of that 15 percent. They \nwouldn't consider it. As a result, prescription drugs are not uniformly \navailable.\n  Some seniors already have prescription drugs. They get it through \nMedigap. This would say, well, you would have to be up to 135 percent \nof poverty, but that just came in in the last week or so. That would \ndisappear, I think, on the floor of the Senate, because I do not think, \nfrankly, that the majority would want to see prescription drugs, \nbecause they would say it would cost too much. Well, they might be \nright. I think they are wrong. Seniors are now paying for it.\n  Under this plan, they purport that prescription drugs are covered, \nbut they are, indeed, not covered. Many beneficiaries would not have \nit. They talk about prescription drugs for low-income beneficiaries, \nbut most would not have them.\n  On one of the most extraordinary things that I think would very much \naffect the senior Senator from New Mexico, they punt. They don't even \npunt. They kick at the ball and miss it on the subject of graduate \nmedical education. We do not have doctors in this country by accident. \nWe have doctors in this country because their residencies and their \npostgraduate experiences are paid for, 50 percent by Medicare. Some \npeople may not think that it should come out of Medicare, but if it \ndoesn't come out of Medicare, then it should come out of some \ndesignated fund, an au pair trust fund or something of that sort.\n  What is incredible about the Medicare Commission is that it simply \nsays, we will leave graduate medical education or direct medical \neducation up to the appropriations process, which is like saying \ngoodbye to all foreign doctors, which are as important in New York City \nas they are in southern West Virginia, because foreign doctors are well \ntrained and they get further training in their own country.\n  Fifty percent of their expense is being paid for by Medicare. Under \nthe appropriations process, they would disappear. So will many others. \nSo will many others, because there will be no constant way of funding a \nvery obscure program called Graduate Medical Education, which is the \nheart and soul of the training of good doctors and, therefore, good \nhealth care in our country.\n  The Federal savings in this matter--and I won't talk on forever \nhere--but the Federal savings in this are generally a sham. I think \nonly about $95 to $96 billion out of the $346 billion or $347 billion \nthat the Commission says they are saving actually comes out of what \nthey call premium supports. All the rest comes out of cutting benefits, \nout of the Balanced Budget Act, which we passed in 1997, out of a whole \nseries of other things, cutting doctors and hospitals, once again. The \nsavings are made at the expense of the beneficiary, at the expense \nof good health care. I have very, very strong feelings.\n\n  Just consider for one instance that 71 percent of the counties in \nthis country have no medical plan, no HMO whatsoever. I represent a \nwhole State. We have one. So where is the choice? There is no choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I hope when that \nresolution comes up for a vote, Senators will vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \n40 seconds remaining on the amendment. The Senator from New Mexico has \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will reserve that time, and I will move \non to another amendment, if that is agreeable to the floor managers. If \nI could have the attention of the floor managers, I am glad to either \nyield that time, if you were going to yield yours back. If you want to \nhold yours, I will hold mine. I am quite prepared to go on to another \namendment. I do not want to hold up the Senate any further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nthe leader, that at 12 noon today the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the following amendments, the first vote limited to 15 \nminutes and other votes to 10 minutes each, with 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to each vote\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nand no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote--this has \nbeen cleared on both sides--Specter amendment No. 157; Robb amendment \nNo. 176; Kennedy amendment No. 177. Is that the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Kennedy, I am just going to use a \ncouple minutes.\n  Did the Senator want the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if I might inquire of the Senator from New \nMexico, I had indicated to him I have an amendment that I wanted to lay \ndown. If he would not mind, I would be happy to offer it and ask \nunanimous consent we set it aside. And then he could proceed. I was \nhoping perhaps after the three votes we might debate this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. I believe the sequencing is, after the Kennedy \namendment, we are going to do a Republican education amendment, and \nthen we are going to return to your side for your amendment. If you \nwould like to send it to the desk now, I ask unanimous consent that \nthat be in order. We are not going to debate it now; right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 178\n\n    (Purpose: To provide $36,000,000,000 in additional agricultural \n                                funding)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenators Daschle, Harkin, Conrad, Baucus, Johnson, Durbin, Bingaman, \nand Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Kerrey proposes an amendment \n     numbered 178.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT AGRICULTURAL RISK \n                   MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS SHOULD BENEFIT LIVESTOCK \n                   PRODUCERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) extremes in weather-related and natural conditions have \n     a profound impact on the economic viability of producers;\n       (2) these extremes, such as drought, excessive rain and \n     snow, flood, wind, insect infestation are certainly beyond \n     the control of livestock producers;\n       (3) these extremes do not impact livestock producers within \n     a state, region or the nation in the same manner or during \n     the same time frame or for the same duration of time;\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\n       (4) the livestock producers have few effective risk \n     management tools at their disposal to adequately manage the \n     short- and long-term impacts of weather-related or natural \n     disaster situations; and\n       (5) ad hoc natural disaster assistance programs, while \n     providing some relief, are not sufficient to meet livestock \n     producers' needs for rational risk management planning.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that any consideration of \n     reform of federal crop insurance and risk management programs \n     should include the needs of livestock producers.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Conrad be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. This amendment, offered by myself, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Thomas, and now Senator Conrad, is a sense of the Senate that \nresolves that any consideration of reform of Federal crop insurance and \nrisk management programs should include the needs of livestock \nproducers as well.\n  The livestock industry has very few risk management tools available \nto manage the short- and long-term impacts of weather-related and \nnatural disaster situations. They do not have an insurance program to \nhelp guard against losses. In fact, livestock producers are prohibited \nby law from participating in USDA's Crop Insurance Program. That \nprohibition must be removed.\n  We must devote our resources to finding a rational approach to risk \nmanagement that will eliminate the need for ranchers and farmers to ask \nCongress each year for disaster assistance. Any program offered to the \nagricultural producers should cover them in the event of any crop or \nlivestock losses due to excessive rain and snow, wind, drought, and \neven insect infestation. We need a program that is actuarially sound.\n  The livestock industry is comprised of smart, hardworking businessmen \nwho constantly operate at the whims of Mother Nature. They are not \nlooking for a Government handout. They simply want to be given the \nopportunity to better manage the risks they face in trying to get their \ncattle and sheep to market. We promised our ranchers help, but we have \nnot delivered. This amendment is a good first step.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back any time that I have.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, very briefly, let me just say I hope our \ncolleagues will support the amendment which my colleague from Wyoming \nhas offered, along with a number of others of us who are very concerned \nabout what has happened in the livestock industry.\n  In American agriculture now, we face the lowest prices in 52 years. \nWe have been through an absolute price collapse in many sectors of the \nlivestock industry. In the hog industry alone, prices have dropped to \n8.5 cents a pound.\n  Mr. President, it takes 40 cents a pound to break even in the \nlivestock industry. And 8.5 cents a pound is absolutely ridiculous. We \nanticipate losing as many as three-quarters of the hog producers in our \nState if something is not done.\n  This amendment, offered by Senator Enzi, cosponsored by others of us, \nwe think is one way to help livestock producers manage risk through a \nprogram of risk management. I hope very much our colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Enzi, Grassley, \nThomas, Conrad amendment. Livestock producers have few viable risk \nmanagement tools available to deal with drought, excessive rain and \nsnow, flood, or disease. Dismal profits for cattlemen and the collapse \nof hog market in the Fall of 1998 are two of the predominate factors \nwhich have spurred a renewed interest in livestock insurance. I feel it \nis important that any consideration of reform for federal crop \ninsurance and/or federal risk management programs should include the \nneeds of livestock producers.\n  Since the introduction of revenue insurance programs in 1996 farmers \nraising crops have been provided risk management tools which better \nmediate the unavoidable risks farmers experience. Programs such as Crop \nRevenue Coverage (CRC), Income Protection (IP), and Revenue Assurance \n(RA) are available for crops, but currently a statutory prohibition \nbans the development of federally supported livestock insurance.\n  It is my opinion that we have a responsibility to provide risk \nmanagement tools to all farmers, whether they raise crops or livestock. \nIowa State University's Center for Agricultural and Rural Development \n(CARD) has studied the possible benefits of Whole-Farm Revenue \nInsurance for crop and livestock producers. The center has developed \ndata which lends credibility to those who advocate adding a livestock \nnet revenue guarantee to existing whole-farm crop revenue guarantees.\n  CARD determined Whole-Farm Revenue insurance programs could \nsupplement existing risk management tools offered through the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade for livestock. CARD \nalso ascertained that the addition of livestock to whole-farm revenue \nguarantees could dramatically reduce both insurance rates and insurance \npremiums. Lower rates could lead to expanded coverage and less risk \nexposure for farmers.\n  Mr. President, risk management tools are necessary for the success of \nthe agriculture community. Congress must work together and focus on \nexpanded risk management to better mediate the unavoidable risks \nfarmers experience. It's time for Congress to take an active role in \nproviding these tools to all farmers.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support livestock producers by \nsupporting the Enzi, Grassley, Thomas, Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection on our side. I think it has been \ncleared on the Democrat side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 154) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 177\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think our next Senator with an amendment has arrived. \nWe have agreed your amendment would be next, I say to Senator Gorton. \nBut we have to finish the Kennedy amendment in just a minute here.\n  Just give me a moment, I say to the Senator.\n  First, as I indicated earlier this morning, something very \nsignificant happened, and I am sure it will be adopted when we vote \nlater on. That is the introduction of a bipartisan amendment to this \nbudget resolution whereby the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, joined by Senator Frist, on our side, and two very \ndistinguished Democrats, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Breaux \nof Louisiana, indicated in an official way, for the first time, that \nthe Senate is going to be asked, because of their amendment, to proceed \nin a bipartisan manner to reform and fix Medicare so that it will be \neffective for our senior citizens for decades to come.\n  I must say that when we vote on that--and I believe it will be agreed \nto--we will have started down a path. But it will not be a long path; \nit will be a very short path. That path is going to lead, before the \nyear is up, to a resolution in the Senate of the Medicare program for \nour senior citizens and for our children and for the taxpayers, all of \nwhom have a very big stake in making sure this Medicare program is \nreformed and fixed.\n  So I once again congratulate those four Senators. They have permitted \nme to join them, so I am the fifth man on the team. I hope, before the \nday is out, many others will join. But I am certain by our vote we will \nindicate that that is precisely the path we want to take.\n  Some will get up and say it is very specific and precise. But \nultimately, it lays down some markers. It says to the Finance \nCommittee, let's get on with it; let's quit talking about it; let's fix \nit.\n  It is interesting that as soon as that amendment got debated, a kind \nof a furor occurred, and it was not on our side of the aisle, it was on \nthe other side of the aisle. That is because that was a significant \namendment that people in this country are going to understand. It is \nnot politics; it is not talking; it is a commitment to fix Medicare for \nour senior citizens.\n\n  If there are new ideas beyond what the Commission--there are two \ncommissions that are recalled in that amendment--if there are ideas \nbeyond\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nit, it is going to come out of that bipartisan committee, who are so \ncommitted to repairing and fixing and modifying that program.\n  Having said that, the commotion got quick, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts arrived on the floor. Let me suggest, I have great \nrespect for the distinguished Senator. I do know--I do know--that I am \nas concerned about Medicare people in America--our people, our friends, \nour neighbors, our relatives--as he is. I am just as compassionate and \njust as concerned. But I do believe--I do believe--we have to talk a \nlittle bit about reality.\n  Let me tell you the first reality. When the vote starts and the \nSenator is through with his charts, I would like very much for the rule \nto be applied and they be taken down, because they are only supposed to \nbe up for a little while. Frankly, whatever little while, they should \nnot have been up at all, because those charts are not true. Those \ncharts state things that are not true.\n  Let me just tell you, ``Republican Plan Would Slash Medicare'' --\nthere is no Republican plan. We are waiting for the Finance Committee \nto produce a plan. We have given them latitude in the budget \nresolution, but there is none. It is a bipartisan plan. So he might \nhave said that up there, ``The Bipartisan Plan,'' if it is that plan \nthat he does not like.\n  The chart says that cuts under the Democratic plan are zero. What \ndoes that mean? What in the world does that mean? There will be no \nreform that saves any money, that changes anything in Medicare under a \nDemocratic plan--can't be, can't be. Everybody that is for fixing \nMedicare is going to have something in that column because they will \nrepair it so it is more efficient. Some will legitimately call that a \ncut.\n  The next column in the chart is really preposterous, ``Cuts under \nRepublican plan, 1999-2020.'' We have not even been talking about the \nyear 2020 on the floor. There is no budget resolution for 2020 and \nthere is no Republican plan. How can it be that we have $686 billion in \ncuts by the year 2020? Perhaps that number is if you leave the program \nalone for 20 years, it needs $686 billion worth of resources--that \nmight be the number.\n  What does that have to do with our Republican plan, what we are \ntalking about on the floor? Is the Senator suggesting we ought to put \n$686 billion into Medicare out of general taxes to America? It will \nnever happen. That will not happen. Everybody knows that.\n  We have debated this issue. I should stop debating it because I have \ndone it three times, but every time they bring up an amendment I have \nto get up because they get up. I don't want anybody out there listening \nto this debate to think that is accurate because that is not accurate.\n  We can put up charts and claim whatever we want, but that chart is \nnot accurate. It does not adequately describe nor appropriately \ndescribe anything with reference to where we are.\n  Having said that, we debated and voted an amendment very similar to \nthis amendment. The only thing is it was subject to a point of order. \nPerhaps Senator Kennedy has doctored this up so it is not subject to a \npoint of order. The Senate rejected by a majority a plan of Senator \nConrad's which is very similar, except for one thing. It is a little \nbetter in terms of trying to protect Medicare than this one. It \nestablishes a point of order of some kind which makes it difficult to \nspend this extra money that is sitting around, or this surplus that is \nsitting around. The Kennedy amendment does not even do that.\n  I need no more time. I have used about 5 minutes; the Senator has \nused 2\\1/2\\ minutes. I hope we get on with the rest of this and let \nother Senators have a chance to debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Lautenberg \nis to be recognized for the purpose of presenting amendments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since a \nchallenge was put down by the chairman of the committee on the \ninformation presented by the Senator from Massachusetts, that the \nSenator from Massachusetts be allowed 5 minutes to respond.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 2\\1/\n2\\ minutes be made available before we send our amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this $686 billion is the amount that we \nwould like and the President would like to have out of the surplus to \nfund the Medicare trust system so that it will be financially stable to \nthe year 2020. That is what it represents.\n  Under the budget proposal of the majority, if you are not going to \nallocate this 15 percent of the surplus for the Medicare system, you \nare going to have to have $686 billion in cuts or premium increases.\n  That is not what I am saying; that is what the Medicare trustees have \nsaid.\n  To conclude, basically what we are saying, let us go ahead, prior to \nthe tax cut, take the 10-year budget, take $320 billion of what the \nRepublicans are intending to use for a tax cut, and use it to put the \nMedicare system on a sound financial system. That is it. Put the \nprotection of Medicare first, prior to a tax cut. That is what this \nvote is about.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record statements from \nthe AARP and virtually every senior citizen organization, including the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security, the OWL organization, Families USA, Gray Panthers, all \nof the organizations that are in strong support of using the 15 percent \nto make Medicare financially sound so we will have the opportunity to \nbring about reforms, and do that prior to the time we have tax breaks. \nThat makes sense to protect working families in this country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Council of\n\n\n                                              Senior Citizens,\n\n                                Silver Spring, MD, March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy. In behalf of the members and officers \n     of the National Council of Senior Citizens and our nationwide \n     network of clubs and councils, I write in strong support of \n     your efforts to amend the Senate budget resolution to assure \n     the utilization of 15 percent of the budget surplus to extend \n     the solvency of the Medicare program.\n       We also support your work to include in the final \n     resolution a straight-forward reserve fund to create a \n     Medicare pharmaceutical benefit with no ambiguity in regard \n     to the use of reserve fund resources. The Snowe Amendment to \n     the resolution falls to deliver on this point. It will not \n     create a viable reserve fund for the Medicare prescription \n     benefit. It would set up hurdles before the Congress could \n     access the fund for the benefit. The overriding issue is the \n     need of millions of seniors for a comprehensive Medicare drug \n     benefit now.\n       The Senate and the Congress must not lose this historic \n     opportunity to make a significant investment in the future \n     health needs of both older persons and Baby Boomers as they \n     reach Medicare eligibility. By this action, the Congress will \n     provide for sufficient time to consider a large range of \n     options both to strengthen Medicare and assure long-term \n     solvency.\n       We applaud your efforts and those of your colleagues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steve Protulis,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Statement on Medicare Funding\n\n (By Max Rightman, Executive Vice-President, The National Committee To \n         Preserve Social Security and Medicare, March 18, 1999)\n\n       The measure proposed for Medicare by the Budget Committee \n     is inadequate and short-sighted.\n       The President's request to devote 15 percent of the surplus \n     to Medicare is a critical element in saving Medicare. The \n     Budget Committees' plan falls far short of that.\n       What the congressional measure do, quite frankly, is \n     shortchanged today's seniors--the seniors here with this \n     morning--and shortchange millions of baby-boomers who in just \n     a few short years will be retiring and relying on Medicare to \n     be there for them.\n       America has a long-standing commitment to all of our \n     retirees of adequate and affordable health care--it's a \n     commitment called Medicare.\n       Devoting fifteen percent of the surplus for Medicare will \n     extend solvency for a number of additional, critical years. \n     It also will reassure today's baby boomer that this Congress \n     will keep its commitment to them when they retire.\n       The National Committee urges Congress to adopt the \n     President's 15-percent Medicare proposal. Thank you.\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                          The Voice of Midlife and\n\n\n                                                  Older Women,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: OWL, the only national membership \n     organization to address issues unique to women as they age, \n     urges the Congress to set aside 15 percent of the projected \n     federal budget surplus to extend the solvency of the Medicare \n     Trust Fund for an additional decade. We need a more complete \n     public discussion of thoughtful reform and its implications \n     on all Americans.\n       Medicare is a women's issue. Any effort to strengthen and \n     modernize the system must be viewed for its impact on women. \n     Women are 58 percent of the Medicare population at age 65 and \n     that number rises to 71 percent at age 85. Women's health \n     care needs differ from men's needs. They have more chronic \n     illness, often more than one chronic illness at a time. As a \n     result, women must have access to specialists, leading-edge \n     medications, and technology. Chronic illness means that women \n     interface with the Medicare system more frequently and, \n     appropriately managed, their care can remain cost effective \n     and they remain independent longer. Inappropriately managed, \n     their poorer, frailer health can lead to expensive acute care \n     episodes or long-term stays in nursing facilities. Medicare \n     reform, to be successful, must address her needs.\n       As you know, Senator Daschle, women are also poorer in \n     retirement than men. She has almost less than half of the \n     income that her male counterpart has in retirement and she \n     lives an average of six years longer. She spends more out-of-\n     pocket for health care needs covered by Medicare. She \n     averages 22 percent of her lower income in out-of-pocket \n     expenses compared to 17 percent by men. Thus, efforts to \n     change Medicare that would increase out-of-pocket costs for \n     the Medicare population would have a disparate impact on the \n     majority of the Medicare population who are women.\n       You know, too, Senator that Medicare and Social Security \n     are inextricably linked in women's retirement security. We \n     must examine the impact on each as we move forward to resolve \n     the longterm issues facing these important programs. We \n     cannot move in haste. We must engage the American public in \n     this important process. Therefore, we urge Congress to set \n     aside 15 percent of the projected surplus. Bolstering the \n     Trust Fund will remove Medicare from the critical list and \n     give both the public and policymakers the necessary breathing \n     room to consider a range of options. It means that we can and \n     will develop a program to strengthen Medicare that will work \n     for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Deborah Briceland-Betts,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Families USA Foundation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: Protecting the Medicare program's \n     effectiveness and solvency is of utmost concern to America's \n     seniors and people with disabilities--and their families as \n     well. It should be a top priority in this Congress.\n       To protect the Medicare program, Families USA strongly \n     supports committing 15 percent of the federal budget surplus \n     to extending the Medicare trust fund. We do not believe that \n     any credible reform of the program can be achieved without \n     including significant new resources for the program. As the \n     recently disbanded Medicare Commission has demonstrated, even \n     so-called ``reforms'' that reduce seniors' benefit packages, \n     increase beneficiary out-of-pocket costs, and cause younger \n     seniors to lose health insurance coverage fail to secure the \n     long-term solvency of the program. Hence, the commitment of \n     15 percent of the federal budget surplus is a very \n     constructive and helpful first step in strengthening the \n     fiscal integrity of the program.\n       Medicare is a program that works well for millions of older \n     Americans and people with disabilities. By extending the life \n     of the Medicare Part A trust fund to the year 2020, the \n     proposed transfer of surplus funds will help to ensure that \n     the program remains effective and viable in the years ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ron Pollack,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Gray Panthers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing you this letter on \n     behalf of Gray Panthers across the country regarding the \n     improvements we see necessary for the Medicare Program. For \n     almost thirty years, Gray Panthers have represented older \n     Americans and families across the country. Today, our fifty \n     chapters and over 20,000 members across the United States, \n     include members who are patients, caregivers, providers, \n     business owners, association members, and active voters. All \n     of our members have a vested interest in the Medicare \n     program. Our members are extremely active on the Medicare \n     issue and demand the Congress Protect, Improve, and Modernize \n     Medicare.\n       As a first step then, in protecting the program, Gray \n     Panthers urges members of Congress to vote in favor of \n     setting aside 15% of the non-Social Security budget surplus \n     specifically for Medicare. We understand that this will \n     guarantee the financial integrity of the program for at least \n     the next decade. Gray Panthers also recommends lifting the \n     cap on Social Security in order to expand that budget as well \n     as build fiscal integrity for the program.\n       We thank you for your time and consideration of this \n     matter.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                Patricia A. Rizzo,\n     National Deputy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Association of Jewish\n\n\n                                               Aging Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of the membership of the \n     Association of Jewish Aging Services and the over 150,000 \n     elderly served in communities across the nation we urge you \n     to protect at least 15% of the projected budget surplus to \n     extend Medicare solvency.\n       Shoring up Social Security, not privatization, and \n     improving the quality and accessibility of health care \n     deserve the highest Congressional priority. To do otherwise, \n     is an abdication of leadership responsibility and abandonment \n     of our country's fundamental responsibilities to its aging \n     citizenry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Lawrence M. Zippin,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    NCOA Applauds President's Social Security and Medicare Proposals\n\n (By James Firman, President & CEO, The National Council on the Aging, \n                           January 20, 1999)\n\n       President Clinton's proposal to fortify Social Security and \n     Medicare for the years ahead deserves the support of all \n     Americans. His proposals would pay dividends in the form of a \n     higher quality of life for us all--not only the chronically \n     ill, the disabled and the frail elderly but also their \n     families. The National Council on the Aging strongly supports \n     investing the budget surplus to protect and strengthen Social \n     Security and Medicare rather than squandering it on a one-\n     time tax break.\n       Setting aside additional money today is the only way to \n     prepare for the great demographic changes that our economy \n     and our culture will face as the massive baby boom generation \n     enters its later years. President Clinton's proposals would \n     provide much-needed relief to today's older Americans and \n     their families--and it would also help ensure a more secure \n     and fulfilling old age for the baby boomers who are today's \n     wage earners and tomorrow's Senior Boom.\n       By extending the solvency of these essential programs \n     without privatizing them, cutting benefits or slashing \n     eligibility, the Clinton plan benefits all Americans--those \n     who are in need of assistance today, and those who will be \n     tomorrow. The National Council on the Aging, on behalf of \n     older Americans and those who care about them, strongly \n     supports using the surplus for this purpose.\n       The President's recognition of the need to ease the poverty \n     of older women--particularly widows--is also welcome and long \n     overdue. For far too long, our nation has looked the other \n     way as aging women sink deeper and deeper into poverty. We \n     all know women live longer than men, on average, and that \n     they tend to earn less over the course of their lifetimes. \n     Too often, these factors doom them to a sparse and barren \n     subsistence in their later years. In our individual lives, we \n     would not willingly abandon our wives and mothers to spend \n     their final years in poverty. Yet for too long, we as a \n     nation have denied women their right to a safe and \n     financially secure retirement.\n       We likewise applaud and will support the President's \n     proposals to provide a $1,000 long-term care tax credit, to \n     make home-care and caregiver services more available to those \n     who need them, to increase the minimum wage and to raise \n     additional revenues from the tobacco industry and use some of \n     the proceeds to support the Medicare program.\n       We would also call on Congress to increase funding and to \n     reauthorize the Older Americans Act, which provides for so \n     many services--congregate and home-delivered meals, the older \n     worker employment program, senior centers and other home and \n     community-based activities--that are crucial to older \n     Americans.\n       We look forward to working with the President and the \n     Congress to win passage of these crucial measures, which \n     will--sooner rather than later--touch the lives of each of \n     us.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Statement by AARP Executive Director Horace Deets on the President's \n                       State of the Union Address\n\n       We are pleased that the President has offered creative \n     ideas to strengthen Social Security and Medicare--issues of \n     primary concern to AARP and the American people. We eagerly \n     await the details.\n       The President has offered some very intriguing ideas and we \n     are anxious to learn more about them and how they would \n     affect the American people. AARP has long advocated that any \n     discussion of Social Security needs to be in the broader \n     context of retirement income. These ideas should be measured \n     against American's family budgets, as well as against the \n     federal budget.\n       AARP's goal for Social Security reform remains steadfast a \n     program that will guarantee benefits for future generations, \n     that\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\n     cannot be jeopardized by misfortune, eroded by inflation, or \n     depleted by a long life. Following a year of dialogue, AARP \n     believes it is now time to move forward with purpose and \n     conviction and begin to carefully examine and debate specific \n     proposals on these and other retirement issues.\n       The President's plan to bolster, along with Social \n     Security, Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund with funds \n     from the federal budget surplus adknowledges what most \n     Americans have long understood--that health security and \n     economic security in retirement go hand-in-hand.\n       AARP has long supported the addition of a prescription drug \n     benefit to Medicare and we applaud the President's support of \n     one. AARP believes Medicare should remain an earned guarantee \n     of specified health-care benefits for all older Americans and \n     those with disabilities.\n       One piece of unfinished business from the last Congress \n     that should be addressed quickly is consumer protections in \n     managed health care. AARP continues to be deeply committed to \n     assuring quality and consumer protection in health care, and \n     we urge the Congress to enact legislation that will ensure \n     such basic safeguards for all consumers as a fair and \n     meaningful external appeals process, understandable health \n     plan information, and access to specialty care.\n       The President's proposal to provide a tax credit to \n     Americans who need long-term health care is long-overdue \n     recognition to the many American families who are assuming \n     the enormous burden of providing high quality care to a \n     family member. The tax credit builds on the similar proposal \n     put forward previously by House Republicans. AARP believes it \n     is but one of a number of steps that can be taken to solve \n     the nation's long-term care.\n       We are pleased that the President and the Republicans \n     through their legislative agenda have given high priority to \n     these issues. AARP encourages bipartisan Congressional action \n     this year.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent to have 1 minute to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kennedy, I don't know if you were paying \nattention, but I did say to you that I compliment you on your \ncompassion and your concern in this area. All I indicated was that you \nin your Irish way are compassionate; I, in my Italian way, am just as \ncompassionate and I compliment you for trying to save Medicare.\n  I now know where the $686 billion came from. So everyone will know--I \nwas wondering where the figure came from--it came from the President's \nbudget, the dollar number that he is going to transfer to the Medicare \nfund and take back IOUs.\n  Let me tell Members what that is, I finally understand it. It is like \npostdating a check for all these billions and then saying to the \nAmerican people, ``You are going to wake up one day when we have to pay \nthem, but we are telling you now in advance you will pay them,'' and \nthe only thing that can happen is we will pay a huge amount of new \ntaxes, or we will have to cut the Medicare program dramatically.\n  I don't think that is how we ought to do business. That is what the \nnumber represents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will make a unanimous consent \nrequest just to take 1 minute to parallel my friend and chairman of the \nBudget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the President of the United States has \na plan to extend Medicare's solvency to 2020. I heard the impassioned \nand always eloquent appeal by the chairman of the Budget Committee that \nthis was a bipartisan effort. It is true that there are a couple of \nDemocrats that are supporters of the amendment under discussion, but \nthis is by no means to be judged in this moment to be a bipartisan \neffort.\n  Each of us is going to look at it as we see it. The Republicans do \nnot have anything in the plan to extend the solvency.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 183 through 205, en bloc\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, under the provisions of the consent \nagreement of yesterday, I send a package of amendments to the desk and \nask they be considered and offered individually, set aside en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 183\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should enact \n              legislation to modernize America's schools)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MODERNIZING AMERICA'S \n                   SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The General Accounting Office has performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities and has found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States.\n       (2) The General Accounting Office has concluded that more \n     than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement; 7,000,000 children attend schools with \n     life safety code violations; and 12,000,000 children attend \n     schools with leaky roofs.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office has found that the \n     problem of crumbling schools transcends demographic and \n     geographic boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 \n     percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, \n     at least 1 building is in need of extensive repair or should \n     be completely replaced.\n       (4) The condition of school facilities has a direct effect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility.\n       (5) The General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. 46 percent of schools lack adequate electrical \n     wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. More than \n     a third of schools lack the requisite electrical power. 56 \n     percent of schools have insufficient phone lines for modems.\n       (6) The Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools.\n       (7) The General Accounting Office has determined that the \n     cost of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       (8) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for \n     Native American children are also in dire need of repair and \n     renovation. The General Accounting Office has reported that \n     the cost of total inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities \n     is $754,000,000. The December 1997 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States states that, ``Compared with \n     other schools nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer \n     physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental \n     factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for \n     education reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology.\n       (9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (10) The Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction.\n       (11) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this budget resolution assume \n     that Congress will enact measures to assist school districts \n     in modernizing their facilities, including--\n       (1) legislation to allow States and school districts to \n     issue at least $24,800,000,000 worth of zero-interest bonds \n     to rebuild and modernize our Nation's schools, and to provide \n     Federal income tax credits to the purchasers of those bonds \n     in lieu of interest payments; and\n       (2) appropriate funding for the Education Infrastructure \n     Act of 1994 during the period 2000 through 2004, which would \n     provide grants to local school districts for the repair, \n     renovation and construction of public school facilities.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues--\nSenator Lautenberg and Senator Robb in sponsoring this important \namendment which calls on Congress to pass legislation to fix our \nNation's crumbling schools.\n  The condition of our Nation's schools is well known--they are in \ndeplorable condition. Last year, the American Society of Civil \nEngineers issued a report card on the condition of America's \ninfrastructure. The report made it clear that the physical \ninfrastructure in this\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\ncountry is in dire need. However, the only area that warranted a \nfailing grade was education. The group was concerned about the \ncondition of things like our roads, bridges, and wastewater systems. \nBut the only area that was deemed inadequate is education. It is clear \nwe must place repair of our nation's schools at the top of our Nation's \npriority list.\n  There are 14 million children--almost 5 times the number of people in \nall of Iowa--that are attending classes in buildings that are literally \nfalling down around them. The General Accounting Office tells us that \nwe need $112 billion to modernize our Nation's schools to bring them to \ngood overall condition. The Civil Engineers also say we need $60 \nbillion in new construction to accommodate increasing enrollments.\n  This is a serious problem, and one that is not getting better. As a \nmatter of fact, every day we delay, it gets worse and will cost more \nmoney to address.\n  Iowa State University conducted a comprehensive survey on the \ncondition of schools in Iowa. In 1995 the estimated cost over the next \n10 years was $3.4 billion. Two years later it was $4 billion and I \nwould guess that if the study were updated for 1999 we would find that \nthe cost has increased even more.\n  There are many that say this is a local problem and federal support \nis unwarranted and unwise. All across this country school districts are \nstruggling to repair and upgrade their facilities because the cost is \nenormous.\n  It is simply unacceptable that we tolerate this situation. It is \nunconscionable that children in this country go to school in buildings \nwhere the plumbing doesn't work, the windows are broken, and the roofs \nleak.\n  This amendment calls on Congress to enact legislation to provide a \ncomprehensive strategy to modernize our Nation's schools. First, we \nmust pass legislation to provide funding for the Education \nInfrastructure Act. This is an existing federal program which has been \non the books since 1994.\n  During each of the last two years, the Senate has passed legislation \nwhich included my proposal to appropriate $100 million for this \nprogram. Unfortunately, we have been unable to hold the funds in \nconference with the House.\n  We must redouble our efforts to provide funding for this grant \nprogram to assist needy school districts and the resolution calls on \nour to make this investment.\n  Second, the amendment calls on Congress to pass legislation to \nprovide at least $24.8 billion in tax credits to holders of school \nconstruction bonds. These tax credits will make it possible for school \ndistricts to build and renovate school facilities at a reduced cost \nbecause the holder of the bond would receive a federal tax credit in \nlieu of interest.\n  Mr. President, We have high expectations for our children. We want \nthem to be the best in the world--to reach the highest academic \nstandards. But then we ask them to attend class in buildings that just \ndon't make the grade--in buildings that are not equipped to provide a \nquality 21st century education.\n  We must enact legislation now to remedy this situation and I urge my \ncolleagues to support our amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 184\n\n(Purpose: To establish a budget-neutral reserve fund for environmental \n                         and natural resources)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member \nfor accepting this amendment that I have offered expressing the Sense \nof the Senate and the Urban Parks Recreation and Recovery Program \n(UPARR) should be a high Congressional budget. Community recreation \nservices and green open spaces are an invaluable investment in our \nurban areas. Few things can make as big a difference for improving the \nquality of life and improving community morale in inner cities as a \nsimple investment in parks. However, many facilities are old, overused, \nand called upon to perform years beyond their original life spans.\n  Established in 1978 by Public Law 95-625, the UPARR program was \nauthorized at a level of $725 million to provide (70% federal and 30% \nlocal) grants and technical assistance to economically distressed urban \ncommunities. Prior to the elimination of funding for UPARR in 1995, the \nprogram experienced great success. UPARR funds have returned more than \n1500 facilities to functional use in 400 local jurisdictions in 42 \nstates. In the last round of applications when UPARR money was \navailable, over 200 communities sought grants. Grants of only a few \nhundred thousand dollars have been enough to provide the spark to turn \nabandoned industrial facilities and armories into green open spaces and \nneighborhood recreational facilities.\n  By providing safe recreation opportunities these grants will improve \nour city's quality of life and help address the needs of at-risk youth. \nViolent crime arrests grew 94% between 1980-1995 for youth under age \n15. FBI analysis of 1991-93 data indicate violent crimes committed by \njuveniles occurs with the greatest frequency after school. While \nfederal financial assistance cannot rebuild all urban parks or solve \nall urban recreation problems, the program's original mission of \nproviding seed money for local investments is one that is still \nvaluable to make as we prepare to enter a new millennium.\n  Funding for UPARR is supported by a wide range of organizations--from \nthe National Association of Police Athletic Leagues and the Sporting \nGoods Manufacturers Association, to the Conference of Mayors and Mayor \nLeague Baseball. They know the results of studies of studies that show \nthat when students have an activity available after school hours, crime \nrates and juvenile arrests decrease. A study of the Big Brothers/Big \nSisters mentoring program demonstrated that young people with adult \nsupervision were only after half as likely to begin illegal drug use as \nthose who had no mentor. Research at Columbia University has shown that \nBoys and Girls Clubs have been effective in reducing drug activities \nand juvenile crime in public housing and that participants do better in \nschool and are less attracted to gangs as non-participants.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their support and look forward to \nworking to ensure sufficient funding for this important program.\n\n\n

reduce revenues by not more than $0 in fiscal year \n     2000, $91,744,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2004, and $621,426,000,000 for the period of fiscal \n     years 2000 through 2009; and\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, at first glance, the pending budget \nappears to place a high priority on education. The resolution invests \nmore money than proposed by President Clinton and highlights increases \nfor elementary and secondary education.\n  This stands in sharp contrast to previous Republican budgets that \nslashed\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n\nfunding for vital discretionary education programs, cut college loans \nand called for elimination of the Department of Education. In some \nrespects, this budget is a welcome change.\n  To highlight elementary and secondary education, the resolution takes \nthe unusual step of providing so-called ``sub-function'' allocations to \nprominently display the proposed increases for K-12 education. In \naddition, the resolution calls for an investment of $2.5 billion in \nspecial education over the next five years. That sounds pretty good.\n  Unfortunately, a closer examination of the budget exposes serious \nflaws. On the one hand, the budget touts increases for K-12 schools but \nplays down the sobering fact that the only way to accomplish that \nobjective is to cut other important education and training programs.\n  Cuts, or in the best case scenario, freezes college grants.\n  Denies 100,000 children Head Start services.\n  Eliminates 73,000 young people from the summer jobs program.\n  Makes it impossible for 102,000 dislocated workers to get the \ntraining they need to get new jobs.\n  Unlike previous GOP budgets that launched a frontal assault on \neducation, this budget is a stealth attack. The rhetoric touts \neducation, but the details will spell disaster.\n  That is why we are offering this amendment to fully fund two \ncritically important education programs--special education and the \nclass size reduction act. The amendment will enable us to meet two \nimportant goals.\n  First, we will make sure there is full funding for these two \ninitiatives. IDEA will be fully funded for the first time ever and we \nwill meet our national goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce \nclass size.\n  Second, by providing this mandatory stream of funding, the amendment \nwill free up precious discretionary funds that could be invested in \nother important national priorities such as college grants, Head Start, \nTitle I, education technology and job training.\n  The amendment is fully offset by reducing the tax breaks by 20%. That \nstill leaves plenty of room for tax cuts for working families.\n  We must renew the bipartisan effort we began last fall to reduce \nclass size. Research has shown that smaller class sizes make a \ndifference. Teachers are able to provide more personalized attention \nfor students and have to spend less time on discipline. As a result, \nstudents do better and learn more.\n  We got off to a good start last fall by enacting legislation as part \nof the omnibus appropriations bill for the first year of the seven year \nclass size initiative. This amendment would enable us to finish the job \nand fully fund the initiative.\n  The amendment also invests in IDEA. In the early seventies, two \nlandmark federal district court cases--PARC versus Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and Mills versus Board of Education of the District Court \nof Columbia--established that children with disabilities have a \nconstitutional right to a free appropriate public education.\n  In 1975, in response to these cases, the Congress enacted PL 94-142, \nthe precursor to IDEA, to help states meet their constitutional \nobligations.\n  When we enacted PL 94-142, the Congress authorized the maximum state \naward as the number of children served under the special education law \ntimes 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure.\n  Congress has fallen far short of this goal. Indeed, in fiscal year \n1999, Congress appropriated only 11.7% of the national average per \npupil expenditure for Part B of IDEA. Congress needs to do much more to \nhelp and this amendment would fully fund this program for the first \ntime.\n  As an editorial in the March 15 edition of the New York Times \nexplained, ``Educating disabled youngsters is a national \nresponsibility. The expense should be borne on the nation as a whole, \nnot imposed haphazardly on stated or financially strapped districts \nthat happen to serve a large number of disabled students.''\n  As the ranking member on the education appropriations subcommittee, I \nam acutely aware of all the things we are unable to do because we do \nnot have sufficient resources to invest. An added benefit of this \namendment is to provide $43 billion for education and training programs \nover the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will place education at the top of the \nnational priority list and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 193\n\n  (Purpose: To allocate a portion of the surplus for legislation that \n   promotes early educational development and well-being of children)\n\n       On page 43, strike beginning with line 13 through line page \n     44, line 10, and insert the following:\n\n     for fiscal year 2000 or increases in the surplus for any of \n     the outyears, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     shall make the adjustments as provided in subsection (c).\n       (c) Adjustments.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget shall take a portion of the amount of increases in the \n     on-budget surplus for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 \n     estimated in the report submitted pursuant to subsection (a) \n     and--\n       (1) increase the allocation by these amounts to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions only for \n     legislation that promotes early educational development and \n     well-being of children for fiscal years 2000 through 2004; \n     and\n       (2) provide for or increase the on-budget surplus levels \n     used for determining compliance with the pay-as-you-go \n     requirements of section 202 of H.

BUDGETING FOR THE DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       ``It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels \n     for National Defense (function 050) for fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2008 assume funding for the Defense Science and \n     Technology program that is consistent with Section 214 of the \n     Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1999, which expresses a sense of the Congress that for \n     each of those fiscal years it should be an objective of the \n     Secretary of Defense to increase the budget request for the \n     Defense Science and Technology program by at least 2 percent \n     over inflation.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'm very pleased to be joined by \nSenators from both sides of the aisle in offering this amendment \nregarding the Defense Science and Technology program. Senators DeWine, \nKennedy, Hutchison, Graham, Santorum, Schumer, Chafee, Moynihan, and \nLieberman are all cosponsors, and I thank them for their valuable \nsupport.\n  This sense of the Senate amendment reemphasizes Congressional support \nfor modest but needed increases in the Defense Science and Technology \nprogram budget. It reinforces that the Senate, honoring its \nresponsibility for maintaining the long-term strength of our national \ndefense, intends to see that the DoD places a greater priority on this \nhigh payoff investment in our national security.\n  A little background is in order. Technological superiority, coupled \nwith outstanding training, remains a keystone of our military strategy \nand might. Undergirding that superiority has been the patient, long-\nterm investment we have made in the Defense Science and Technology \nprogram--often known around here as ``S'' or ``6.1, 6.2, and 6.3'' \nfunding. That investment gave us things like stealth and the advanced \ninformation systems that allowed us to totally dominate the battlespace \nduring Desert Storm. It's sometimes said that the S of the 60's and \n70's was used to fight and win the Gulf War of the 90's, at a \nrelatively low cost of American lives. And, it's worth remembering that \neach time you use the Internet, you're using the results of Defense \nS\n  Yet, despite the widely acknowledged and proven value of Defense S, \ndespite the fact that new technology will help us counter the new \nthreats we see emerging, despite the fact that overall Defense spending \nwill significantly increase, the DoD plans to cut and continue cutting \nS The fiscal 1999 S funding is $7.8 billion, whereas the budget \nrequest for fiscal 2000 is $7.4 billion, down around 15% in real terms \nsince 1995. Moreover, that request includes the lowest level of S by \nthe military services in 22 years. Worse yet, S is slated to decline \nto around $7 billion in constant dollars in the outyears--$1 billion \nless than the level recommended just last summer by the independent \nDefense Science Board. To my mind, that is just not consistent with \nmaintaining the long term technological edge of our military.\n  Now, both Houses of Congress have recognized this problem. Last year, \nwe included in the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act a \nsense of the Congress provision, Section 214, calling on the Secretary \nof Defense to increase the S budget request by at least 2% a year \nover inflation during fiscal 2000 through 2008.\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\n That provision was designed to be a flexible way of urging the DoD to \nplace a higher priority on S It contemplated they would plan \nsensible, gradual increases in S, which would reach the Defense \nScience Board target in real terms by fiscal 2005 or so.\n  Unfortunately, the DoD may be falling into a classic trap that can \ncatch the best of managers, that of focusing so hard on the short term \nproblems that they shortchange the future. This year's plans continue \nto show declines for S in the outyears, and are largely unchanged \nfrom last year's plans.\n  That's where we come in. The Senate is perhaps uniquely suited to \ntake the long term view, to look after those things that require \npatience, yet lie at the very foundation of our national security--like \nDefense S We have the luxury of not being subject to the day to day \npressures of DoD managers, but we have the responsibility to make sure \nthey don't shortchange the future.\n  Hence, this amendment says that within the budgetary levels for \nNational Defense, function 050, we assume the DoD will increase the S \nbudget as called for in last year's Defense authorization act. This \nassumption, in turn, signals that we continue to be very serious about \nour long term investment in S, and will not just let the issue slide. \nOver time, I believe the DoD will hear our message and begin placing a \nhigher priority on S and fix this problem.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join the ten of us and support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the early seventies, two landmark \nfederal district court cases--PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and \nMills v. Board of Education of the District Court of Columbia--\nestablished that children with disabilities have a constitutional right \nto a free appropriate public education.\n  In 1975, in response to these cases, the Congress enacted PL 94-142, \nthe precursor to IDEA, to help states meet their constitutional \nobligations.\n  When we enacted PL 94-142, the Congress authorized the maximum state \naward as the number of children served under the special education law \ntimes 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure.\n  Congress has fallen far short of this goal. Indeed, in fiscal year \n1999, Congress appropriated only 11.7% of the national average per \npupil expenditure for Part B of IDEA.\n  Congress needs to do much more to help school districts meet their \nconstitutional obligations. Indeed, whenever I go home to Iowa, I am \nbesieged by requests for additional federal funding for special \neducation.\n  These requests increased in intensity following the Supreme Court \ndecision in Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garrett F. That \ndecision reaffirmed the court's longstanding interpretation that \nschools must provide those health-related services necessary to allow a \nchild with a disability to remain in school.\n  This is a terribly important decision, which reaffirms that all \nchildren with disabilities have the right to a meaningful education. As \nJustice Stevens wrote, ``under the statute, [Supreme Court] precedent, \nand the purpose of the IDEA, the District must fund such ``related \nservices'' in order to help guarantee that students like Garrett are \nintegrated into the public schools.''\n  The child in this case, Garrett Frey, happens to come from Iowa. He \nis friendly bright, articulate young man, who is also quadriplegic and \nventilator-dependent. Twenty years ago, he probably would have been \nshunted off to an institution, at a terrible cost to taxpayers. \nInstead, he is thriving as a high school student, and will most likely \ngo off to college and become a hard-working, tax paying citizen.\n  An editorial in USA Today summed up the situation well.\n\n       We've learned a lot about the costs of special education \n     over the past 24 years. In addition to the savings realized \n     when children can live at home with their families, we also \n     know there are astronomical costs associated with not \n     educating students with disabilities. Research shows that \n     individuals who did not benefit from IDEA are almost twice as \n     likely to not complete high school, not attend college and \n     not get a job. The bottom line: Providing appropriate special \n     education and related services to children saves government \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars in dependency costs.\n\n  The Garrett Frey decision, also underscores the need for Congress to \nhelp school districts with the financial costs of educating children \nwith disabilities. While the excess costs of educating some children \nwith disabilities is minimal, the excess costs of educating other \nchildren with disabilities, like Garrett, is great.\n  The pending amendment, of which I am pleased to cosponsor, would take \ntwo important steps. First, it would fully fund IDEA at the 40% goals. \nSecondly, the amendment would provide a mandatory stream of funding for \nthis important program. Finally, the amendment is paid for by taking a \nportion of the funds set-aside for tax breaks and instead invest those \nfunds in IDEA. Mr. President, my amendment would provide real money to \nhelp school districts meet their constitutional obligations. Local \nschool districts should not have to bear the full costs of educating \nchildren with disabilities.\n  Again, the USA Today editorial said it well.\n\n       Let's be clear: The job of educating all our children is no \n     small feat. But kids in special education and kids in \n     ``gifted and talented'' programs are not to blame for tight \n     resources. We, as a nation, must increase our commitment to a \n     system of public education that has the capacity to meet the \n     needs of all children, including children with disabilities.\n\n  Of course, in providing increased funding for IDEA, we must make sure \nwe do not do so at the expense of other equally important education \nprograms.\n  We need to fully fund Head Start so that all children start school \nready to learn.\n  We need to fully fund Title I so that all children get the extra help \nthey need in reading and math.\n  We need to fully fund Pell Grants so that all students have a chance \nto go to college.\n  There are many other important education initiatives, such as \nreducing class size, improving teacher training, and modernizing our \ncrumbling schools, that will also help children with disabilities.\n  Finally, I'd like to point out that when we reauthorized IDEA in \n1997, we made clear that the cost of serving students with disabilities \nshould fall not just on school districts, but should be shared by all \nresponsive state agencies, including state Medicaid agencies and state \nhealth departments. While Garrett does not qualify for any state \nprograms, many children in his situation do, and the school districts \ncan and should avail themselves of that money.\n   Mr. President, this amendment is about setting rational national \npriorities. We must make education our nation's top priority since the \nreal threat to our national security is an inability to compete in the \nglobal marketplace. We must have the best-educated, most-skilled, \nhealthiest workers in the world to secure our nation's future. \nInvestments in education are essential if we are to reach that goal.\n  The amendment targets one important area--special education--and \nfully funds this important program. As an editorial in the March 15 \nedition of the New York Times explained, ``Educating disabled \nyoungsters is a national responsibility. The expense should be borne on \nthe nation as a whole, not imposed haphazardly on states or financially \nstrapped districts that happen to serve a large number of disabled \nstudents.''\n  By providing these additional resources for special education, we \nwould free up funds both here and in local school districts for other \nimportant education priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant amendment to fully fund IDEA by reducing tax breaks in the \nbudget.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 200\n\n  (Purpose: To allow

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to strike \nsection 204 of the budget resolution, as well as the reconciliation \ninstructions to cut taxes by $778 billion over the next 10 years \nwithout offsetting their costs.\n  I move to eliminate these provisions because they strike at the very \nheart of the fiscal discipline that has brought about the first unified \nbalanced budget in 30 years.\n  In 1993, in President Clinton's first budget, we introduced a new \npay-as-you-go rule in the Senate. This rule provided for a 60-vote \npoint of order in the Senate against legislation that would increase \nthe deficit over 10 years. That has served to keep the Senate and the \nCongress on a course of fiscal responsibility by requiring Congress to \npay for any changes in revenues or direct spending.\n  The budget resolution before us, however, abandons the pay-go rule \nand allows Congress to spend the projected onbudget surpluses without \noffsetting their costs.\n  While supporters of this language promote this as a simple \nclarification of existing principles, arguing the pay-go rules were not \nto apply in times of onbudget surpluses, the Congressional Budget \nOffice disagrees.\n  In my judgment, it would be irresponsible to abandon the very pay-go \nrules that brought us to this point when we still face a $3.7 trillion \ndebt held by the public, and a total debt of over $5.5 trillion.\n  But, Mr. President, regardless of one's views on whether these rules \nwere meant to apply in our current fiscal circumstances, I believe it \nis in our interest not to abandon the pay-go rules at this time. They \nhave been instrumental in imposing fiscal discipline on this body, \nsomething that has been sorely lacking in previous years.\n  Paying for new spending or new tax cuts forces legislators to make \ntough choices. If we abandon this rule, we are saying, in effect, we \ndon't have to make tough choices anymore. And that is particularly \ntroubling when we make long-term decisions based only on projections, \nas we do today.\n  Mr. President, those who support this change are using it to pass a \ntax cut that would otherwise be subject to a point of order under the \ncurrent pay-go rules. But I want to ask our colleagues, which is the \nmore fiscally conservative position? Supporters of this new language \nmay think of themselves as fiscal conservatives. In my view, the \nfiscally conservative position demands paying for other priorities and \nusing the total surplus, not just the off-budget surplus, to pay down \nthe publicly held debt.\n  By ridding ourselves of this debt, we dramatically increase our \nflexibility to solve some of our long-term funding challenges in Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  The budget resolution before us is short shrift to Social Security \nand Medicare by abandoning the pay-go rules and using the onbudget \nsurplus for tax cuts. Once again, it puts short-term political \ninterests ahead of long-term planning. As long as the only window we \nare looking through faces the next election rather than our economic \nstrength in the next century, we will continue to put our focus on \nfeel-good tax cuts at the expense of preparing for the future of Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Bottom line, Mr. President, the responsible position is to maintain \nthe\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\ncurrent budget rules and pay down the debt, and that is the proposition \nthat Americans support.\n  We have a responsibility to the next generation to reduce the debt \nthat clouds our Nation's future prosperity, and the way to remove that \ndebt is to stick to the pay-go rules that have served us so well.\n  With this amendment, cosponsored by Senator Graham of Florida, we \nwill keep the pay-go rules, we will pay off the debt, and we will \nensure that any tax cut doesn't threaten to plunge us back into the \nlarge deficits from which we have so recently been delivered.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining. I thank \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it in order for the Senator to submit the Republican \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 206 through 243, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR STATE \n                   AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the President's budget request for fiscal year 2000 \n     proposes significant reductions in Federal support for State \n     and local law enforcement efforts to combat crime by \n     eliminating more than $1,000,000,000 from State and local law \n     enforcement programs that directly support the Nation's \n     communities, including--\n       (A) zero funding for Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, \n     for which $523,000,000 was made available for fiscal year \n     1999;\n       (B) a reduction from the amount made available for fiscal \n     year 1999 of $645,000,000 for State prison grants (including \n     Violent Offender Incarceration Grants and Truth-in-Sentencing \n     Incentive Grants);\n       (C) a reduction from the amount made available for fiscal \n     year 1999 of more than $85,000,000 from the State Criminal \n     Alien Incarceration Program, which reimburses States for the \n     incarceration of illegal aliens;\n       (D) a reduction in funding for the popular Byrne grant \n     program under part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968; and\n       (E) elimination of funding for Juvenile Accountability \n     Block Grants, which have provided $500,000,000 over the last \n     2 years to communities attempting to control the plague of \n     youth violence;\n       (2) as national crime rates are beginning to fall as a \n     result of State and local efforts, with Federal support, it \n     is unwise to ignore the responsibility of the Federal \n     Government to communities still overwhelmed by crime;\n       (3) Federal support is crucial to the provision of critical \n     crime fighting services and the effective administration of \n     justice in the States, such as the approximately 600 \n     qualified State and local crime laboratories and medical \n     examiners' offices, which deliver over 90 percent of the \n     forensic services in the United States;\n       (4) dramatic increases in crime rates over the last decade \n     have generally exceeded the capacity of State and local crime \n     laboratories to process their forensic examinations, \n     resulting in tremendous backlogs that prevent the swift \n     administration of justice and impede fundamental individual \n     rights, such as the right to a speedy trial and to \n     exculpatory evidence;\n       (5) last year, Congress passed the Crime Identification \n     Technology Act of 1998, which authorizes $250,000,000 each \n     year for 5 years to assist State and local law enforcement \n     agencies in integrating their anticrime technology systems \n     into national databases, and in upgrading their forensic \n     laboratories and information and communications \n     infrastructures upon which these crime fighting systems rely; \n     and\n       (6) the Federal Government must continue efforts to \n     significantly reduce crime by at least maintaining Federal \n     funding for State and local law enforcement, and wisely \n     targeting these resources.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 to \n     assist State and local law enforcement efforts will be--\n       (A) greater than the amounts proposed in the President's \n     budget request for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (B) comparable to amounts made available for that purpose \n     for fiscal year 1999;\n       (2) the amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 for \n     crime technology programs should be used to further the \n     purposes of the program under section 102 of the Crime \n     Identification Technology Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 14601); and\n       (3) Congress should consider legislation that specifically \n     addresses the backlogs in State and local crime laboratories \n     and medical examiners' offices.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 214\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that funding for Federal \ndrug control activities should be at a level higher than that proposed \n        in the President's budget request for fiscal year 2000)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR COUNTER-\n                   NARCOTICS INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) from 1985-1992, the Federal Government's drug control \n     budget was balanced among education, treatment, law \n     enforcement, and international supply reduction activities \n     and this resulted in a 13-percent reduction in total drug use \n     from 1988 to 1991;\n       (2) since 1992, overall drug use among teens aged 12 to 17 \n     rose by 70 percent, cocaine and marijuana use by high school \n     seniors rose 80 percent, and heroin use by high school \n     seniors rose 100 percent;\n       (3) during this same period, the Federal investment in \n     reducing the flow of drugs outside our borders declined both \n     in real dollars and as a proportion of the Federal drug \n     control budget;\n       (4) while the Federal Government works with State and local \n     governments and numerous private organizations to reduce the \n     demand for illegal drugs, seize drugs, and break down drug \n     trafficking organizations within our borders, only the \n     Federal Government can seize and destroy drugs outside of our \n     borders;\n       (5) in an effort to restore Federal international \n     eradication and interdiction efforts, in 1998, Congress \n     passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act which \n     authorized an additional $2,600,000,000 over 3 years for \n     international interdiction, eradication, and alternative \n     development activities;\n       (6) Congress appropriated over $800,000,000 in fiscal year \n     1999 for anti-drug activities authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act;\n       (7) the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2000 \n     would invest $100,000,000 less than what Congress \n     appropriated in fiscal year 1999;\n       (8) the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2000 \n     contains no funding for the Western Hemisphere Drug \n     Elimination Act's top 5 priorities, namely, including funds \n     for an enhanced United States Customs Service\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\n     air interdiction program, counter-drug intelligence programs, \n     security enhancements for our United States-Mexico border, \n     and a promising eradication program against coca, opium, \n     poppy, and marijuana; and\n       (9) the proposed Drug Free Century Act would build upon \n     many of the initiatives authorized in the Western Hemisphere \n     Drug Elimination Act, including additional funding for the \n     Department of Defense for counter-drug intelligence and \n     related activities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) funding for Federal drug control activities should be \n     at a level higher than that proposed in the President's \n     budget request for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (2) funding for Federal drug control activities should \n     allow for investments in programs authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and in the proposed Drug Free \n     Century Act.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 215\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning resources for \n   autism research through the National Institutes of Health and the \n              Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AUTISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are \n     biologically-based neurodevelopmental diseases that cause \n     severe impairments in language and communication and \n     generally manifest in young children sometime during the \n     first two years of life.\n       (2) Best estimates indicate that 1 in 500 children born \n     today will be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and \n     that 400,000 Americans have autism or an autism spectrum \n     disorder.\n       (3) There is little information on the prevalence of autism \n     and other pervasive developmental disabilities in the United \n     States. There have never been any national prevalence studies \n     in the United States, and the two studies that were conducted \n     in the 1980s examined only selected areas of the country. \n     Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan suggest that the \n     prevalence of classic autism alone may be 300 percent to 400 \n     percent higher than previously estimated.\n       (4) Three quarters of those with infantile autism spend \n     their adult lives in institutions or group homes, and usually \n     enter institutions by the age of 13.\n       (5) The cost of caring for individuals with autism and \n     autism spectrum disorder is great, and is estimated to be \n     $13.3 billion per year solely for direct costs.\n       (6) The rapid advancements in biomedical science suggest \n     that effective treatments and a cure for autism are \n     attainable if--\n       (A) there is appropriate coordination of the efforts of the \n     various agencies of the Federal Government involved in \n     biomedical research on autism and autism spectrum disorders;\n       (B) there is an increased understanding of autism and \n     autism spectrum disorders by the scientific and medical \n     communities involved in autism research and treatment; and\n       (C) sufficient funds are allocated to research.\n       (7) The discovery of effective treatments and a cure for \n     autism will be greatly enhanced when scientists and \n     epidemiologists have an accurate understanding of the \n     prevalence and incidence of autism.\n       (8) Recent research suggests that environmental factors may \n     contribute to autism. As a result, contributing causes of \n     autism, if identified, may be preventable.\n       (9) Finding the answers to the causes of autism and related \n     developmental disabilities may help researchers to understand \n     other disorders, ranging from learning problems, to \n     hyperactivity, to communications deficits that affect \n     millions of Americans.\n       (10) Specifically, more knowledge is needed concerning--\n       (A) the underlying causes of autism and autism spectrum \n     disorders, how to treat the underlying abnormality or \n     abnormalities causing the severe symptoms of autism, and how \n     to prevent these abnormalities from occurring in the future;\n       (B) the epidemiology of, and the identification of risk \n     factors for, infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders;\n       (C) the development of methods for early medical diagnosis \n     and functional assessment of individuals with autism and \n     autism spectrum disorders, including identification and \n     assessment of the subtypes within the autism spectrum \n     disorders, for the purpose of monitoring the course of the \n     disease and developing medically sound strategies for \n     improving the outcomes of such individuals;\n       (D) existing biomedical and diagnostic data that are \n     relevant to autism and autism spectrum disorders for \n     dissemination to medical personnel, particularly \n     pediatricians, to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of \n     this disease; and\n       (E) the costs incurred in educating and caring for \n     individuals with autism and autism spectrum disorders.\n       (11) In 1998, the National Institutes of Health announced a \n     program of research on autism and autism spectrum disorders. \n     A sufficient level of funding should be made available for \n     carrying out the program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     additional resources will be targeted towards autism research \n     through the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 216\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the potential \n   impact of the amendments to the medicare program contained in the \nBalanced Budget Act on access to items and services under such program)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ACCESS TO ITEMS AND \n                   SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Total hospital operating margins with respect to items \n     and services provided to medicare beneficiaries are expected \n     to decline from 4.3 percent in fiscal year 1997 to 0.1 \n     percent in fiscal year 1999.\n       (2) Total operating margins for small rural hospitals are \n     expected to decline from 4.2 percent in fiscal year 1998 to \n     negative 5.6 percent in fiscal year 2002, a 233 percent \n     decline.\n       (3) The Congressional Budget Office recently has estimated \n     that the amount of savings to the medicare program in fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2002 by reason of the amendments to that \n     program contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is \n     $88,500,000 more than the amount of savings to the program by \n     reason of those amendments that the Congressional Budget \n     Office estimated for those fiscal years immediately prior to \n     the enactment of that Act.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the provisions contained in this budget resolution assume \n     that the Senate should--\n       (1) consider whether the amendments to the medicare program \n     contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have had an \n     adverse impact on access to items and services under that \n     program; and\n       (2) if it is determined that additional resources are \n     available, additional budget authority and outlays shall be \n     allocated to address the unintended consequences of change in \n     medicare program policy made by the Balanced Budget Act, \n     including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, to \n     ensure fair and equitable access to al items and services \n     under the program.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 217\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the budget process \n should require truth-in-budgeting with respect to the on-budget trust \n                                 funds)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. HONEST REPORTING OF THE DEFICIT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume the following:\n       (1) In general.--Effective for fiscal year 2001, the \n     President's budget and the budget report of CBO required \n     under section 202(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     and the concurrent resolution on the budget should include--\n       (A) the receipts and disbursements totals of the on-budget \n     trust funds, including the projected levels for at least the \n     next 5 fiscal years; and\n       (B) the deficit or surplus excluding the on-budget trust \n     funds, including the projected levels for at least the next 5 \n     fiscal years.\n       (2) Itemization.--Effective for fiscal year 2001, the \n     President's budget and the budget report of CBO required \n     under section 202(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     should include an itemization of the on-budget trust funds \n     for the budget year, including receipts, outlays, and \n     balances.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 218\n\n        (Purpose: Relating to the international affairs budget)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the concurrent resolution, \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Administration has attacked the Senate budget \n     resolution which stays within the caps set in the Balanced \n     Budget Agreement reached with the President in 1997. The \n     Administration accuses the Senate of taking a ``meat axe'' to \n     American leadership, and placing a ``foreign policy \n     straitjacket'' on the United States. In fact, the fiscal year \n     2000 budget continues to fund programs and projects that \n     advance United States interests, while eliminating funding \n     for wasteful or duplicative programs and activities.\n       (2) The Administration claims that the Senate resolution \n     would cut funds for international affairs in fiscal year 2000 \n     by 15.3 percent. The reality is that the reduction is a five \n     percent decrease from spending in fiscal year 1999. Much of \n     the decrease is a result of savings from reductions assumed \n     by the President in his budget: the President assumes savings \n     from ``one time costs'' in the fiscal year 1999 budget, as \n     well as fiscal year 2000 budget reductions for OPIC, P.L. 480 \n     Programs, and historic levels of foreign assistance to Israel \n     and Egypt . When adjusted for arrearages, the Senate \n     Resolution is only a decrease of $.9 billion in budget \n     authority and $.02 billion in outlays from the fiscal year \n     1999 levels.\n       (3) The Administration threatens the budget will hinder \n     consular services and abandon our citizens who travel abroad \n     and leave them to fend for themselves. The reality is that \n     most consular services today are supplemented heavily by \n     machine readable visa, expedited passport, and other fees. \n     The State Department is able to retain these fees due\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\n     to congressional authorization for the retention of these \n     fees rather then returning them to the general fund of the \n     Treasury. Due to this authority, in fiscal year 2000, the \n     State Department expects to have at least $374,000,000 to \n     expend from fee collections. These funds are in addition to \n     the budget authority provided by the Senate budget \n     resolution.\n       (4) The Administration argues that this budget will pull \n     the plug on U.S. contributions to UNICEF and Child Survival. \n     In fact, the United States provided more than $122,000,000 or \n     27 percent of all UNICEF funding in 1997, according to the \n     State Department's most recent statistics (of course, this \n     does not include private donations of United States \n     citizens). At the same time, the United States Agency for \n     International Development is requesting a funding increase of \n     $119,000,000 for development assistance and $15,000,000 for \n     operating expenses even as the General Accounting Office \n     reports that the Agency for International Development cannot \n     explain how its programs are performing or whether they are \n     achieving their intended goals.\n       (5) The Administration argues that this budget will reduce \n     the United States commitment to the war on drugs. In fiscal \n     year 1999, Congress appropriated funds for drug interdiction \n     programs far exceeding the Administration's request; \n     moreover, the comprehensive Western Hemisphere Drug \n     Elimination Act enacted in October 1998 authorizes nearly \n     $1,000,000,000 in new funds, equipment, and technology to \n     correct the dangerous imbalance in the Administration's anti-\n     drug strategy that has underfunded and continues to underfund \n     interdiction programs. (The President's fiscal year 2000 \n     budget continues to short-change anti-drug activities by the \n     Customs Service and the Coast Guard.)\n       (6) The Administration argues that this budget will erode \n     support for peace in the Middle East, Bosnia, and Northern \n     Ireland. However, funding for peacekeeping continues to \n     skyrocket. However, the cost of peacekeeping has become a \n     burden on the 050 defense budget rather than the 150 foreign \n     affairs budget since the failure of the United Nations \n     mission in Bosnia. Last year, the United States expended \n     $4,277,500,000 on peacekeeping and related activities in \n     Bosnia, Iraq, other Middle East peacekeeping, and in Africa. \n     This amount does not include funds for humanitarian and \n     development activities.\n       (7) The Administration argues that this budget will force \n     the United States to close its embassies and turn its back on \n     American interests. The budget will instead force the \n     Executive branch to take on greater cost-based \n     decisionmaking. According to the General Accounting Office, \n     ``more needs to be done to create a well-tuned platform for \n     conducting foreign affairs. Achieving this goal will require \n     the State Department to make a strong commitment to \n     management improvement, modernization, and `cost-based' \n     decisionmaking.'' The General Accounting Office reports that \n     ``one of State's long-standing shortcomings has been the \n     absence of an effective financial management system that can \n     assist managers in making `cost-based' decisions.''\n       (8) Prior to the start of fiscal year 2000, the United \n     States Information Agency and the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency will be integrated into the State \n     Department. In addition the Secretary of State will have more \n     direct oversight over the Agency for International \n     Development, and certain functions of that agency will be \n     merged into the State Department. To date, no savings have \n     been identified as a result of this merger. The General \n     Accounting Office identifies potential areas for reduction of \n     duplication as a result of integration in the areas of legal \n     affairs, congressional liaison, press and public affairs, and \n     management. In addition the General Accounting Office notes \n     that in the State Department strategic plan, it has not \n     adequately reviewed overlapping issues performed by State \n     Department functional bureaus and other United States \n     agencies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the budget levels of this resolution assume that enactment of \n     the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n     provides a unique opportunity for the State Department to \n     achieve management improvements and cost reductions, and \n     that:\n       (1) The Senate believes that savings can be achieved by \n     simply eliminating wasteful and duplicative programs, not the \n     programs cited by the Administration, which generally receive \n     broad bipartisan support. Just a few abuses that could be \n     eliminated to achieve reductions include the following:\n       (A) $25,000,000 for UNFPA while UNFPA works hand-in-glove \n     with the brutal Communist Chinese dictators to abuse women \n     and children under the coercive one-child-per-family \n     population control policy.\n       (B) $35,000,000 for the Inter-American Foundation, which \n     funded groups in Ecuador clearly identified by the State \n     Department as terrorist organizations that kidnaped Americans \n     and threatened their lives, as well as the lives and safety \n     of other United States citizens, while extorting money from \n     them.\n       (C) $105,000,000 proposed for Haiti, which has abandoned \n     democracy in favor of dictatorship and where United States \n     taxpayer funds have been used, according to the International \n     Planned Parenthood Federation's annual report, for ``a \n     campaign to reach voodoo followers with sexual and \n     reproductive health information..by performing short song-\n     prayers about STDs [sexually transmitted diseases] and the \n     benefits of family planning during voodoo ceremonies''.\n       (D) $60,000,000 over ten years to the American Center for \n     International Labor Solidarity (ACILS), which is AFL-CIOs \n     international nongovernment division. 100% of ACILS's funding \n     is from taxpayers while AFL-CIO contributed $40,956,828 \n     exclusively to Democratic candidates in the 1998 Federal \n     election cycle.\n       (E) In fiscal year 1999, $200,000 in foreign aid to Canada \n     to underwrite seminars on gender sensitivity for \n     peacekeepers.\n       (F) In fiscal year 1999, the United States provided the \n     International Labor Organization with $54,774,408. Work \n     produced by that organization included a report advocating \n     recognition of the sex trade as a flourishing economic \n     enterprise and called for recognition of the trade in \n     official statistics.\n       (G) According to the General Accounting Office, ``USAID has \n     spent, by its own account, $92,000,000 to develop and \n     maintain the NMS [new management system], the system does not \n     work as intended and has created problems in mission \n     operations and morale.''\n       (H) In fiscal year 1999, the State Department is attempting \n     to send $28,000,000 to fund the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     Organization, which is an organization established by a \n     treaty the United States has not ratified.\n       (I) Despite sensitive deadlines in the Middle East Peace \n     Process looming, the United Nations is calling for a \n     conference under the auspices of the Fourth Geneva \n     Convention. No conference has been held under that Convention \n     since its inception in 1947. The topic for discussion is \n     Israeli Settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The United \n     States opposes this conference yet contributes 25 percent of \n     the United Nations budget.\n       (J) The United States has spent more than $3,000,000,000 to \n     ``restore democracy in Haiti.'' The reality is that there has \n     been no Prime Minister or Cabinet in Haiti for 19 months; the \n     Parliament has been effectively dissolved; local officials \n     serve at the whim of President Preval; the privatization \n     process is stalled; political murders remain unsolved; drug \n     trafficking is rampant. In short, billions of dollars in \n     foreign aid have bought us no leverage with the Haitians.\n       (K) As a result of consolidation of United States foreign \n     affairs agencies, 1,943 personnel will be transferred into \n     the State Department prior to the start of fiscal year 2000. \n     The fiscal year 2000 budget does not identify a reduction in \n     a single staff position.\n       (2) Additional funds that may become available from \n     elimination of some foreign assistance programs, management \n     efficiencies as a result of reorganization of the foreign \n     affairs agencies, and new estimates on the size of the budget \n     surplus should be designated for United States embassy \n     upgrades.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 219\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that $50 million will be \nprovided in fiscal year 2000 to conduct intensive firearms prosecution \nprojects to combat violence in the twenty-five American cities with the \n                          highest crime rates)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR INTENSIVE \n                   FIREARMS PROSECUTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) gun violence in America, while declining somewhat in \n     recent years, is still unacceptably high;\n       (2) keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals can \n     dramatically reduce gun violence in America;\n       (3) States and localities often do not have the \n     investigative or prosecutorial resources to locate and \n     convict individuals who violate their firearms laws. Even \n     when they do win convictions, states and localities often \n     lack the jail space to hold such convicts for their full \n     terms;\n       (4) there are a number of federal laws on the books which \n     are designed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. \n     These laws impose mandatory minimum sentences upon \n     individuals who use firearms to commit crimes of violence and \n     convicted felons caught in possession of a firearm;\n       (5) the federal government does have the resources to \n     investigate and prosecute violations of these federal \n     firearms laws. The federal government also has enough jail \n     space to hold individuals for the length of their mandatory \n     minimum sentences;\n       (6) an effort to aggressively and consistently apply these \n     federal firearms laws in Richmond, Virginia, has cut violent \n     crime in that city. This program, called Project Exile, has \n     produced 288 indictments during its first two years of \n     operation and has been credited with contributing to a 15% \n     decrease in violent crimes in Richmond during the same \n     period. In the first three-quarters of 1998, homicides with a \n     firearm in Richmond were down 55% compared to 1997;\n       (7) the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce-State-Justice \n     Appropriations Act provided $1.5 million to hire additional \n     federal prosecutors and investigators to enforce federal \n     firearms laws in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia project--\n     called Operation Cease Fire--started on January 1, 1999. \n     Since it began, the project has resulted in 31 indictments of \n     52 defendants on firearms violations. The project has \n     benefited from help from the Philadelphia Police Department \n     and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms which was not \n     paid for out of the $1.5 million grant;\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\n       (8) Senator Hatch has introduced legislation to authorize \n     Project CUFF, a federal firearms prosecution program;\n       (9) the Administration has requested $5 million to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects on a national level;\n       (10) given that at least $1.5 million is needed to run an \n     effective program in one American city--Philadelphia--$5 \n     million is far from enough funding to conduct such programs \n     nationally.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Function 750 in the budget resolution assumes that \n     $50,000,000 will be provided in fiscal year 2000 to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects to combat violence in \n     the twenty-five American cities with the highest crime rates.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 221\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning fostering the \n     employment and independence of individuals with disabilities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FOSTERING THE \n                   EMPLOYMENT AND INDEPENDENCE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care is important to all Americans.\n       (2) Health care is particularly important to individuals \n     with disabilities and special health care needs who often \n     cannot afford the insurance available to them through the \n     private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the \n     private sector, or are at great risk of incurring very high \n     and economically devastating health care costs.\n       (3) Americans with significant disabilities often are \n     unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage \n     of the services and supports that enable them to live \n     independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Coverage for \n     personal assistance services, prescription drugs, durable \n     medical equipment, and basic health care are powerful and \n     proven tools for individuals with significant disabilities to \n     obtain and retain employment.\n       (4) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing \n     health care and related services is one of the greatest \n     barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their \n     employment, earning potential, and independence.\n       (5) Individuals with disabilities who are beneficiaries \n     under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) risk losing medicare or medicaid \n     coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that \n     is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of \n     cash benefits associated with working.\n       (6) Currently, less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of social \n     security disability insurance (SSDI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) beneficiaries cease to receive benefits \n     as a result of employment.\n       (7) Beneficiaries have cited the lack of adequate \n     employment training and placement services as an additional \n     barrier to employment.\n       (8) If an additional \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the current \n     social security disability insurance (SSDI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) recipients were to cease receiving \n     benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social \n     Security Trust Funds in cash assistance would total \n     $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of the individuals.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the Work \n     Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (S. 331, 106th Congress) \n     will be passed by the Senate and enacted early this year, and \n     thereby provide individuals with disabilities with the health \n     care and employment preparation and placement services that \n     will enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on \n     cash benefit programs.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the amendment that I offer with my \ncolleagues Senators Kennedy, Roth, Moynihan, and Chafee, states that \nthe Senate budget resolution assumes that the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act of 1999, S. 331, will pass the Senate and be enacted \nearly this year.\n  S. 331 helps people with disabilities remain or become taxpayers. It \nhas 70 co-sponsors. It gives people with disabilities, who are on the \nSocial Security rolls, a reason to work.\n  If they work and forego cash payments, they will have access to \nhealth care. They will contribute to the cost of that health care. \nRight now the federal government disburses $1.21 billion each week in \ncash payments--a real budget buster that S. 331 would fix.\n  Mr. President, we have one broad, bipartisan initiative on health \ncare reform, that we should take up and enact quickly. Along with my \ncolleagues Senators Kennedy, Roth and Moynihan, I have introduced S. \n331, legislation that would help individuals with disabilities go to \nwork without being forced to sacrifice vital health care benefits. 70 \nSenators have joined us as co-sponsors of the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act of 1999, S. 331.\n  I have heard many compelling stories from individuals with \ndisabilities. Some sit at home waiting for S. 331 to become law, so \nthey can go to work. Some work part time being careful not to exceed \nthe $500 per month threshold which would trigger cut off of their \nhealth care. Yesterday I received a letter from a young man, Don, 30-\nyears of age, who told me he has mild mental retardation, mild cerebral \npalsy, a seizure disorder, and a visual impairment. Don works, but only \npart time.\n  At the end of his letter he wrote,\n\n       The Work Incentives Improvement Act will help my friends \n     become independent too. Then they can pay taxes too. But most \n     of all they will have a life in the community. We are adults. \n     We want to work. We don't need a hand out . . . we just need \n     a hand up.\n\n  Well, we want to help people such as Don have a hand up. Not just for \nhim, but out of self-interest as well. The hard facts make a compelling \ncase for enacting S. 331 quickly.\n  The rate in growth in these programs between 1989 and 1997 was 64 \npercent. Thus, it is not surprising that SSI and SSDI disbursements \nwent from $34.4 billion in 1989 to $62.9 billion in 1997. For 1997, GAO \nestimated weekly disbursements to be $1.21 billion.\n  Surplus or no surplus, we cannot afford these escalating costs. By \nadopting our resolution, the Senate sends an important message, we want \nindividuals with disabilities to have an opportunity to contribute--to \ntheir own well-being, to that of their families, and to that of their \ncommunities. The 57,000 beneficiaries in Vermont are waiting for S. \n331. A vote in favor of our Sense of the Senate amendment will send \nthese beneficiaries and those in every State a clear, concrete signal. \nS. 331 will be enacted this year, and soon.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 222\n\n     (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to \nmaintaining at least current expenditures (including emergency funding) \nfor the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for FY 2000)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LIHEAP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Home energy assistance for working and low-income \n     families with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the \n     disabled, and others who need such aid is a critical part of \n     the social safety net in cold-weather areas during the \n     winter, and a source of necessary cooling aid during the \n     summer;\n       (2) LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help \n     millions of low-income Americans pay their home energy bills. \n     More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have \n     annual incomes of less than $8,000, approximately one-half \n     have annual incomes below $6,000; and\n       (3) LIHEAP funding has been substantially reduced in recent \n     years, and cannot sustain further spending cuts if the \n     program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home \n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income \n     families, especially those in cold-weather states.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying this \n     budget resolution assume that it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funds made available for LIHEAP in Fiscal Year 2000 \n     will not be less than the current services for LIHEAP in \n     Fiscal Year 1999.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there is strong bipartisan support for \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Last year, Congress \nunanimously passed a five-year reauthorization of LIHEAP. In addition, \n52 Senators signed a letter in support of $1.2 billion in funding for \nLIHEAP. This year, the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition is \ncirculating a similar letter, which has already garnered the support of \n30 Senators.\n  Support has not waned for the LIHEAP program since the May 1996 Sense \nof the Senate on LIHEAP. Eighty-eight Senators voted to maintain \ncurrent expenditure levels for LIHEAP. Nevertheless, it appears time to \nre-confirm the Senate's commitment to LIHEAP. Last year, there was a \nfailed attempt to zero out funding for LIHEAP. The threat looms again \nthis year.\n  I, along with my colleagues from the Northeast-Midwest Senate \nCoalition, offer this Sense of the Senate to demonstrate the broad, \nbipartisan support for the LIHEAP program. The amendment is simple. It \nmaintains LIHEAP funding at a minimum of current levels, which is $1.1 \nbillion. This is still 50% lower than LIHEAP funding was in 1985.\n  I recognize that these are difficult budgetary times; however, LIHEAP \nis an effective tool for maintaining the basic needs of low-income \nhouseholds.\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\n It promotes self-sufficiency, something our welfare-to-work laws \nadvocate; and it ensures that our nation's children, elderly and \ndisabled never go to sleep in a freezing cold farmhouse or a stifling \nhot apartment.\n  Some would argue that energy costs are low and winter temperatures \nhave been milder. My response is that the need for LIHEAP has never \nbeen greater. The eligible population has grown; eligibility has been \nrestricted; benefit levels have been reduced; and welfare rolls have \nbeen shrinking. LIHEAP provides a critical safety net to the working \npoor, the elderly and families with children.\n  The statistics demonstrate the need for LIHEAP best. More than two-\nthirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have annual incomes of less than \n$8000, approximately one-half have annual incomes below $6000. It has \nbeen estimated that low-income households typically spend four times \nwhat middle-income households spend on utility services. Middle-income \nhouseholds spend about 4 percent of their income for energy purposes, \nwhereas low-income households spend between 14% and 16%, and in many \ninstances up to 25% for utility costs.\n  The other argument I hear against LIHEAP is that only cold weather \nstates reap its benefits. Wrong again. In 1998, eleven southern states \nreceived $150 million in emergency LIHEAP funding alone. I have seen \nnews articles from Oregon, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kansas discussing \nthe importance of LIHEAP. This is an important national program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 223\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Congress should \nprovide the maximum funding envisioned in law for Southwest Border law \n enforcement programs to stop the flow of drugs into the United States)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n    SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOUTHWEST BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                                FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) The Federal Government has not effectively secured the \n     Southwest Border of the United States. According to the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration, 50 to 70 percent of illegal drugs \n     enter the United States through Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, \n     and California. According to the State Department's 1999 \n     International Narcotics Strategy Report, 60 percent of the \n     Columbian cocaine sold in the United States passes through \n     Mexico before entering the United States.\n       (2) General Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy, has stated that 20,000 Border \n     Patrol agents are needed to secure the United States' \n     southern and northern borders. Currently, the Border Patrol \n     has approximately 8,000 agents.\n       (3) The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996, requires the Attorney General to \n     increase by not less than 1,000 the number of positions for \n     full-time, active duty Border Patrol agents in fiscal years \n     1997, 1998, 2000, and 2001. The Administration's fiscal year \n     2000 budget provides no funding to hire additional full-time \n     Border Patrol agents.\n       (4) The U.S. Customs Service plays an integral role in the \n     detection, deterrence, disruption and seizure of illegal \n     drugs as well as the facilitation of trade across the \n     Southwest Border of the United States. Customs requested 506 \n     additional inspectors in its fiscal year 2000 budget \n     submission to the Office of Management and Budget. In their \n     fiscal year 2000 budget request to Congress, however, the \n     Administration provides no funding to hire additional, full-\n     time Customs Service inspectors.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this budget resolution assume \n     full funding for the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     to hire 1,000 full-time, active-duty Border Patrol agents in \n     fiscal year 2000, as authorized by the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Further, it \n     is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in this \n     budget resolution assume funding for the Customs Service to \n     hire necessary staff and purchase equipment for drug \n     interdiction and traffic facilitation at United States land \n     border crossings, including 506 full-time, active-duty \n     Customs inspectors.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 224\n\n(Purpose: to express the sense of Congress that South Korea must abide \n        by its international trade commitments on pork and beef)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING SOUTH KOREA'S \n                   INTERNATIONAL TRADE PRACTICES ON PORK AND BEEF.\n\n       Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       Asia is the largest regional export market for America's \n     farmers and ranchers, traditionally purchasing approximately \n     40 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports;\n       The Department of Agriculture forecasts that over the next \n     year American agricultural exports to Asian countries will \n     decline by several billion dollars due to the Asian financial \n     crisis;\n       The United States is the producer of the safest \n     agricultural products from farm to table, customizing goods \n     to meet the needs of customers worldwide, and has established \n     the image and reputation as the world's best provider of \n     agricultural products;\n       American farmers and ranchers, and more specifically, \n     American pork and beef producers, are dependent on secure, \n     open, and competitive Asian export markets for their product;\n       United States pork and beef producers not only have faced \n     the adverse effects of depreciated and unstable currencies \n     and lowered demand due to the Asian financial crisis, but \n     also have been confronted with South Korea's pork subsidies \n     and its failure to keep commitments on market access for \n     beef;\n       It is the policy of the United States to prohibit South \n     Korea from using United States and International Monetary \n     Fund assistance to subsidize targeted industries and compete \n     unfairly for market share against U.S. products;\n       The South Korea Government has been subsidizing its pork \n     exports to Japan, resulting in a 973 percent increase in its \n     exports to Japan since 1992, and a 71 percent increase in the \n     last year;\n       Pork already comprises 70 percent of South Korea's \n     agriculture exports to Japan, yet the South Korean Government \n     has announced plans to invest 100,000,000,000 won in its \n     agricultural sector in order to flood the Japanese market \n     with even more South Korean pork;\n       The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries \n     reportedly has earmarked 25,000,000,000 won for loans to \n     Korea's pork processors in order for them to purchase more \n     Korean pork and to increase exports to Japan;\n       Any export subsidies on pork, including those on exports \n     from South Korea to Japan, would violate South Korea's \n     international trade agreements and may be actionable under \n     the World Trade Organization;\n       South Korea's subsidies are hindering U.S. pork and beef \n     producers from capturing their full potential in the Japanese \n     market, which is the largest export market for U.S. pork and \n     beef, importing nearly $700,000,000 of U.S. pork and over \n     $1,500,000,000 of U.S. beef last year alone;\n       Under the United States-Korea 1993 Record of Understanding \n     on Market Access for Beef, which was negotiated pursuant to a \n     1989 GATT Panel decision against Korea, South Korea was \n     allowed to delay full liberation of its beef market (in an \n     exception to WTO rules) if it would agree to import \n     increasing minimum quantities of beef each year until the \n     year 2001;\n       South Korea fell woefully short of its beef market access \n     commitment for 1998; and,\n       United States pork and beef producers are not able to \n     compete fairly with Korean livestock producers, who have a \n     high cost of production, because South Korea has violated \n     trade agreements and implemented protectionist policies: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       It is the sense of the Congress that Congress:\n       (1) Believes strongly that while a stable global \n     marketplace is in the best interest of America's farmers and \n     ranchers, the United States should seek a mutually beneficial \n     relationship without hindering the competitiveness of \n     American agriculture;\n       (2) Calls on South Korea to abide by its trade commitments;\n       (3) Calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the \n     United States Executive Director of the International \n     Monetary Fund to promote vigorously policies that encourage \n     the opening of markets for beef and pork products by \n     requiring South Korea to abide by its existing international \n     trade commitments and to reduce trade barriers, tariffs, and \n     export subsidies;\n       (4) Calls on the President and the Secretaries of Treasury \n     and Agriculture to monitor and report to Congress that \n     resources will not be used to stabilize the South Korean \n     market at the expense of U.S. agricultural goods or services; \n     and\n       (5) Requests the United States Trade Representative and the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture to pursue the settlement of \n     disputes with the Government of South Korea on its failure to \n     abide by its international trade commitments on beef market \n     access, to consider whether Korea's reported plans for \n     subsidizing its pork industry would violate any of its \n     international trade commitments, and to determine what impact \n     Korea's subsidy plans would have on U.S. agricultural \n     interests, especially in Japan.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 225\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that no additional \n       firewalls should be enacted for transportation activities)\n\n         At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TRANSPORTATION FIREWALLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) domestic firewalls greatly limit funding flexibility as \n     Congress manages budget priorities in a fiscally constrained \n     budget;\n       (2) domestic firewalls inhibit congressional oversight of \n     programs and organizations under such artificial protections;\n       (3) domestic firewalls mask mandatory spending under the \n     guise of discretionary spending, thereby presenting a \n     distorted picture of overall discretionary spending;\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n       (4) domestic firewalls impede the ability of Congress to \n     react to changing circumstances or to fund other equally \n     important programs;\n       (5) the Congress implemented ``domestic discretionary \n     budget firewalls'' for approximately 70 percent of function \n     400 spending in the 105th Congress;\n       (6) if the aviation firewall proposal circulating in the \n     House of Representatives were to be enacted, over 100 percent \n     of function 400 spending would be firewalled; and\n       (7) if the aviation firewall proposal circulating in the \n     House of Representatives were to be enacted, drug \n     interdiction activities by the Coast Guard, National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration activities, rail safety \n     inspections, Federal support for Amtrak, all National \n     Transportation Safety Board activities, Pipeline and \n     Hazardous materials safety programs, and Coast Guard search \n     and rescue activities would be drastically cut or eliminated \n     from function 400.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that no additional \n     firewalls should be enacted for function 400 transportation \n     activities.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 226\n\n  (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate that new public health \n  programs should not be established to the detriment of funding for \nexisting, effective programs, such as the Preventive Health and Health \n                         Services Block Grant)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. 316.   .

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nbudget resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that we should \ncontinue to support our successful existing public health programs, \nbefore diverting limited dollars to the creation of new programs.\n  The President's budget proposed a $30 million cut to the Preventive \nHealth and Health Services Block Grant, which is funded through the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. That's a 20 percent cut. \nFor Wyoming, that means the loss of an entire public health program. \nHow can I ask them to decide between the heart disease prevention \nprogram and emergency medical services? I sure know that I can't tell \nmy constituents we were able to find funding for new, narrowly focused \ncategorical programs that they may or may not be eligible for.\n  Mr. President, I believe we all share the same goal of getting the \nmost out of money in the interest of public health. That was exactly \nCongress' thinking when they consolidated a variety of programs and \nestablished instead block grants to states. The intent was clear. \nStates and localities need the flexibility to determine the best way to \nmeet the public health needs of their residents. I believe we can \naddress national health priorities without discarding the needs of \nlocal communities.\n  Congress has already drawn the correct conclusion. A significant \nportion of the public health battle is wages on the front lines back in \nthe states. In the name of advancing public health, we should not be \nproposing cuts to our front line infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I ask for my colleagues support for this amendment and \nrequest its immediate adoption.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 227\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PRESIDENT'S FY \n                   2000 BUDGET PROPOSAL TO TAX ASSOCIATION \n                   INVESTMENT INCOME.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) The President's fiscal year 2000 federal budget \n     proposal to impose a tax on the interest, dividends, capital \n     gains, rents, and royalties in excess of $10,000 of trade \n     associations and professional societies exempt under sec. \n     501(c)(6) of the IRC of 1986 represents an unjust and \n     unnecessary penalty on legitimate association activities.\n       (2) At a time when the government is projecting on-budget \n     surpluses of more than $800,000,000,000 over the next ten \n     years, the President proposes to increase the tax burden on \n     trade and professional association by $1,440,000,000 over the \n     next five years.\n       (3) The Presidents association tax increase proposal will \n     impose a tremendous burden on thousands of small and mid-\n     sized trade associations and professional societies.\n       (4) Under the President's association tax increase \n     proposal, most associations with annual operating budgets of \n     as low $200,000 or more will be taxed on investment income \n     and as many as 70,000 associations nationwide could be \n     affected by this proposal.\n       (5) Associations rely on this targeted investment income to \n     carry out tax-exempt status related activities, such as \n     training individuals to adapt to the changing workplace, \n     improving industry safety, providing statistical data, and \n     providing community services.\n       (6) Keeping investment income free from tax encourages \n     associations to maintain modest surplus funds that cushion \n     against economic and fiscal downturns.\n       (7) Corporations can increase prices to cover increased \n     costs, while small and medium sized local, regional, and \n     State-based associations do not have such an option, and thus \n     increased costs imposed by the President's association tax \n     increase would reduce resources available for the important \n     standard setting, educational training, and professionalism \n     training performed by association.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the functional totals \n     in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that \n     Congress shall reject the President's proposed tax increase \n     on investment income of associations as defined under section \n     501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Crapo, \nSantorum, Hagel, Inhofe and Collins in introducing a sense of the \nSenate amendment to the budget resolution rejecting the President's \nproposed tax, as part of his fiscal year 2000 budget proposal, on the \ninvestment income earned by nonprofit trade associations and \nprofessional societies.\n  This proposal would tax any income in excess of $10,000 earned \nthrough the non-competitive activities of nonprofit associations, such \nas interest, dividends, capital gains, rents and royalties, posing a \ntremendous burden on an estimated 70,000 registered trade associations \nand professional societies.\n  Mostly operating on a state and local level, these organizations \ndepend on this income to perform such vital community services as \neducation, training, standard setting, industry safety, and community \noutreach. Faced with an additional increase in taxes of $1.4 billion \nover the next five years, many associations will be forced to cut back \nor eliminate these important services, forcing the government to step \nin, increasing expenditures and creating additional programs.\n  During a time when the government is projecting on-budget surpluses \nof more than $800 billion over the next 10 years, it is unconscionable \nthat we would allow the administration to levy a new tax on these \nnonprofit organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the resolution be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my statement.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend, \nSenator Abraham of Michigan, in offering this amendment.\n  This amendment is being offered in reaction to a provision in the \nPresident's FY 2000 budget that would impose a new tax on the \ninvestment income of nonprofit trade and professional associations. \nThese trade and professional associations are currently exempt from \ntaxes under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  The administration's proposal would tax the investment income--\ninterest,\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\ndividends, capital gains, rents, and royalties--of 501(c)(6) \nassociations. Associations currently rely on this investment income to \ncarry out exempt-status related activities such as education, training, \nstandard-setting, research, and community outreach.\n  Under the President's proposal, the first $10,000 an association \nearns from investments would not be taxed. However, all income earned \nover $10,000 would be subject to the unrelated business income tax \nunder the Internal Revenue Code. It is estimated that this new tax, \nwhich can be as high as 35 percent, will increase the tax burden on the \nnation's nonprofit trade and professional associations by $1.4 billion \nover the next 5 years.\n  Contrary to assertions made by the administration, this proposal will \naffect thousands of small and mid-sized trade associations and \nprofessional societies. According to the American Society of \nAssociation Executives' Operating Ratio Report, most associations with \nannual operating budgets as low as $200,000 would be subject to a new \ntax under this proposal.\n  As many as 70,000 associations nationwide could be affected by this \nnew tax, including the American Youth Soccer Organization, American \nNurses Association, the National Education Association, National \nAssociation of State Departments of Agriculture, and many others. \nImportant trade associations in my home state that could be affected by \nthe new tax include the Idaho Association of School Administrators, \nIdaho Credit Union League, Idaho Mining Association, the Idaho Cattle \nAssociation and others.\n  This amendment is supported by the American Society of Association \nExecutives (ASAE), the trade organization that represents our Nation's \ntrade and professional associations.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this new tax and \nsupport the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 228\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. XX. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL \n                   FUNDS FOR NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Deaths from drug overdoses have increased over five \n     times since 1988.\n       (2) A Montreal study published in the American Journal of \n     Epidemiology, found that IV addicts who used a needle \n     exchange program were over twice as likely to become infected \n     with HIV as those who did not.\n       (3) A Vancouver study published in the Journal of AIDS, \n     showed a stunning increase in HIV in drug addicts, from 1 to \n     2 percent to 23 percent, since that city's needle exchange \n     program was begun in 1988. Deaths from drug overdoses have \n     increased over five times since 1988 and Vancouver now has \n     the highest death rate from heroin in North America.\n       (4) In November of 1995 the Manhattan Lower East Side \n     Community Board #3 passed a resolution to terminate their \n     needle exchange program due to the fact that ``the community \n     has been inundated with drug dealers. . . . Law-abiding \n     businesses are being abandoned; and much needed law \n     enforcement is being withheld by the police.''\n       (5) The New York Times Magazine in 1997 reported that one \n     New York City needle exchange program gave out 60 syringes to \n     a single person, little pans to ``cook'' the heroin, \n     instructions on how to inject the drug and a card exempting \n     the user from arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia.\n       (6) Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Weekly reports that heroin \n     use by American teenagers has doubled in the last five years.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the functional totals \n     in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume that \n     Congress shall continue the statutory ban on the use of \n     federal funds to implement or support any needle exchange \n     program for drug addicts.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Coverdell, \nAshcroft, and Hutchinson in introducing a sense of the Senate amendment \nto the budget resolution rejecting the use of federal funds for needle \nexchange programs.\n  Deaths resulting from drug overdoses have increased five times since \n1988. According to Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Weekly, the number of \nAmerican teenagers using heroin, once considered a drug used primarily \nby hard-core drug addicts, has doubled in the past five years.\n  Last year, the Clinton administration attempted to lift the ongoing \nban on federal funds for needle exchange programs as a solution to \nreducing the rate HIV infection among intravenous (IV) drug use without \nincreasing the use of drugs like heroin. Needle exchange programs are \nnot the answer--giving an addict a clean needle is equivalent to giving \nan alcoholic a clean glass--both do a more sanitary job of delivering \nthe poison that is killing our kids.\n  A Montreal study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, \nfound that IV addicts who used a needle exchange program were over \ntwice as likely to become infected with HIV as those who did not. The \nNew York Times magazine reported that one New York City needle program \ngave a single individual 60 syringes, little pans to ``cook'' the \nheroin, instructions for usage, and a card amounting to a ``get out of \njail free'' pass for possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  At a time when heroin use is skyrocketing among our youth, the last \nthing we need is for Washington to send the message that drug use is \nokay, and that we are not serious about the war on drugs. Join with us \nin finding that Congress shall continue the statutory ban on the use of \nfederal funds to implement or support any needle exchange program for \ndrug addicts.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 229\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning funding for \n                           special education)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR SPECIAL \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) (referred to in this resolution as the \n     ``Act''), Congress found that improving educational results \n     for children with disabilities is an essential element of our \n     national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full \n     participation, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) In the Act, the Secretary of Education is instructed to \n     make grants to States to assist them in providing special \n     education and related services to children with disabilities.\n       (3) The Act represents a commitment by the Federal \n     Government to fund 40 percent of the average per-pupil \n     expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools in the \n     United States.\n       (4) The budget submitted by the President for fiscal year \n     2000 ignores the commitment by the Federal Government under \n     the Act to fund special education and instead proposes the \n     creation of new programs that limit the manner in which \n     States may spend the limited Federal education dollars \n     received.\n       (5) The budget submitted by the President for fiscal year \n     2000 fails to increase funding for special education, and \n     leaves States and localities with an enormous unfunded \n     mandate to pay for growing special education costs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that part \n     B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et \n     seq.) should be fully funded at the originally promised level \n     before any funds are appropriated for new education programs.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins, in offering this important amendment to express the \nSense of the Senate that funding for need-based student financial aid \nprograms should be increased.\n  The Republican budget proposal provides some welcome news when \ncompared with past Republican budget proposals because it at least \nincludes increased funding for elementary and secondary education. \nIndeed, it can be called much improved in contrast with past Republican \nproposals to eliminate the Department of Education.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that this funding increase may be \nfinanced by cutting critical programs like Head Start, Summer Jobs for \nYouth, and job training by up to 10% in FY2000, and 20% in the \nfollowing years.\n  Moreover, this budget proposal assumes an increase for elementary and \nsecondary education programs of $2.6 billion over a freeze. However, it \nonly assumes a $2.4 billion overall increase for all education programs \nin fiscal year 2000, which means other vital education programs, like \nstudent financial aid programs, would have to be deeply cut or frozen \nin order to meet these assumptions.\n  It would be a shame to limit our ability to realize the reforms we \njust recently enacted as part of the Higher Education Act Amendments of \n1998 to enhance federal assistance to college students. That is why I \nhave joined Senator Collins and others in offering this amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment simply urges increases in funding for \nneed-based student financial aid programs. These programs include Pell \nGrants, the Federal Work Study Program, the Leveraging Educational \nAssistance Partnership (LEAP) program, and TRIO.\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\n  I strongly support a greater investment in all of these important \nprograms than is provided by the budget resolution. And, in particular, \nI have long been a champion of more robust funding for the LEAP \nprogram, a federal-state partnership that is essential to our efforts \nto help needy students attend and graduate from college.\n  I worked closely with Senator Collins on a successful amendment two \nyears ago to save LEAP from elimination and on legislation to reform \nthis program, which was included in the Higher Education Act Amendments \nof 1998. These reforms seek to encourage states to increase their \ncommitments to need-based student grant aid in exchange for increased \nflexibility to provide a broader array of higher education assistance \nto needy students.\n  We are currently working together to secure $75 million for LEAP in \nthe Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations bill to trigger these reforms, and I urge my colleagues \nto join us in this important effort.\n  LEAP and the rest of the federal financial aid programs are critical \nto helping students achieve their higher education goals.\n  All higher education and student groups endorse the effort to \nincrease funding for need-based student financial aid programs, and I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support our amendment in order to meet \nthe commitment to higher education that we reaffirmed last fall by \npassing the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 230\n\n   (Purpose: To provide an exception for emergency defense spending)\n\n       At the end of section 205 of the resolution, add the \n     following:\n       (f) Exception for Defense Spending.--This section shall not \n     apply to a provision making discretionary appropriations in \n     the defense category.''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment modifies section 205 of \nthe resolution, which creates a 60 vote point of order against \nemergency appropriations. The modification establishes an exception \nfrom the 60 vote point of order for national security emergency \nappropriations. Given the on-going operations in the Balkans, the need \nfor this exception is clear.\n  Much like the vote to authorize the Persian Gulf war, where only 52 \nmembers of the Senate voted in support of that action, the current \nmilitary operations in Kosovo and Serbia gained the support of only 58 \nSenators. I opposed that resolution. That doesn't change the fact that \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces mut be properly supplied, \nequipped and supported when they are sent to combat. That is our job, \nirrespective of whether each of us agrees with the specific policy that \nled to the deployment of U.S. forces.\n  Earlier this month, the Governmental Affairs Committee reported S. \n93, which established new procedures for the consideration of emergency \nappropriations. That bill creates a point of order that requires 51 \nvotes to waive. That bill has been referred to the Budget Committee, \nand will probably come before the Senate after the Easter recess. I \nurge the adoption of the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 231\n\n(Purpose: Sense of the Senate on providing tax relief to all Americans \n       by returning the non-Social Security surplus to taxpayers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF SENATE ON PROVIDING TAX RELIEF TO ALL \n                   AMERICANS BY RETURNING NON-SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   SURPLUS TO TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Every cent of Social Security surplus should be \n     reserved to pay Social Security benefits, for Social Security \n     reform, or to pay down the debt held by the public and not be \n     used for other purposes.\n       (2) Medicare should be fully funded.\n       (3) Even after safeguarding Social Security and Medicare, a \n     recent Congressional Research Service study found that an \n     average American family will pay $5,307 more in taxes over \n     the next 10 years than the government needs to operate.\n       (4) The Administration's budget returns none of the excess \n     surplus back to the taxpayers and instead increases net taxes \n     and fees by $96,000,000,000 over 10 years.\n       (5) The burden of the Administration's tax increases falls \n     disproportionately on low- and middle-income taxpayers. A \n     recent Tax Foundation study found that individuals with \n     incomes of less than $25,000 would bear 38.5 percent of the \n     increased tax burden, while taxpayers with incomes between \n     $25,000 and $50,000 would pay 22.4 percent of the new taxes.\n       (6) The budget resolution returns most of the non-Social \n     Security surplus to those who worked so hard to produce it by \n     providing $142,000,000,000 in real tax relief over 5 years \n     and almost $800,000,000,000 in tax relief over 10 years.\n       (7) The budget resolution builds on the following tax \n     relief that Republicans have provided since 1995:\n       (A) In 1995, Republicans proposed the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1995 which included tax relief for families, savings and \n     investment incentives, health care-related tax relief, and \n     relief for small business--tax relief that was vetoed by \n     President Clinton.\n       (B) In 1996, Republicans provided, and the President \n     signed, tax relief for small business and health care-related \n     tax relief.\n       (C) In 1997, Republicans once again pushed for tax relief \n     in the context of a balanced budget, and this time President \n     Clinton signed into law a $500 per child tax credit, expanded \n     individual retirement accounts and the new Roth IRA, a cut in \n     the capital gains tax rate, education tax relief, and estate \n     tax relief.\n       (D) In 1998, Republicans (initially opposed by the \n     Administration) pushed for reform of the Internal Revenue \n     Service, and provided tax relief for America's farmers.\n       (8) Americans deserve further tax relief because they are \n     still overpaying. They deserve a refund. Federal taxes \n     currently consume nearly 21 percent of national income, the \n     highest percentage since World War II. Families are paying \n     more in Federal, State, and local taxes than for food, \n     clothing, and shelter combined.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the levels in this resolution assume that the Senate \n     not only puts a priority on protecting Social Security and \n     Medicare and reducing the Federal debt, but also on middle-\n     class tax relief by returning some of the non-Social Security \n     surplus to those from whom it was taken; and\n       (2) such middle-class tax relief could include broad-based \n     tax relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings \n     incentives, death tax relief, savings and investment \n     incentives, health care-related tax relief, education-related \n     tax relief, and tax simplification proposals.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 232\n\n  (Purpose: To allow increased tobacco tax revenues to be used as an \n   offset for the Medicare prescription drug benefit provided for in \n                              section 209)\n\n       On page 53, line 4, after ``may change committee \n     allocations'' insert ``, revenue aggregates for legislation \n     that increases taxes on tobacco or tobacco products \n     (only).''.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 233\n\n(Purpose: To protect taxpayers from retro-active income and estate tax \n              rate increases by creating a point of order)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. RESTRICTION ON RETROACTIVE INCOME AND ESTATE TAX \n                   RATE INCREASES.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The Senate declares that it is essential to \n     ensure taxpayers are protected against retroactive income and \n     estate tax rate increases.\n       (b) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report, that includes a retroactive Federal income \n     tax rate increase.\n       (2) Definition.--In this section--\n       (A) the term ``Federal income tax rate increase'' means any \n     amendment to subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of section \n     1, or to section 11(b) or 55(b), of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, that imposes a new percentage as a rate of tax and \n     thereby increases the amount of tax imposed by any such \n     section; and\n       (B) a Federal income tax rate increase is retroactive if it \n     applies to a period beginning prior to the enactment of the \n     provision.\n       (c) Supermajority Waiver.--\n       (1) Waiver.--The point of order in subsection (b) may be \n     waived or suspended only by the affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under subsection (b).\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section takes effect on January \n     1, 1999.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 234\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regardng the need for \nincentives for low- and middle-income savers and investors and the need \n  for such incentives to be accompanied by an expansion of the lowest \n                      personal income tax bracket)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ______. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCENTIVES FOR \n                   SMALL SAVERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in general, the Federal budget will accumulate nearly \n     $800,000,000,000 in non-Social Security surpluses through \n     2009;\n       (2) such a level of surplus affords Congress the \n     opportunity to return a portion to the taxpayers in the form \n     of tax relief;\n       (3) the Federal tax burden is at its highest level in over \n     50 years;\n       (4) personal bankruptcy filings reached a record high in \n     1998 with $40,000,000,000 in debts discharged;\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\n       (5) the personal savings rate is at record lows not seen \n     since the Great Depression;\n       (6) the personal savings rate was 9 percent of income in \n     1982;\n       (7) the personal savings rate was 5.7 percent of income in \n     1992;\n       (8) the personal savings rate plummeted to 0.5 percent in \n     1998;\n       (9) the personal savings rate could plummet to as low as \n     negative 4.5 percent if current trends do not change;\n       (10) personal saving is important as a means for the \n     American people to prepare for crisis, such as a job loss, \n     health emergency, or some other personal tragedy, or to \n     prepare for retirement;\n       (11) President Clinton recently acknowledged the low rate \n     of personal savings as a concern;\n       (12) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years would move \n     7,000,000 middle-income taxpayers into the lowest income tax \n     bracket;\n       (13) excluding the first $500 from interest and dividends \n     income, or $250 for singles, would enable 30,000,000 low- and \n     middle-income taxpayers to save tax-free and would translate \n     into approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in savings;\n       (14) exempting the first $5,000 in capital gains income \n     from capital gains taxation would mean 10,000,000 low- and \n     middle-income taxpayers would no longer pay capital gains \n     tax;\n       (15) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000, would mean over \n     5,000,000 taxpayers will be better equipped for retirement; \n     and\n       (16) tax relief measures to encourage savings and \n     investments for low- and middle-income savers would mean tax \n     relief for nearly 112,000,000 individual taxpayers by--\n       (A) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years;\n       (B) excluding from income the first $500 in interest and \n     dividend income ($250 for singles);\n       (C) exempting from capital gains taxation the first $5,000 \n     in capital gains taxes; and\n       (D) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution and legislation \n     enacted pursuant to this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress will adopt tax relief that provides incentives \n     for savings and investment for low- and middle-income working \n     families that assist in preparing for unexpected emergencies \n     and retirement, such as--\n       (A) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years;\n       (B) excluding from income the first $500 in interest and \n     dividend income ($250 for singles);\n       (C) exempting from capital gains taxation the first $5,000 \n     in capital gains taxes; and\n       (D) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000; and\n       (2) tax relief as described in this subsection is fully \n     achievable within the parameters set forth under this budget \n     resolution.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 235\n\n              (Purpose: To reduce the size of the tax cut)\n\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO BECOME DISABLED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\n       (1) in addition to providing retirement income, Social \n     Security also protects individuals from the loss of income \n     due to disability;\n       (2) according to the most recent report from the Social \n     Security Board of Trustees nearly 1 in 7 Social Security \n     beneficiaries, 6,000,000 individuals in total, were receiving \n     benefits as a result of disability;\n       (3) more than 60 percent of workers have no long-term \n     disability insurance protection other than that provided by \n     Social Security;\n       (4) according to statistics from the Society of Actuaries, \n     the odds of a long-term disability versus death are 2.7 to 1 \n     at age 27, 3.5 to 1 at age 42, and 2.2 to 1 at age 52; and\n       (5) in 1998, the average monthly benefit for a disabled \n     worker was $722.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that levels in the resolution assume that--\n       (1) Social Security plays a vital role in providing \n     adequate income for individuals who become disabled;\n       (2) individuals who become disabled face circumstances much \n     different than those who rely on Social Security for \n     retirement income;\n       (3) Social Security reform proposals that focus too heavily \n     on retirement income may adversely affect the income \n     protection provided to individuals with disabilities; and\n       (4) Congress and the President should take these factors \n     into account when considering proposals to reform the Social \n     Security program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 238\n\n  (Purpose: To provide $200,000,000 for the State-side program of the \n                   land and water conservation fund)\n\n       On page 15, line 8, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 9, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 15, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 16, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) amounts in the land and water conservation fund finance \n     the primary Federal program for acquiring land for \n     conservation and recreation and for supporting State and \n     local efforts for conservation and recreation;\n       (2) Congress has appropriated only $10,000,000,000 out of \n     the more than $21,000,000,000 covered into the fund from \n     revenues payable to the United States under the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.); and\n       (3) 38 Senators cosigned 2 letters to the Chairman and \n     Ranking Member of the Committee on the Budget urging that the \n     land and water conservation fund be fully funded.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that Congress should \n     appropriate $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 to provide \n     financial assistance to the States under section 6 of the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C 460l-\n     8), in addition to such amounts as are made available for \n     Federal land acquisition under that Act for fiscal year 2000.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nrestore funding to a program that has been dormant for too long, a \nprogram that could provide vital funding to assist small municipalities \nin conserving their resources. I rise today to offer an amendment to \nprovide $200 million for funding the State-side program of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund (LWCF). I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nBob Smith, Feingold, Leahy, Jeffords, Moynihan, Roth, Allard, Collins, \nand Snowe in sponsoring this amendment.\n  The LWCF was started in 1964 to provide funds for land and water \nconservation through two programs: Federal land acquisitions, and \nFederal cost-sharing of State conservation and recreation projects. \nMoneys for the LWCF are derived from revenues obtained through oil and \ngas drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. These revenues amount to \n$4 billion to $5 billion annually, which go into the General Treasury. \nOf this amount, $900 million is authorized to go specifically to LWCF. \nHowever, in recent years, only about $300 million to $350 million has \nbeen appropriated for LWCF, and since 1995, funding for the State-side \nprogram has been entirely eliminated.\n  The principle behind the LWCF is a simple but noble one: to reinvest \nthe revenues earned from the depletion of offshore oil and gas \nresources to the conservation of other natural resources. \nUnfortunately, the promise of the LWCF has never been fully realized \nbecause of sporadic funding. Many opportunities to conserve precious \nlands and to work with our State and local partners have been lost.\n  People across the country are realizing that they cannot afford to \nlose more opportunities to protect the lands they consider important. \nThe elections of November 1998 underscored the groundswell of support \nfor these efforts. Voters approved more than 200 State and local ballot \ninitiatives--70 percent of the total initiatives offered--to commit $7 \nbillion for conservation and related activities.\n  Congress should play a role in supporting these efforts, and the LWCF \nwas created 35 years ago precisely for this purpose. The two components \nof the Fund--Federal acquisitions and State-side conservation--provide \na perfect complement to one another in a comprehensive package. Just \ntwo weeks ago, I spearheaded efforts to encourage 37 of my Senate \ncolleagues to cosign a letter to the Budget Committee supporting full \nfunding for the LWCF.\n  The State-side program, however, deserves specific attention. It is a \ngrants program, that requires States to contribute 50 percent of the \ntotal cost of projects they wish to fund. The Federal Government \nmatches the other 50 percent. States must prepare a comprehensive plan \nin order to be eligible for the funding, and they receive funds through \nan allocation formula. In short, the State-side program is a cost-\nsharing grants program, based on sound planning, with an apolitical \ndistribution formula. What could be better? And yet Congress has not \nfunded it since 1995.\n  One reason it has not been funded has been a question of priorities \namong a long list of conservation needs. Federal land acquisition; \noperations and maintenance of Federal lands; and assistance to States \nare all important. Indeed, Mr. President, the Budget Committee \nexplicitly recognizes this in its report for S. Con. Res. 20. However, \nthe State-side program has suffered too long by being completely \nwithout funds. It is high time we restore some funding to this program, \nwhile recognizing that other needs still exist. My amendment does just \nthat.\n  In order to increase the LWCF by $200 million, of course, we need to \nfind an offset with equivalent budget authority and outlays. This is \nnever an easy task, but my amendment takes the funds from Function 370, \nrelating to Commerce and Housing Credit. I believe that there are \nseveral programs within that function that can be cut to provide $200 \nmillion for LWCF.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I support the Chafee amendment that assumes \nfunding of $200 million specifically for the stateside program of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund to come out of Function 370. It is my \nunderstanding that no specific program in Function 370 has been \ndesignated as an offset for the Chafee amendment, nor do I believe that \nprograms such as the Advanced Technology Program be considered as an \noffset. The ultimate funding decision of course rests with the \nappropriators, but I wanted to take this opportunity to cast my support \nfor funds for the LWCF stateside program, which has not received any \nfunding since 1995.\n  Up until 1995, LWCF stateside program funds were used in my state to \nassist communities for planning, acquiring and developing outdoor \nrecreation facilities that would not otherwise have been affordable, \nespecially in the smaller communities in Maine.\n  The LWCF stateside program has funded such local projects in Maine as \nthe community playground in Durham, the Mt. Apatite trails in Auburn, \nthe Dionne Park Playground in Madawaska, the East-West Aroostook Valley \ntrail in Caribou, the Williams Wading Pool in Augusta, multi-purpose \nfields in St. George, Hampden, Buxton, Calais, and Bradford, the \nskating rink in Bucksport, and wharf rehabilitation in Greenville.\n  By leveraging state dollars with critical LWCF stateside funds, \nMaine's communities have been able to enjoy recreational facilities \nsuch as neighborhood parks, swimming pools, and ball fields, and also \nhave had the opportunity to conserve certain highly valued lands that \nthe citizens of the state wish to save for outdoor recreational \nactivities for themselves and for generations to come.\n\n[[Page S3351]]\n\n                           amendment no. 239\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Social Security \nTrust Fund shall be managed in the best interest of current and future \n                             beneficiaries)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FEDERAL TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Congressional Budget Office has reported that \n     payroll taxes will exceed income taxes for 74 percent of all \n     taxpayers in 1999.\n       (2) The Federal Government will collect nearly $50 billion \n     in income taxes this year through its practice of taxing the \n     income Americans sacrifice to the government in the form of \n     Social Security payroll taxes.\n       (3) American taxpayers are currently shouldering the \n     heaviest tax burden since 1944.\n       (4) According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the \n     median dual-income family sacrificed a record 37.6 percent of \n     its income to the government in 1997.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that a significant portion of the tax \n     relief will be devoted to working families who are double-\n     taxed by--\n       (1) Providing taxpayers with an above-the-line income tax \n     deduction for the Social Security payroll taxes they pay so \n     that they no longer pay income taxes on such payroll taxes, \n     and/or\n       (2) gradually reducing the lowest marginal income tax rate \n     from 15 percent to 10 percent, and/or\n       (3) other tax reductions that do not reduce the tax revenue \n     devoted to the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 241\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE CLOSURE OF HOWARD \n                   AIR FORCE BASE AND REPOSITIONING OF ASSETS AND \n                   OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES IN FORWARD OPERATING \n                   LOCATIONS.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds the following--\n       (1) at noon on the last day of 1999, the Panama Canal and \n     its adjacent lands will revert from U.S. control to that of \n     the government of Panama, as prescribed by the Carter-\n     Torrijos treaties concluded in 1978.\n       (2) with this act, nearly ninety years of American presence \n     in the Central American isthmus will come to an end.\n       (3) on September 25, 1998, the United States and Panama \n     announced that talks aimed at establishing a Multinational \n     counter-narcotics Center (MCC) were ended through mutual \n     agreement. The two countries had been engaged in discussions \n     for two years.\n       (4) plans to meet the deadline are going forward and the \n     U.S. is withdrawing all forces and proceeding with the return \n     of all military installations to Panamanian control.\n       (5) Howard Air Force Base is scheduled to return to \n     Panamanian control by May 1, 1999. Howard AFB provides a \n     secure staging for detection, monitoring and intelligence \n     collecting assets on counter-narcotics drug trafficking. \n     Howard Air Force Base was the proposed location for the \n     Multinational Counter-narcotics Center.\n       (6) AWACS (E-3) aircraft used for counter-drug surveillance \n     is scheduled for relocation from Howard AFB to MacDill AFB in \n     April. The E3's are scheduled to resume this mission in May \n     from MacDill.\n       (7) USSOUTHCOM and the Department of State have been \n     examining the potential for alternative forward operating \n     locations (FOLs). A potential location would require the \n     operational capacity to house E-3 AWACS KC-135 tankers, Night \n     Hawk F-16s/F-15s, Navy P-3s, U.S. Customs P-3s and Citations, \n     Army Airborne Reconnaissance Low, and Senior Scout C-130s. No \n     agreement has been reached regarding the number of FOLs \n     required, cost of relocating these assets, time to build \n     ensuing facilities, or plans for housing these assets for \n     long-term stays.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the United States is obligated to protect its citizens \n     from the threats posed by illegal drugs crossing our borders. \n     Interdiction in the transit and arrival zones disrupt the \n     drug flow, increases risk to traffickers, drives them to less \n     efficient routes and methods, and prevents significant \n     amounts of drugs from reaching the United States.\n       (2) there has been an inordinate delay in identifying and \n     securing appropriate alternate sites.\n       (3) the Senate must pursue every effort to explore, urge \n     the President to arrange long-term agreements with countries \n     that support reducing the flow of drugs, and fully fund \n     forward operating locations so that we continue our balanced \n     strategy of attacking drug smugglers before their deadly \n     cargos reach our borders.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 242\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that increased funding for \n  elementary and secondary education should be directed to States and \n                        local school districts)\n\n       On page 73, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (c) Additional Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Children should be the primary beneficiaries of \n     education spending, not bureaucrats.\n       (2) Parents have the primary responsibility for their \n     children's education. Parents are the first and best \n     educators of their children. Our Nation trusts parents along \n     with teachers and State and local school officials to make \n     the best decisions about the education of our Nation's \n     children.\n       (3) Congress supports the goal of ensuring that the maximum \n     amount of Federal education dollars are spent directly in the \n     classrooms.\n       (4) Education initiatives should boost academic achievement \n     for all students. Excellence in American classrooms means \n     having high expectations for all students, teachers, and \n     administrators, and holding schools accountable to the \n     children and parents served by such schools.\n       (5) Successful schools and school systems are characterized \n     by parental involvement in the education of their children, \n     local control, emphasis on basic academics, emphasis on \n     fundamental skills, and exceptional teachers in the \n     classroom.\n       (6) Congress rejects a one-size-fits-all approach to \n     education which often creates barriers to innovation and \n     reform initiatives at the local level. America's rural \n     schools face challenges quite different from their urban \n     counterparts. Parents, teachers, and State and local school \n     officials should have the freedom to tailor their education \n     plans and reforms according to the unique educational needs \n     of their children.\n       (7) The funding levels in this resolution assume that \n     Congress will provide an additional $2,800,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000 and an additional $33,000,000,000 for the period \n     beginning with fiscal year 2000 and ending with fiscal year \n     2005 for elementary and secondary education.\n       (d) Additional Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) increased Federal funding for elementary and secondary \n     education should be directed to States and local school \n     districts; and\n       (2) decisionmaking authority should be placed in the hands \n     of States, localities, and families to implement innovative \n     solutions to local educational challenges and to increase the \n     performance of all students, unencumbered by unnecessary \n     Federal rules and regulations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 243\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate to create a task force to pursue the \n              creation of a natural disaster reserve fund)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       It is the sense of the senate that a task force be created \n     for the purpose of creating a reserve fund for natural \n     disasters. The task force should be composed of three \n     Senators appointed by the majority lender, and two Senators \n     appointed by the minority leader. The task force should also \n     be composed of three members appointed by the speaker of the \n     House, and two members appointed by minority leader in the \n     House. It is the sense of the Senate that the task force make \n     a report to the appropriate committees in Congress within 90 \n     days of being convened. The report should be available for \n     the purposes of consideration during comprehensive overhaul \n     of budget procedures.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, this amendment does not endorse any one \ncourse of action. It calls upon the Finance Committee to develop \nbipartisan legislation to reform the Medicare program. Congress should \nwork in a bipartisan fashion to extend the solvency of\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\nthe Medicare program and to ensure that benefits under that program \nwill be available to beneficiaries in the future. Congress should move \nexpeditiously to consider the bipartisan recommendations of the \nchairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of \nMedicare. It urges the President to work with the Congress in fixing \nthe problems in the Medicare program.\n  I thank my colleagues Senator Breaux, Senator Frist, Senator Kerrey, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Thompson, Senator Bob Graham, Senator Abraham \nas well as Senators Phil Gramm, Nickles, Grassley, Murkowski, and \nAshcroft for cosponsoring this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But people, before they praise what \nthe Bipartisan Commission has done, should understand the sick and \ndisabled are going to have to pay the most. Mr. President, 71 percent \nof all counties in this country have no HMOs whatsoever. The costs of \nbeneficiaries are going to go up.

The Senate will be in order. Senators will \ntake their conferences off the floor. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will continue by saying rural \nseniors and urban seniors are going to be hurt in this process because \nthere will be fewer physicians who are trained because the training of \ndoctors is completely removed from Medicare. It was turned over to the \nappropriators. I think you will see a diminution of personnel.\n  The numbers of uninsured seniors are going to be increased, some \nestimate by 1.4 million.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the course of the past 2 days of \ndebate, we have seen that there really are no additional funds in this \nbudget proposal before the Senate for the preservation of the financial \nsecurity of Medicare. But there are proposals for a tax cut of $778 \nbillion over the period of the next 10 years.\n  This amendment says we will take $320 billion of the amount that is \nreserved for the tax cut and use it for the financial security of \nMedicare. Effectively, we are saying, with the surplus, which \nrepresents the pay-ins by hard-working Americans--hard-working \nAmericans--that we are going to use that money for the preservation of \nMedicare, and then we can move ahead and really reform Medicare, and \ngive that a priority over tax cuts which are currently in the budget.\n  It is a simple question. Are we going to favor financial stability \nand security of Medicare or are we going to favor tax cuts? I say we \ncan do both, but let us do the financial security of the Medicare \nsystem first. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, this is an anti-tax-relief \namendment. Secondly, compared to the resolution, we increase taxes $320 \nbillion. And there is absolutely no relationship between this amendment \nand Medicare, no matter how much the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts wants to say that there is. There is no relationship. \nThis money sits around, can be spent. It is applied to the debt. We \nalready apply more of the surplus to the debt than the President did \nwith the Kennedy amendment. And last, we have already voted on it. We \nvoted on Conrad. It is almost identical.\n  Having said that, I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 242\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe it is now in order to consider \nan amendment previously offered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], for himself, and \n     Mr. Gorton, proposes an amendment numbered 242, as previously \n     offered.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this amendment relates to the education \nfunding included in this budget proposal. I have joined with other \nRepublican Senators in calling for an increase in Federal spending for \neducation and urging that those additional dollars go directly to the \nclassroom. This is a proposed sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and I am \noffering this measure with Senator Gorton. It is a measure which \nalready is at the desk.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this budget is very generous \nin terms of education, providing additional resources for the purpose \nof enhancing the capacity of our students to perform.\n  This budget provides, for instance, for my own State--I think if the \nmoney were to be divided equally between the States, Missouri would get \n$56 million next year, more than it gets now. Over the next 5 years, it \nwould get about $660 million more. So that is a substantial increase in \nthe resource.\n  I have joined with Senator Gorton of Washington to say that when we \nhave that kind of resource flowing to the States, it is important for \nus that this increased resource in Federal education dollars be \ndirected to the States and local schools out of the Federal budget and \nnot to the Federal bureaucracy.\n  You see, our intention with this resource is to elevate the capacity \nof students to perform, not to elevate the capacity or the propensity \nof the bureaucracy to intermeddle in directing, and sometimes \nmisdirecting, the resources that would otherwise be best directed at \nthe local level.\n  Our hope is that this additional resource will give States and local \ncommunities, will give teachers and principals, and will give people at \nthe classroom level--places where decisions can be made effectively \nabout allocation of the resources--the maximum flexibility to design \nand run education programs that will literally elevate performance of \nour students.\n  One of our Nation's highest priorities is that every child would have \nthe opportunity to receive the kind of challenging, rigorous education \nthat would prepare them for not only success personally, but would also \nprepare them as team members of Team U.S.A. to keep America where it \nought to be--leading the world.\n  Congress should develop and support Federal policy that will best \npromote education practices that succeed in our States and schools. \nSometimes those practices are different in one State than they would be \nin other States. So we really want to invite the States, the school \nboards, the parents, and the teachers, those whose children are in the \nschools, to participate in developing the right deployment of these \nresources--spending the money wisely in ways that will help the \nstudents.\n  Successful school systems are characterized by parental involvement, \nwhere parents really care, where parents get involved with the school \nsystem, where they energize their children, where they assign a high \nvalue to achievement in education. That is where our children soar. We \nshould have Federal policy that gives the parents, the schools, the \nschool boards, the school districts, the local governments, and the \nStates the right to tailor the expenditure of resources so as to meet \nthe needs of our children. Successful schools are also characterized by \nfundamental skills, excellent teachers, dollars spent in the classroom, \nand not dollars wasted in the bureaucracy. So many of our current \nFederal educational resources are misspent. They drive a demand for \npaperwork. They don't drive a demand for performance. They don't \ncontain elements that further our goal of giving our children a world-\nclass education. A number of our Federal education programs contain \nthese mountainous paperwork burdens--regulations and restrictions that \nhinder States' and local schools' ability to design programs.\n\n  Here are a couple of examples about the bureaucracy. Listen to these \nnumbers. They are almost mind staggering.\n  In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in State funds. So it \ntakes 374 to administer the $8 billion in State funds. However, there \nare 297 State employees needed to oversee only $1 billion in Federal \nfunds, six times as many employees, six times as much bureaucracy, six \ntimes as much administration per dollar of funds spent in Federal \ndollars as there are for State dollars.\n  I think if we want to avoid that kind of overlay of inefficiency, if \nwe want to avoid the weight of paper that is weighing down the \neducational system that keeps teachers writing reports to bureaucrats \ninstead of teaching our students, we ought to be working for this \namendment which says that resources should go to State and local \nefforts; they should be tailored to meet the needs of the schools and \nto elevate student performance. The enhanced resources in this bill \nshould not be devoted to the Federal bureaucracy where we have that 6-\nto-1 ratio demonstrated in the Florida experience where there are six \ntimes as many administrators for federal dollars as there are for State \ndollars.\n  The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours \nof paperwork each year just to receive the Federal dollars. That \ntranslates into the equivalent of 25,000 full-time employees every year \njust doing the paperwork. This bureaucratic maze for Federal education \nbureaucracy takes up to 35 percent of Federal education dollars.\n  If I were to hand my son $1 and before it got from my hand to his it \nchanged from $1 to 65 cents, I would hear about it. I would hear about \nit with justification--``You say you are giving me a dollar. You are \nonly giving me 65 cents.'' That is what has been happening with Federal \neducation dollars.\n  The Governors of the country know about it. That is why they were so \nadamant in unanimously supporting the Ed-Flex bill which we passed in \nthe Senate. Flexibility is important. That is what we would be \nproviding to support student achievement if we are able to support this \namendment.\n  A recent example of inflexible Federal funding is the $1.2 billion \nearmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for early elementary \ngrades. It may have been a noble aspiration, but it may not be what \nsome schools need.\n  Listen to what Gov. Gray Davis, a Democratic Governor of California, \nrecently said. He said it this way. His State had already achieved \nsmaller classroom sizes in the early grades and needed to use the new \nFederal funds for reducing class size in 10th grade math and English \nclasses. But no. The Federal bureaucrats and we, in conjunction with \nthem, said no; this is only to be used in another specific arena.\n  Let's give the flexibility to a school district, to the Governors, to \nteachers, to principals, to people at the local level. Let's give them \nthe flexibility to meet student needs instead of to satisfy the \nbureaucratic demand. Why should we handcuff States and local schools \nfrom using money in the way they best see fit?\n  According to the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress \nReading Report Card, nearly 40 percent of our fourth grade students \ncannot even read at a basic level. United States 12th graders \noutperformed only 2 out of 21 nations in mathematics on a recent Third \nInternational Math and Science Study Test.\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\n  The Brookings Institution has reported that public institutions of \nhigher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial \neducation for students who want to go to college. They have to have \nremedial work because it didn't happen at the elementary and secondary \nlevel.\n  Let's not continue to spend money, Federal funds, in the old way of \nrunning it through the bureaucracy, first shrinking it and then \nallowing it to go from the bureaucracy forward in ways that aren't \nserving students. We should direct any new and existing Federal \neducation resources to States and local schools to design and implement \neducation programs that work, and that they know can work, because they \nare working with the program. And they also know what programs they \nneed for their students.\n  When Governor Gray Davis said he didn't need the money for smaller \nclass sizes in early grades, he wasn't saying the program wouldn't \nwork. He is just saying we already did that; we need to use the \nresource for something else.\n  We cannot afford to keep spending our dollars in the same way that we \nhave been doing for years. A profound friend of mine said, ``Your \nsystem is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting. If you \ndo not like what you are getting, you had better change your system.''\n  We can't do it the same way. It has been giving us the wrong results. \nLet's let States and local communities decide how to spend dollars to \nimprove performance--not give us the same result but give us an \nelevated outcome.\n  I think we should give States and local schools the kind of \nflexibility they need to spend Federal dollars on programs that are \nneeded at the local level rather than programs that are mandated from \nthe bureaucracy. I think we need programs that boost student \nachievement, and that somehow foster academic excellence, giving local \nindividuals the right to deploy the resources to do that.\n  Under this approach, schools will be able to deploy resources to hire \nnew teachers and to raise teachers' salaries. They could buy textbooks, \nor new computers, enhance the library, or even build--do all kinds of \nthings, whatever they believe is most important in order to achieve \nthat fundamental goal that we will all agree we want to pursue: that \nis, elevated student performance.\n  That is what education is for--not for the bureaucracy in Washington. \nIt is not really even for the bureaucracies at the State level, or the \nschool boards, or even for the teachers. Our education effort is \ndesigned to elevate the performance and capacity to build the future of \nthe United States by enhancing the future of individual students.\n  In conclusion, parents, teachers, school boards, and administrators \nare in the best position to say what is needed. You wouldn't think of \ngoing to a doctor who is 1,000 miles away who is prescribing only one \nthing for all the people in the country regardless of their symptoms. \nWe would say that is the most foolish thing of all. Yet we go to the \nbureaucracy in Washington, have them prescribe what we are going to do \nwith our educational resources, no matter what the situation is in the \nState, or the school, or the local school area, or in the classroom. We \nneed the capacity to say, here is what is wrong. Let's make the \ndiagnosis at the local level, and then let's get at the problem at the \nlocal level.\n  We can provide those resources. The resources in this budget should \nbe devoted to that. Senator Gorton of Washington has been a champion of \nthis idea. Several years ago, really in a breakthrough in the Senate, \nwe voted for this concept, and it was on his motion that we did so. I \nam pleased to join with him in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Sessions as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. There may be others as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \njoin my colleague from Washington State, Slade Gorton, in making sure \nthat we give the Senate an opportunity to express itself clearly in \nfavor of the kind of funding for schools that boosts student \nachievement.\n\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is almost 35 years since Congress \npassed the first Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That marked a \nfundamental change in the relationship between the Federal Government \nand local school districts in the management of education policy. That \nact in 1965 was 30 pages long. Today the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act takes up 400 pages of our statute books. The regulations \npassed pursuant to that act and other education acts literally occupy \nthousands of pages of the Federal regulations.\n  For a third of a century, Washington, DC--often Congress but most \nparticularly the people who work in the Department of Education--has \nbeen dominated by the thought that centralized decisions and \ncentralized control exercised here in Washington, DC, was the best way \nto solve problems relating to the education of our young people.\n  Mr. President, 35 years of that experience has been demonstrably \nshown not to work. Test scores have not improved anything like the \ndegree that centralized control has been imposed from Washington, DC. \nIn addition, of course, the Congress has not really kept its promise \nwith respect to education. Only 7 or 8 percent of the money that our \nschools spend comes from appropriations from the Congress of the United \nStates, but a good 50 percent of the rules and regulations do. A failed \nexperiment should be abandoned, and we should try something else.\n  To focus on a particular incident in my own State of Washington, a \nteam of researchers at the University of Washington found that it \nwasn't more money that improved test scores in 26 elementary schools in \nSeattle. It was better people and more freedom. The schools that showed \nthe greatest improvements had principals who motivated teachers to work \ntogether, parents who cared and were involved, and the flexibility to \ndo things differently among these various schools. Those principals had \nmore control over the moneys that their schools spent, and it allowed \nthem to custom build programs tailored to their particular school's \nneeds.\n  The idea has caught on in my State to the point at which our Governor \nhas proposed the creation of ``opportunity schools,'' school districts \nthat would choose to send their funding directly to the schoolhouse and \nthus free themselves from many regulations at the State level.\n  This amendment, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, suggests that we \nhere in Washington, DC, abandon the failed pattern of more and more \nFederal rules and regulations and repose more trust in parents, in \nteachers, in principals, and in elected school board members all across \nthe United States.\n  My friend, the Senator from Missouri, dramatically illustrated how \nmuch more money goes into administration when you deal with Federal \ndollars than is the case with State dollars. He talked about the \nthousands of school employees throughout the United States who must \noccupy their time filling out Federal forms. We believe that we should \nprovide more in the way of dollars to our students across the United \nStates, and in fact, this budget resolution is far more generous than \nthe budget proposed by the President of the United States, but we \nbelieve that we should impose far fewer controls with those dollars and \nimpose more trust in those people who spend their full time caring \nabout the education of our children.\n  In the Presiding Officer's State of Ohio and in mine, Washington \nState, and the State represented by the Senator from Missouri, the \nelectors who were wise enough to elect us to this position are \ncertainly wise enough to elect school board members who care \npassionately about the kids in their school districts and about the \nsuccess of their education.\n  Later in this year, we will deal with the renewal of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. Then our voices and our votes will carry \neven more weight because we will be voting on real policies. In this \nbudget resolution, however, we are making a promise of more resources \nfor our schools and for our schoolchildren, and we should accompany \nthat promise with the promise to trust our parents and teachers and \nprincipals and school board members to spend that money wisely.\n\n[[Page S3356]]\n\n  The Senator from Missouri was very complimentary with respect to my \nefforts in this regard. Twice in the last 2 years the Senate has voted \nto move in exactly that direction. We have not yet been successful. We \nhave not gotten this all the way through Congress and past the \nPresident of the United States. In fact, the President's budget \nunderfunds the programs that we have already established without \nremoving the regulations that accompany those programs and establishes \na whole new series of categorical programs in which we tell the schools \nwhat their priorities ought to be and how they ought to spend their \nmoney.\n\n  What does that do in the real world? The Seattle Times recently \nreported remarks by the superintendent of the Snoqualmie Valley School \nDistrict, Rich McCullough, who said:\n\n       It's a little discouraging, but I think there is a lack of \n     trust implicit in almost all Federal funding programs we deal \n     with. They don't trust us to spend the money right, so they \n     force us to do whatever they think is best. It's not always \n     best for every school.\n\n  I think that Mr. McCullough knows more about what the students in the \nSnoqualmie Valley School District in Washington need and how the money \nhe has should be spent on their education than does any Member of \nCongress, myself included, or any bureaucrat in the Department of \nEducation in downtown Washington, DC.\n  Dwayne Slate, the executive director of the Washington State School \nBoard, made a similar point in a recent letter that he wrote to me:\n\n       At some point elected officials in Washington, DC simply \n     must trust local education officials to do what's in the best \n     interests of kids in their communities. We all have their \n     best interests at heart.\n\n  Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will follow that \nadvice and will allow these superintendents, these teachers, these \nparents, more in the way of decisionmaking authority as to the kids to \nwhom they are devoting their lives and their careers.\n\n  I have every hope that the Senate will accept this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  As has been pointed out by our friends and colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, the importance of providing resources and help and \nassistance to local communities and then having a degree of flexibility \nwithin those communities is basically a concept which this body has \ngone on record supporting as long as we have some accountability for \nthose funds. That is incorporated in the amendments which I cosponsored \nwith Senator Hatfield in 1994, providing States with flexibility, and \nnow we see that legislation is in conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We did not have the resolution of our friends until just a few \nmoments ago, but after a quick look at the sense-of-the-Senate, I urge \nour colleagues on this side to support it. The point that I think is \nalways well worth understanding is that education is basically a local \nresponsibility as has been pointed out by the two speakers on the other \nside of the aisle. Only about 5 to 6 cents out of every dollar that is \nspent locally comes from the Federal Government. The rest is raised \nlocally and by the States. So whatever success or failure we have out \nthere in local communities obviously is attributable to the local \ncommunities.\n\n  We have had some success. We have other challenges. What I think the \nAmerican people want today is a partnership between the local community \nand the State and the Feds to try to enhance academic achievement. What \nwe have heard from those schoolteachers and what we have heard from \nparents and what we have heard from students is a series of \nrecommendations. They had talked about smaller class size, better \ntrained teachers, afterschool programs. They talked about technology in \nthe classroom and some other recommendations--literacy programs as \nwell. That is what they have been telling us, and we have developed \nlegislative proposals to respond to those ideas.\n  I point out for the benefit of the Record that currently, according \nto the Department of Education--and I will include their study in the \nRecord--95 cents of every dollar is actually appropriated for local \nschools, 95.5 percent of the Federal funds actually go to local \ndistricts; a half of 1 percent stays at the Federal level, 4 percent \nstays at the State level.\n  So, this is a pretty good indication that whatever we do--and it is \nvery modest when you look at the Nation--it is getting to the \ncommunity. We can always do better with what we are providing there, \nbut we are, at least with regard to getting the funds into the local \ncommunities, doing pretty well, I think. It is certainly better than \nthe kind of bureaucracy that exists at the State level.\n  Having said that, we will have an opportunity this afternoon to do \nsomething which I consider to be very significant in the area of \neducation--a real choice. The proposal we have today indicates the \nimportance of supporting local desires and local interest in the \ncommunity, and I am certainly going to recommend we all support that. \nBut, later on this afternoon, we will have a measure which the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and I will send to the desk, and which we will vote \non, which will say: Let's really do something, provide some additional \nresources to help assist those local communities.\n  It is all nice and well to agree to a resolution that, as this \nresolution does, encourages further flexibility at the local level. We \nare going to embrace and support that. But we will have an opportunity \nthis afternoon to say the following: Before we have the tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest individuals, let us go ahead and fully fund the IDEA \nprogram at 40 percent.\n  We heard a great deal of debate about that in the earlier debate on \neducation. Now, this afternoon, we will have an opportunity to fully \nfund, at 40 percent, the IDEA program--the special needs programs of \nhelp and assistance for the local communities that have special needs \nchildren--and meet for the first time our responsibility of funding it \nat 40 percent, prior to the time we have tax breaks for the wealthy. \nThat will be the significance of the vote on our amendment this \nafternoon. We will say that we will support a program for smaller class \nsize from K-3, we will support the afterschool programs, we will as a \nresult of this particular amendment see an expansion of the Pell grants \nand an expansion of the work/study programs, and we will see an \nexpansion of the Head Start programs.\n\n  We are effectively saying, instead of $778 billion in tax breaks, we \nare going to take $156 billion of that over the next 10 years and put \nit where it will make a difference for children in our country at the \nlocal level, in the local community--in smaller class sizes, in helping \nand assisting in modernizing buildings, in upgrading the skills of our \nteachers, in effective afterschool programs, in additional technology, \nin helping and assisting in bringing the Pell Program up to date in a \nmore effective way, and in work/study programs which in many instances \nare used to expand literacy training and fund the literacy program.\n  It will be very easy later on this afternoon when we vote on this; \nthe choice will be very clear. After all the pronouncements, all the \nspeeches, all the declarations, all the press releases, this afternoon \nthis Senate will have an opportunity to say we are, over the next 10 \nyears, going to have the most serious support for local improvement, \nraising the standards of education, that we will have had in the last \n35 years. That will be before the Senate this afternoon in our \namendment.\n  There still will be ample resources, over $500 billion, that will be \navailable for the tax breaks.\n  So I hope when the time comes we will have the support of those who \nhave been speaking in support of local schools and districts involving \nparents, involving local decisions. I hope we are going to have their \nhelp and their support. Do they want to really put their vote where \ntheir voice has been and where their press releases have been in\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\nsupporting education? Or are they going to vote and say: We will do \nthat at another day, but I am going to vote for tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals? That is the choice. That will be the choice when the \nSenate considers the amendment that Senator Dodd and I will introduce \nat the first available opportunity.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, they are not here on the floor at this \nmoment, but let me say to my colleagues from Missouri and Washington, \nthat I appreciate the sense-of-the-Senate resolution in which they \ncalled for increased Federal funding for elementary and secondary \neducation to be directed to the States and local school districts, \ngranting decisionmaking authority in the hands of the States. I have no \ndifficulty with that assertion. But, as my colleague from Massachusetts \nhas just pointed out, there is not a single dime that flows to the \nStates as a result of this amendment.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, and the members of the committee, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, for earmarking additional funds for education. This was a \nlong overdue but welcome addition to the budget process. But, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts has pointed out, there are some significant \ndifferences in what we should do with those dollars because we are \ncompeting within the educational function, in effect, on some very \ncritical needs.\n  Many times Members stand on the floor of the Senate and tell you what \nmessage the American public may be sending. Two Senators can get up on \nthe same subject matter, take entirely different positions, and tell \nyou they are speaking on behalf of the American people. On education, \nMr. President, we hear one message. We hear, I think, very loudly and \nvery clearly, regardless of geography, economics, ethnicity, gender, or \nage, that education is a major concern of the American people. There \nhas been a deep and abiding appreciation throughout the long history of \nour Nation for the importance of education, the fundamental \nunderstanding that the subtleties of our democracy and our Constitution \ncan only be perpetuated in time because each succeeding generation is \nan educated generation. We prosper economically, we grow culturally and \nintellectually, because we are an educated people. That has been \ningrained from the founding days of this Republic.\n  Earlier today I heard our new colleague from Indiana give his maiden \nspeech on the floor of the Senate. It was a fine speech in which he \ntalked about this being the last budget of the 20th century. I would \nlike to take that in a different direction, in a sense, and remind our \ncolleagues, that this is the first budget of the 21st century. What we \nare adopting here today, tonight, or tomorrow by noon will be the first \nbudget that will apply to the first year of the coming millennium.\n  I suppose historians looking back, as they are apt to, will want to \nknow what we were saying about our society as we left the 20th century \nand began this new millennium. Where were our priorities? What was our \nagenda? What did we want to see envisioned for our country? Again, I \nthink the voice of the American public is pretty loud and clear and \npretty uniform on the issue that education ought to be paramount on our \nagenda.\n  For those reasons, the Senator from Massachusetts and I will offer an \namendment later today--we will not be able to debate it so we are doing \nit now--which will say that 80 percent of the tax cut that we are \ntalking debating today will stay in place, if, in fact, that is the \nwill of the majority. Twenty percent of that proposed tax cut we would \nlike to take and deal with the educational needs of America over the \nnext 10 years.\n  We would like to do something about the commitment we made almost a \ngeneration ago, when it came to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. I do not know of a mayor, Mr. President, or a Governor, \nI say to the Presiding Officer, who knows what I am talking about, in \nmy State or across the country, who has not begged me to do something \nabout us living up to that 40-percent level that we said we would \nfulfill when it came to the educational needs of special needs \nchildren.\n  We have gone from 8 to about 11 percent of special education funding. \nI offered an amendment 5 or 6 years ago, Mr. President, in the Budget \nCommittee, which I lost on a tie vote on the IDEA budget that would \nhave increased our commitment to special education.\n  What Senator Kennedy and I are offering this afternoon is an \nopportunity for us to do that over the next 10 years and fulfill that \ncommitment by merely saying, let's slightly modify the tax cut \nproposal. We are also proposing to take some of those funds, and apply \nthem to deal with the issue of class size--again, a subject matter that \nI think all Americans agree is important--to have an additional 100,000 \nteachers, to reduce the ratio of student to teachers in our classrooms; \nthus, obviously, as I think we all appreciate, increasing the \nopportunity for learning. Those are the two things we do in this \namendment we plan to offer.\n  There are other questions, obviously, including both school \nconstruction and student loans. The Senator from Massachusetts made \nreference to Pell grants. Does anyone doubt in the 21st century that \nthere is going to be an increasing cost in higher education for \nfamilies? What a signal to send on the first budget of the 21st century \nthat we recognize that need and that growing cost, and we are going to \ncommit some resources to provide for the higher educational cost needs \nof average American working families.\n  School construction: Again, it is incredible to me that in the most \naffluent nation in the world, we have school buildings that are falling \ndown within blocks of this building. Within blocks of where we are \nspeaking today, there are school buildings that were built in the early \npart of the 20th century, facilities in which we are training and \neducating young people who will be the leaders of the 21st century. We \nsomehow have not yet been able to find the resources to make sure those \nschools are going to be well constructed, are going to be wired with \nthe technology that they need.\n  The problem with the budget resolution that our good friend from New \nMexico and others have crafted is that while it increases spending for \neducation, it does so at the expense of the very programs I have just \nidentified, and others.\n  It says, in order to do that, we are going to take it from Head Start \nand higher education, and we are going to take it from other areas. \nFurther, it says we are not going to do something about special \neducation costs at the local community level.\n\n  So on the one hand, I commend my colleagues for raising the ante, if \nyou will, on education. Simultaneously, they are squeezing the other \nprograms that are absolutely critical, so that we can attempt to \nprovide for the educational needs of the Americans of the 21st century.\n  We have a way of paying for this. Again, I think our colleagues \nearlier today talked about a balance in this budget. There is a need \nfor tax cuts. I am looking forward to supporting some good tax cut \nproposals--child care, the marriage penalty tax, investment in small \nbusiness, innovation and technology, housing. I can think of a dozen \nareas where good, strong tax cuts make sense.\n  But that is not the only need in this country. There is a need to do \nsomething about the educational improvement of American schools. There \nis something valuable in assisting our communities and local \ngovernments with the cost of special education. What we will offer in \nour amendment will do that.\n  New school construction, classroom size, special education: why not \nalso provide for that and simultaneously provide the resources for some \nof the tax cuts people are proposing?\n  The resolution before us, the sense of the Senate which says we ought \nto do more about elementary and secondary education, if Senators vote \nfor that, and I hope they will, then they are going to get a chance \nmomentarily, right after that, to fulfill that commitment. Rarely do we \nget to do that. We make a promise with one resolution, and within \nminutes we will be given a\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\nchance to actually fulfill that commitment and that promise with the \namendment that we will offer.\n  We hope, Mr. President, that our colleagues will support the \nresolution by the Senator from Missouri. In doing so, we also hope that \nwhen the amendment is offered by the Senator from Massachusetts and \nmyself, to fulfill our commitment on IDEA and do something about \nclassroom size by reducing marginally the tax cut proposal, that we \nwill also put real dollars and real meaning behind the commitments made \nin the resolution before us.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment has 10 minutes 5 \nseconds, and the opponents, 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I will take the remaining 10 minutes.\n  First of all, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. today, all \nremaining debate time on the budget resolution be considered yielded \nback and, further, that the Senate proceed to a stacked series of votes \non the remaining pending amendments.\n  I further ask that the first vote be 15 minutes in length, with the \nremaining votes in the sequence limited to 10 minutes in length, with 2 \nminutes equally divided between each vote for brief explanations of the \namendments.\n\n  Finally, I ask that the votes alternate between Republican and \nDemocrat amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure I \nunderstood that correctly, Mr. President. Was that request, again, as \nof 4 to begin the process of serial votes?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Further reserving the right to object, Mr. President--\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I wanted to make a few comments on an amendment that the Senator from \nOregon and I have introduced already. It has already been brought up.\n  I wanted to offer a few words of explanation, because we think this \nis a very important amendment that would expand the reserve fund in the \nbudget resolution for Medicare and the prescription drug benefit \nprogram. Specifically, our amendment would allow for new tobacco taxes \nto be used as an offset for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit \nthat this reserve fund would create.\n  As I stated on the floor yesterday, I believe that one of the most \ncritical items included in this year's Senate budget resolution is the \nreserve fund for Medicare and prescription drugs. This reserve fund \nreceived support from virtually all the members of the committee, both \nDemocrats and most Republicans, which would address the prescription \ndrug benefit program by allowing the use of onbudget surpluses.\n  We know that the Bipartisan Commission did not report out a majority \nreport, but we do know that the Senate Finance Committee will be \nconsidering the Commission's recommendations nevertheless. So in this \nproposal, in the bipartisan resolution, it does include, in the reserve \nfund in the budget resolution, language that in the event that the \nSenate Finance Committee reports out a reform package of the Medicare \nprogram that extends the solvency of the program, then we would also \ninclude a prescription drug benefit program.\n  To the credit of the chairman of the Budget Committee, he proposed, \nwhen we were trying to work out exactly how this would be funded, \nwhether or not to use tobacco taxes or other sources of revenue, we \ndecided that the onbudget surplus was one means of supporting a \nprescription drug benefit program. But we also know that could also be \ntenuous depending on the surpluses that develop over the next 5 to 10 \nyears. We want to provide certainty to the funding of this prescription \ndrug benefit program.\n  So the Senator from Oregon and I have proposed an amendment that \nwould provide an additional means of funding for this prescription drug \nbenefit program so that we provide the continuity and the stability for \nfunding by raising tobacco taxes in order to fund the program.\n  In fact, the President includes a 55-cent tax increase in his own \nbudget for a tobacco tax increase. He talks about a prescription drug \nbenefit program but does not provide a plan nor does he provide any \nsources for funding. We think this is an important step forward.\n  I appreciate being able to work with the Senator from Oregon in a \nbipartisan fashion to address this most critical issue, critical \nproblem that is facing our Nation's senior citizens. Twelve percent of \nour Nation's elderly account for more than a third of the drug \nexpenditures that occur in this country. Clearly, it is a real problem \nfor seniors. It certainly is the black hole in the Medicare program \nbecause of the absence of support for a drug benefit program.\n  We want to provide the means by which it can happen and can happen \nthis year. So the reserve fund in the budget resolution, contrary to \nwhat has been said, does provide the means for a prescription drug \nbenefit program. If that reserve fund and that line item was not in the \nbudget resolution, we would have a 60-vote hurdle to bring it to the \nfloor.\n  So it guarantees the prospects of having a prescription drug benefit \nprogram with use of onbudget surpluses. We are just adding another \noption to the funding of that program because we think it is so \nimportant.\n  HCFA will say 65 percent of the Nation's elderly who are on Medicare \nhave support of prescription drug benefits through other insurance \npolicies. Well, not exactly. When you start to look at the Medigap \npolicies, the cost of the deductibles and the caps, it is a very \nexpensive proposition, and very few seniors have the option of using it \nin a way that can help them given the enormous costs that prescription \ndrugs represent to their families.\n  So we realize this is a necessity. That is why we wanted to develop \nthis bipartisan approach on funding, and ultimately the Senator from \nOregon and I are going to develop bipartisan legislation to move this \nprocess forward.\n  I want to yield to the Senator from Oregon, because I know there is \nvery little time left, to be able to address this issue as well. I \nthink it is important. It makes sense to use tobacco taxes. The \nColumbia University did a study on this issue.\n  And there is no question that tobacco-related illnesses has cost the \nMedicare program to a tremendous extent, in fact, more than $34 \nbillion. And 80 percent of the $32 billion in total substance abuse \ncosts in 1994 were as a result of tobacco-related illnesses, as this \nchart will illustrate right here. So $25 billion alone in 1994.\n  So Mr. President, there is no question that it makes sense to link a \ntobacco tax increase to financing a prescription drug program when you \nconsider the costs and the impact of tobacco-related illnesses on the \nMedicare program. And that is only going to get worse in the future.\n  Now I would like to yield to the Senator from Oregon for any comments \nhe would like to make on our amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague from Maine. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, whose time is being used now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senators have submitted an amendment, \nthey have 30 minutes as proponents on the amendment. The Chair has \naccepted the proposition that an amendment has been accepted.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, parliamentary point of inquiry. Which \namendment is, in fact, the amendment that is currently under controlled \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are more than 80 amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY. No. It is my understanding, Mr. President, that the \nAshcroft amendment is the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the last amendment that was proposed.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Ashcroft amendment is being debated under controlled \ntime; is that correct? There is a unanimous consent request as to the \norder of amendments. Excuse me. There is a unanimous consent order that \nhas set up the order of amendments now. So the order is the Ashcroft \namendment.\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\nSubsequent to the Ashcroft amendment, there is an additional Daschle \namendment, and then it is going back and forth. So we are on the \nAshcroft amendment. If debate on that is finished, under the consent \norder, we would move to a separate order. This amendment, if it is \nseparate, would not be in order at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If you will give me a moment, I have an inquiry. I \nask the Parliamentarian, is there a UC now that lists amendments in \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We did not get a UC.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Point of inquiry. Can I try to clarify this issue? If I \ncould have the attention of the Parliamentarian. As I understood, we \nhad the Ashcroft amendment. And then we had 12 minutes left on our \nside; 12 minutes on the other side. And as someone who was interested \nin our side, the Democratic side, I thought the Senator from Maine \nasked to take the 10 minutes--it was on the other side--to talk about \nan amendment that was going to come up, just as we talked about an \namendment we hoped would be considered later in the afternoon. I do not \nremember a consent request that we set that aside. I have been sitting \nhere, Senator Dodd has been sitting here, ready to debate the Ashcroft \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Further inquiry, Mr. President. Last night I stood here in \nthis very chair when the distinguished manager----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was not here.\n  Mr. REID. I was here.\n  Mr. KERRY. Senator Reid. And we propounded a unanimous consent \nrequest at that time which the Chair, in fact, did rule on, saying \nthere would be six amendments, three on each side; and the three on our \nside were specifically listed at that point in time. And I think the \ndistinguished minority whip will confirm what I am saying.\n\n  Mr. REID. There was an order entered last night with names of \nSenators on this side mentioned. Senator Domenici indicated he would \nfill in the names of the Republican Senators, for the three amendments \nto be offered on their side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President and Senators, I was not here, but I do \nnot challenge what anybody has said. Somebody else was here in my \nstead. I think it was--no. Was I here?\n  Mr. REID. You were here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. My recollection is getting weaker by the hour here.\n  Mr. DODD. Join the club.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But if you let me try to fix it, just give me a moment.\n  How much time is left on the amendment that is known as the Ashcroft-\nGorton?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes to the sponsors and 11\\1/\n2\\ minutes to the opponents----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the argument?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Ashcroft amendment. So we are still on \nAshcroft.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They are supposed to have that time. Why not give them \nthat time? What is wrong with that?\n  Mr. KERRY. The Snowe amendment is a separate amendment, and not in \norder.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could you clarify, what is the status of Senator \nSnowe's amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There have been submitted in excess of 80 \namendments. Under the Senate's precedents, each of those amendments can \nbe brought up on the call of the regular order.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. She did not ask for regular order. Her amendment isn't \npending. Is it pending or not?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is what we are trying to get to right \nnow.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we ask Senator Snowe, what do you desire to do? \nDo you want to talk about your amendment?\n  Ms. SNOWE. That is correct. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I want to talk about \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long would you like to talk about your amendment?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Not too much longer, perhaps another 10 minutes. The \nSenator from Oregon could finish up his remarks and then any concluding \nremarks.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes between the two Senators?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think we can be finished with this in \nprobably 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Maine and I, as well as our colleague from \nMassachusetts, have been here for the last few hours. If I had 10 \nminutes and Senator Snowe could wrap up briefly, we could be done.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will make time for you.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am absolutely confident that we can work \nthis out appropriately with the help of the distinguished manager. I \nmake it clear that no call for regular order was made. We were in the \nmiddle of the process of debating the Ashcroft amendment which is under \ncontrolled time. In the course of that debate of controlled time, the \nSenator from Maine--and I have no objection to this--stood up to speak \non a separate amendment without calling for regular order.\n  So that is not the pending business before the Senate.\n  Now, I am delighted to have the Senator from Maine and the Senator \nfrom Oregon be able to debate their amendment, but there is, in fact, \nan order setting up a line of amendments here.\n  I am happy to enter into a new unanimous consent agreement that \nadequately protects those people in line and the time of the Senator \nfrom Maine's, and then we can proceed. I would be willing to lift my \nobjection to having the serial votes follow at that point in time. I do \nthink we ought to follow the procedures of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nSnowe and Wyden be permitted to speak without calling up their \namendment for 15 minutes, after which time the regular order will be \nthe Ashcroft amendment, which will then vest in the respective Senators \nthe remaining time under the hour that they had. As soon as that is \nover, we will proceed with the Daschle-Dorgan amendment, and they will \nhave 1 hour equally divided, after which we will move to a Republican \namendment for Grams-Roth, which will be one half-hour equally divided. \nThen we will have Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts to follow that \nwith one half-hour equally divided.\n  We can stay on that path for just a while and then we will do \nsomething else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time on the pending Ashcroft amendment?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we just entered into a unanimous consent \nagreement. What do we need the Parliamentarian for? He can sit there. \nSenators Snowe and Wyden are to proceed under the UC now for 15 \nminutes, and we just stated what is to follow.\n  You don't have to ask the Parliamentarian anything; just call on \nSenator Snowe.\n  You are the Parliamentarian; you run the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair rules that we will have 15 minutes \ndivided between the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Oregon.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague from Maine \nand say that the reason we have come to the floor at this time is there \nwould be an opportunity today for the Senate, after all of the \nfrustrations surrounding the Medicare Commission, to take a major step \nforward in the cause of Medicare reform, and finance it in a \nresponsible way.\n  What the Senator from Maine and I have done, both in the Budget \nCommittee and with this amendment, is sought to ensure that the Senate \nwould have an opportunity in this bipartisan amendment to ensure for \nthe first time in this session the Senate could make a significant \naddition to the Medicare program: Start covering prescription drugs for \nvulnerable older people and pay for it in a responsible fashion.\n  More than 20 percent of the Nation's elderly spend over $1,000 a year \nout of pocket on their prescription medicine. These are older folks who \nare walking on an economic tightrope. They balance their food bills \nagainst their medical bills, their medical bills\n\n[[Page S3360]]\n\nagainst their housing expenses, and many of these older people end up \nwith a prescription that would involve their taking three pills a day \nwhich they cannot afford. So they end up taking two pills at the \nbeginning and then maybe they take one. They get sicker. As a result, \nthis country's inability to finance prescription drug coverage for \nolder people under Medicare, this results in a lot of those older folks \nhaving to face hospitalizations, unnecessary surgeries, institutional \nhealth care.\n\n  The reason Senator Snowe and I have acted as we have: First, to \nensure that part of the onbudget surplus could be used for this \nadditional benefit; and, second, to raise the opportunity for \nadditional revenue through new tobacco taxes. We believe that a \nsignificant portion of Medicare expenses are due to tobacco-related \nillnesses. In fact, the evidence shows that perhaps 15 percent of all \nMedicare costs are tobacco related.\n  In this amendment we have provided a two-step process for ensuring \nthat we will have the opportunity to finance a decent pharmaceutical \nbenefit for low-income older people. The first is the proposition that \nmany Democrats have felt strongly about, and that is to ensure that a \nportion of the onbudget surplus could be used for this benefit. Second, \nwe have felt that it may take additional funds, which is why we are \nsaying that the Senate Finance Committee would have the opportunity, \nshould they choose to do so, to add to the reserve fund money that \nwould come from a new tobacco tax.\n  I believe, having seen the frustrations of the Medicare Commission \nand their inability to come up with a bipartisan agreement, the Snowe-\nWyden amendment, the amendment that we will vote on today, is a major \nstep forward.\n  When we talk with our older constituents, they tell us that the great \ngap today in Medicare is prescription drugs. More than 37 percent of \nolder people are responsible for their prescription drug bill. On \naverage, they pay twice as much as those without coverage. The AARP has \nestimated that fee-for-service beneficiaries with annual incomes below \n$10,000 are estimated to be spending about 10 percent of their entire \nincome on prescription drugs.\n  I am very pleased to have a chance, after some of the bickering that \nhas surrounded this Medicare issue, to come to the floor of the Senate \ntoday and say that with the Snowe-Wyden amendment we are in a position \nto add coverage for the vulnerable older people of this country and to \npay for it in a responsible way.\n  Many of our colleagues know that Medicare offers very little in the \nway of preventive benefits. We have finally been able to add some \nmammography coverage, some coverage for those with diabetes. But the \nfact of the matter is, this drug coverage benefit is perhaps the next \nbest step we can take in terms of preventive health care.\n  What we are seeing with these new drugs and new therapies, they are \nabsolutely key to keeping older people out of the hospital, to making \nsure we are avoiding unnecessary surgeries. I submit that this \nlegislation, which meets an enormous need in our country, is also a \nmajor step forward in terms of preventive health services.\n  I know that there are going to be some on the Republican side and \nsome on the Democratic side who will say that this is not perfection in \nterms of Medicare reform. Well, I would agree with that. But I also say \nthat the opportunity to take a major step now to helping those 20 \npercent of the Nation's senior citizens who pay more than $1,000 out of \npocket for their prescription drugs is certainly an opportunity that \nthe Senate should move to take advantage of.\n  It isn't a perfect amendment. The Senate Finance Committee is going \nto have an opportunity to make refinements in it. But for the \nvulnerable older people, 37 percent of the Nation's elderly that are \nresponsible for their prescription drug bill, this is going to mean \nthat some of those folks are actually going to be able to pay for three \npills a day when the doctor tells them that is needed.\n  I want to wrap up by thanking my colleague from Maine. She, like \nmyself, has worked on this issue for many years--really, since our \nHouse days. I am so pleased that now we can, after there have been the \nfrustrations surrounding the Medicare Commission, come to the floor of \nthe Senate with a significant Medicare reform that is responsibly \nfinanced. We got a 21-1 vote in the Senate Budget Committee, and the \naddition that we have made today, with the opportunity for additional \nrevenue to be generated for this program with any new tobacco tax, is \nanother step forward.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine for this time. I know she would like \nto wrap up, and I tell her I very much appreciate the opportunity to, \nwith her, address Medicare reform now in a bipartisan fashion and to \nmeet the needs of some of the Nation's most vulnerable citizens, our \nelderly. I thank her for this time to speak.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleague, Senator \nWyden, for his leadership on this issue, not only here in the Senate, \nbut as he referred to, during our days in the House of Representatives. \nI know he has worked considerably on the issues of senior citizens in \nthis country, and in his service on the Aging Committee as well in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I want to also commend the chairman of the Budget Committee because \nat a time when I was discussing the idea of creating a reserve fund for \nthe prescription drug benefit program, Senator Domenici came up with \nthe idea of including onbudget surpluses of which there is probably \nmore than $132 billion estimated over the next 5 years, and that that \ncould be a potential source for funding for the prescription drug \nmanagement program.\n  So this amendment is to build on that leadership, to ensure that \nthere will be continuity and funding in the event that those surpluses \ndo not materialize. Also, this is a carrot-and-stick approach because \nthe reserve fund in the budget resolution includes a prescription drug \nbenefit program contingent on a reform package being passed out by the \nSenate Finance Committee that extends the solvency of the Medicare \nprogram.\n  We think that is important, but we don't want to overlook the \nsignificance of providing this benefit to senior citizens because it \nhas constituted a crisis in this country for our Nation's elderly, \nwithout a doubt. As Senator Wyden has indicated, it has consumed most \nof their income when it comes to the cost of prescription drugs. We \nthink it is an appropriate linkage between a tobacco tax increase and \nthe impact on the Medicare program. Again, if you look at this chart, \n$25 billion is the cost to the Medicare program in 1995 as a result of \ntobacco-related illnesses. Well, if you take that even further, it \nrepresents 14 percent of Medicare costs in that year alone. That is all \ngoing to grow exponentially. It will get worse. It could be more than a \n$400 billion problem over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\n  So that is why it is important, I think, to look at the source of \nrevenue through a tobacco tax increase, in the event the surpluses \ndon't materialize, but that we have a permanency in terms of coverage. \nThat is what we are attempting to do in this amendment. That is why we \nthink it is so important because to do otherwise is failing to \nacknowledge the reality of the impact of not having this kind of \nbenefit program currently in the Medicare system.\n  Finally, I should say, Mr. President, that in the reserve fund in the \nbudget resolution we prohibit any transfer of IOUs to the Medicare \nprogram. We do not artificially address the Medicare program. We are \ndoing it in a real way, and that is also the case with the prescription \ndrug benefit program.\n  I might also just mention, in talking about Medicare, as one quote \nthat came out of the President's book--the OMB fiscal year 2000 \nbudget--what it said with respect to the President's Medicare proposal \nis:\n\n       Trust fund balances are available to finance future benefit \n     payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a \n     bookkeeping sense. . . . They do not consist of real economic \n     assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. \n     Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, \n     will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the \n     public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The \n     existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, \n     by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay \n     benefits.\n\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\n\n  What that means, in a nutshell, is that the President's proposal, \ncontrary to what is suggested on the floor, isn't putting a penny of \nreal money into these programs, and the same is true for the \nprescription drug benefit program. They talk about the State of the \nUnion Address, but did not propose a plan, did not provide one penny \nfor a prescription drug benefit program. The budget resolution, on a \nbipartisan basis--21-1--supported the reserve fund I offered with the \nonbudget surpluses to pay for it. That is a step in the right direction \nthat is going to ensure that the Nation's senior citizens have that \nbenefit. In addition, on this amendment offered by the Senator from \nOregon and myself, I should also mention that Senator Smith from Oregon \nis a cosponsor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for yielding. I want to come back to \nhow bipartisan this amendment has been----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. In a moment, I will. In the Budget Committee, this \nreceived a 21-1 vote. Suffice it to say, for an issue that has been \nthis controversial, which generated so much discussion in the Medicare \nCommission, to be able to come to the Senate today with a 21-1 vote \nfrom the Senate Budget Committee and then to take the additional step \nthat the Senator from Maine and I and many of our other colleagues have \ntaken, like Senator Kennedy who has fought this battle valiantly for so \nmany years--we have now taken the additional step of saying that any \nnew tobacco tax money could be used for this program, and that strikes \nme as the kind of bipartisan work that the Senate ought to be doing. It \nwould be one thing if this was a narrowly fought battle in the Senate \nBudget Committee. Instead, we got a 21-1 vote.\n\n  Now we come to the Senate floor and say that onbudget surpluses could \nbe used to finance this program for the vulnerable, No. 1. The second \nis to say that any new tobacco tax revenue could be generated for this \nprogram. That is the kind of bipartisan approach we ought to be taking. \nI thank my colleague from Maine. I know my friend from Massachusetts \nwants to speak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask a question, please? On this trust fund, the \nreserve fund, on page 90, which describes the fund, there are also the \nwords that the committee report would not allow the reserve to be \nfunded by the intergovernmental transfers. That would be the part that \nthe President talked about--any of the funding from the surpluses. And \nthen, on page 90, it indicates that you can't have the funds from other \nrevenues, as it talks about being adjusted for legislation that extends \nthe solvency of the fund.\n  How are we going to extend the solvency without additional funds in \norder to trigger this program? You have the solvency mentioned, and 9 \nyears and 12 years. We don't want to create a program that says we are \ngoing to do something on prescription drugs and then, on the other \nhand, which says we are only going to do it if we extend solvency, and \nthen we don't have additional funds to extend solvency. I am interested \nin what kind of a commitment or promise this is really going to be.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the answer to the Senator's question is, \nthat is occurring through the Part A program of Medicare. The \nprescription drug benefit will be in Part B of the program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The provision here talks about now allowing transfer of \nnew subsidies from the general fund. That is not applicable to Part B. \nIt says right here on page 90. That is prohibited without the use of \ntransfers of new subsidies from the general fund. And it also talks \nabout prohibition of intergovernmental transfers.\n  Can the Senator tell us how she foresees the solvency being worked \nout, if it isn't going to be higher premiums, or reduced benefits?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time that has been allocated to the \nSenator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask for a minute so the Senator can respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, if I may respond, I would be glad to \nrespond. We are not proposing any reforms to solvency. That will be \ndetermined by the Senate Finance Committee with respect to Part A. With \nrespect to the prescription drug benefit program, that would come under \nPart B. And that is why we will be using onbudget surpluses, plus the \ntobacco tax increase, if it is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, Mr. President, to the Parliamentarian, I \napologize for my statements a while ago. I guess I have been here too \nlong.\n  Anyhow, let me see who is under the order. Is not the Daschle \namendment up? We understand there is time remaining on other \namendments. That is bothering you. So why don't we just say whatever \ntime remains on amendments that have been set aside, or otherwise are \nnot disturbed, by unanimous consent will not be changed or altered by \nsetting them aside, reserving that time, and going to the Daschle \namendment as ordered a few moments ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Daschle-Dorgan. There was a unanimous consent \non three amendments that are going to be made, and this is the \nbeginning of that with the Daschle amendment. The clerk will report \nthat amendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry: After the amendments are called up, \nare you going to ask unanimous consent that they be entered?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have just been back here now \ndistracted. Are we going to just finish up now the amendment? We have \nbeen here with Senator Dodd all during the lunch hour since 1 o'clock, \nwhich I am glad to do to accommodate others. And the chairman has been \nenormously accommodating. But I thought we would have Senator Dodd \nnext. Senator Murray is here and wanted to speak. Senators Harkin and \nDodd wanted to speak on it and to do the last 10 minutes. The chairman \nhas been extremely courteous in accommodating everyone's interest. Both \nof them are here. What I would like to do is to have some idea.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What amendments are they speaking to?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Ashcroft. We have 10 minutes remaining on the Ashcroft \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's recollection is that there was a \nunanimous consent ordered to give the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Oregon 15 minutes, and then we would proceed under an \norder in regard to specific amendments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Regular order is the Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Ashcroft is pending.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is the pending amendment. I think the \nParliamentarian will agree.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if there is any confusion, might I \nmodify the previous unanimous consent request and say that there are 10 \nminutes remaining on each side on the Ashcroft amendment, 10 under the \ncontrol of Senator Kennedy, 10 under the control of Senator Ashcroft, \nand that we proceed to do that now, and then follow the sequence that \nwe just agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. We will \nproceed. There being no objection, the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, before the body at this time is an amendment on \neducation. We have heard from this floor many times over the course of \nthis Congress that education is a priority. And that is a fact; it is a \npriority here in the Senate. I am delighted to say that. It is \ncertainly a priority for thousands of families across the country who \nhave children in school who want them to get a good education. But it \nis also a priority for many businesses who want to make sure that we \nare educating young people today in order to give them the skills they \nneed to be able to hire them. It is a priority for our police officers \nand the community leaders, because they know that investing in \neducation and making sure that young people get what they need in our\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\nschools means the safety, the health, and the viability of our country \nfor many years to come.\n  The pending amendment talks about education. But talking about \neducation is not what our constituents are asking for. They are asking \nfor us to invest in education. We can all talk about quality, but \nunless we provide the resources for those schools out there, we will \nnot be providing them with the kind of education they have to have in \norder for our country to be strong in the future. The amendment that my \ncolleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd, have introduced offers us \na way to do that.\n  Too often on this floor we have set up challenges between different \nfunding. We can either support IDEA funding for special education, or \nwe can support teacher quality, or class size. The amendment that \nSenator Kennedy will offer at a later time provides us with the \nalternative to make sure that we do provide the funds for special \neducation under IDEA and complete the promise we have made to young \nstudents and teachers and communities to reduce class size. It simply \nsays that this is an investment we are going to make.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will make a \ndifference in our classrooms across this country.\n  Mr. President, too often we are told that we are providing a tax cut \nand returning money to the people. I can think of no better way to \nreturn money to our constituents than by investing it in education so \nthat our young people get the skills they need, so they can get jobs \nand become a viable part of our economy in the future. A budget is not \njust about putting dollars out there today, it is making good \ninvestment so that our budgets will be strong in the future.\n\n  That is why I am going to support the Kennedy amendment, which gives \nactual real resources to our students, and not just another empty \npromise and another way of moving bureaucratic paper around.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield my time back to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to just mention to the Members again what we \nare basically talking about is funding, meeting our responsibility \nunder IDEA, which this Nation is committed to offer the next 10 years, \nand also funding the smaller class program and providing a significant \nincrease in the Head Start Program, the Pell grants, the work/study \nprograms, afterschool programs, school dropout programs.\n  These are the groups that support our program: American Association \nof School Administrators, the National Education Association, Parent-\nTeachers, Council of Greater City Schools, Chief of State School \nOffices, Federation of Teachers, Committee on Education Funding, the \nNational Parent Network on Disabilities, the Disability Rights \nEducation Fund, Easter Seals, Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, \nNational Federation of Children with Special Needs.\n  Virtually every children's group and every education group \nunderstands that this is our best opportunity in this Congress to \nreally make a downpayment in terms of the partnership among local, \nState, and Federal in terms of enhancing academic achievement and \naccomplishment in the schools across our country.\n  We have a chance now to fulfill our commitments that we have all made \nin statements and speeches and press releases to do something now. That \nis what this vote is about. It says we will fund these programs before \nwe go for tax breaks for wealthy individuals. That is the choice. It is \nas clear as can be. That is what the issue is. We are hopeful that we \nwill get strong support for that program.\n  Mr. President, I yield what time remains to my colleague and \ncosponsor, Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a letter that I think the Presiding \nOfficer will be very familiar with. This is a letter from the National \nGovernors' Association.\n  Let me quote this letter, if I may. So my colleagues will be aware, \nthis is signed by Michael Leavitt, Republican Governor of Utah; Mike \nHuckabee, Republican Governor of Arkansas; Tom Carper, Democratic \nGovernor of Delaware; and Jim Hunt, Democratic Governor of North \nCarolina. They say in their letter to us, to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, ``Governors urge Congress to live up to the agreements \nalready made to meet current funding commitments'' regarding education \nbefore adopting ``new initiatives or tax cuts in the Federal budget.''\n\n  It goes on in the letter to say that they are already cutting \nexisting funds locally to provide for special needs students. They are \nasking unanimously, Democratic and Republican Governors across this \ncountry, to do exactly what Senator Kennedy and I will be asking our \ncolleagues to do in the amendment when we vote on it, and that is to \nplace the special education needs of children ahead of a tax cuts. Our \ncommitment to special education ought to come before tax cuts. There \nwill still be plenty of room financially for the tax cuts. But here is \nMike Leavitt, Mike Huckabee, Tom Carper, and Jim Hunt speaking on \nbehalf of the National Governors' Association telling us to fund IDEA \nbefore enact tax cuts. What clearer message could we have?\n  I hope our colleagues today, after they vote on the Ashcroft \namendment and say that we ought to provide more for education, and then \nquickly thereafter have a chance to vote on the Kennedy-Dodd amendment, \nwill remind themselves--and I will see that each Member gets a copy of \nthe NGA letter regarding IDEA funding--to live up to the commitment in \nthe Ashcroft amendment by fulfilling the request of the National \nGovernors' Association to support this program as crafted by this \namendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 5 seconds to the opponents and \n10 minutes to the proponents.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I do not know if there are--Senator Harkin \nof Iowa wanted to be heard, but I don't see him in the Chamber at this \ntime. I don't know, are there any further requests for time on this \nside?\n  We reserve the remainder of our time, unless the distinguished \nchairman of the committee wants to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to argue for 2 minutes and yield back the \nremainder of my time so we can get going. If Senator Harkin isn't here, \nI hope Senators will cooperate with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that a Governor \noccupies the Chair while I make this statement.\n  Those Governors are friends of ours. The Republicans have been \nincreasing the funding for special education. We do not need a lecture \nfrom the Governors about it. What we need is help from the Democrats \nwho have resisted it every time. The President didn't even put an \nincrease in his budget last year. We put the whole increase in. I don't \nremember if he did much this year, but it is mighty small. It is \nSenator Judd Gregg and others who have been leading the parade around \nhere on IDEA.\n  Now, frankly, we would like to ask those Governors who signed that \nletter, would you like us to cut the extra $3 billion in this budget \nthat we put in and the extra $27 billion that we put in here? If you \nwould like that cut, we will make room for more IDEA money for you. \nThat is an increase in education, and it is left up to the committees \nto do what they would like, except we would like to make a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution binding, adopted by us, that says, let's reform \nthe Federal program and let's make sure that they are more responsive \nby focusing them in at the local level with local control.\n  Now, we ought to pass that, because it is time we reform it. There is \nno IDEA issue in this amendment. They are going to raise IDEA in a \nlater amendment. They are going to raise something on special \neducation.\n  So with that, I wish their amendment well when they bring it up. It \nis high time that they are for significantly increasing funding under \nspecial education, but for now we have raised it and we ask that the \nlocal control be attached to that with one of the qualities being that \nit be accountable, that there be accountability in those laws.\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\n  I yield back the remainder of time so we can move on.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. DODD. We have more time remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Ashcroft amendment is a sense-of-the-\nSenate. Our amendment is real dollars, real dollars. We are saying fund \nthe education programs before the tax cut. That is what the issue is. I \nam interested in what the Governors say, but I care most about those \nparents who are supporting this program. Every child group, every \neducation group supports it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to my good friend from New \nMexico, I served on the Budget Committee for a number of years. Back in \n1992 or 1993, I offered the IDEA amendment. I lost on a tie vote. I \nmust say, the majority leader, Trent Lott, a member of the Budget \nCommittee, voted with me. That was the only vote I got on the other \nside, so I lost on the tie vote. The amendment failed. I commend the \nchairman and others who have wanted to increase this. We have funded \nIDEA at about $500 million a year. I think there is $500 million this \nyear, I say to the chairman of the committee, on the IDEA funding. They \ndeserve credit for doing that.\n\n  What we are saying here is that we have all tried different ways over \nthe last number of years. I don't think you necessarily want to turn \naround and say to Head Start or to Pell grants or to school \nconstruction, fine, you can do IDEA but we are going to cut your \nbudget.\n  We are not saying that. We are saying, look, with an $800 billion tax \ncut, that is a big tax cut, keep 80 to 85 percent of the tax cut; how \nabout 10 or 15 percent of that to do what the Governors have asked us \nto do here? That is specifically what we have said. Do this before you \ndo the tax cut.\n  All we are suggesting is their request is well founded. When \nRepublican and Democratic Governors ask the Congress to set some \npriorities so they can have the resources to do the job, I think we in \nthis body ought to take note of it. That is the reason I offer the \nargument.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nNational Governors' Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you prepare the budget resolution for \n     the coming fiscal year, the nation's Governors urge Congress \n     to live up to agreements already made to meet current funding \n     commitments to states before funding new initiatives or tax \n     cuts in the federal budget.\n       The federal government committed to fully fund--defined as \n     40 percent of the costs--the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA) when the law, formerly known as \n     Education of the Handicapped Act, was passed in 1975. \n     Currently, the federal government's contribution amounts to \n     only 11 percent, and states are funding the balance to assist \n     school districts in providing special education and related \n     services. Although we strongly support providing the \n     necessary services and support to help all students succeed, \n     the costs associated with implementing IDEA are placing an \n     increased burden on states.\n       We are currently reallocating existing state funds from \n     other programs or committing new funds to ensure that \n     students with disabilities are provided a ``fee and \n     appropriate public education.'' In some cases, we are taking \n     funds from existing education programs to pay for the costs \n     of educating our students with disabilities because we \n     believe that all students deserve an equal opportunity to \n     learn. Therefore, Governors urge Congress to honor its \n     original commitment and fully fund 40 percent of Part B \n     services as authorized by IDEA so the goals of the act can be \n     achieved.\n       This is such a high priority for Governors, that at the \n     recent National Governors' Association Winter Meeting, it was \n     a topic of discussion with the President as well as the \n     subject of an adopted, revised policy attached. Many thanks \n     for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Thomas R. Carper.\n     Gov. James B. Hunt, Jr.,\n                              Chair, Committee on Human Resources.\n     Gov. Michael O. Leavitt.\n     Gov. Mike Huckabee,\n                         Vice Chair, Committee on Human Resources.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield back the remainder \nof our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 178, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Daschle amendment?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have 1 hour \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That amendment is an amendment that I have introduced \nwith a number of my colleagues, including Mr. Daschle. So let me begin \nby describing the amendment and the reason that we are here. I will \nthen call on my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, Senator \nDaschle, and others.\n  Mr. President, first, let me tell you that I am offering an amendment \nfor my colleagues to try to strengthen rural America, and to try to \nprovide some better price supports for family farmers.\n  I want to tell you about a 90-year-old woman I talked to this \nmorning. Her name is Margaret Hansen. A few weeks ago, Margaret, age \n90, got in her car in the rural part of North Dakota and got stuck in a \nsnow bank. This 90-year-old lady got out of her car and began to walk. \nShe walked a mile and a half when her legs gave out. Then this 90-year-\nold woman began to crawl on this gravel road. She crawled for a half \nmile, and then she couldn't crawl any longer. She laid there huddled on \nthat road apparently for about 8 hours before someone came along in a \npickup truck and stopped to wonder what was lying on the road. He found \nthis 90-year-old woman. She wasn't dead. They took her to a hospital.\n  I am happy to report that Margaret is doing quite well. She said to \nme, yeah, I am doing fine, but my legs aren't so good. She was \nremarkably upbeat.\n  Why would it take 7 or 8 hours before a 90-year-old woman is found \nlying on a gravel road in the middle of winter? That's because there \naren't many people living in rural America anymore.\n  I want to show you a chart. This chart shows, blocked out in red, the \ncounties in this country that are losing population. If you look at the \nfarm belt in the Great Plains, up and down the middle part of America, \nyou will see a part of our country that is being depopulated. And some \nof these counties have lost half their population in a relatively short \nperiod of time.\n  Now, why is that? The overriding reason is we have a farm program \nthat doesn't work. We have a farm program that doesn't allow family \nfarmers to stay on the land and work the land. We have a miserable farm \nprogram that pulls the rug out from under family farmers.\n  Let me show you a chart that shows what has happened to the price of \nwheat. The price of wheat has dropped 53 percent since the passage of \nthe farm law. It was $5.75 a bushel. Last, month prices received by \nfarmers nationwide average $2.72. Now, ask yourself, if instead of the \nprice of wheat it were your salary or your profit, your wages, your \nminimum wage, your Social Security check, were cut in half? If this was \nyour income, how do you think you would be doing?\n  We have folks in the Senate who said some years ago within budget \ndebate that we are going to change the farm program. In making those \nchanges, in essence they told rural America that they were going to \npull the rug out from underneath family farmers. They were going to \nhave farmers operate in the marketplace and, when prices collapse, the \nnation won't care. If farmers go out of business, they wouldn't care. \nThey basically said they don't care whether there are family farmers in \nthis country's future. Boy, you talk about a wrongheaded public policy \nfor America. That was it.\n  What my colleagues and I are suggesting today is that it is time to \ndecide that family farmers matter in this country. It is time to \nprovide the resources to get some price protection so that when \ncommodity prices collapse, those folks operating out on America's farms \nhave the underpinnings so that\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\nthey are going to be able to get across those price valleys. That way, \nthey will be able to continue working the land, continue a rural \nlifestyle. Other countries do it. But, our country has decided that, \ngee, if things are fine on Wall Street, they are fine everywhere.\n  That is not true. This country has a very strong economy. Things are \ngoing well in this country. But our family farmers face a very serious \ncrisis. This is a serious emergency on the family farm, and we must do \nsomething to respond to it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask my friend if he will yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might say to Senators, we have been working on this \nfor a long time. We will see if we can't put ourselves in a position \nwhere we might finish a little earlier, perhaps even tonight. I am not \nsure. This has been worked out by the majority leader, minority leader, \nand those of us on the floor. I assume there has been consultation \nelsewhere.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader I ask unanimous \nconsent that following the previously allotted debate times, the \nfollowing debate times be in order: Hollings amendment on debt \nreduction; Craig amendment No. 146; Durbin amendment, emergencies; \nCrapo amendment No. 163; Boxer amendment No. 175; Sessions amendment \nNo. 210--I ask each of the above-listed amendments be limited to 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes equally divided in the usual form. I ask unanimous consent \nthat, following the conclusion of those debates, I be recognized in \norder to yield back all remaining debate time on the budget resolution.\n  Therefore, the Senate will then proceed to a stacked series of votes \non the remaining pending amendments. I further ask that the first vote \nbe 15 minutes in length, with remaining votes in sequence limited to 10 \nminutes each, with 2 minutes equally divided between each vote for \nbrief explanations of the amendments.\n  Finally, I ask the votes alternate between Republicans and Democrat \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me continue briefly and then call on \nmy colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, and I believe the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, will be here as well.\n  Imagine for a moment that corporate profits were cut by 50 percent, \nor 75 percent, or 90 percent, as farm income was cut one year recently \nin my State. Imagine what would happen in this country if that were the \ncase, and corporate profits were slashed. We would have an apoplectic \nseizure here in Congress trying to figure out what happened and what \ncan we do about it.\n  The question is what do we do about the economic all-stars, the \nfamilies out there on our family farms that produce, raise crops, and \ntake the risks? What about when their income collapses? Again, we have \npeople here who say that doesn't matter and that corporations can farm \nAmerica from the California coast to Maine. It doesn't matter, they \nsay. I cannot describe how wrong they are. So we come to the floor to \nsay we propose this amendment to add $6 billion a year, which would \nprovide the opportunity for real, significant price support increases \nwhen commodity prices collapse for family farmers. Is that a lot to \nask?\n  We hear folks come to the floor and say defense needs more. So, we \nstick in money for defense. We want to build a missile system. You put \n$1 billion in for a missile system last fall that the Defense \nDepartment said it did not want and could not use. Money for tax cuts? \nThere's plenty of money for that. But what about money for mom and pop \nout there on the family farm who are ravaged by collapsed prices? No, \nthey say, we are out of money.\n  I would say this. This Congress is out of ideas when it comes to \nfamily farming, if it believes the current farm program is the road to \nprosperity for these producers who are this country's real economic \nall-stars. We need to backtrack just a bit and decide that family \nfarmers matter to this country's future. We need to say to them that we \nare going to reconnect a reasonable price protection program. So, when \nprices collapse our country will say to farmers that we will give them \na chance to make it across those price valleys.\n  I started by talking about Margaret Hansen, the 90-year-old woman \nfrom North Dakota. We are a sparsely populated State. Half of our \neconomy is agriculture. But that is also true with respect to a major \npart of this farm belt. This Congress should understand that America's \neconomy is never going to be doing well in the long term if the middle \npart of its farm belt is being depopulated. Food production is \nimportant to this country's future and the health of family farming is \nimportant in producing America's food.\n  Let me call on my colleague from North Dakota and allocate 7 minutes \nto my colleague, Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dorgan and I thank our \ncolleagues. This is a matter of sheer survival. I want to say to my \ncolleagues, we are on the brink of a depression in farm country in this \nNation. If you come to North Dakota today and go with me to community \nfarms, what you find people want to talk about is the collapse of farm \nincome because it is threatening the survival of literally tens of \nthousands of family farmers just in our State of North Dakota. In fact, \nthis year, unless something happens and happens quickly, we anticipate \nwe will lose one-third of all the farmers in the State.\n  The reason that is occurring is really very simple. This chart shows \nwhat happened from 1996 to 1997, as farm income was washed away: In 1 \nyear, a 98 percent reduction in farm income in our State. The reason we \nhave seen this collapsing income is really three factors: Bad prices, \nbad weather, and bad policy.\n  The bad prices are stunning. This shows what has happened to farm \nprices over a 52-year period. We now have the lowest prices for our \nmajor commodities in 52 years. We have wheat selling for $2.60 a \nbushel. Mr. President, $2.60 a bushel. That is 5 cents a pound. There \nis no way anybody can make it at those prices. The cost of production \nis about double that. So what we have is a hemorrhaging, a loss of \nincome, and farmers' livelihoods being threatened. That is what we are \nfaced with.\n  When I talk about bad policy, when we passed the last farm bill--\nwhich is, frankly, a disaster itself--the support for farmers was cut \nin half. Under the previous legislation we averaged $10 billion a year. \nUnder the new legislation, $5 billion a year. This makes it virtually \nimpossible to write any kind of decent farm legislation. The current \nfarm legislation cuts support for farmers each and every year and cuts \nit sharply, without regard to what happens to prices. In previous \nlegislation we used to make an adjustment. When prices fell there was \nmore assistance.\n  But look what our major competitors are doing. It is very \ninteresting, because if we look at what they are doing we see that they \nare spending almost 10 times as much as we are to support their \nproducers. In Europe, they are spending nearly $50 billion a year to \nsupport their farmers. We are spending $5 billion. This is not a fair \nfight. This is unilateral disarmament in a trade confrontation. We \nwould never do it in a military confrontation. Why ever are we doing it \nin a trade confrontation? This says to our farmers: You go out there \nand compete against the French farmer and the German farmer. And, oh, \nwhile you are at it, you take on the French Government and the German \nGovernment as well. That is not a fair fight. You have to say to our \nfarmers it is pretty amazing you are able to survive in a circumstance \nlike this one, when our major competitors are spending 10 times as much \nto support them.\n  When we look at what they are doing for support of exports, it is \neven more dramatic. Instead of a factor of 10 to 1, they are \noutspending us by a factor of more than 100 to 1. In fact, it is about \n130-to-1 to support their farm exports versus what we are doing. Then \nsome say just leave it to the market. That is not what our competitors \nare doing. If that is what we do, we are going to\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\nconsign our farmers to a life of economic hardship and economic \ncollapse. That is what is happening in farm country today. That is why \nit is absolutely critical that an amendment like this one pass to help \nfarmers through this period of collapsed commodity values. If we do not \ndo it, we will see literally thousands of farm families forced off the \nland. The stakes are high. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I start, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Jodi Niehoff, who works in my office, be granted the privilege of \nthe floor during the duration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I make this appeal to my colleagues as a Senator from \nMinnesota: First of all, please get this disaster relief bill through, \nat least get the agricultural part of it through.\n  If we don't get that, our FSA offices run out of loan money. They \nwill have to let people go, and we will not be able to provide people \nwith the loan money that they need and they are going to go under. \nPlease make that happen. We should not go home without that happening.\n  Second of all, I rise to support this amendment. Time is not neutral. \nIt rushes on. It is not on the side of family farmers in our States. I \nhave never seen it this bad in all the years we have lived in \nMinnesota. People are in real economic pain.\n  It was the wheat farmers in the northwest. Now it is the other grain \nfarmers. It is the dairy farmers in southern Minnesota. The hog \nproducers are facing extinction while the packers are in hog heaven. We \nhave to get the price up. We have to get farm income up.\n\n  I think this amendment, which speaks to taking the cap off the loan \nrate, is the right thing to do. Price, price, price. Get farm income up \nand get it up now.\n  This is a critically important crisis amendment. If Senators are on \nthe side of family farmers and a family farm structure of agriculture, \nwhich is good for farmers and rural America and consumers, they will \nvote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues being on the floor today to \ntalk about this important issue. I am pleased to be here in support, \nand I am pleased to see these Senators helping to educate our other \ncolleagues in this body about the importance of this issue.\n  It is not just to educate. It is also to impress upon them the \nurgency of this issue. I come from a seventh-generation Arkansas farm \nfamily. We are in dire straits. All farmers across this Nation are in \ndire straits. It is so very important for us to act in this body and in \nthis Congress in a timely fashion.\n  I believe my colleagues have expressed it, but it is so absolutely \ncritical. Our farmers have been in dire straits for the past year, with \nbad weather, bad prices, and bad markets. This is the last straw. It is \nabsolutely essential that we do something before we go home for this \nrecess.\n  Our farmers right now are looking at the equivalent of 1970 prices. \nWhat industry could make it with the increase in production costs, the \nincrease of keeping the business going, surviving on what people were \nmaking in the 1970s? It is absolutely impossible to survive in today's \nagriculture economic climate.\n  We produce the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply \nin the world. It is not going to be there for the future of this Nation \nand for the world if we do not support our farmers at this critical \ntime. It is simply a desperate time.\n  I spent the last recess looking at the worry on the faces of Arkansas \nfarmers as they have talked about this crisis. These farmers are ready \nto throw in the towel; many of them already have. I applaud Senator \nDorgan's efforts and hope my colleagues will join him in addressing the \nneeds of our agricultural community.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding me this time. I thank \nhim for his leadership on this amendment, and I thank our Democratic \nleader also for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, last Saturday was National Agriculture Day. Each year \non the first day of spring, we celebrate the success and the \naccomplishment of American agriculture. U.S. consumers today spend less \nthan any country in the world, as a percent of their disposable income, \non food. Nine cents out of a dollar, that is all. Think about this, the \nproductivity of American farmers, what it has done for us. In the \n1960s, one farmer in America supplied food for 25 people. Now they \nsupply food for over 130 people. Tremendous.\n  Isn't it a cruel irony that we set aside the first day of spring \nevery year to recognize agriculture and the American farmer, yet tens \nof thousands of American farm families are going under right now? They \nare on the verge of losing their livelihoods and their life savings. It \nis devastation in the agricultural sector.\n  What this amendment basically says is that with the expected budget \nsurplus for fiscal year 2000 and greater surpluses in years to follow, \nwe will apply $6 billion of that extra surplus to putting a safety net \nunderneath agriculture. In other words, if we have extra money in the \nyears 2000 to 2004, that money will be made available to agriculture. \nOf course, if the farm economy improved, then it wouldn't be needed.\n  This chart here kind of tells it all. People say, why do you need $6 \nbillion? Here is last year, 1998. This is all of the farm income; that \nis, the crop receipts, their AMTA payments, their aid, their loan \ndeficiency payments--$69.5 billion. Expected this year, $64 billion. \nThat is about a $5 billion, $5.5 to $6 billion decrease. But last year \nthis was 17 percent lower than the average 5 years before. This year it \nis expected to be 27 percent less in income for farmers. That is why \nthis amendment is sorely needed. Those who have much in our society, to \nwhom the Republicans want to give these tax breaks, they are doing \nwell. They are doing well on Wall Street. They are doing well in Palm \nBeach. They are doing well on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. In the farm \nsector of America, our families are struggling to survive. All we are \nasking for is a decent safety net. That is why this amendment is sorely \nneeded.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota for \nhis leadership on this matter.\n  Let me say, you can't say it better than what the ranking member of \nour committee, Senator Harkin, has just said. The fact is that you can \nlook at virtually any commodity in agriculture today, and the situation \ncontinues to worsen. Whether it is in livestock or in grain, the \ncommodity doesn't matter.\n  The fact is, our circumstances are so dire that in spite of all the \nhelp we have attempted to provide through disaster assistance over the \nlast 6 months, we are still going to lose millions of farmers and \nmillions of rural Americans in the next couple of years. That is fact.\n  All we are simply saying is this: If we are going to be of any \nassistance as we go through this extraordinary transition, we need to \nrecreate the safety net that we once had. We need to recognize that \nfarmers and ranchers cannot do it alone. We need to recognize that if \nthere is going to be a surplus, one of the single best investments we \ncan make is to ensure that those farmers and ranchers can survive with \nwhat meager tools they are going to have to manage their risks more \neffectively.\n  That is what the Senator from North Dakota is saying. We are not \ngoing to specify and delineate each and every tool today. We will work \nthat out. But we have got to set the parameters. We have got to send \nthe message. We have to ensure that the priority is there.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. I \napplaud\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\nthe Senator from North Dakota for his willingness to take the \nleadership in ensuring that we are at this point. I am hopeful that we \ncan get a broad bipartisan consensus in passing it. It sends as clear a \nmessage as we can send out to agriculture across this country: We hear \nyou. We are as concerned as you are, and we want to do something about \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may we have a copy, please?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that the time be charged to me for the next 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FITZGERALD.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise with great empathy and sympathy \nand heartfelt concern about the farmers of the United States. That is \nwhy in the budget before you we put $6 billion of new money for crop \ninsurance and other things which was, indeed, modified in the committee \nso as to accommodate farm Senators by even making sure it was available \nthis coming year.\n  Now, I guess there is an adage around that it is harder to manage the \nsurplus than it was a deficit. I agree with that statement without a \nquestion. And here today it is very, very interesting. My wonderful \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, I am sure joined by some on my \nside of the aisle, are here on the floor about 2\\1/2\\ months after the \nPresident of the United States sends his budget to us, and they are \nlamenting the terrible state of economics for the farmers of America.\n  I did not ask any of them, as they spoke--and I do not know that I \nwill--but frankly, the President of the United States knew about all \nthis. Isn't it interesting he asked for not one red cent for the \nfarmers--zero. Typical. Typical. There is a crisis prevailing. If there \nis one, the President ought to know about it. He puts nothing in the \nbudget. We put $6 billion in thinking we are being helpful. The \nPresident claims he lives within the caps, he isn't breaking any \nbudget. Of course he is not. He did not even provide the $6 billion we \ndid in our budget resolution.\n  Now, $6 billion isn't enough. Hold on, everybody. This is $6 billion \na year. This is $30 billion. When is enough enough? So $30 billion of \nnew money on top of the $6 billion we put in is $36 billion in 5 years \nin new money for agriculture.\n  Frankly, I am fully aware that there is a problem. There are some \nother sectors of America with problems, big problems--steel, oil and \ngas. All kinds of pieces of the American economy are having trouble \nbecause of the world economy. We are doing a little bit here and there, \nbut we cannot go in and make everybody whole everywhere in America when \nwe are having a downturn that adversely affects their business.\n  If the Senators proposing this want to spend more money because they \nwant a new agriculture program, then I submit they ought to go to the \nAgriculture Committee and get a new agriculture program written into \nthe laws of this land. I believe they would not get it done. I believe \nthat is why they did not do it.\n  So each year they come along and add a few more billions, and while \nsaying we still have a law around they, little by little, destroy it. \nIf that is what they want, they ought to say it. If they think this \namendment is repealing the law we have on the books, let them say it, \nso then we can at least add this as an amendment to repeal the \ncompetitive agricultural reforms that we put in place not too many \nyears ago.\n  Frankly, it will be difficult for some not to vote for $30 billion \nmore in support money for farmers when there is already $6 billion in \nthe bill and when the President of the United States asks for none--\nzero--zip. No. It is kind of interesting. When is enough enough? It \nseems to me that this amendment is an indication that for some it does \nnot matter what you put in a budget resolution because it will not be \nenough.\n  I believe $6 billion in new money for agriculture, addressing the \nmost significant issue they have, crop insurance, is sufficient at this \npoint. Maybe we have an emergency, maybe the President should have \nlooked at the emergency before he sends us a budget with nothing in it \nfor farmers so we have to come along and put it in, cut other programs \nin our arsenal, or in this case reduce the tax cuts that we planned for \nthe American people.\n  I just do not think that is right. I would hope some would listen \ntoday. I am not sure how many. Normally I try to accommodate, but I \ndon't think, as one trying to write budgets, that I can accommodate \ntoday. Either they win or my position prevails. If I could find another \nway, I would try it. I just do not think there is one.\n\n  Either we decide that in an era of surpluses the American taxpayer \ndoes not matter a bit--you remember what some of us said, why it would \nbe difficult to manage a surplus. You remember? Because we will spend \nit all; we will spend it all. Why did the Senator from New Mexico say, \n``Yes, you can claim you put it all on the surplus and it's sitting \nthere to get rid of the debt.'' Why did I say, I do not choose that \nmethod. I choose it for all the Social Security money, but I do not \nchoose it for everything. I said, ``Because you know what, we'll spend \nit. Then we'll have bigger Government, the public will be paying for \nbigger Government, and they'll be paying more and more taxes.'' And \nthat isn't the right kind of America.\n  So, Mr. President, I have some additional time, and depending upon \nwhat is said in the remaining 5 minutes that they have on the other \nside, that the proponents have, I may yield back the remainder of my \ntime. But for now I reserve it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from South Dakota, \nSenator Johnson.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I thank my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, for his great work on \nthis amendment.\n  What we have here is a very fundamental priority decision that this \nCongress needs to make. The question is not whether we will have tax \nrelief or not. Certainly we will have tax relief. The question is \nwhether we have a commonsense kind of budget that also allows for some \nkey investments, in this case in agriculture. Are we going to preserve \nthe strongest agricultural system in the world that provides the \nhighest quality, most affordable food in the world or not?\n  To say that we have an $800 billion tax relief package and there is \nno room for $6 billion of investment in our ag sector simply makes no \nsense. The American people see through the budget resolution on the \nfloor. They know that they want some tax relief, especially if it is \ntargeted to middle-class and working families. But they also know that \nwe need to make some key strategic investments in important sectors of \nour economy. Nothing is more important than agriculture as we craft \nways to get a better price out of the market, as we craft ways to keep \na fine meshed system of family farms and ranches all across America. \nBut as things are going right now, we are headed for a catastrophic \ntrain wreck in agriculture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 1 minute.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield such time as I have back to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Presiding Officer notify me when I have 1 \nminute remaining?\n  Mr. President, this is about priorities. We just heard my colleague \nsay: ``Well, this isn't a priority. We don't have resources for this.'' \nGosh, we have resources for some very large tax cuts. If that is their \npriority, then there is money for that. Or, what about the $1 billion \nfor national missile defense which the Department of Defense says it \ndoes not want, does not need, and cannot spend. They have money for \nthat. And, then there is $110 billion or so for readiness in defense. \nThey have money for that.\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n\n  The question is, What is a priority? We do have a surplus of empathy \nand sympathy. I do not disagree with that. Everybody empathizes and \nsympathizes.\n  The fact is, we have farmers going broke in record numbers.\n  How would you feel I would ask if any of you listening or watching or \nparticipating had your income cut by 98 percent? All of a sudden you \nhave 98 percent less income. Would that be a catastrophe? I think it \nwould. That is what happened to our farmers. I had a fellow at a forum, \na big, husky guy with a beard. He said, ``My dad farmed, my granddad \nfarmed on the same place. I farmed for 23 years.'' Then he got tears in \nhis eyes and his chin began to quiver. He said, ``I am quitting, I \ncan't continue. I am being forced off the farm.''\n  That is what this amendment is about. We need to consider the human \ntoll of farm failures all across this country. What will be left when \nonly the corporate agrifactories are producing America's food. Some \npeople think that would be great because they love big corporations--\nthe bigger the better. Of course, there will be no yardlights lighting \nfarmsteads. There will be nobody living in the country, because all the \nfarmers who risked their money will have found that the auction block \nserved as the final resting place for their dreams and their hopes.\n  We can do something about that if we decide it is a priority.\n  I say to my colleague from New Mexico, this is where the current farm \nbill started in 1995. It started right here in the budget. It is where \nit ought to stop. It is where we ought to make the modifications and \nchanges. It is where we, as a Congress, ought to say this is a \npriority, and that family farmers are a priority. But, it is not just \nabout farm families. It is also about Main Streets and small towns. It \nis about the economic and social fabric in a part of our country that \nis now being depopulated.\n  Let me again refer to this chart. The red on the chart shows the \nmiddle part of the country, which is full of rural counties that are \nlosing population. This little place right here is where I grew up in \nHettinger County, North Dakota. When I left, there were 5,000 people in \nthat county. Today, there are 3,000 people. That county is symbolic of \nso much of the farm belt that is now being depopulated because we have \na farm program that doesn't work.\n  There is a whole range of other programs that we must address. It is \nnot enough to say that things will work out, or that this doesn't \nmatter. This matters very much to a significant part of America. We \nhave a right to be standing here on the floor of the Senate saying, \nthis too is a priority. This is a priority for us, for our part of the \ncountry, and for family farmers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 21\\1/2\\ \nminutes and the sponsor has 3 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Senator is right, that this \nis a question of priority.\n  The Senator mentioned missile defense. He said it will cost $1.5 \nbillion. We don't need it; we shouldn't pay for it. What would be \nprioritizing would be if he would move to strike the missile defense \nsystem. The problem is, if he did that, he would find that not only the \nAmerican people would say no, but 65 or 70 Senators would say no. He \npicked the wrong program, because most Americans think we have a \nmissile defense system. They think if a rogue country or North Korea or \nChina sent a missile to the United States that we could destroy it. The \ntruth of the matter is, whoever thinks that is wrong. We don't.\n  Republicans have been saying, and now we are joined by Democrats, use \nevery single technological achievable end to get a missile defense \nsystem started. That is a high priority, too.\n  I don't know what else the Senator mentioned, but whatever he \nmentioned, the truth of the matter is he could come to the floor and \nsay farmers have a higher priority than this whole list of things in \nthe Government. That is not what is being done; it is just making the \nGovernment bigger.\n  In fact, it is very interesting. It is a tax-and-spend proposal. It \nis increasing the taxes on the people of this country because we intend \nto give them back some to pay for more Government. I think Government \nis about as big as it ought to be. I remind everyone, the President put \nnothing in for the state of emergency. For a President who is worried \nabout Main Street, and everything else alluded to on the floor, isn't \nthat interesting?\n  We did what we thought was right and put in $6 billion. The first \namendment that was sent to the desk would have cost $60 billion. I was \nin error--now it is $30, it has been modified. The price is cut in half \nin about 26 minutes. I laud the Senator for modifying it. I wish it \nwere still at 60--we could argue about 60. That sounded like a good, \nround number.\n  Having said that, I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I prefer to close for a minute, but if the \nSenator wishes to keep it open I assume he will want to move along here \nand be able to get as much done as is possible.\n  Let me have the attention of the Senator from New Mexico. If I finish \nour time, would the Senator then yield back his time so we can proceed?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me respond to a couple points.\n  First, let's talk about national missile defense. He makes an \ninteresting argument, but the Senator misunderstood what I said. I \ntalked about the $1 billion last fall that was stuck into the omnibus \nappropriations bill. No one asked for it and the Defense Department \nsaid they couldn't use it. Go track the money and find out what \nhappened to it. They didn't want it, but Congress said, ``We demand you \ntake it.'' My point is, if it is a priority, then the sky is the limit. \nIt doesn't matter that it is not needed. That is the point I was \nmaking.\n  The tax-and-spend cliche is such an old argument it is calcified. I \nthought I heard the last of that some years ago. This debate is about \nwhat is important and what are our priorities.\n  I want to talk about the big print and the little print which got us \nto this mess. Some years ago, we had people in Congress who said we \nshould change the farm program. In the big print in the 1996 farm law \nit says that we will provide a marketing loan and it will be at 85 \npercent of the Olympic average of the prices received by farmers in the \nprevious five years. That was the big print. Then they put the little \nprint in the bill. It said, by the way, although we promised you that \nmarketing loan at 85 percent, we are going to cap it at $2.58 a bushel \nfor wheat. What the big print giveth, the little print taketh away.\n  Does it matter? Does it cost? Of course. It matters in terms of the \nfailure of hopes and dreams for family farmers who are bankrupted by \nthese little print policies. These little print policies really say \nthat family farming doesn't matter too much to this country anymore. It \nsays that we would rather have big corporate agrifactories. It says we \nlike corporate agriculture. and corporate farming. It says that mom and \npop don't have to live out there so the yardlights don't have to be on. \nIt says we can mechanically milk all the cows and have 3,000-head dairy \nherds. That is a very different version of America than I have and a \ndifferent sense of priorities than I think should exist for this \ncountry.\n  That is what this debate is about. The Senator from New Mexico says \nthis should go to the Agriculture Committee. This started in 1995 in \nthe Budget Committee. That is where it started. The budget resolution \nprescribed the Freedom to Farm bill. If you can start the farm bill in \n1995 in the Budget Committee, we can, it seems to me, debate it in 1999 \nas we debate the budget resolution.\n  Today, we face depression-era prices on the farm. Family farmers are \ngoing belly up on a wholesale basis out there in the country and this \nCongress must do something about it.\n  Did the President's budget address this? No. Does this budget \nresolution address it in an appropriate way? No. Do I appreciate that \nthe Budget Committee put in $6 billion over 6 years or so for crop \ninsurance? Of course I do. I appreciate that. But it is so far short of \nwhat is needed. We are about $5 billion\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\na year short of what we used to do to provide to fund price protection \nfor family farmers.\n\n  Today we need to repair that by deciding our priority in this budget \nresolution is to stand up and help family farmers during this time of \ntrouble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time I have.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 178, As Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Previously, the Senator sought modification.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 178), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 43, strike beginning with line 3 through line 15, \n     page 44, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 201. RESERVE FUND FOR AN UPDATED BUDGET FORECAST.\n\n       (a) Congressional Budget Office Updated Budget Forecast for \n     Fiscal Years 2000-2004.--Pursuant to section 202(e)(2) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Congressional Budget \n     Office shall update its economic and budget forecast for \n     fiscal years 1999 through 2009 by July 15, 1999.\n       (b) Reporting a Surplus.--If the report provided pursuant \n     to subsection (a) estimates an on-budget surplus for fiscal \n     year 2000 or results in additional surpluses beyond those \n     assumed in this resolution in following fiscal years, the \n     Chairman of the Committee on the Budget shall make the \n     appropriate adjustments to revenue and spending as provided \n     in subsection (c).\n       (c) Adjustments.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget shall take the amount of the additional on-budget \n     surplus for fiscal years 2000 through 2009 estimated in the \n     report submitted pursuant to subsection (a) and in the \n     following order in each of the fiscal years 2000 through \n     2009--\n       (1) increase the allocation to the Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry by $6,000,000,000 in \n     budget authority and outlays in each of the fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2004 for legislation that provides risk management \n     and income assistance for agricultural producers;\n       (2) reduce the on-budget revenue aggregate by any remaining \n     amounts for fiscal years 2000;\n       (3) provide for or increase the on-budget surplus levels \n     used for determining compliance with the pay-as-you-go \n     requirements of section 202 of H.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 231\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is to be recognized to speak on his amendment.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], for himself, Mr. \n     Roth, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Abraham proposes an amendment \n     numbered 231, as previously offered.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment with Senators Roth, Coverdell and Abraham.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add the names of Senators Hagel, Burns, \nMcCain and Craig as original cosponsors as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, again, what I am talking about is \nsupporting the middle-income tax relief included in this budget \nresolution. This is a crucial amendment that we all should support.\n  This amendment says that the Senate Budget Resolution places a \npriority not only on protecting Social Security and Medicare and \nreducing the Federal debt, but also on middle-income tax relief by \nreturning nearly $800 billion of the non-Social Security surplus to \nthose from whom it was taken. It discusses options for middle-income \ntax relief such as broad-based tax relief, marriage penalty relief, \nretirement savings incentives, death tax relief, health care-related \ntax relief, and education-related tax relief.\n  This amendment does not put us on record as supporting any one form \nof tax relief, or any particular combination. That is the task of the \nFinance Committee under the able leadership of Senator Roth.\n  While many of us will discuss our own preferences for the tax relief, \nour job today is to support the nearly $800 billion total, recognizing \nthe need for tax relief, and then to ask the Finance Committee to come \nup with specific tax relief proposals.\n  Again, Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to assure the \nAmerican people that we've made a commitment to major tax relief, and \nthat there is room in this budget to fulfill this commitment while \nprotecting Social Security and Medicare, providing debt relief and \nrespecting some new spending priorities.\n  I just heard it said in the last debate on the farm issues, ``if \nthere is something for a tax cut,'' or ``if that is a priority''--it \nshould be a priority. There would not be a surplus if American \ntaxpayers had not been overcharged and paid more in taxes than they \nshould have. What they are doing is fighting over how can they spend \nthose dollars, rather than trying to find a way to give those \novercharges back to the people who paid them.\n   Mr. President, let me highlight a few points as to why we must \nprovide a major tax relief this year.\n  Polls showed many Americans were skeptical about whether they would \never get meaningful tax relief this year. They have good reason to be \nskeptical about President Clinton's rhetoric on tax relief.\n  Despite a huge on-budget surplus over the next 10 years, President \nClinton has failed to secure a single significant tax cut for working \nAmericans. Instead, he has proposed to increase our taxes by at least \n$50 billion in his budget over the next five years and $90 billion over \n10 years. He also spends $158 billion right out of the Social Security \nsurplus he claims to protect. President Clinton talks about helping the \nAmerican people build retirement security but to offset his new \nspending, he has proposed many new taxes including taxing life \ninsurance products, which will hurt the retirement annuities of \nmillions of Americans. The President talked about helping small \nbusiness, but he has proposed to tax the income of non-profit trade \nassociations and change the tax treatment for ESOPs, which will \nadversely affect millions of small businesses. These are just some of \nhis new taxes that will hurt hard-working Americans.\n  Unlike President Clinton, our budget resolution has reserved nearly \n$800 billion of the non-Social Security budget surplus over the next 10 \nyears for tax relief. This is in fact the largest tax relief since \nPresident Reagan's. This amendment has once again proved the Republican \nmajority is committed to providing meaningful tax relief in 1999 as \nwell as protecting Social Security, Medicare, reducing the debt, and \nfunding important priorities.\n   Mr. President, with more middle-income workers being thrown into \nhigher tax brackets, the ``middle class tax squeeze'' is devastating. \nThere are over 20 million workers today with annual earnings between \n$20,000 and $50,000. Before 1993, they paid income tax at the 15 \npercent rate. But most of them have now been pushed into the 28 percent \ntax bracket due to inflation and economic growth. Worse still, they \nhave to pay the 28 percent federal income tax rate on top of a 15.3 \npercent payroll tax. This adds up to a tax rate of 43 percent, without \ncounting state, local tax, and other taxes. So any gains they made in \nwages have been taken by Washington. The bigger tax bite continues to \neat up more of their wages.\n  Again, my point, Mr. President, is that this non-Social Security \nsurplus is nothing but tax overpayments, and it should be returned to \nthe taxpayers, not spent, as you are going to hear argued here on the \nfloor day after day, hour after hour--``let's spend it.'' It should be \ngiven back to the taxpayers.\n  How to use the remaining surplus once we wall off Social Security has \nbeen the central focus of this year's budget debate. The Democrats want \nWashington to spend it because they don't believe the American people \ncan be trusted to use it responsibly. We're heard it before, but let me \nremind you\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\nwhat the President said about the surplus during a speech in Buffalo in \nJanuary: ``We could give it all back to you and hope you spend it \nright, [but[ if you don't * * *.'' You are smart enough to earn the \nmoney, but you are not quite smart enought to know how to spend it.\n  A top aide to the President, Paul Begala, said, ``We could squander \nthe surplus by giving a tax cut.''\n  So, in other words, we have overcharged you and taken more money from \nyou than we should have, or you have paid more in, but to give it back \nwould be squandering it. Washington thinks they should spend it.\n  Republicans want to give the surplus back to working Americans--those \nwho paid too much taxes in the first place.\n  We've recently heard some claims on the Senate floor that the \nAmerican people today aren't interested in tax relief. That's not what \nI'm seeing and hearing. Those who don't care about tax relief are a \nminority, especially in my state. Tax relief continues to be a major \ninterest of Minnesotans.\n  Mr. President, let me read to you letters from just three of the many \nMinnesotans who have taken time to contact me: Ken Ebensteiner from \nAudubon, Minnesota wrote: ``* * * please understand that the silent \nmajority are sick and tired of all the taxes and regulations. We're \njust too busy working to voice our opinions.'' Taxpayers are working, \nand don't have the time to come to Washington. They can't afford to \ndefend themselves because the government takes so much of their income. \nWashington's philosophy is apparently, ``Keep them poor, keep them \nquiet, keep them home.''\n  Rev. Craig Palach of Fergus Falls wrote: ``With four children--two \nsoon to be in college, one beginning to think about college, and one in \na parochial school--I could sure use some of the money that goes to \ntaxes.'' But again, the President says Rev. Craig Palach wouldn't spend \nit right.\n  The third letter, this one by Alicia Jones of White Bear Lake, is \nright on target with the story she shared. She wrote:\n\n       Last year, both my husband and I had graduated from college \n     and had just begun working full time. I have never written a \n     letter like this before, but after completing my taxes for \n     1998, I felt that this was my only option.\n       I can't do anything about the amount of money my husband \n     and I will have to pay to both the federal and state \n     governments, but I hope that you can be active in making \n     changes for next year.\n       During 1998, my husband and I both worked full time in \n     professional careers. We have no children and we are renting \n     an apartment, saving to buy a house. Based on the fact that \n     we both work, we are married, we have no children, and that \n     we do not own a house--when we filed our taxes this year we \n     owed approximately $700 more in federal income taxes, on top \n     of the over $10,000 that we have already had taken out of our \n     paychecks * * *.\n       I am frustrated by this, I'm frustrated for the future--how \n     do we get ahead, when each year we have to take money from \n     our savings to pay more for our taxes. I hope that you will \n     remember my concern.\n\n  But again, presidential aide Paul Begala says Alicia would \n``squander'' any tax cut.\n  Working people have good reason to ask for a tax cut. Since 1993, \nFederal taxes have increased by 50 percent--50 percent. That is a tax \nincrease of nearly $4,000 a year for a Alicia and her husband--50 \npercent; $4,000 more in the last 6 years. As a result, Americans today \nhave the largest tax burden since World War II, and it is still \ngrowing.\n  Federal taxes consume now 21 percent of the total national income. A \ntypical American family pays nearly 40 percent in total taxes. And that \nis more than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined.\n  People should go home and look at their pay stubs and find out \nexactly how much of their money is going to support Government, and how \nmuch they have left. And then figure out whether they should have a tax \ncut.\n  Mr. President, why should we continue taxing middle-class Americans \nat such a high rate? Who can rightfully argue that they don't need a \ntax cut? Who can argue that it is fair to take more than 40 percent of \na person's income so Government can spend it?\n  That is why I, along with Senator Roth and others, introduced bill \nNo. S. 3, the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act. Our bill calls for a 10-\npercent across-the-board income tax for working Americans.\n  It is simple, fair, profamily, and progrowth. It will help millions \nof middle-income families to avoid the middle-income ``real income \nbracket creep'' that they have been subjected to since 1993.\n  Although I prefer broad-based tax relief, I understand this is just \none of many tax relief proposals that are on the table. Again, there is \nnothing in this budget that endorses one proposal over the others. All \nwe have done is to reserve some of the non-Social Security surplus for \ntax relief.\n  The Finance Committee will consider all tax relief proposals and \ndecide how this reserved onbudget surplus should be distributed.\n  It is my hope that we can use the surplus to provide broad-based tax \nrelief as well as other tax relief I support which would give families \na break, and encourage savings, encourage investment, and provide \nincentives for higher education.\n  I remember vividly when I first proposed the $500-per-child tax \ncredit back in 1993. The naysayers called it bad policy, even \ndangerous. Democrats accused us of cutting taxes for the rich. That \nsounds familiar, doesn't it? Every time it is a tax cut, it is for \nsomebody else.\n  Some in Congress contended it was too costly, and others argued that \nwe should balance the budget first. I argued then repeatedly that we \ncould, and should, do both. And we did. As a result, we now have a \nbalanced budget, and the largest non-Social Security surplus in U.S. \nhistory.\n  Cutting taxes, reducing the national debt, and reforming and \nprotecting Social Security and Medicare at the same time are all \npossible. We can to it again. Mr. President, we must do it again.\n  That is what this budget is about, and that is what this amendment is \nabout. I urge my colleagues to strongly support reserving this money \nfor tax relief for working Americans.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what is the time situation on this \namendment?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a total of a half hour equally \ndivided. The sponsor has 3 minutes remaining. There are 15 minutes in \nopposition.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I stand here, and I request \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I was, obviously, very much interested--I will not say \nmoved--by the discussion that I just heard on this amendment, because \nthe drill is a familiar one. The drill is the people who earned it want \nit back; and, why not give it to them? Of course, we want to give it to \nthem. But whether you give it to them in direct tax cuts or you shore \nup Social Security, you say that no matter when you retire, for the \nnext 75 years, you will know that the retirement program is going to be \nthere for you. Or you say, ``Well, we are going to take the Medicare \nfund, and we are going to increase its solvency from 2008 to 2020, 12 \nyears more, during which time, or during this time, because we are \nlooking at something 21 years away. We want to institute the reforms \nthat are so often talked about so that health care can be provided in a \nreasonable fashion with longevity, with the solvency that is required.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Minnesota in our Budget \nCommittee the other day presenting a poll in which he said 63 percent \nof the people--I think I have it accurately and fairly--polled wanted a \ntax cut. I read a newspaper story about that poll. Once the question \nwas put as to whether you would rather have a tax cut, or pay down the \ndebt, or make sure that Social Security is there for you, or make sure \nthat Medicare is there when you need it, the numbers changed radically. \nThe numbers that said pay down the debt, increase the longevity for \nSocial Security, increase the longevity and solvency of Medicare, and, \nboy, they went the other way.\n  When I hear that the typical American family pays 40 percent in \ntaxes--I\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\ndon't know what the income is for the typical American family, but I \ncan tell you that almost 60 percent of the people are in the $38,000 or \nbelow income strata. They are not paying 40 percent taxes. Come on. \nLet's be reasonably direct and accurate about these things.\n  Look at what happened. If we use the GOP tax program as outlined by \nthe distinguished Senator, the chairman of the Finance Committee, he \nsays that if you are in the top 1 percent of the income, over $300,000 \nor more, an average of $800,000 a year, you get a $20,000 tax cut. But \nif you make $38,000, which is the bottom 60 percent of the people in \nthis country, $38,000, you save $99. The guy on the top who gets a \n$20,000 refund could buy another car for that, or add a wing to his \nhouse. But the family that is earning $38,000 is not going to do a lot \nwith 100 bucks--$99 to be precise.\n  I think we ought to be fairly clear when we have this debate. Yes, \neveryone is entitled to offer amendments they think are appropriate, \nbut we ought not to color the facts such that we ignore the reality of \nwhat it is we are talking about.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is quite obvious that this gets back \nto the essential dispute between the parties with the Republicans \nwanting tax breaks primarily for the wealthy, ignoring the fact that \nthey can improve the condition of Medicare.\n\n  We on this side want to have as our principal programs: save Social \nSecurity; extend the life of Medicare; make sure there are targeted tax \nbreaks so that families who have an elderly parent can take care of \nthat parent and get a tax deduction, a tax break for that \nresponsibility; or who needs day care for their children, and get a tax \nbreak so that mama can work. That is what we are talking about. We are \ntalking about things that pertain to the average American.\n  I am one of the people lucky enough to be in the top 1 percent. I was \nin business before I was here. I will tell you something. I am so happy \nevery time I have the ability to earn that kind of money to pay my \ntaxes, because I belong to the best club in the whole world, the club \ncalled ``America,'' where everything is available to you. Opportunity \nshould be--education should be--everything should be available for \nthose who want to climb the ladder and who are clever enough to do it.\n  That is what I am paying for when I send in my tax bill. I don't \nthink it is being squandered by a bunch of bureaucrats. Some, maybe. \nThat happens in corporate life. I ran a big corporation. I can tell \nyou. What I want is a secure country. I want a country where people \nfeel good about themselves and aren't looking at the guys on top and \nsaying they are getting all the breaks. That is not a stable society. \nThe stable society says, I want a chance to educate my children, I want \na chance to have a roof over my head, and I want a chance to have a \njob. That is what I want. I want to know that when I am of retirement \nage that Social Security is going to be there for me. And I am happy to \npay my dues. That is what it is--dues. We are so lucky to be here. \nPeople are willing to die, and are fleeing in inner tubes across the \nstraits near Cuba, near Florida, to get to this country, and risk death \ncoming out of ships' holds and things such as that to get to this \ncountry. We are not talking about squandering money and throwing away \nthe citizens' dollars.\n  I think we ought to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator \nRoth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as we turn our attention to the Budget \nResolution, pondering the course government is going to take--the \nphilosophy and policies that are going to lead us into a new \nmillennium--I want my colleagues to consider that rather than a time \nfor acrimony and partisan politics, this is a time of great \nopportunity.\n  In fact, few times in history have been so rich with the \nopportunities that are before us--opportunities to set a future where \nthe needs of taxpayers, families, students, and communities come before \nthe insatiable appetite of the federal government. Because of policies \nwe began to implement in the early 1980s, we are the beneficiaries of \nthe longest peacetime economic expansion in history.\n  Our efforts to support the home--to provide incentives to save and \ninvest--as well as our work to encourage risk-taking businessmen and -\nwomen, researchers and developers, our agricultural and educational \ncommunities--these efforts have paid tremendous dividends.\n  Now the question, as we face the final hours of the 20th century, is \nsimple: Do we move forward, embracing economic policies that are proven \nto increase prosperity and economic opportunity for all Americans, or \ndo we abandon them for proposals that will raise taxes on the most \nvulnerable among us, proposals that will fill government coffers, swell \nfederal programs, and risk shutting down the tremendous engine of \ngrowth that we have successfully created?\n  It seems that the answer to this question is clear, and therefore I \nrise today to support a Sense of the Senate amendment to the Budget \nResolution--a Sense of the Senate amendment that is bipartisan in \nnature--one that makes it clear that in the choice between a tax cut, \nas authorized in the resolution, or a tax increase, as provided in the \nAdministration's budget, we are resolved and choose to be consistent as \nto the direction we want to go.\n  Today the federal government is collecting more taxes than ever \nbefore. Because of our entrepreneurs, our farmers, laborers, and \nfamilies preparing for the future, we are witnessing strong economic \ngrowth, and this has been very beneficial for the government's income. \nThese individuals have been encouraged by our efforts to dramatically \ncut taxes in the 1980s, to create incentives for saving and investing \nin the 1990s, and by our work to reduce government interference in \ntheir lives.\n  Unfortunately, and despite the fact that government is collecting \nmore revenue than ever, the Administration's budget reverses this \nimportant trend. It represents another in a series of large tax \nincreases this Administration has tried to impose on Americans. In \nfact, this proposal is a net tax increase of $50 billion over five \nyears and $90 billion over ten years. It is not a targeted tax cut as \nits proponents claim. Rather, it is a tax increase that dramatically \nhits lower-income Americans the hardest. For example, under the \nAdministration's budget, taxpayers with incomes of $25,000 and under \nwill bear almost 40 percent of the net tax increase. Taxpayers with \nincomes of $75,000 and under will bear over 75 percent of the burden.\n  One might ask, with all the talk about targeted tax breaks in the \nAdministration's budget, how can it be a tax increase on America's most \nvulnerable. The simple answer is that the Administration's budget \nrelies to a great degree on a 55 cents per pack cigarette tax increase. \nThat tax increase, which largely goes for new spending, far outweighs \nany tax cutting provisions in the budget, and it hits lower-income \nAmericans the hardest.\n  On the other hand, Mr. President, the budget resolution proposed by \nSenator Domenici does not unfairly penalize one group of Americans. In \nfact it does not penalize any group. Rather, it provides the Senate \nFinance Committee with the authority to cut taxes, not increase them. \nAnd it allows us to cut taxes in a way that will continue to energize \nthe economic growth our nation is enjoying. This is what America needs \nas we look to the opportunities before us.\n  I reject any argument that tries to raise the old worn-out issue of \nclass warfare--those who might try to suggest that this resolution will \nprovide tax cuts for the rich. First, I reject it because this \nresolution does not actually cut taxes, but only authorizes the Finance \nCommittee to proceed to cut taxes. And second, I reject it because the \nkind of across-the-board tax cuts that are being discussed are just \nthat --fairly applied across-the-board tax cuts that go to everyone. \nThey are just like the tax cuts that President Kennedy implemented in \nthe 1960s and the tax cuts that President Reagan implemented in the \n1980s. On both occasions these bipartisan tax cuts led to record-\nsetting economic growth, so not only were they fairly applied, but they \nbenefitted everyone.\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\n  Mr. President, I also reject the argument that the federal revenue \nwindfall, or budget surplus, will be used by the Administration to \nretire the debt. For years, there were many among us who argued that \ntax increases were needed to reduce deficit spending and retire the \ndebt. On occasion, they prevailed and taxes were raised, but then \nsomething interesting happened. Deficit spending did not stop, the debt \nwas not retired. The increased taxes actually placed a damper on the \neconomy, and the government spent more than $1.50 for every $1.00 it \nincreased taxes. In other words, the government actually taxed itself \ninto higher deficit spending. It wasn't until Congress insisted on \nholding the line on spending that the growing economy actually brought \nabout a balanced budget.\n  According to a new study by the Joint Economic Committee, in the \npost-war period, sixty cents of every dollar of surplus taken into \ngovernment coffers has been spent by government within a year. Does \nanyone doubt the taxpayer overpayments that are now contributing to \nsurplus revenue will not be spent by future Congresses? Of course they \nwill. The way to reduce the debt is to keep the economy growing--to \nkeep an environment of opportunity available to all Americans. And the \nway to keep the economy growing is to cut taxes and minimize government \ninterference in the lives of Americans. This is the message of the \nGrams Sense of the Senate amendment. It reaffirms support for the tax \ncut authorized under the resolution offered by Senator Domenici. The \ntax cut provided in that resolution is $142 billion over five years and \n$778 billion over ten.\n  This resolution will empower the Finance Committee, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to work together and provide comprehensive tax relief. The \nFinance Committee can provide across-the-board tax relief, over the \nlong-term--relief that is simple, fair, and meaningful to all \ntaxpayers. With the authority given us by this resolution, the Finance \nCommittee can provide tax relief in the short term for many good \npurposes--purposes supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  For example, we could enhance retirement security. By this I mean \nimproving small business pension plans, making IRAs more accessible, \nand simplifying employer 401(k) plans. Also, we should address the \nneeds of women returning to the workforce. Every worker has a stake in \na better retirement that these incentives could provide.\n  Second, we could enhance family tax relief. For instance, we could \nensure that the $500 per child tax credit, dependent care tax credit, \nand education credits are available to middle income families by \nexempting these credits from the alternative minimum tax (``AMT''). If \nwe do not provide these exemptions, millions of families could be \nadversely affected. In addition, the Budget Committee, on a bipartisan \nbasis, has emphasized the importance of providing marriage penalty \nrelief.\n  Third, we could do more to correct our abysmal national savings rate. \nChairman Alan Greenspan says this is the number one economic problem \nconfronting America. To this end, in addition to the retirement plan \nand IRA expansion mentioned above, we could do something for small \nsavers. For instance, we could simplify the tax system by providing an \nexclusion for small savers of $200 for singles and $400 for married \ncouples.\n\n  This bipartisan tax cut would benefit more than 60 million taxpayers. \nIt would also allow up to 11 million Americans to file the 1040 EZ--\nwhich is the simpliest federal tax form there is.\n  Fourth, we could provide greater tax relief to improve educational \nopportunities for students and their families. We could provide \nincentives for families and students to seek higher education and avoid \nlarge debt burdens. For instance, nearly every state has a prepaid \ncollege tuition plan, and those plans could be made tax-free under a \nbipartisan proposal.\n  Fifth, we could address the expiring provisions in the current tax \ncode, and we could look at real tax code simplification. The Finance \nCommittee could eliminate needless complexity that results from income \nlimits, phaseouts, and the alternative minimum tax. Again, these are \nbipartisan objectives.\n  And finally, Mr. President, we could continue to push for proper \ntaxpayer protections. Reform of the IRS is in its infant stages. \nElimination of unjust penalties and interest scores as revenue loss. In \norder to continue meaningful reform of the Internal Revenue Service, we \nmust realize that our efforts will be scored as revenue losses and we \nmust consequently address them in the context of tax cuts.\n  This Sense of the Senate amendment makes clear that without the \nauthority provided in the budget resolution, the Finance Committee will \nnot be able to provide significant tax relief--we will not be able to \naddress these important bi-partisan issues and fix problems in the \ncurrent code.\n  The resolution will allow us to move forward. And let me conclude by \nexplaining how important it is that we move forward.\n  Working together, we have delivered on a bold promise to the American \npeople--the promise of a balanced budget and a dynamic economy where \njobs, opportunity, and growth are available to all. Since 1995, we have \nworked for tax relief for families, savings and investment incentives, \nhealth care-related tax relief, relief for small business, and tax \nsimplification. As we moved forward in these areas, not everyone was \nsupportive at first, but they were eventually adopted by Congress and \nsigned into law by the President. Among the items enacted were tax \ndeductible treatment for long-term care insurance and raising the \ndeductible portion of health insurance for self-employed small \nbusinesses and farmers. In addition, pension plan reforms, especially \nfor small business, were enacted.\n  In 1997, we pushed for tax relief in the context of a balanced \nbudget. The President agreed to tax relief he had previously vetoed. \nAmong the tax relief proposals enacted was a $500 per child tax credit \nthat is now providing relief to millions of taxpaying families. We also \nexpanded individual retirement accounts and created the new Roth IRA. \nMillions of taxpayers now have tax-favored savings vehicles open to \nthem. We reduced the top capital gains rate from 28% to 20%. This \nprovision helped unlock investment dollars for the economy and provided \nrelief to farmers and small business.\n  Beyond this, Mr. President, we have worked together to offer \neducation-related tax relief, including educational IRAs, prepaid \ncollege tuition plans, an extension of the tax-free treatment of \nemployer-provided educational assistance, and a revival of the student \nloan interest deduction.\n  We have passed estate tax relief, including relief for small \nbusinesses and farmers. And we have succeeded with historic reform of \nthe Internal Revenue Service, including new taxpayer protections \nregarding the collection activities of the IRS.\n  The Grams Sense of the Senate amendment makes clear that once again, \nwe are at the crossroads on the question of tax relief or tax \nincreases. The Sense of the Senate clarifies that the resolution \ncontinues Congress on the same tax relief path begun in 1995. It can be \nsummarized into three points:\n  First, the Administration's budget, though described by its \nsupporters as targeted tax cuts, is a tax increase.\n  Second, if you are serious about tax relief, it must be accommodated \nin the resolution. The Finance Committee must have the tools to provide \nmeaningful relief. To oppose the tax cut in the resolution is to deny \nthe Finance Committee the tools to do the job.\n  Third, a vote for the tax cut in the resolution is a vote for tax \nrelief that is consistent with tax cuts that have been enacted over the \npast four years.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Grams Sense of the \nSenate amendment and I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record \na copy of the Tax Foundation's analysis of the Administration's budget, \nas well as a copy of a revenue table, prepared by the Joint Committee \non Taxation, which scores the Administration's budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Tax Foundation Special Report, March 1999]\n\n   The President's Fiscal Year 2000 Budget-- Low- and Middle-Income \n  Taxpayers to Pay Lion's Share of New Revenue Despite Record Surplus\n\n                          (By Patrick Fleenor)\n\n       President Clinton's newly proposed budget plans on a \n     steadily growing series of budget\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\n     surpluses over at least the next ten years. To ensure the \n     surpluses, the Administration plans to hold the line on most \n     types of federal spending while increasing the current record \n     peace-time level of federal taxation.\n       Ostensibly to bolster the failing Social Security and \n     Medicare programs, the Clinton plan would use more than three \n     quarters of the projected surplus to reduce federal debt. \n     Another 12 percent would be used to fund private savings \n     accounts, and the balance would fund new spending \n     initiatives.\n       Some programs would see an increase over the next five \n     years, notably education and training programs as well as \n     funding for roads and other transportation projects. The \n     budget also calls for additional spending for more teachers, \n     after-school programs, and Head Start. The Administration's \n     plan to use surplus funds to pay down the national debt would \n     significantly lower interest expenses while entitlement \n     spending remains essentially unchanged under the plan.\n       On the revenue side of the ledger the Clinton plan contains \n     a mix of tax and fee increases as well as a host of tax \n     credits. These would, on net, boost federal revenues by $45.8 \n     billion over the next five years. Revenue raisers include a \n     55-cent-per-pack hike in the federal cigarette tax and higher \n     corporate income taxes. The revenue reducers are a myriad of \n     tax credits that would subsidize activities ranging from \n     long-term medical care to first-time home purchases in the \n     District of Columbia.\n\n\n               Which Income Groups Will Pay the New Taxes\n\n       Figure 1 shows the net distributional effects of the \n     Clinton plan. Individuals with adjusted gross incomes of less \n     than $25,000 would bear 38.5 percent of the increased tax \n     burden, or $17.7 billion. People in the $25,000-$50,000 range \n     would pay 22.4 percent of the new revenue, or $10.2 billion. \n     Taxpayers making $50,000-$75,000 would pay $6.7 billion in \n     additional taxes, or approximately 14.6 percent of the total. \n     In sum, then, over 75 percent of the President's new tax \n     revenue would be paid by people whose tax returns report less \n     than $75,000.\n       Upper-income taxpayers would not escape entirely, but as \n     Figure 1 illustrates, their share of the increased tax burden \n     is much smaller. Cumulatively, individuals in these three \n     categories would bear only 24.5 percent of the increased tax \n     burden. This regressive slant against low- and middle-income \n     taxpayers results largely from the Administration's proposal \n     to boost the federal cigarette tax. Probably the most \n     regressive of all federal taxes, the cigarette tax would be \n     the largest revenue raiser in the President's budget \n     proposal.\n\n\n                           The Budget Outlook\n\n       Figure 2 illustrates federal receipts and outlays as a \n     percentage of GDP under the Clinton plan, given in historical \n     context.\n       Federal receipts would grow 4.2 percent from $1,806.3 \n     billion in 1999 to $1,883.0 billion in 2000. That is an \n     uptick from 20.6 percent to 20.7 percent of GDP. By 2004, \n     federal receipts would grow to $2,165.5 billion, or 20.0 \n     percent of GDP. By 2009, federal receipts would rise to \n     $2,707.7 billion, or 20.1 percent of GDP.\n       Only twice in American history--during the two closing \n     years of World War II--did federal receipts ever exceed 20 \n     percent of GDP. From this perspective, the Clinton proposal \n     is truly historic in that it would fix federal receipts at \n     this extraordinary level.\n       Federal outlays would rise from $1,727.1 billion in FY 1999 \n     to $1,765.7 billion in FY 2000. They would rise to $1,992.0 \n     billion in 2004. As a percentage of GDP, however, federal \n     outlays would fall steadily from 19.4 percent in FY 2000 to \n     18.4 percent in 2004, then even further to around 17 percent \n     in FY 2009.\n\n\n                          federal expenditures\n\n       The budget shares of the major categories of federal \n     spending under the Clinton plan are illustrated by the five \n     columns of Figure 3 corresponding with fiscal years 2000-\n     2004. Historical data is provided for context. (See also \n     Tables 1 and 2.)\n       Federal outlays are divided into two broad categories, \n     discretionary and mandatory/net interest. Discretionary \n     spending is determined by the annual appropriations process, \n     while so-called mandatory outlays are predetermined by \n     statute. To alter mandatory spending levels, the program's \n     authorizing legislation must be amended.\n\n     ______________\n\n     * Illustrations not reproducible in the Record.\n\n

Pay $5,307 More in Taxes Than \n   Needed--CRS Estimates 10-Year Tax Overpayment for U.S. Households\n\n       Washington.--With no changes to current law, the average \n     American household will pay $5,307 more in taxes than the \n     government needs to operate over the next ten years, \n     according to a new study by the non-partisan Congressional \n     Research Service (CRS) released today by Ways and Means \n     Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX). Of particular \n     importance is that CRS calculated the tax overpayment using \n     the non-Social Security budget surplus. The CRS study follows \n     this release.\n       ``After we reserve Social Security dollars for Social \n     Security, Americans will still overpay their taxes. There are \n     a lot of politicans in Washington who want to keep this money \n     and spend it on more government programs, but I think \n     Americans should keep it for themselves and their families. \n     Five thousand dollars is a lot of money for hardworking \n     taxpayers who deserve to keep more of what they earn,'' said \n     Chairman Archer.\n       CRS calculated the annual overpayment per household based \n     on the non-Social Security budget surplus as follows:\nFiscal year:                                                     Amount\n  2000.................................................................\n  2001..............................................................$42\n  2002..............................................................385\n  2003..............................................................331\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\n  2004..............................................................432\n  2005..............................................................486\n  2006..............................................................758\n  2007..............................................................867\n  2008..............................................................941\n  2009............................................................1,065\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n5,307al..............................................................\n                                  ____\n\n\n    [Memorandum from the Congressional Research Service, Library of \n                        Congress, Mar. 16, 1999]\n\n     To: Committee on Ways and Means, Attention: Trent Duffy.\n     From: Gregg A. Esenwein, Specialist in Public Finance, \n         Government and Finance.\n     Subject: Per household tax cut financed by the on-budget \n         surplus.\n       The following table has been prepared in response to your \n     recent request concerning the effects of a federal tax cut \n     using only the non-social security budget surplus. It is \n     intended to provide only a rough estimate of the per \n     household in federal income taxes that could be funded using \n     only the on-budget surplus.\n       The first column of the table shows fiscal years, the \n     second column shows the baseline unified total budget \n     surplus, the third column shows the on-budget deficit/surplus \n     (the budget deficit/surplus excluding social security and the \n     Postal Service), the fourth column shows the projected number \n     of households for each year, and the fifth column is the \n     dollar amount of tax cut per filing unit (column three \n     divided by column four).\n       I hope this information meets your needs in this matter.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Lautenberg if he would give me 2 minutes \nof his time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He said he will yield me 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just say that I believe, after talking to \nSenator Lautenberg, the staffs can work together on this and that the \nsense-of-the-Senate part of this amendment, advocating the kind of tax \ncuts that were referred to by the Senator in his sense-of-the-Senate \nparagraph, might be acceptable to Senator Lautenberg, and we can then \naccept it without a vote. But I would just like to make an observation \nwhile we wait to see whether that will happen. I hope it doesn't make \nthe Senator from New Jersey change his mind. I don't think it will.\n  Frankly, I said a while ago it is easier to manage a budget when we \nare not in surplus. I am almost prepared to say it is easier for the \ntaxpayer to get a tax cut when we do not have a surplus than when we \ndo.\n  Now, I haven't checked the history of the last six or seven tax cut \nbills, but obviously we were not in balance because we just got in \nbalance. We gave tax cuts because we thought they were necessary, \nprudent. To the American people, our businesses, large and small, \nothers--maybe those who have their businesses at home--ought to be able \nto deduct their health care like everyone else. We come around and say \nthose things ought to be done.\n  Now we have a surplus, and I will be darned; it is tougher to get \nconcurrence that we ought to give some of it back to the people than \nwhen we borrowed it to give it back to them. So I was thinking as the \ndebate occurred, who has been forgotten by this Government? Who is \nlooked upon as sort of a silent partner in all this but shouldn't be \nterribly worried about it? It seems to me it is the taxpayer.\n  Asked on our side, we would say reducing taxes, making sure Social \nSecurity is fixed--and we have done that. Everybody is now joining us \non 100 percent of the surplus when held for that --Medicare; we have \nhad a bipartisan approach here saying let's get it done--and that \nleaves the taxpayer. I kind of say, poor taxpayers. We ought to put \nthem right up at the top, and that is sort of what the intention of my \nfriend from Minnesota was. Whatever the language, laudatory or, as \nSenator Nickles said the other day, precatory--if you want to look it \nup in the dictionary, it is pretty much like laudatory. And if you \ndon't know what that means, I don't know what to tell you. But there is \na lot of that. In any event, the sense of the Senate at the bottom says \nwe recognize the taxpayers are very important and we ought to look at \nthem just as we look at new programs. I certainly say it is important \nthat we do that.\n  I yield back whatever of the 2 minutes I did not use.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just heard, I think I will call it \nthe chairman's lament, and that is here we have all this money and we \ncan't give tax breaks. But I see the tax breaks as having a funny shape \nto them. They are big for the guy at the top and they are little for \nthe people who need it most. But I would say this, that the only people \nwho can add a new room to the house, get a child some special \nassistance with education, prepare retirement, ensure health care is \navailable are those who have some surplus. That is when you do the good \nthings. And the good things to me are not to take care of the guys at \nthe top, who would get another 20 grand, to use the expression, on top \nof the $800,000 they make. I don't think they need help. But the person \nwho is making $38,000, a family of four, they are struggling. They are \nstruggling. They are trying to find a way to take care of all the needs \nas the kids grow, and it is a difficult, difficult problem.\n\n  So I do not object to appropriate tax breaks. I don't object to tax \nbreaks for long-term health care. I don't object to tax breaks for \nchild care so that mom can go to work and help dad support the family, \nor vice versa. I don't object to any of those things.\n  So with that I think we have probably heard each other enough. Can we \nyield back all the time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't think they have any time left.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No. I have some time on my side, I think.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I feel benevolent, and I am going to yield back my \ntime and we will try to resolve our problem so that we can accept the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 231, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I send a modification of the amendment to \nthe desk. With a few changes, hopefully, it has been accepted on both \nsides. We submit this amendment and hope to get it approved.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection and we have no time remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are all set.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the proposed \nmodification? Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 231), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF SENATE ON PROVIDING TAX RELIEF TO ALL \n                   AMERICANS BY RETURNING NON-SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   SURPLUS TO TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Every cent of Social Security surplus should be \n     reserved to pay Social Security benefits, for Social Security \n     reform, or to pay down the debt held by the public and not be \n     used for other purposes.\n       (2) Medicare should be fully funded.\n       (3) Even after safeguarding Social Security and Medicare, a \n     recent Congressional Research Service study found that an \n     average American family will pay $5,307 more in taxes over \n     the next 10 years than the government needs to operate.\n       (4) The Administration's budget returns none of the excess \n     surplus back to the taxpayers and instead increases net taxes \n     and fees by $96,000,000,000 over 10 years.\n       (5) The burden of the Administration's tax increases falls \n     disproportionately on low- and middle-income taxpayers. A \n     recent Tax Foundation study found that individuals with \n     incomes of less than $25,000 would bear 38.5 percent of the \n     increased tax burden,\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\n     while taxpayers with incomes between $25,000 and $50,000 \n     would pay 22.4 percent of the new taxes.\n       (6) The budget resolution returns most of the non-Social \n     Security surplus to those who worked so hard to produce it by \n     providing $142,000,000,000 in real tax relief over 5 years \n     and almost $800,000,000,000 in tax relief over 10 years.\n       (7) The budget resolution builds on the following tax \n     relief since 1995:\n       (B) In 1996, Congress provided, and the President signed, \n     tax relief for small business and health care-related tax \n     relief.\n       (C) In 1997, Congress once again pushed for tax relief in \n     the context of a balanced budget, and President Clinton \n     signed into law a $500 per child tax credit, expanded \n     individual retirement accounts and the new Roth IRA, a cut in \n     the capital gains tax rate, education tax relief, and estate \n     tax relief.\n       (D) In 1998, Congress pushed for reform of the Internal \n     Revenue Service, and provided tax relief for America's \n     farmers.\n       (8) Americans deserve further tax relief because they are \n     still overpaying. They deserve a refund. Federal taxes \n     currently consume nearly 21 percent of national income, the \n     highest percentage since World War II. Families are paying \n     more in Federal, State, and local taxes than for food, \n     clothing, and shelter combined.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the levels in this resolution assume that the Senate \n     not only puts a priority on protecting Social Security and \n     Medicare and reducing the Federal debt, but also on middle-\n     class tax relief by returning some of the non-Social Security \n     surplus to those from whom it was taken; and\n       (2) such middle-class tax relief could include broad-based \n     tax relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings \n     incentives, estate tax relief, savings and investment \n     incentives, health care-related tax relief, education-related \n     tax relief, and tax simplification proposals.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. And approved?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And it is accepted.\n  They can urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no time left on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 231), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe the regular order is to proceed \nnow to my amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 190\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I call up amendment No. 190.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I add as original \ncosponsors Senator Lautenberg, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Hollings, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, and Senator \nConrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is an amendment, really, of common \nsense and I think fiscal responsibility. It is a very simple amendment \nthat I believe is a safeguard, an important safeguard, against our \nreturning to an era of deficit spending. This amendment includes no new \nspending, no new programs, it does not touch the budget authority, it \ndoes not touch outlays as proposed in the budget resolution. Neither \ndoes it affect in any way whatsoever the Social Security trust funds.\n  Perhaps most important to many Members on the other side of the \naisle, this amendment does not eliminate any of the tax relief that is \nprovided in the budget resolution. Indeed, Congress can and Congress \nshould consider sensible tax cuts which are targeted towards helping \nworking families to meet their growing needs, whether it is health care \nor child care or buying a first home or any number of other things--\nsaving to send a child to college--there are a number of tax cuts I \nthink all of us can agree on. Those tax incentives will help Americans \nto plan and to save for retirement and to build the economy of the \ncountry.\n  My amendment simply directs that the tax cuts we authorize, that we \npass today in the budget resolution, will not rely on deficit spending \nto fund them. That is it. It is a very simple proposition: We should \nnot pass a tax cut that will rely on deficit spending in order to fund \nit.\n  In the Budget Committee's report accompanying this resolution, \nChairman Domenici and his colleagues say the following, and I quote \nChairman Domenici:\n\n       The whole premise of this resolution is to ensure that the \n     onbudget deficit is eliminated and to prohibit consideration \n     of legislation resulting in an on-budget deficit in the \n     future.\n  So the chairman and his colleagues who have voted for this budget \nhave brought it to the floor of the Senate with the statement that it \nis their purpose to prevent a future onbudget deficit by having any \nlegislation that would create that deficit. I applaud the chairman and \nhis colleagues for that effort to maintain the course of fiscal \ndiscipline which we began in 1993 with the Deficit Reduction Act, which \nhas put us on this path. To keep on that path is both progrowth and \nfiscally responsible. I am offering my amendment to ensure this year's \ntax provisions cannot and will not result in deficit spending.\n  Under my amendment, if the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \ndetermines that the tax cut passed in this year's reconciliation bill \nwould result in an onbudget deficit in the future, under the scoring \nperiods we are currently applying for budget purposes, then all I would \ndo is simply delay that tax cut for 1 year. We do not repeal it. We do \nnot end it. We do not take it away. We simply delay it for the purposes \nof not being confronted with deficit spending in order to fund it.\n  The amendment itself would not affect the tax cuts once they become \neffective.\n  The budget we have before us sets aside the Social Security surplus \nfor debt reduction, but, as every single one of my colleagues knows, \nthe Social Security surplus is only one portion of the projected \nsurplus over the next 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office \nprojects an onbudget, obviously non-Social Security, surplus that will \nbe more than $800 billion over the next 10 years. That is the \nprojection.\n  If the Finance Committee reports out a tax bill later this year, \nthose tax provisions will become law, and they become law not just for \nthis year but they become law for the next year and the next year and \nthe outyears. They will take effect regardless of what happens to the \ncurrent projections on the economy. But most of them will not be \neffective until the year 2005.\n  All of us in this institution understand that our predictive \ncapacities are not so honed that we are going to guarantee we have the \nrevenues in the year 2005 in order to pay for the new tax breaks while \nstill doing the other things the budget requires. So the last thing I \nthink any of us would want to do is set up an equation where we put \ninto law today $800 billion worth of projected surplus, therefore tax \ncuts, but, lo and behold, the surplus is not there but the tax cuts are \nstill in law. The question then will be, How do we fund them?\n  It seems to me there ought to be precautions taken against this kind \nof fiscal irresponsibility. If the projected onbudget surplus suddenly \ndisappears during the intervening years, we want to avoid the crisis \nthat will occur when those tax provisions are in law. If we were to \ncreate an automatic push onto the next year, we would wind up in a \nsituation where we have not promised a tax cut that cannot be \ndelivered, we have not promised a tax cut that is going to force us \ninto deficit spending or into other choices that are similarly \nunpalatable.\n  That is the simplicity of this budget amendment. Under this \namendment, we can guarantee if the surplus actually materializes, tax \ncuts passed this year will not be affected, they will go into effect. \nBut if the current economic projections change for the worse and the \nsurplus turns out to be considerably smaller or nonexistent, we will \ndelay the effect of the tax cuts and avoid the crisis of that moment. I \nthink it is common sense. It is a sound way to budget. It is an \nappropriate way to make a determination instead of promising a tax cut \nthat can either never materialize or that takes you into a position of \nfiscal irresponsibility.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Kerry have?\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And 15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to use very much time.\n  Mr. President, first of all, as I read the amendment, I wondered, I \ncould not quite figure out what was going wrong. Essentially this \namendment is subject to a point of order, because we do not have \nauthority to tell the Finance Committee in a reconciliation instruction \nto do this. The law says what we can do in a reconciliation bill, and \nit does not include ordering them to trigger taxes. It says reduce \ntaxes by a given amount over the period of time reflected in the \nreconciliation agreement. So it is subject to a point of order which I \nwill raise when we come around to voting.\n  But aside from that, it seems to me if you write a tax law for the \nNation, that any tax law you write is an ongoing tax law. Once you put \nit in, it is ongoing, at least the general tax provisions, unless you \nwant to sunset it or the like. Frankly, I do not believe it would be \nappropriate to trigger a tax on and off depending upon what the \nonbudget surplus is.\n  In addition, I do not want to say too much about this, but our \nlockbox is a pretty good safeguard that we will not be spending Social \nSecurity surpluses in the future, because if you have to borrow any \nextra money, then you need a 60-vote point of order. So I think the \nSenator can rest assured if we vote for the lockbox as contemplated \nwherein the debt limit is going to be affected and you will have to \nraise it, I think it will be a pretty good indication we cannot go \nsignificantly in the red in future years, even with a tax cut that \noccurs in years prior to that. Something will have to be done.\n  I compliment the Senator for his concern about fiscal responsibility. \nI am sure inherent in this is his concurrence we ought to have some tax \ncuts. I am not sure which of the various amendments he has agreed to \nheretofore on how much. But I compliment him for being concerned, but I \ncould not accept it and I do not think it would be valid if we did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute and then I will \nyield to the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. President, let me say to my colleague who really understands \nbudget well and understands fiscal matters well, this is not about \nSocial Security. Indeed, the lockbox will protect Social Security. I am \nnot here in this amendment worried about Social Security. I am talking \nabout the onbudget surplus predicted today. That onbudget surplus could \ndisappear. Indeed, the budget resolution claims to save $133 billion of \nthe onbudget surplus over 10 years, but only $14 billion is saved in \nthe first 5 years.\n  They are going to write in some $600 billion of tax cuts in the \noutyears without any capacity to predict that this country will have a \nsurplus or have the capacity to support that.\n  What happens when that is in the law, the chairman sits down in 5 \nyears, if he is still chairman, and he says, oh, we have these big tax \ncuts we have to fund, but we don't have the money for it? Where will it \ncome from? That is when we are going to have a battle over every other \nprogram, or the tax cuts are phony.\n  I am not taking the tax cut away. I am simply saying, if CBO tells us \nin that year there is no money to fund it, you delay it a year. That \nseems to be the most fundamental common sense of how most Americans \nwould decide to handle their budgets. If you cannot afford it, you \ndon't do it. That is what we are trying to ask for, fiscal \nresponsibility, not a flimflam show.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I support Senator Kerry's amendment to delay new tax \ncuts if projected surpluses do not materialize. Medicare has a \ncompelling need for revenues in the future that should not be \njeopardized by tax cuts, especially knowing that these costs for tax \ncuts would explode substantially in the outyears.\n  I want to mention for my colleagues some history. The fiscal year \n1982 budget projected surpluses were just around the corner. We all \nknow what happened to those projected surpluses after the massive 1982 \ntax cut. We have also seen in recent years how wrong both CBO and OMB \nestimates have been as the economy has consistently outperformed all \nprojections. Projecting long-term budget results is really an art, not \na science.\n  This budget resolution relies heavily on estimates of surpluses going \nso far out as to adjust them during the summer. If such short-term \nestimates are being taken into account, we also ought to take into \naccount the long-term realities. If the surpluses do not materialize, \nthe tax cuts they are based on should be delayed until the surpluses \nare there.\n  We just heard the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee talk \nabout tax cuts being permanently in law. We still do not fully \nunderstand why the commonly referred to ``revenue surprise'' has \noccurred, and we don't know honestly how long it is going to last.\n  My Republican colleagues often say, we are returning excess revenues \nto the taxpayers. I put it to them, if the tax revenues are not there \nin the future, should we drain away resources from Medicare to provide \ntax cuts?\n  Today we are phasing in tax cuts over long periods to obscure their \nrevenue effects. If we implement tax breaks which create huge outyear \nrevenue losses and the economy fails to perform as well as predicted, \nwe could return to the world of deficits as far as the eye can see, \njust in time for the baby boomers to begin retiring.\n  Very simply, Mr. President, I think this is a sound amendment. It \nsays, don't give it away unless you know very well that you are on \ntarget.\n  I think it is a reasonable position. I think it is fiscally sound. I \nhope that our colleagues will vote for the Kerry amendment.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will use 1 minute and yield back my \ntime so the Senator can have the rest of the time.\n  Frankly, many years ago I came to the floor--Senator Nunn helped me; \nhe wasn't even on the Budget Committee--and I did something like this \nfor entitlement programs.\n  I said, if the projections in the outyears are that it is going up so \nhigh that it creates a bigger deficit, then maybe we ought not spend \nthe money, having programs that we spend money on automatic pilot. \nMaybe when we come around and say we are going to do that to taxes, we \nare going to do that to entitlements, we are going to do that to \neverything we spend on, we are going to trigger them all and, if we get \na deficit, we cut them all so we are right back down to zero and \nincurring no debt.\n  Why should we do this to the taxpayer on the most important thing \nthey can ask of their Government, and that is that they not be taxed \ntoo much? That is what they are looking up here asking us for. The big \nbroad base that keeps America going and pays for all these programs, \nthey would like some tax relief. We say, we will trigger you, we will \ngive you some, but in case the deficit goes up, we will take it away \nfrom you, or at least it won't continue to grow, even though we passed \nit and it is in the law.\n  I think maybe that would be a great idea so we could stay in balance \nforever. Let's apply that to everything. Just think of that. We are in \nbalance. Nothing could ever grow, if it puts us in the red again. \nEverything would get stopped that year. No entitlements could grow, \nnothing could. That would be treating everybody kind of fairly.\n  We would never do that. We shouldn't do that to the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say quickly to my colleague \nfrom New Mexico, he has been a real deficit hawk, and I admire the way \nin which he has fought it over the years he has been here. But he knows \nas well as I do that we have actually changed significantly our \nattitude and our approach towards entitlements. We have changed\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\nsignificantly the entire budget structure from those years when he \ntried to do that with Senator Nunn.\n  The fact is, we now operate under very strict caps. I think for the \nlast 10 or 12 years of the 15 I have been here, we have been cutting in \nmost places, except a couple of areas where, in order to hold Social \nSecurity whole, we made some changes in the revenue stream.\n  The fact is, we have made significant reductions. All I am asking for \nhere is--in 1993, we had the biggest turnaround of all. I remember my \ncolleagues arguing that you had to have a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States. If you didn't do that, you \ncouldn't change the economy of this country or our budgeting practice. \nWell, the fact is, we proved them wrong. In 1993, we changed the entire \nbudgeting process and turned it around so that we now have the balanced \nbudget and the surplus that we are talking about.\n  The American people would like us to apply the same discipline now \ngoing forward that we applied to get to this position. The fact is that \nAmericans do not want us to create a deficit to give them a tax cut. \nAsk any American: Do you want me to add to the debt of the country so I \ncan give you back some money today? They would say: That is absurd. Why \nwould you add to the debt of the country in order to put a few dollars \ninto my pocket?\n  Americans overwhelmingly want the surplus applied to debt reduction. \nThat is what they say. All I am doing in this amendment is asking my \ncolleagues to exercise the same responsibility about tax cuts that they \nhave asked everybody to exercise about every other part of the budget.\n  This is about deficit spending to support a tax cut. The vast \nmajority of Americans would say, don't be so crazy, don't promise me \nsome great big tax cut that actually adds to the debt of the country \nand maybe even deprives my mother or father of Medicare payments and \nmaybe even deprives my kid of a loan to go to college or a number of \nother things.\n  There is no way in that balance that that is the choice Americans \nwould make. I ask my colleagues today to join in making a responsible \nvote on the issue of this budget. We should not fund a tax cut we can't \nafford down the road. Nothing in my amendment would deny us the ability \nto have a tax cut if the surplus is there. If you have a surplus, you \nwill have a tax cut. That is about as decent and fiscally responsible \nan equation as you could ask for.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, has all time been yielded back on the \nKerry amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator still has 14 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yielded back my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 242\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there was an amendment which was known \nas Ashcroft-Gorton, No. 242. We understand that it is acceptable on the \nother side. We do not think it ought to be held in the package here. No \nvote is needed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order that the amendment be \naccepted by the Senate without objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The yeas \nand nays are vitiated.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 242) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Lautenberg for clearing the amendment.\n  Now we can proceed to the next amendment, Senator Craig's amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire, what are the time \nconstraints in relation to the debate on this amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Craig, I made a mistake. Senator \nHollings was next. It is 3 and a half minutes. Would you let him \nproceed?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, I will. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He was listed next.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. By unanimous consent, Mr. President, I ask that \nSenator Hollings be given 5 minutes instead of 3 and a half to present \nhis case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 174\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I call up amendment No. 174 offered by myself and the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we just heard the word ``surplus.'' We \nhave seen a lot of charts. But the truth of the matter is that we are \nspending $100 billion more than we are taking in this year. And the \nCongressional Budget Office projects that we will spend $89.9 billion \nor $90 billion more next year just under current policy, in the face of \nthat current policy, taking care of inflation.\n  We hear all kinds of ``visions of sugar plums dancing in their \nheads'' on this floor. We have turned the Senate Chamber into a \nrecording studio for campaign 2000. And everybody is saying, ``Well, $2 \nbillion more for the veterans and $8 billion more for the farmers, and \n$15 billion more for the military pay, and so much more for education. \nAnd, by the way, we ought to have a tax cut. But remember, we have \nspending caps, and we have to stay within the caps.'' They know, of \ncourse, that we exceeded the caps last year by $12 billion and this \nyear by $21 billion. So already we have exceeded the caps by $33 \nbillion, plus the $18 billion that we voted for the military pay. We \nought to be looking for $50 billion to make up for this, but we are \nadding on all of these fanciful figures.\n  So what we really ought to do is bring a note of reality, a note of \nwhat the situation actually is, to the debate and get a budget that we \ncan vote on.\n  Here is the lead editorial of USA Today. And I quote it:\n\n       If your member of Congress comes home this weekend bragging \n     about having adopted a responsible federal budget for the \n     coming year, don't you believe it.\n       The $1.7 trillion spending and tax outlines being muscled \n     through the House and Senate this week are little more than \n     the budgetary equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes [or the \n     emperor had no clothes]: Behind the self-congratulatory hype \n     there's a lot of nothing--and the real possibility of another \n     political train wreck later in the year.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment is offered in order to avoid that train \nwreck. And how do we do it? We do it as Alan Greenspan, the head of the \nFederal Reserve, said: ``Do nothing.''\n  I thought it was very interesting: in the Banking and Housing \nCommittee we had the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, in a \ndiscourse with Mr. Greenspan.\n  Quoting Senator Sarbanes near the end of the questioning: ``So it \nseems to me for this whole host of reasons I agree with what I \nunderstand to be your position; that is, of all the alternatives the \none you rate first and foremost by a significant margin would be to use \nthe surplus to pay down the debt.''\n\n  Greenspan: ``That is correct, Senator.''\n  Sarbanes: ``Yes, I--how do you save that surplus? You know, how do \nyou keep it from getting spent, I guess is the question?''\n  Greenspan: ``What happens is that you do nothing.''\n  Namely, you freeze this budget with respect to the current policy. \nYou take this year's budget for next year, you program it out, and you \nget to a real surplus in the year 2006. Thereupon, Mr. President, that \nis the real surplus; and thereupon, we will direct that surplus--if it \nmaterializes--to paying down the debt, and we will give everybody a \nreal tax cut, because the interest rates will go down. And they will \nsave all the mortgage homeowners--the automobile payments, the \nrefrigerator payments, the washing machine payments. Everybody in \ncredit-card America will get a real tax cut.\n  The point is that we have been playing the game of paying down the \ndebt that is not understood really by the American people in that we \nhave been using Social Security to pay down the debt for the last 15 \nyears.\n  What we do is, we just take the Social Security credit card and look \nover\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\nhere to what they call public debt or the Wall Street credit card and \npay off that debt to the payers with the credit from Social Security; \nand you just up the debt on Social Security. You still owe the same. It \nis like taking a Visa card and paying down your MasterCard; and, of \ncourse, your Visa card goes up. That gamesmanship, Mr. President, has \nbeen going on, to the point that we have fiscal cancer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Could I get a few more minutes? Would you give me 2 \nmore minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional \n2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  What has happened really is we have caused the debt in Social \nSecurity. This minute, Social Security is in the red $730 billion. Next \nyear it will be in the red $867 billion. And by the year 2009, we will \nowe $2.6 trillion to Social Security.\n  Now, if we hold the line--staying the course; the economy is good; \ninflation is down; unemployment is down--if we stay the course, it is a \nresponsible budget and we can maintain the good economy here in \nAmerica.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina does have the virtue of consistency. He was one of three \nmembers of his party the night before last who voted against \nauthorizing a war in Yugoslavia. And this budget resolution, among \nother things, does not raise the caps for national defense--a point \nthat most Members feel is necessary after many years of shortchanging \nit. It does not permit any tax relief, it does not permit any change in \npriorities for education, as does the budget that is before us at the \npresent time.\n  In fact, it is based on the proposition that the country is unchanged \nfrom where it was when we voted on the budget a year ago. I believe the \nbudget that we have here today is preferable to the one we had a year \nago, partly because for the last year we have been very, very \nsuccessful.\n  But, clearly, we are going to need the flexibility to pay for \nsomething that the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and the \nPresiding Officer and I voted against the other night which is going to \nhave to be paid for at this point. And the only way to do so is to show \nthe flexibility that this budget resolution does.\n  So I oppose the amendment of the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 146\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the time limitations on \neach amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and one-half minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Three and three-quarters.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  My amendment would require that new mandatory spending programs be \npaid for with savings in existing mandatory programs, and it would \nestablish a 60-vote point of order. We have known--since we have had \nlimits on discretionary programs as the chart beside me demonstrates--a \nprogressive reduction in the overall size of the discretionary spending \nwithin our budget.\n  My amendment does not affect any existing mandatory program. My \namendment does not impact any current or future beneficiary of existing \nprograms. What I am talking about is new mandatory, new direct spending \nprograms, and it doesn't eliminate them, either. It simply requires \nthat any Senator who brings that kind of program to the floor must \nexperience the support of at least 60 of the Members of the Senate to \nbe able to withstand this point of order.\n  My amendment will not prevent a tax increase and its use of debt and \ndeficit reduction. That is simply not the case. It simply puts on equal \nfooting new spending in mandatory areas, along with current \ndiscretionary spending.\n  My amendment institutes a milder version of the same spending \nrestrictions that have applied to appropriated spending programs since \n1990. I think it is easy to understand. Last year we received 54 votes. \nIt is a bipartisan effort. Senator Kerrey will speak to it. Senator \nRobb and Senator Byrd have supported me in this effort, and have \nindicated their continued support in that area. It is that very effort \nthat limits the kind of growth in our budget that we have always tried \nto do in creating balance.\n\n  Senator Kerrey has arrived on the floor, and I yield him the \nremainder of our time.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to join the Senator from Idaho. This \namendment would apply the same budgetary restrictions to mandatory \nprograms that we have on discretionary programs. Mandatory programs are \ngrowing faster than the discretionary programs. We are converting our \nbudget from one that used to be almost entirely discretionary, endowing \nour future, into a budget that is largely mandated by law.\n  This simply says if we are going to add a new mandatory program, you \ndo as you would with the discretionary program: You need to have 60 \nvotes to get the job done. It doesn't mean you can't; it just raises \nthe bar as high as it is on discretionary programs.\n  I hope my colleagues see the wisdom of this and will support it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 33 seconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I reserve that time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because it \nwill prohibit using revenues to offset new mandatory spending and \ninstead will require that all new mandatory spending be offset with \nother mandatory cuts. It is a major change in law. If there is a \nmandatory expenditure, commonly called entitlement, the fact of the \nmatter is that we ought not be changing it by restricting funding. We \nought to change the law. Change the law and you have taken care of the \nproblem.\n  But I don't think this is an appropriate way to do it. Programs like \nSocial Security and Medicare could be affected, and I think it is an \ninappropriate way to do it.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am willing to yield back the reminder.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me conclude using my 30 seconds to say that it does \nnot impact, as the Senator has just said, current programs. We are \ntalking new creations, new ideas, new entitlement programs--not Social \nSecurity, not Medicare, not those kinds of critical programs that this \nCongress and this Senate attempt to strengthen and protect.\n  I am talking about the new ideas that come along. It doesn't limit \nthem, either. It simply says that you have to gain the 60-vote majority \nhere in the Senate; you have to find new revenue sources for them or \npull revenue from existing mandatory areas.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska has so clearly spoken, it brings on \nbalance in our budget new mandatory programs with current discretionary \nprograms.\n  Here is the simple relationship: The red on the chart shows the \nprogressive decline in discretionary spending since we have had pay-go \nenforcement there. This has been the kind of growth in mandatory when \nwe had none of that budget authority, and, therefore, budget \nrestriction.\n  That is the issue of this amendment. I encourage my colleagues here \nin the Senate to support it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I don't think this amendment is germane and, \ntherefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for a waiver of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Are we ordering the yeas and nays now?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We neglected, when Senator Hollings presented his\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\namendment No. 174, to ask for the yeas and nays. We ask for the yeas \nand nays on amendment No. 174.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Carolina be given 5 minutes to speak on another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk for proper referral a \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the introduction of S. 720 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 185\n\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding, under the \nunanimous consent agreement, that it is my turn to speak for 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes in support of my amendment. I don't have the number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 185, as previously offered.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a procedural change relating to \nthe times when the Senate considers emergency spending. Examples are \ndisaster aid, when an area has been hit by a flood, or the need for \nmore money in the Department of Defense, for example. We may have \nemergency spending that is necessary because of the Kosovo military \noperation. I don't believe a single Member would stand in the way of \nproviding all the resources necessary to bring our men and women home \nsafely. Other emergency spending might be something as esoteric as the \nY2K crisis--whether we are going to be able to respond quickly enough \nso the Government computers will be in line and not cause any problem \nto provide services. Those are examples of emergency spending, and the \nSenate can decide by a majority vote whether to change the basic caps \nor limits on spending because of an emergency.\n  Now there is a provision in this budget resolution which changes that \ndramatically and says that any emergency provision is going to require \na supermajority vote from now on--60 votes. I oppose that. I don't \nbelieve that is good policy. I think that a majority of the Senators \nshould be allowed to decide whether or not this Nation and this Senate \nface an emergency situation that requires a majority vote only to go \nforward and spend the necessary funds. Setting up a supermajority \nallows the minority in this body to become more or less the political \nbrokers in an emergency situation.\n  I don't want to see that occur. We debated this in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and reached a bipartisan agreement--involving \nSenators Thompson and Domenici on the Republican side, and involving \nSenator Lieberman, myself, and others on the Democratic side--that we \nwould stick with the majority vote. Then I was surprised to see that in \nthe budget resolution our bipartisan agreement has been vitiated, and \nnow we are dealing with another requirement for supermajority.\n  My amendment goes back to the simple majority requirement for \nemergency spending. It is supported by Senator Lieberman from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the ranking Democrat, as well as \nSenator Robert Byrd, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  At this point, I will retain the remainder of my time. I don't know \nif the rules require me to use it in all one fell swoop.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator can spread it around, if he has any time \nleft.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there any time left of the 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 1 minute 23 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I retain the remainder of my time. Somebody might wish to \nspeak on the other side of this issue.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the provision in this budget resolution \nthat the distinguished Senator from Illinois seeks to strike is there \nfor one quite simple reason, and that is that while we have created a \ndiscipline for ourselves through spending caps, and while within those \nspending caps we are able to determine appropriations on the basis of a \nsimple majority vote, Members have discovered that all they need to do \nis declare an ``emergency,'' whether one exists or not, and they are \nfree from the budget caps, from the very spending discipline that has \nbeen central to our economic success over the course of the last 3 or 4 \nyears.\n  As a consequence, the requirement that in order to declare an \nemergency, in order to spend money that is outside of the caps, in \norder, essentially, in this fiscal year to invade the Social Security \nsurplus will require a modest supermajority.\n  Now, under those circumstances, Mr. President, that seems to me to be \neminently reasonable. If there is a true emergency, won't 60 votes be \navailable? The Senator from Illinois refers to our members of our Armed \nForces in Yugoslavia. Now, Mr. President, it beggars belief to feel \nthat 60 votes will not be able to support our Armed Forces when they \nare engaged in conflict. The same thing is going to be true with \nrespect to any other emergency. But to allow spending limitations that \na majority of the Senate has put into effect, spending limitations that \nare so important to our success, to be frivolously overridden and \nignored simply by a 51-vote majority is not responsible budgeting.\n  This provision is there because of our experience in the last couple \nof years with the declaration of emergencies for emergency spending \npurposes. Mr. President, I am sure that, along with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, we feel the provision in this budget resolution is \nextremely sound, highly responsible, and should be retained.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will yield all of my remaining time \nafter making one comment. The Senator from Washington suggests that a \nmajority vote is a ``simple thing.'' A majority vote is how we rule in \nthe United States of America. It is the exception which requires a \nsupermajority.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and I point out that when we are talking about \nemergencies, we are talking about things like a volcanic eruption in \nthe State of Washington, Mt. Saint Helens, or we are talking about an \nearthquake in California, or floods down the Mississippi, or storm \ndamage in the Northeast. I don't know why it should take 60 votes to \nagree with maybe someone who has taken an unpopular political position \nearlier. I think we ought to let the majority rule. If we need changes \nin the emergency definition, I would certainly go along with that. Make \nsure that it is urgent. Make sure it is an emergency. But to suggest \nthat simply because we don't have enough votes that the volcanic damage \nis worth cleaning up immediately, or some oil spill isn't worth dealing \nwith immediately, frankly, I think is bad law. I think we ought to \neliminate it from this budget resolution.\n  I hope that the vote on the amendment by the Senator from Illinois \nwill prevail.\n  I yield the time.\n  I ask the Republican leader, is there another amendment to be \ndiscussed?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On our side Senator Crapo was next. He will be here in \n3 minutes. We can go to Senator Sessions, and then Senator Crapo will \nbe last.\n  Is Senator Sessions ready? The Senator has 3\\1/2\\.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 210\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to rise in support and \nexpress my support for an amendment called the ``Class Act,'' a sense \nof the Senate.\n  The purpose of that Act is to deal with a growing problem in America. \nIn the 1990s alone--we are not through the 1990s yet--we have \naccumulated more debt for college and higher education\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\nthan we have in the prior three decades, in the prior 30 years. We have \nan accelerating amount of debt to pay for college education. People are \ngraduating with more debt than they have ever graduated with before. \nAnd it is a disruption to them and their families as they start to \nbuild their careers.\n\n  So what is the problem? How has this happened? I don't propose the \n``Class Act'' amendment that I have worked to introduce along with \nSenator Bob Graham of Florida will solve that problem, but at least it \nis a significant step in the right direction.\n  What we have been doing as a Government is subsidizing debt and \ntaxing savings for college. That is the bottom line to it. If you save \nmoney for college, you pay taxes on it. But the Government will \nsubsidize and give you interest rate breaks and delays if you will \nborrow money for your higher education.\n  Forty-two States will soon have prepaid college tuition plans. They \nare very popular. They are expanding. Middle-income people are the ones \nthat are taking advantage of it. They are putting money in. They are \nlocking in college tuition at the paid cost so inflation doesn't hurt \nthem on the rising tuition, and then they put the money into those \naccounts. When it is taken out to pay for the tuition, they have to pay \nincome tax on what it has accumulated. That is, to me, a shortsighted \nview. It encourages debt and discourages savings.\n  So our public policy is actually to tax, to hinder, and to punish \npeople who wisely save, but to subsidize people who go further into \ndebt.\n  It is a nice bill. We believe in it strongly. It has bipartisan \nsupport. It has the strong support in the House of Representatives. It \nwill require, I believe, $197 million in cost; only that much through \nthe first 5 years of the program; and $600 million or so over the 10 \nyears. But it will as a result of that encourage huge amounts of \nsavings because, frankly, it is not all that clear, according to a lot \nof money managers, that it is the wisest thing in the world to take \nadvantage of these programs, if you have to pay taxes on the increase.\n  If we eliminate that tax on the increase funds, put in prepaid \ncollege tuition plans, it will be a clear winner. Every financial \nmanager will urge their clients to take advantage of this program.\n  It will eliminate--which is not considered in the cost analysis of \nthis bill--but, in my opinion, it will in fact reduce the amount of \nGovernment loans and maybe Pell grants that will have to be expended by \nthe Government. It will be a good public policy move for our country.\n  I appreciate the chairman's support. I appreciate Senator Bob Graham \nfrom Florida, who is on the Finance Committee, who is a cosponsor to \nthis, and a number of other Senators.\n  We believe it is good public policy at a reasonable cost, and will \nhelp produce a significant amount of money for higher education.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I understand this is a sense of the Senate that we \nadd to that list of tax changes that might be used by the Finance \nCommittee when they set about to draw the bill, that this is just an \nadditional one? There is nothing mandatory about it. It is merely \nsuggesting that it is a good one that ought to be there, and they ought \nto look at it.\n  Is that it?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is precisely correct. It will be a sense of \nthe Senate that that be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think this is a good amendment. I \ncongratulate the Senator from Alabama for offering it. Therefore, to my \ncolleague in the management of the budget, I think we ought to go \nahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I be added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be honored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 210) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe Senator Crapo is here. He is \nready with his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 163\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo] proposes an amendment \n     number 163, as previously reported.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to \npresent this important amendment.\n  As we said yesterday when we discussed this amendment preliminarily, \nwe have had an opportunity for the last 4 or 5 years to debate the \nconcept of a lockbox in one context or another. Originally, in the \nHouse of Representatives when we presented this idea, it was to address \ndeficits. We have had deficits for as long as most of us can remember. \nYet the budget process did not seem to provide a mechanism by which we \ncould lock aside spending that Congress decided to reduce in order to \nmake sure that it was used to reduce the debt, or to reduce the \ndeficit. Now we are in a surplus environment. We have just done some \nmajor work on this budget that was spearheaded by Senator Abraham and \nSenator Domenici to create a lockbox for the Social Security surpluses, \nand to assure those surpluses are not spent by Congress. They are \nlocked aside to be utilized to either pay down the public debt, or to \nbe used to reform Social Security, both of which will strengthen and \nsave a lot of the Social Security trust fund.\n  I commend our chairman for that tremendous effort and will support \nthat effort. This amendment which Senator Grams from Minnesota and I \nhave worked on would use the lockbox concept for another part of the \nsurplus, that part of the surplus that deals with the potential for an \nincreased surplus beyond that which we now have projected.\n  In July, we expect that new projections will show an increased \nsurplus outside of the Social Security surplus that will be generated \nby taxpayer dollars. This part of the surplus will be a surplus that \nwas not contemplated by Congress as we put together this budget. We are \nputting together this budget based on our current projections. And this \nbudget will take care of the Social Security surplus. It will protect \nMedicare and education and other needed spending and will find room for \ntax relief. But, if in July the new projections show an enhanced \nsurplus, this amendment would say that any new surplus must be locked \naway in a lockbox so that it can be used only for tax relief or \nretirement of the national debt.\n  It is critical that we take the tough steps, but the important steps \nto assure that as we now move into a surplus environment with our \nbudget that we protect the taxpayer and we protect those of \nparticularly our younger generations who face such monumental debt in \nour Federal Government.\n  This amendment says any new enhanced surplus that comes from better \nprojections that is in excess of what we are projecting in this budget \nthat we are working on now will not be used for other spending, but \nwill be used to reduce the burden of taxes on Americans, or to reduce \nthe national debt, which has been incurred over the last few decades.\n  I strongly encourage the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I reluctantly but strongly oppose the \nCrapo amendment. It would create a reserve fund, as I understand, to \nlock in any additional onbudget surplus in the outyears to be used only \nfor tax breaks and debt reduction.\n  Mr. President, the Democrats welcome the opportunity to lock away a \nportion of the surplus for debt reduction. We have offered amendments \nthat would do just that. But this amendment would limit the use of \nfuture surpluses to debt reduction or tax breaks exclusively--only. So \nI have to ask my friends on the other side of the aisle the following \nquestion. Why is it OK to set aside the surplus to create a new special \ninterest tax loophole but not OK to use the surplus for an increase in \nmilitary pay? Why is it OK to set aside\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\nthe surplus to give more tax breaks to the well off but not OK to use \nthe surplus to hire more teachers and reduce class size?\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not about fiscal responsibility. It \nis not about saving Social Security or Medicare. But it is about \nsetting aside the surplus to give tax breaks particularly to the \nwealthiest among us. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could we have the yeas and nays on the \namendment that was just proffered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I raise a point of order, Mr. President. The \namendment is not germane, and I raise a point of order that the \namendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n\n\n                     Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to waive the Budget Act under the appropriate \nwaiver provisions of the Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe waiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. President, we are getting close to what we have nicknamed around \nhere votorama. The only thing is that sounds like a movie picture with \na big screen where everybody can see everything. I am afraid it is \ngoing to be sort of the opposite because there is going to be 1 minute \nafter a while on each amendment, and I don't know how many there is \ngoing to be yet. But unless and until we change our process, that is \nwhat we are going to go through for a while.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Pursuant to the previous consent agreement, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the first vote in the voting sequence be on the adoption of S. \nRes. 57 regarding Cuba--that is extraneous to our Budget Act, but we \nare getting consent to take care of that very soon--with 10 minutes \nequally divided between Senator Mack and Senator Dodd just prior to the \nvote. I further ask that pursuant to the previous agreement, the \nsucceeding votes in the sequence begin with and continue as follows: \nSenator Santorum, amendment No. 212; Senator Reed, amendment No. 162; \nSenator Craig, 146; Boxer, 175; Senator Voinovich, 161; Kennedy, 192; \nCrapo, 163; Dodd, 160; Ashcroft-Gorton, 242; Dorgan, 178, as modified; \nGrams-Roth, 231; Lautenberg, 166; Snowe, 232; Kennedy 195.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, as we understand here, when we start with Santorum \n212, this will mean Senator Santorum should be on the floor if he \ndesires to speak to his amendment. And he will get 1 minute, and \nSenator Lautenberg or his designee on the other side, if they oppose \nit, will be given 1 minute, and so on down the line.\n  Now, we have already indicated previously that the first vote tonight \nwill be a 15-minute vote, and the amendments after that will be 10 \nminutes each. I do not know what we are going to do about dinner, but \nperhaps we will reconsider dinner at 6:30 or 7 and see what we do. But \nin the meantime, we are going to proceed with that format, and I urge \nSenators to stay in the Chamber if they have amendments because if we \nwant to get out of here at a reasonable time, we can't take 20 minutes \non each rollcall. We just agreed it would be 10. That is very hard to \ndo. We have timed it. Some people say, why don't you make it 7\\1/2\\? \nRemember last year. You cannot even get it done and get the Senators up \nto vote in 7\\1/2\\. Ten is the best we can do. But we have to work at \nit. We still don't know whether we can finish tonight, but we are \nworking very hard to do it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I can just add a note here, part of \ndoing amendments is to fill the amendment tree. So I will say that now \nwe want to shake the tree and see if we can drop some of those \namendments that perhaps on reconsideration by the offeror, maybe there \nwould be another time to achieve the goal he or she wants to attain. \nBut I want to add this, Mr. President. I think it is an important \nobservation. There could be as many as 50 votes.\n  Now, if we are exact on the enforcement of the time limit, which I \nwould urge we agree to, that 10 minutes is 10 minutes, it is not 11, \n12, 13, that means everybody has to pay attention. If we have a 10-\nminute vote and a 2-minute debate, that is 12 minutes. And if you have \n50 of those, we are looking at 600 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten hours.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Ten hours. Senator Domenici and I will be here, \nperhaps with a glass of wine, at 3 o'clock in the morning or else we \nwill have to go over to the next day.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So I will forgo the glass of wine, but what I hope \nis----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I never was going to have one.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, we weren't going to have it. I was kidding. It is \nfor my friends in California I said that. I hope that our colleagues \nwill be paying attention to this because a delay by one person is a \ndelay for 99 people and we ought not to treat that casually. We are \ngoing to be here a long time. This could be expedited substantially. We \nhope that any Senators who have an amendment review that which has \nalready been discussed and accepted so that we are not being redundant. \nIf it has been heard, I would ask colleagues to perhaps rethink whether \nor not they are going to offer their amendment. So I guess we can--I \ndon't know what the terminology is for letting the vote roll--let the \nskaters begin, or something of that nature, or let the pitcher pitch.\n  Do we have our first?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's see if we have our first Senator here. We are \ngoing to do Cuba and that Senator is here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with reference to the matter that is not \npart of our budget resolution, S. Res. 57 regarding Cuba, Senator Dodd, \nis supposed to speak;  Connie Mack on our side, Senator Dodd on your \nside. Mr. President, we are going to wait just a little bit.\n  Before Senator Mack and Senator Dodd begin their 10 minutes equally \ndivided, might I repeat again, the first Senator up is Senator Santorum \nwith amendment No. 212, Senator Reed with No. 162. I have stated the \nrest of them. If anybody needs it, we have the list here. We need the \nSenators to be here and now they are going to have to just as well stay \nbecause there are going to be 15 or 16 votes in a row. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire, just to be clear, the pending \nbusiness is the resolution, is that correct?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3380-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3380-S3383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HUMAN RIGHTS IN CUBA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 57) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the human rights situation in Cuba.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, have the proponents spoken on the \nresolution, I inquire of my colleague from Florida?\n  Mr. MACK. Not yet. We have not used our time yet.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time is there on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes apiece.\n  Mr. DODD. Fine. Mr. President, if I may, let me, first of all, say I \nintend to support and vote for this resolution. But in doing so, I want \nto express some deep concerns. Many of my colleagues know we have what \nis now just about a 40-year-old problem that has not been even remotely \nclose to resolution and that is, of course, United States-Cuban \nrelations.\n  We know why we are going to be asked to consider this resolution this \nweek, and I suspect it will be passed overwhelmingly. The real question \nis, does it do anything to influence the policies of the Cuban \nGovernment or garner the support of our allies? On that issue, I have \nto answer resoundingly no. It may make us feel good, it will express \nour views, but in terms of these resolutions having some influence on \nthe very events which provoked the resolution, I think the answer has \nto be we can probably anticipate the same response as we have had\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\nwith a collective set of resolutions over the years.\n  I have criticized the recent crackdowns on dissidents, as many have \nhere, including the sentencing of the ``Group of Four,'' which is \nterribly wrong and totally counterproductive and, in my view, a \nviolation of human rights of these individuals. It is also very \ninconsistent with the Cuban Government's efforts in the past to gain \nthe international respectability they have been trying to garner. For \nthe life of me, from their standpoint, I don't see why this benefits \nthem or assists them.\n  Our passing of these kinds of resolutions on Cuba, year after year, \nyear after year, unfortunately, has not prevented the Cuban authorities \nfrom dealing harshly with dissidents. Depending upon the ebb and flow \nof the Cuban political dynamic, the human rights situation gets a \nlittle better or a little worse or a little better or a little worse, \nbut nothing significant or permanent seems to happen or change.\n  We need to engage, in my view, the Cuban Government on this and other \nissues, as we have done with other nations with whom we have \nsignificant disagreements, if we are going to create any kind of \nenvironment for some change. That engagement, which we traditionally \ncall diplomacy, has been totally absent in the conduct of relations \nbetween these two nations, the Cuban Government and our own. Perhaps \nthat is why, I suggest, the record is so dismal. It is action-reaction, \naction-reaction, and a total absence of any diplomacy.\n  Let's not fool ourselves. This resolution is not going to help the \npeople of Cuba. Is it not time to change our view of what should be the \ndynamics of United States-Cuban relations--to start a new conversation \nwith Cuba, rather than simply act and react to unfolding events in \nHavana? I believe it is time to begin such a new conversation in this \nbody and in the United States.\n  We in this country make the mistake, in my view, of overreacting to \nthese ebbs and flows, rather than keeping to the steady and consistent \npolicy to bring Cuba into the world community of democratic nations. \nAll we do, by passing resolutions of this kind which are not accurate \nin all respects, is to fuel nationalist sentiments in Havana and \nelsewhere in this hemisphere and around the globe.\n  The resolution authoritatively cites human rights organizations as \ncritical of human rights practices of Cuban authorities. However, it \ndoes not mention these very same organizations also criticize U.S. \npolicies with respect to Cuba. The 1999 Human Rights Watch World Report \nstates:\n\n       The (U.S.) embargo had not only failed to bring about human \nrights improvements in Cuba but had become counterproductive.\n\n  It goes on to conclude that:\n\n       The embargo continued to restrict the rights of freedom of \n     expression and association and the freedom to travel between \n     the United States and Cuba, thus violating Article 19 of the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a \n     treaty [I might add] ratified by [our Government.]\n\n  This resolution further, and our policy generally, allows all of \nCuba's problems, and there are many, to be blamed on the United States \nin too many international circles. While we are not responsible for the \nstate of the Cuban economy, the Cuban people are extremely \nnationalistic and will rally behind their government against foreign \nthreats. This is true elsewhere in the hemisphere.\n  What we need to do, in my view, is to move forward to implement Pope \nJohn Paul II's call that Cuba open up to the world and the world open \nup to Cuba. More constructive measures such as the upcoming baseball \ngame and concert are more effective ways of communicating U.S. values \nto the Cuban people, particularly as a part of a broader effort to \npursue increasing contacts between the American and Cuban people.\n  Love of baseball and music are just two examples of the many things \nthe American and the Cuban people have in common. We have much more in \ncommon than that. The best way to communicate that is by lifting \nrestrictions on U.S. citizens' rights to travel to Cuba or anywhere \nelse. Frankly, such restrictions, in my view, are un-American. We can \ntravel to virtually any other nation in the world--North Korea, Iraq, \nIran. The only restrictions are what those nations place on us. The \nonly place I know of where we restrict Americans from going is a \ncountry 90 miles off our shore. If they want to place restrictions on \nour travel there, I would object. But we should not restrict Americans' \ntravel.\n  We need to make other fundamental changes in our policy. Our guiding \nprinciple in doing that should be that these changes are in our, the \nAmericans', best interests. With respect to Cuba, an island of 11 \nmillion people 90 miles off our shore, America's interest is that there \nbe a peaceful transition to a post-Castro era, whenever that time \ncomes.\n  Mr. President, I ask just for 1 additional minute, if I can, and I \nwill give 1 additional minute to my colleague from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is not in America's interest to have an \narmed insurrection occurring in that country or to see living \nconditions become so onerous that everyone takes to the boats and finds \nthemselves at sea, seeking safe harbor in this country or elsewhere.\n  With respect to policy, I suggest the lifting of restrictions on food \nand medicine. These restrictions border on immoral, in my view. I also \nrecommend lifting restrictions on travel. Under certain circumstances, \nU.S. companies should also be permitted to invest in Cuba, provided \nAmerican-style workplace conditions prevail in U.S.-owned investments. \nI also encourage contacts between United States and Cuban diplomats, \nincluding inviting Cuban diplomats to the United States, discussing \nissues of huge concern including regional terrorism, drug trafficking, \nand the preservation of the environment.\n  If we really want to see the peaceful transition to democracy in \nCuba, then it is about time, after 40 years, the end of the cold war \nand the falling of the Berlin Wall, to break out of the policy \nstraitjacket that has prevented meaningful change from taking place in \nCuba-United States relationships. Passing resolutions of this kind, \nyear after year, year after year, do nothing to help change what is a \nsituation that demands, in my view, some new thinking, a new \nconversation.\n  With that, I thank my colleague for providing the additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I understand I have now 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. MACK. It is my intention then to use 3 of those minutes and then \nto yield to my colleague, Senator Graham, for the balance of the 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank Senator Dodd for \nhis vote for this resolution. I respect immensely his viewpoint and \nwhat he has stated over all these years, but I respectfully disagree \nwith him. Again, I will just point out, all we are suggesting here is \nthat the least America can do is to say we ought to ask the United \nNations to condemn Fidel Castro for his human rights violations. That \nis not an extreme position to take, to ask the world body to condemn \nFidel Castro for human rights violations.\n  The reason we are doing this is because I think it is appropriate to \nrespond to the impression that has been created over these last several \nmonths after the Pope visited Cuba. There has been this kind of love \naffair that Cuba has changed, that the world is now going to open up. \nThe Senator said a moment ago, if Cuba would open up, if we would open \nup, we could come together.\n  Clearly, what has happened since the Pope's visit, Fidel Castro has \narrested more dissidents than he has released following the Pope's \nvisit. He has instituted new laws which restrict the freedom of speech, \neven more restrictive than in previous years. He arrested 15 people \ntrying to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King this year, and \njust this month he arrested and sentenced four prominent activists for \nwriting about the basic rights of the Cuban people.\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that this country, a country that has \nbeen willing to stand up in defense of human rights, basic human rights \nall over the globe, is doing the right thing. I ask my colleagues in \nthe Senate to support this resolution.\n  I yield back my time and yield the floor to Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I, too, appreciate the vote of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut in favor of this, I think, quite moderate but \nextremely important and timely resolution.\n  Today in Geneva the United Nations Human Rights Commission commenced \nits annual meetings. One of the issues that will be before the \nCommission will be whether a resolution condemning human rights in Cuba \nand appointing a special rapporteur to review those conditions should \npass. Unfortunately, last year a similar resolution for the first time \nin many years failed to pass.\n  The question is, How has Cuba reacted to the fact that for 12 months \nit has not had the international condemnation of its human rights \nrecord, which has been the case for many of the years of the Castro \nregime? What in fact has happened is that we have seen a significant, \nalmost inexplicable increase in the denial of fundamental rights, \npolitical rights, human rights, civil rights, to the people of Cuba \nand, as my colleague has just indicated, the examples of the loss of \nfundamental human dignity.\n  Why are we passing this resolution? We are passing this resolution \nnot only to express our outrage at this condition but also to urge the \ninternational community to join us, the international community which \nhas so recently been populated by new democracies, for those new \ndemocracies to step forward and express their condemnation for one of \nthe few remaining dictatorial regimes in the world.\n  This recent crackdown by the Cuban Government has already drawn the \ncondemnation of the international community, including some of Cuba's \nstaunchest friends, such as Canada. A resolution is now being \ncirculated in Geneva by several Eastern European states condemning the \nCuban Government for its human rights record and calling for the \nappointment of a special rapporteur.\n  Mr. President, I think it is significant that these Eastern European \nstates, which suffered under the tyranny of Nazi Germany and Stalinist \nRussia, are leading the effort to highlight the repression and terror \nthat accompanies everyday life in Cuba.\n  This resolution calls on the U.S. Government to take all measures to \nsupport this resolution so that the international community, including \nthe international community with the United States of America, can \nshine the light of freedom on Castro's brutal repressive regime.\n  I urge my colleagues to strongly support this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, has all time expired on the Cuba \nresolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I make a further announcement? A while ago I listed \nthe amendments as we are going to consider them, starting with Senator \nSantorum, Senator Reed. We had two Republican amendments listed, \nAshcroft-Gorton 242. That is an error. We had already accepted that \namendment. So what we would like to do is put, in lieu of Ashcroft-\nGorton, which had been accepted, it was already adopted, Fitzgerald \n217. Then if we go down on our list, Dorgan is next. Then Grams-Roth, \nwe had also accepted that, and somebody on our staff put it on here. So \nwe are going to substitute Ashcroft 240. So everybody should be on \nnotice, including the proponents of those amendments, when they come \nup. I will try to announce the list just before the vote as to who is \nnext, maybe two in advance, so everyone will know. I think we are \nprepared.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion, please; that is, how many votes do we have bracketed right \nnow that we are certain of?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fifteen.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So is it fair to say that 15 votes, 10 minutes \napiece, 150 minutes, 2 minutes for debate, another 30 minutes, we are \nlooking at a few hours, wouldn't you say?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. But if we can get the cooperation of the Members, we \ncan finish this tonight. If we can't, we will be here tomorrow. I think \nI speak for the chairman; we will find out immediately, when I say that \nI am willing to be here as late as it takes, if we can finish tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, we are going to be as cooperative as we can \nand beyond this in agreeing to accept amendments. We are working with \nyou to do the same, which means we can take many more later and accept \nthem as we work our way through this part.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution \n(S.

Res. 57\n\n       Whereas, the annual meeting of the United National \n     Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, provides a \n     forum for discussing human rights and expressing \n     international support for improved human rights performance;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     and international human rights organizations, the Government \n     of Cuba continues to commit widespread and well documented \n     human rights abuses in Cuba;\n       Whereas such abuses stem from a complete intolerance of \n     dissent and the totalitarian nature of the regime controlled \n     by Fidel Castro;\n       Whereas such abuses violate internationally accepted norms \n     of conduct;\n       Whereas the Government of Cuba routinely restricts worker's \n     rights, including the right to form independent unions, and \n     employs forced labor, including that by children;\n       Whereas such abuses violate internationally accepted norms \n     of conduct enshrined by the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights;\n       Whereas the Government of Cuba has detained scores of \n     citizens associated with attempts to discuss human rights, \n     advocate for free and fair elections, freedom of the press,\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\n     and others who petitioned the government to release those \n     arbitrarily arrested;\n       Whereas the Government of Cuba has recently escalated \n     efforts to extinguish expressions of protest or criticism by \n     passing state measures criminalizing peaceful pro-democratic \n     activities and independent journalism;\n       Whereas the recent trial of peaceful dissidents Vladimiro \n     Roca, Marta Beatriz Roque, Felix Bonne, and Rene Gomez \n     Manzano, charged with sedition for publishing a proposal for \n     democratic reform, is indicative of the increased efforts by \n     the Government of Cuba to detain citizens and extinguish \n     expressions of support for the accused; and\n       Whereas these efforts underscore that the Government of \n     Cuba has continued relentlessly its longstanding pattern of \n     human rights abuses and demonstrate that it continues to \n     systemically deny universally recognized human rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that at the \n     55th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva, Switzerland, the United States should make all \n     efforts necessary to pass a resolution, including introducing \n     such a resolution, criticizing Cuba for its human rights \n     abuses in Cuba, and to secure the appointment of a Special \n     Rapporteur for Cuba.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

I thank the Chair.\n  Among the first casualties of this proposed budget will be the cities \nand rural communities of America. This budget would cut upwards to 78 \npercent of money devoted to community and regional development over the \nnext 10 years.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It would restore $88.7 billion \nover 10 years to bring up funding to the level proposed by the \nPresident. It would do so by taking a small portion of the projected \ntax cuts that are included in this budget. Without my amendment, we \nwill see extreme reductions in community development block grants, the \nEconomic Development Administration, the lead paint abatement program, \nthe brownfields program, those programs that are essential to the \ncities and rural areas of this country.\n  We cannot abandon these communities. In fact, we cannot throw them, \nas this budget would, into financial chaos as they try to make up the \ndifference with the property tax. The irony here is that these tax cuts \nin the budget will mean tax increases for many communities. It is \nsupported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of \nCities. I hope Senators will support this measure and not abandon the \ncities and rural communities of America.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I do not think I am going to argue the \nsubstance, other than to say this amendment increases taxes by $64 \nbillion. This amendment increases taxes by $64 billion, relative to the \ncommittee bill before us. It suggests it be spent for community and \nregional development.\n  Frankly, it would not have to be. The appropriators have their own \njudgment. They can do what they want with it. Essentially, I do not \nbelieve we ought to be raising taxes to pay for programs like this.\n  In addition, this is not germane and is subject to a point of order, \nwhich I now make under the Budget Act.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I remind Senators we have 10 minutes on the next vote. \nWe intend to have regular order so we can finish at a reasonable time. \nTen minutes is what we are allowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, \nand I have joined together in our effort to control the overall growth \nof government. We are asking that the Senate apply a 60-vote \nrequirement to any new entitlement program--not new spending in \nexisting entitlement programs, but new entitlement programs--exactly as \nwe treat any growth in discretionary spending. It would take a 60-vote \npoint of order for us to add new entitlement programs and spend new \nmoney.\n  I think it is a requirement that this Senate should have. Last year, \n54 Senators voted for it. It is bipartisan in its character to control \nthe overall growth of government. We think it is appropriate that it be \nspent that way.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am opposing this amendment. It would \nprohibit using revenues to offset new mandatory spending and instead \nrequire all new spending to be offset with other mandatory cuts. It \nwould give special protection to special interest tax loopholes at the \nexpense of programs like Social Security or Medicare.\n  I understand the Senator said ``new programs.'' It would prevent us \nfrom using the onbudget surplus for prescription drugs, new benefits, \nor any new mandatory spending. The onbudget surplus could be used only \nfor tax breaks.\n  Also, the amendment would prevent us from using the user fees, such \nas gas tax, to pay for new highways. If we are looking for a way to pay \nfor a new benefit, why would we say that cutting Social Security is OK \nbut closing a wasteful tax loophole is not? Why would we say that \ncutting Medicare is OK but eliminating a corporate tax subsidy is not?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, Mr. President, and I \nmake the budget point of order. I think this is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order has already been made.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the \ncommittee and my ranking member for agreeing to this. Of course, \nSenator Lautenberg was very supportive in committee, and Senator \nDomenici tonight has said he will go along with this amendment.\n  It is very simple and clear. It says if there should be a tax cut, we \nwant to see the substantial benefit go to the first 90 percent of wage \nearners, rather than the top 10 percent.\n  I think this is good for the people of the country.\n  I want to thank, again, Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there will be no rollcall vote on this \namendment. I agree to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 175) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator would yield for some housekeeping, we \nare having a degree of success with the list of amendments. If your \nname is not on this list, then it means you are insisting on a rollcall \nvote. That means there are still about 15 or 20 of you we are looking \nfor to sit down and talk, so we will not have to have so many rollcall \nvotes. These are all generous Senators on this list. They have \ndecided--and the other side has agreed--to accept them. We will do that \nright now, en bloc.\n  So that Members might be thinking about this, maybe we ought to find \na new way to take care of sense-of-the-Senate amendments that show up \non a budget resolution. I had an idea that maybe we should change the \nlaw and have a second budget resolution after we have done the real \none, and anybody that has a sense of the Senate can offer them to the \nsecond budget bill and ask the leader to set this up in a recess \nperiod, and people can file these. When we return from the recess, we \nwill vote on them en bloc.\n  I think that would be an excellent solution. The leader and I will be \ntalking about it soon.\n  In the meantime, we thank you for great cooperation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, having spoken to you and the \nDemocratic manager and the two leaders, we will try to wrap this thing \nup tonight; is that true?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we get this kind of cooperation, we can do it; if we \ndon't get cooperation, a few Senators will keep us over until tomorrow.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Late at night, too.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senators on the list that the Democratic and \nRepublican staff worked on that and it still might require votes. We \nhave had great cooperation and a number of amendments have already \ndropped off.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 225, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk of \namendment No. 225 from Senator Shelby. This modification has been \napproved by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 225), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TRANSPORTATION FIREWALLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) domestic firewalls greatly limit funding flexibility as \n     Congress manages budget priorities in a fiscally constrained \n     budget:\n       (2) domestic firewalls inhibit congressional oversight of \n     programs and organizations under such protections:\n       (3) domestic firewalls mask mandatory spending under the \n     guise of discretionary spending, thereby presenting a \n     distorted picture of overall discretionary spending;\n       (4) domestic firewalls impede the ability of Congress to \n     react to changing circumstances or to fund other equally \n     important programs;\n       (5) the Congress implemented ``domestic discretionary \n     budget firewalls'' for approximately 70 percent of function \n     400 spending in the 105th Congress;\n       (6) if the aviation firewall proposal circulating in the \n     House of Representatives were to be enacted, firewalled \n     spread would exceed 100 percent of total function 400 \n     spending called for under this resolution; and\n       (7) if the aviation firewall proposal circulating in the \n     House of Representatives were to be enacted, drug \n     interdiction activities by the Coast Guard, National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration activities, rail safety \n     inspections, Federal support of Amtrak, all National \n     Transportation Safety Board activities, Pipeline and \n     Hazardous materials safety programs, and Coast Guard search \n     and rescue activities would be drastically cut or eliminated.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that no additional \n     firewalls should be enacted for function 400 transportation \n     activities.\n\n\n       Unanimous Consent Agreement--Amendments Agreed To En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the following amendments have been \ncleared on both sides: Shelby, 209; Sessions, 210; Santorum, 211; \nRoberts, 216; Gorton, 215; Specter, 220; Jeffords, 222; Shelby, 225, as \nmodified; 226, Enzi; Collins, 229; Chafee, 237; Specter, 219; \nFitzgerald, 217; and Jeffords, 221.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

The following amendments, and I am very appreciative of \nthis, have been withdrawn: 234, 239, 235, 241 and 193.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are withdrawn.\n  The amendments (Nos. 234, 239, 235, 241 and 193) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have only 13 amendments remaining on our side. I \nhope Members or their staffs will please sit down with our staff and \nsee if we can resolve some of these and give us some idea whether we \ncan finish tonight. I very much appreciate it.\n  Thank you for yielding, Senator. I am sorry for using your time.\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\n                           amendment no. 161\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 161, as previously offered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, first, I want to commend the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee for offering a budget \nresolution that stays within the spending caps and--for the first \ntime--protects Social Security surpluses.\n  I also want to thank him for setting aside $131 billion in what I \nlike to call a ``rainy day fund.'' This money can be used for possible \ncontingencies in Medicare or agriculture, emergency spending, or debt \nreduction.\n  I respect the view of my colleagues who want to use on-budget \nsurpluses to give the American people a tax cut. But before we give a \ntax cut, I believe we should pay down our massive national debt first.\n  My amendment would take out the tax cuts in the budget resolution and \nuse that money to pay down the debt.\n  If my amendment is adopted, and if the projected surpluses \nmaterialize, then we will slash the publicly-held debt from $3.6 \ntrillion today to $960 billion in 2009.\n  Paying down the debt is the right thing to do--it will reduce our net \ninterest payments, expand the economy, lower interest rates for \nfamilies, and reduce the need for future tax increases.\n  Has there been a request for the yeas and nays on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from \nOhio knows of the great respect I have for him. Over the years, I have \nworked with him when he was Governor. But I just can't agree with this \namendment, and I hope the Senate doesn't.\n  This amendment says that the American taxpayer deserves no tax relief \nand, yet, we can spend the money that is in surplus, but we can't give \nthe American people any tax relief. This strikes the entire tax relief \nprogram that we have planned in this budget resolution. We have heard \nsome say that we should have only half. We have heard others say we \nshould only have two-thirds of it. This one says none. While in the \nbudget we spend money for Medicare, we spend money out of the surplus \nfor other programs. But now it is being said that we cannot spend any \nof it on tax cuts. I don't believe this is good policy, and I don't \nthink that is where we ought to end up this year. We will spend and \nspend and spend that surplus, and there won't be any left for the \nAmerican people in the not-too-distant future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, is there any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the budget there is $778 billion for \n10 years for the reduction in taxes. The amendment offered by myself \nand Senator Dodd is very simple. Effectively, it takes $156 billion of \nthat, first, to fully fund IDEA; to fully fund the smaller classrooms; \nand to take the remaining funds, which is $43 billion that can be used \nfor afterschool programs, for technology, for Pell grants, for Work-\nStudy Programs, and for other education programs.\n  Effectively, we are saying this is the best opportunity that we have \nhad in a generation to continue a partnership between local, State and \nthe Federal Government in the areas of education. We have a real \nopportunity to do so. We believe that we can still leave 80 percent of \nthe tax cut. We are taking 20 percent of the tax cut to fully fund \nIDEA, to meet our commitments, and to also fully fund the smaller \nclassroom.\n  This is supported by school board associations, the school \nadministrators, parent/teachers, the disability rights, the Consortium \nof Citizens with Disabilities, and the Federation of Children with \nSpecial Needs. It is supported by all of those groups in the best \ninterests of the future of our country. I hope it is accepted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 1 minute. I yield 40 seconds to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, and I will take the other 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico will suspend.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has yielded time.\n  To whom does the Senator yield his time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire 40 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, essentially, no one in this Senate has \nworked harder--many have worked as hard, but I think I have worked as \nhard as anyone else to try to get funding for IDEA programs. What this \namendment is essentially is a ``don't worry, be happy'' amendment. It \nis an amendment which doesn't address the underlying problem, which is \nthat this Congress and, unfortunately, some people on the other side of \nthe aisle in this Congress are not willing to set priorities in the \narea of education.\n  We have in the law, on the books a law that says we should fund IDEA. \nThe only people who have been trying to do that have been on this side \nof the aisle. In the last 3 years, we have increased funding for IDEA \nby 85 percent from this side of the aisle. In the Domenici budget, we \nhave increased it by another $2.5 billion.\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let's do it the right way. Let's do it the way it is done \nin this budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been telling you all, Democrat \nand Republican alike, that what is going to happen with this surplus is \nwe are going to spend it all. I have made a preliminary analysis of \nthis week's Democratic amendments that use the surplus. They have now \nused $430 billion of the surplus for new programs. This one is in this \n430. Some others aren't. I merely ask that we not do this and save some \nof the money for the American taxpayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 219, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have heretofore adopted a Specter \namendment. We should have sent a modification to the desk to Amendment \nNo. 219. I send the modification to the desk and ask the amendment, \nwhich was adopted, be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 219), previously agreed to, as modified is as \nfollows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR INTENSIVE \n                   FIREARMS PROSECUTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) gun violence in America, while declining somewhat in \n     recent years, is still unacceptably high;\n       (2) keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals can \n     dramatically reduce gun violence in America;\n       (3) States and localities often do not have the \n     investigative or prosecutorial resources to locate and \n     convict individuals who violate their firearm laws. Even when \n     they do win convictions, states and localities often lack the \n     jail space to hold such convicts for their full prison terms;\n       (4) there are a number of federal laws on the books which \n     are designed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. \n     These laws impose mandatory minimum sentences upon \n     individuals who use firearms to commit crimes of violence and \n     convicted felons caught in possession of a firearm;\n       (5) the federal government does have the resources to \n     investigate and prosecute violations of these federal \n     firearms laws. The federal government also has enough jail \n     space to hold individuals for the length of their mandatory \n     minimum sentences;\n       (6) an effort to aggressively and consistently apply these \n     federal firearms laws in Richmond, Virginia, has cut violent \n     crime in that city. This program, called Project Exile, has \n     produced 288 indictments during its first two years of \n     operation and has been credited with contributing to a 15% \n     decrease in violent crimes in Richmond during the same \n     period. In the first three-quarters of 1998, homicides with a \n     firearm in Richmond were down 55% compared to 1997;\n       (7) the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce-State-Justice \n     Appropriations act provided $1.5 million to hire additional \n     federal prosecutors and investigators to enforce federal \n     firearms laws in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia project--\n     called Operation Cease Fire--started on January 1, 1999. \n     Since it began, the project has resulted in 31 indictments of \n     52 defendants on firearms violations. The project has \n     benefited from help from the Philadelphia Police Department \n     and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms which was not \n     paid for out of the $1.5 million grant;\n       (8) In 1993, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the \n     Western District of New York teamed up with the Monroe County \n     District Attorney's Office, the Monroe County Sheriff's \n     Department, the Rochester Police Department, and others to \n     form a Violent Crimes Task Force. In 1997, the Task Force \n     created an Illegal Firearms Suppression Unit, whose mission \n     is to use prosecutorial discretion to bring firearms cases in \n     the judicial forum where penalties for gun violations would \n     be the strictest. The Suppression Unit has been involved in \n     three major prosecutions of interstate gun-purchasing \n     activities and currently has 30 to 40 open single-defendant \n     felony gun cases;\n       (9) Senator Hatch has introduced legislation to authorize \n     Project CUFF, a federal firearms prosecution program;\n       (10) the Administration has requested $5 million to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects on a national level;\n       (11) given that at least $1.5 million is needed to run an \n     effective program in one American city--Philadelphia--$5 \n     million is far from enough funding to conduct such programs \n     nationally.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Function 750 in the budget resolution assumes that \n     $50,000,000 will be provided in fiscal year 2000 to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects to combat violence in \n     the twenty-five American cities with the highest crime rates.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 224\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have an Ashcroft amendment, amendment \nNo. 224, which is ready to be accepted. The Democratic leader accepts \nit also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 224) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 163\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment is a very straightforward \namendment. It seeks to deal with the excess surplus we expect to be \nprojected this July. We are now working on a budget that will be saving \nSocial Security, for tax relief, and for the necessary investments we \nmust make in our military, education, Medicare, and other needed \nprograms the Federal Government must pay attention to.\n  After this budget is put together and we have made those adjustments, \nwe expect the July reports will say we have an even larger surplus than \nis now expected.\n  This amendment says, if a larger surplus develops, that surplus \nshould be set aside in a lockbox for either tax relief or debt \nretirement. It is very straightforward, to say after we have met the \nneeds in negotiating this budget, we then apply any future increases in \nthe surplus to debt retirement or tax relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Crapo \namendment. As the Senator said, it creates a reserve fund to lock in \nany additional onbudget surplus in the outyears to be used exclusively \nfor tax breaks and debt reduction.\n  Mr. President, Democrats welcome the opportunity to lock away a \nportion of the surplus for debt reduction. We have offered amendments \nthat would do just that. But this amendment would limit the use of \nfuture surpluses to debt reduction or tax breaks only.\n  So I have to ask a question here. Why is it all right to set aside \nthe surplus to\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\ncreate a new special interest tax loophole, but not OK to use the \nsurplus for an increase in military pay?\n  Why is it OK to set aside the surplus to give more tax breaks to the \nwell off but not OK to use the surplus to hire more teachers and reduce \nclass size?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will the Senators \ntake their conferences off the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It would be nice to have order.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not about fiscal responsibility. It \nis not about saving Social Security or Medicare. It is about setting \naside the surplus to give tax breaks to a select few, including the \nwealthiest among us. I hope my colleagues will oppose this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 165\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to take a moment to explain my opposition to \nthe amendment by the gentleman from Idaho, Senator Crapo. This \namendment would set aside all on-budget surpluses above those estimated \nin the Republican Budget Resolution. These funds would then be used for \neither tax cuts or debt reduction. While I agree with his goals of \nreducing taxes and eliminating the debt, I believe that this is the \nwrong way to go about it.\n  I am committed to reserving 77 percent of the total, unified, surplus \nto increase the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. I do not \nbelieve that we should bind ourselves to the estimates of surpluses in \nthis bill. If higher than anticipated surpluses come into the Treasury \nthen I believe that we should still put 77 percent of those new, \nunexpected funds into the Social Security and Medicare programs.\n  The Democratic plan leaves 23 percent of the unified surplus for tax \ncuts, debt reduction and domestic priorities. This leaves room for a \ntax cut regardless of future surpluses, and is not dependent on the \nestimates in this bill. Committing ourselves to reserving 77 percent of \nthe unified surplus for Medicare and Social Security will keep these \nprograms solvent longer than the proposal from the Senator for Idaho, \nand therefore I cannot support his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the point of order. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, as I understand it, I have the right to \nmodify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It takes unanimous consent, which has been \ngranted.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this modification reduces the amount from \n$7.5 billion over 5 years to $5 billion on a child care block grant \namendment. It is very simple. It is designed to help working families. \nThe amendment increases the mandatory spending by $5 billion over 5 \nyears. The offset comes from a reduction of the $800 billion tax bill \nby that amount.\n  This amendment also asserts in nonbinding language that if child care \ntax credits are expanded in future legislation, that they would be for \nstay-at-\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nhome parents as well as working parents, and that there would be a tax \nrefundability so the poorer families would be able to take advantage of \nit.\n  The reason why this amendment on this concurrent resolution is so \nimportant is that if we do not provide additionally to the child care \nneeds in the budget resolution, then there is no other opportunity for \nus to do it in the 106th Congress.\n  So this modest amount over 5 years, given the huge waiting lists that \nexist, the difficulty that working families have in meeting these \ncosts, and providing that incentive as well for stay-at-home parents so \nthey can get the benefit of it, I think justifies the adoption of it.\n  I am delighted to have as my cosponsors, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, and others. I thank some of my Republican \ncolleagues on the other side for their indication of support for this \namendment as well.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment. I think it is a good \none. I think it will help working families and their children get good \nand decent child care.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know how interested my friend from \nConnecticut is in this, and that he has lowered the amount. But I \nreally think that we ought to stick with the format that we have been \nfollowing here, and we ought not start taking money out of the tax cut \nto put into new programs.\n  I yield back my time and move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment, as modified. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 160), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for that vote \nbeing open as long as it was. We can't do that anymore if we are going \nto have any hope of finishing this.\n  I would like to ask all Senators to stay in the Chamber. We have \nreached an hour where I don't think it would be necessary to go back to \nyour office or go to receptions. We still have a number of amendments \nthat are pending. I know the whip is working those amendments on the \nDemocratic side. We are working them over here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that for the next block of amendments--I \nthink there are five of them in this block--the time for the votes be 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. There will need to be the 2 minutes equally divided between \nthe amendments. If the Senators will stay in the Chamber, we can clear \na number of amendments. Hopefully, we can move through this quickly. We \nwill see if there is any chance to wrap this up tonight. We will not \nhold the votes open on this next block of votes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, is there any requirement that the clerk read \nback every vote? That would save considerable time. Is there any need \nfor that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the Senator mean the results of the vote?\n  Mr. REID. What happens is, midway through the votes they go over who \nvoted for and against. Is there some requirement for that to be \nnecessary?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that has been done since the beginning of \ntime. (Laughter.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That takes care of that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think it is going to continue, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. By unanimous consent--may I say with great respect to the \nSenate--by unanimous consent you can avoid the recapitulation, if you \nwant to do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Rather than changing the precedent, Mr. President, let me \nwork with the leadership on both sides to see if we can't in some way \nexpedite this as quickly as possible, maybe without calling the names. \nWe will work on that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the majority leader yield to me?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will tell you how the leader can stop me from keeping \neverybody else here waiting. He can tell them up there to call the \nroll, and announce the results. And if he catches me off the floor \nonce, I will take my lumps. I ought to be here, and not keep everybody \nelse waiting. I have a wife who is 81 years old. I am 81 years old. She \nis there waiting on me. I am here. I think Senators ought to have a \nlittle compassion and respect for one another. If the leader will just \nteach us one time, for those who are not here when that announcement is \nmade, they are going to show up as absent, that will break Senators \nfrom imposing on other Senators by being late for votes.\n  Mr. LOTT. We just did that. Two Senators just missed that last vote.\n  Stay in the Chamber. We are calling those votes after 6 minutes. Stay \non the floor so we can begin the debate and voting.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 213, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have had a little bit of success in \ngetting rid of some other amendments.\n  Amendment No. 213 needs a modification. Then it is ready. This has \nbeen approved on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 213), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. XX. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR STATE AND \n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) as national crime rates are beginning to fall as a \n     result of State and local efforts, with Federal support, it \n     is important for the Federal Government to continue its \n     support for State and local law enforcement;\n       (2) Federal support is crucial to the provision of critical \n     crime fighting programs;\n       (3) Federal support is also essential to the provision of \n     critical crime fighting services and the effective \n     administration of justice in the States, such as State and \n     local crime laboratories and medical examiners' offices;\n       (4) Current needs exceed the capacity of State and local \n     crime laboratories to process their forensic examinations, \n     resulting in tremendous backlogs that prevent the swift \n     administration of justice and impede fundamental individual \n     rights, such as the right to a speedy trial and to \n     exculpatory evidence;\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\n       (5) last year, Congress passed the Crime Identification \n     Technology Act of 1998, which authorizes $250,000,000 each \n     year for 5 years to assist State and local law enforcement \n     agencies in developing and integrating their anticrime \n     technology systems, and in upgrading their forensic \n     laboratories and information and communications \n     infrastructures upon which these crime fighting systems rely; \n     and\n       (6) the Federal Government must continue efforts to \n     significantly reduce crime by maintaining Federal funding for \n     State and local law enforcement, and wisely targeting these \n     resources.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) The amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 to \n     assist State and local law enforcement efforts should be \n     comparable to or greater than amounts made available for that \n     purpose for fiscal year 1999;\n       (2) the amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 for \n     crime technology programs should be used to further the \n     purposes of the program under section 102 of the Crime \n     Identification Technology Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 14601); and\n       (3) Congress should consider legislation that specifically \n     addresses the backlogs in State and local crime laboratories \n     and medical examiners' offices.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 213), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 207, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Amendment No. 207, which I tendered a while ago, has \nnow been OK'd by the minority. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 207), as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide the Sense of the Senate regarding the need to \n  pursue a rational adjustment to merger notification thresholds for \nsmall business and to ensure adequate funding for Antitrust Division of \n                       the Department of Justice)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MERGER ENFORCEMENT BY \n                   DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice \n     is charged with the civil and criminal enforcement of the \n     antitrust laws, including review of corporate mergers likely \n     to reduce competition in particular markets, with a goal to \n     promote and protect the competitive process;\n       ``(2) the Antitrust Division requests a 16 percent increase \n     in funding for fiscal year 2000;\n       ``(3) justification for such an increase is based, in part, \n     increasingly numerous and complex merger filings pursuant to \n     the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976;\n       ``(4) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of \n     1976 sets value thresholds which trigger the requirement for \n     filing premerger notification;\n       ``(5) the number of merger filings under the Hart-Scott-\n     Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which the \n     Department, in conjunction with the Federal Trade Commission, \n     is required to review, increased by 38 percent in fiscal year \n     1998;\n       ``(6) the Department expects the number of merger filings \n     to increase in fiscal years 1999 and 2000;\n       ``(7) the value thresholds, which relate to both the size \n     of the companies involved and the size of the transaction, \n     under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of \n     1976 have not been adjusted since passage of that Act.\n       ``(b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the Antitrust Division needs adequate resources and that \n     the levels in this resolution assume the Division will have \n     such adequate resources, including necessary increases in \n     funding, notwithstanding any report language to the contrary, \n     to enable it to meet its statutory requirements, including \n     those related to reviewing and investigating increasingly \n     numerous and complex mergers, but that Congress should pursue \n     consideration of modest, budget neutral, adjustments to the \n     Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 to \n     account for inflation in the value thresholds of the Act, and \n     in so doing, ensure that the Antitrust Division's resources \n     are focused on matters and transactions most deserving of the \n     Division's attention.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment will put the Senate on \nrecord in two important areas.\n  The first is that, notwithstanding assumptions to the contrary, the \nAntitrust Division needs and should have adequate resources to enable \nit to meet its statutory requirements, including those related to \nreviewing and investigating increasingly numerous and complex mergers.\n  The second, is that Congress needs to review and pursue adjustments \nto the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. This \nsecond point, Mr. President, is an important one and one whose time is \nlong overdue. The threshold values in this Act which trigger the \nrequirement for businesses to file premerger notifications with \ngovernment antitrust enforcers have not been changed, even for \ninflation, since 1976--23 years ago.\n  The overall purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Antitrust \nDivision's resources are focused on matters and transactions most \ndeserving of the Division's attention, and to remove unnecessary \nregulatory and financial burdens on small businesses.\n  Mr. President, few would disagree that it is important to adequately \nfund the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. They are \ncharged with the civil and criminal enforcement of the antitrust laws, \nincluding review of corporate mergers, in order to ensure that the \nconsumer benefits from lower prices and better goods that come with \nvigorous competition in the marketplace. The interests of consumers \nmust prevail over the political interests of some companies.\n  At our oversight hearing of the Justice Department several weeks ago, \nI asked Attorney General Reno whether she would work with us to review \nthe value thresholds of the Hart-Scott-Rodino. It is my belief that \nadjustments to the value thresholds of Hart-Scott-Rodino are needed. \nThey are needed to ensure that the Department's merger reviews take \ninto account inflation and the true economic impact of mergers in \ntoday's economy--not in the economy of 1976. The Attorney General, and \nthe Federal Trade Commission have pledged to work with us, and I look \nforward with working with the Administration to come up with a rational \nproposal that is a win-win for both the Department and small business.\n  Mr. President, let me just add that this amendment is not about one \ncompany, or one issue. It is about providing rational relief for some \nsmall businesses and supporting the enforcement of our laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 207), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 243, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, has Senator Lautenberg cleared amendment \nNo. 243 of Senator Hutchison and Senator Feinstein?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send it to the desk. It is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 243), as modified, is as follows:\n\n                     Amendment No. 243, As Modified\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate to create a task force to pursue the \n              creation of a natural disaster reserve fund)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that a task force be created \n     for the purpose of studying the possibility of creating a \n     reserve fund for natural disasters. The task force should be \n     composed of three Senators appointed by the majority leader, \n     and two Senators appointed by the minority leader. The task \n     force should also be composed of three members appointed by \n     the speaker of the House, and two members appointed by \n     minority leader in the House.

Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 243), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 178\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the amendment we will consider next is an \namendment which provides an opportunity to address the dire emergency \nthat exists on American farms. All of us in this Chamber know that farm \nprices have collapsed. We also know that we face the prospect of losing \ntens of thousands, hundreds of thousands perhaps, of family farmers \nunless something is done to restore some price protection during this \ntime.\n  The amendment I have offered is the only opportunity to do that. It \nprovides room in this Budget Act for a $6-billion-per-year price \nprotection opportunity.\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\n  In 1995, the budget resolution that we considered was the start of \nthe change of farm programs to the new Freedom to Farm bill. In this \nbudget resolution, we are trying to provide an opportunity to repair \nthe deficiencies in that bill that stripped away much of the needed \nprice protection.\n  This amendment I hope will be supported by my colleagues and give us \nthe opportunity this year, after a midyear correction by the \nCongressional Budget Office, to use needed resources to help family \nfarmers during their dire emergency.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been keeping track on how much of \nthe surplus we have spent. We spent $430 billion. If we adopt the \nDemocratic amendment, this is $30 billion more. So the surplus would \nhave had $460 billion already spent, if this amendment were adopted. We \nwill increase the mandatory expenditures under agriculture from about \n$39 billion, to $40 billion, to $75 billion. That will be fixed and \npermanent, because it is an entitlement. And actually there are many \nwho say this agriculture economy will recover in a couple of years. \nYet, we have this built in for 5 years.\n  I don't think we ought to do this tonight. There is ample time to \nconsider.\n  I remind you that the President didn't ask for one nickel. We put $6 \nbillion new money in, and now this is $30 billion more.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The next amendment is the Snowe amendment, No. \n232. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in contrast to the President's budget, we \ndo have a means by which to create a provision for a prescription drug \nbenefit program in the budget resolution. We created a reserve fund in \nthe Budget Committee that was supported by an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nvote, 21 to 1.\n  Mr. President, the reserve fund that is included in the budget \nresolution for the purposes of financing a prescription drug benefit \nprogram was supported overwhelmingly by the members of the committee on \na bipartisan basis, a 21-to-1 vote.\n  The amendment I am offering, along with Senator Wyden, as well as \ncosponsor Senator Smith of Oregon, is to expand and create a funding \nmechanism that will ensure and guarantee the funding of a prescription \ndrug benefit program. We think it is important to ensure that we have \nthis benefit program for our Nation's senior citizens. It is contingent \nupon a reform package being reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee to extend the solvency of the Medicare program. The funding \nmechanism would be an increase in the tobacco taxes.\n  I think it is an appropriate linkage between Medicare and tobacco \ntaxes. A recent study shows, in fact, that $25 billion was the cost to \nthe Medicare program as a result of tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering along with my good friends \nand colleagues from Oregon, Senators Wyden and Gordon Smith, would \nexpand the reserve fund that is found in section 209 of the budget \nresolution. Specifically, our amendment would allow new tobacco taxes \nto be used as an offset for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit \nthat this reserve fund would create.\n  Mr. President, as I stated on the floor yesterday, I believe that one \nof the most critical items included in this year's Senate budget \nresolution is the reserve fund for Medicare and prescription drugs.\n  Put simply, this reserve fund--that was adopted with the support of \nall 10 Democratic members on the Budget Committee--will provide the \nCongress with a critically needed opportunity to address an issue that \nhas been highlighted repeatedly of late: the long-term solvency of \nMedicare and a means to fund a new Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  In light of the recent disappointing conclusion of deliberations by \nthe Bipartisan Commission on Medicare--where the final vote for a \nrecommendation failed by a singe vote--I can think\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nof no provision more critical to moving these issues forward in the \naftermath of that Commission's work than the reserve fund contained in \nthe Senate budget resolution.\n  Specifically, the reserve fund already contained in the budget \nresolution will allow for the creation of a new Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. This reserve fund will be available for any Medicare \nlegislation reported from the Senate Finance Committee that \nsignificantly extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund in a \nmeaningful and legitimate manner beyond its current insolvency date of \n2008.\n  However, to ensure our ability to tap the reserve fund is not unduly \nrestricted or that legislation is not stalled in the Finance Committee \ndue to a particular solvency date not being achieved, the reserve fund \nintentionally provides no specific target date for extending the \nprogram's solvency. Rather, it simply requires that the added solvency \nbe ``significant'' with no gimmicks to simply increase the ``paper \nbalance'' of the trust fund. Specifically, the President's proposal to \nartificially increase the number of IOUs held by the Medicare Trust \nFund would be precluded.\n  Also of critical importance, the reserve fund explicitly provides for \nthe funding of a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that could be \nfunded with a portion of on-budget surpluses that have been set-aside \nin the Chairman's budget. The on-budget surplus currently set-aside in \nthe budget totals $132 billion over the coming 10 years, so up to this \namount of monies could be utilized for the prescription drug benefit.\n  Given the fact that prescription drug coverage proved to be one of \nthe most divisive issues during the Bipartisan Commission's \ndeliberations, this reserve fund will ensure that this critically \nneeded addition to the Medicare program is not blocked from \nconsideration when legislation to strengthen Medicare is considered on \nthe floor. Furthermore, it serves as a much needed ``carrot-and-stick'' \nfor getting Congress and the President to develop a comprehensive plan \nto strengthen Medicare soon--not put it off until the day of reckoning \nin 2008 is nearly upon us.\n  Mr. President, there are many issues where members of the Senate may \ndisagree, but there is one stark fact--the fact that the Medicare Part \nA Trust Fund will be broke within 10 years--which everyone in this room \nmust accept. Therefore, since solutions will likely become draconian \nthe longer we wait to take meaningful steps to strengthen the program, \nwe must not wait any longer to take action to credibly extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund and improve the Medicare program \noverall.\n  As my colleagues are aware, we didn't get a proposal out of the \nBipartisan Medicare Commission despite the best efforts of several \nmembers of this body. But that ``hung jury'' decision does not mean we \ncan simply ignore the fact that the Medicare program--which is the \nprogram more then 38 million elderly Americans rely on for their health \ncare--is going broke.\n  Fortunately, the Senate Finance Committee is already taking action, \nbeginning with a series of hearings that began last week on the \nCommission's majority-supported proposal, and speculation that a markup \nof Medicare-related legislation could occur in the not-too-distant \nfuture. In addition, the President--who was accused of preventing the \nCommission from getting the final, crucial vote necessary to report a \nrecommendation--has now said that he will send us his own proposal \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, the reserve fund already included in the Senate budget \nresolution will facilitate this process by allowing the Congress to \ntake up the President's forthcoming proposal or any other proposal \nreported by the Senate Finance Committee that credibly addresses \nMedicare's needs. That, alone, is a critical step forward since we can \nno longer leave our seniors worrying that our failure to take action \nwill leave them without access to health care. Because when the Trust \nFund runs dry there is no health care--none--for many of our nation's \nsenior citizens.\n  Even as the reserve fund will help spur action on legislation to \ncredibly extend the solvency of the Medicare program, it will also \nallow us to take a critical step in improving and updating the Medicare \nsystem: the addition of a meaningful Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. I believe this addition is, unquestionably, the most \nsignificant we could make to Medicare as we seek to strengthen the \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, the need for this new benefit could not be more clear. \nWhen Medicare was created in 1965 it followed the private health \ninsurance model of the time--inpatient health care. Today, thirty-four \nyears later, it is sadly out of date and it is time to bring Medicare \n``back to the future'' by providing our seniors with prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  The lack of a prescription drug coverage benefit is the biggest \nhole--a black hole really--in the Medicare system. HCFA will tell you \nthat up to 65 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have drug coverage from \nother sources. But that number simply doesn't tell the whole story.\n  Specifically, fourteen percent of Medicare beneficiaries get drug \ncoverage from one of the three Medigap policies that cover drugs. Two \nof these policies require a $250 deductible and then only cover 50 \npercent of the cost of the drug with a $1,250 cap. Needless to say, you \ncan run up against that cap pretty fast with today's drug prices.\n  The third policy provides a cap of $3,000 but the premium ranges \nanywhere from $1,699 to $3,171 depending on where you live. That is a \nlot of money for someone living on a fixed income.\n  An estimated 8 percent get drug coverage from participating in \nMedicare HMOs and another 16 percent receive coverage from Medicaid. Of \ncourse to do that, they must be very low-income to begin with and may \nhave to spend a great deal out of pocket for their drugs--what we \ncommonly refer to as spending down--before they are eligible in a given \nyear for coverage. Finally there are those lucky enough--29 percent--to \nhave employer sponsored drug coverage through their retiree program.\n  Mr. President, drug coverage should be part and parcel of the \nMedicare system, not a patchwork system where some get coverage and \nsome don't. Prescription drug coverage shouldn't be a ``fringe \nbenefit'' available only to those wealthy enough or poor enough to \nobtain coverage--it should be part and parcel of the Medicare system \nthat will see today's seniors, and tomorrow's into the 21st Century.\n  In light of this glaring need for prescription drug coverage, I will \nbe working with senior citizens groups and health care experts over the \ncoming weeks to develop bipartisan legislation with Senator Wyden and \nothers that will provide Medicare recipients with a comprehensive \nMedicare prescription drug coverage benefit that could be included in \nany forthcoming package to strengthen Medicare.\n  The focus of my proposal will be to provide senior citizens with \nactual coverage for prescription drugs. Put simply, even if we attempt \nto control the prices of drugs that are needed by senior citizens, that \ndoes not guarantee many of these individuals will be able to afford \nthose prices. That's why a new benefit is so critical.\n  Although the details of my prescription drug coverage proposal will \nbe developed over the coming weeks, there are several broad principles \nthat I anticipate will be included in the Snowe-Wyden package:\n  First, this package will not be part of Medicare Part A, and \ntherefore will have no direct impact on the solvency of the Medicare \nTrust Fund. Like my colleagues, I am gravely concerned about the \nsolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund and believe that issue must be \naddressed in a comprehensive, bipartisan manner. Therefore, I believe \nit would be irresponsible to propose a new benefit in the Trust Fund \nthat would further jeopardize its solvency in future years, and will \npropose that my new benefit package be outside the Trust Fund \naccordingly.\n  Second, while the details of our legislation will ultimately be \ncrafted during bipartisan negotiations with interested groups and \nhealth care experts, the drug benefit package will be comprehensive and \nensure that all seniors have prescription drug coverage.\n  Third, while the cost of this proposal will ultimately be determined \nby the benefit package that is crafted, our proposal will be fully-\noffset. While my colleagues are aware that the cost of\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nthis coverage varies widely depending on the size and scope of the \nbenefit, I believe it would be irresponsible to create any new benefit \nwithout paying for it. Accordingly, the primary offset for our package \nwill be an increase in the tobacco tax.\n  As my colleagues are aware, President Clinton's FY 2000 budget \nproposal included a 55-cent per pack increase in the cost of cigarettes \nand an acceleration of the 15-cent per pack increase contained in the \n1997 Balanced Budget Agreement. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that \nthe combined revenues of these two proposals would be $36 billion over \n5 years, and $70 billion over 10 years.\n  Interestingly, instead of applying these new revenues to Medicare or \na new prescription drug benefit, the President proposes that these \ntobacco tax revenues be used to offset increases in discretionary \nspending. Because tax increases are not allowed to offset discretionary \nspending under the Budget Act, these improper offsets contribute to the \nPresident's budget being in violation of the spending limits agreed to \njust two years ago by $30 billion in FY 2000.\n  At the same time, the President's budget also fails to provide a \nsingle penny for a prescription drug benefit--or even a mechanism to \nprovide monies for such a benefit--after touting the need for \nprescription drug coverage in the State of the Union address.\n  In light of this deficiency in the President's budget, the bipartisan \nproposal I will be crafting with Senator Wyden will not only create a \nfully-funded prescription drug benefit, but it will also utilize the \nproposed tax increase for tobacco contained in the President's budget. \nUltimately, it is my hope that the President will recognize that these \nmonies would be best spent on Medicare, and will support our effort \naccordingly.\n  Mr. President, the rationale for linking tobacco taxes and Medicare \nis clear. As outlined in a study by Columbia University, smoking-\nrelated illnesses cost the Medicare program $25.5 billion in 1994 \nalone--a full 14 percent of Medicare's costs in that year.\n  In fact, as the chart behind me indicates, of the various forms of \nsubstance abuse that affect the Medicare program, tobacco-related \nillnesses accounted for 80% of the $32 billion in total substance abuse \ncosts in 1994. Therefore, dedicating tobacco revenues to Medicare will \nallow the program to recapture some of the monies it is losing to \ntobacco.\n  In particular, the proposal I will be developing with Senator Wyden \nwill demonstrate how new tobacco monies could be shifted to Medicare \nand then targeted to the new prescription drug benefit for seniors.\n  To accommodate the proposal we will be crafting--and the tobacco \noffset it will contain in particular--the amendment I am offering today \nwill ensure that tobacco tax revenues are among the funding options \nprovided for in the new reserve fund for prescription drugs.\n  While I am pleased that remaining on-budget surpluses are already an \nallowable offset in the reserve fund, I believe it is only appropriate \nthat tobacco taxes also be an allowed offset. Not only because this \noffset be used in the prescription drug package I will be developing \nwith Senator Wyden, but because of the direct link between tobacco and \nthe Medicare program.\n  As mentioned, a study by the National Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University found that the cost of tobacco-\nrelated illnesses on the Medicare program totaled $25.5 billion in \n1994, or 14% of the total expenditures of the Medicare program.\n  Assuming this percent holds as true today as it did five years ago--\nand there is no reason to assume otherwise--the impact of tobacco on \nMedicare is astounding. With CBO projecting Medicare expenditures of \n$220 billion in the current fiscal year, tobacco-related health care \nexpenses would total upward of $30.8 billion in 1999 alone using the 14 \npercent assumption. Over the coming years, these numbers will only \nescalate:\n  $32.5 billion in 2000.\n  $34.7 billion in 2001.\n  $36 billion in 2002.\n  And $39.5 billion in 2003.\n  In fact, if tobacco-related illnesses continue to cost the Medicare \nprogram 14 percent of its total expenditures, these expenses will total \n$62.6 billion in the year 2009. All told, tobacco-related illnesses \nwould cost the Medicare program $486 billion from 1999 to 2009!\n  Mr. President, in light of the impact of tobacco on the Medicare \nprogram, I can think of no reason why new tobacco revenues should not \nbe returned to the Medicare program and used to fund a new prescription \ndrug benefit. Along with our efforts to keep the program solvent well \nbeyond 2008, this new benefit is arguably the most pressing need of our \nnation's senior citizens in the Medicare program. By linking the two \nissues in the reserve fund I have created, we can and should do both.\n  Mr. President, while I know that many of my colleagues may not \nsupport a tobacco tax increase, I urge that they seriously consider the \nimpact of tobacco-related illnesses on Medicare. My amendment is not an \neffort to simply pass a tobacco tax for the sake of doing it. Rather, \nit's about recouping a limited portion of the monies tobacco costs the \nMedicare program every year, and devoting these monies to a program \nwithin Medicare that benefits senior citizens.\n  The bottom line is that the reserve fund already included in the \nbudget will help facilitate the consideration of Medicare legislation \nby laying the groundwork for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit \nthat may not otherwise be available. While it would already allow \nremaining on-budget surpluses to be used for this new benefit, the \namendment I am offering today will ensure that another funding source \nis also available.\n  Ultimately, the true benefit of adopting my amendment is that it will \nensure a new Medicare prescription drug benefit that utilizes tobacco \nrevenues can be offered with only a simple majority vote being required \nfor its adoption. Without this provision, a point of order would lie \nagainst such a proposal, and 60 votes would be required to waive the \npoint of order. While not an impossible hurdle, it nevertheless raises \nthe bar on an offset that I believe is wholly appropriate for the issue \nat hand.\n  Again, I do not expect that all of my colleagues will support the \nprescription drug benefit bill that Senator Wyden and I will be \ncrafting. But I would hope that my colleagues would see the legitimate \nlink between Medicare and tobacco, and will at least vote today to \nallow this offset to be considered without a supermajority vote in the \nfuture.\n  The reserve fund already contained in the budget resolution is a \ncritical step in the right direction that may ultimately ensure \nlegislation to genuinely strengthen Medicare will move in the Congress. \nAnd the amendment we are offering will simply bring one more \nlegitimate, related offset into the mix of available options as that \npackage is crafted in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I believe the cost of Medicare prescription drugs \nconstitutes a crisis for our senior citizens. While the President \nexpressed support for such a benefit in the State of the Union, he \nfailed to deliver anything for it in his budget proposal, just as he \nseemingly failed to assist the Commission in doing their job: sending \nthis Congress a bipartisan Medicare reform proposal.\n  Despite the President's lack of courage on these issues--or \nwillingness to put substance behind his State of the Union rhetoric--I \nbelieve it is critical that we make it possible to strengthen and \nimprove Medicare in the Congress. The reserve fund already contained in \nthe budget may be our best hope to repair and improve the Medicare \nprogram. It will allow it to be one of our finest accomplishments in \nthe 106th Congress--not a political punching bag that delivers nothing \nof value to our deliberations or to our nation's elderly. And the \namendment we are offering today will only make the reserve fund better.\n  Therefore, I urge that my colleagues support our amendment, and work \nto improve the Medicare ``enabling'' reserve fund already contained in \nthe budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have the lowest unemployment \nthat we have had in 30 years, the lowest rates of inflation. Still, we \nhave 11 million minimum-wage workers. And a minimum-wage working family \nof three is still $3,000 less than the poverty income for a family of \nthree.\n  This is an issue that affects women. It is an issue that affects \nchildren. It is an issue that affects families. No one in the United \nStates of America who works for a living ought to live in poverty.\n  We hope now to have a sense of the Senate that we will increase the \nminimum wage 50 cents this year and 50 cents next year.

I want to clear some amendments for immediate \nconsideration: Senator Enzi, 208, as modified; 205, Senator Landrieu, \nas modified; 202, Senator Biden; and 171, Senator Boxer. These have \nbeen cleared with the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 208, as modified; 205, as modified; 202 and 171) \nwere agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 202\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the amendment I offer to the budget \nresolution would express the Senate's intention to give high priority \nto embassy security.\n  As was underscored by the tragic embassy bombings in East Africa last \nAugust, our embassies overseas are highly vulnerable to terrorist \nattack. Following the bombings, the Secretary of State ordered a \nworldwide review of the current security situation.\n  According to testimony provided by the Department of State to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, over 80 percent of U.S. embassies and \nconsulates have less than the required 100-foot setback from the \nstreet, and many missions are in desperate need of greater security \nimprovements.\n  As required by law, the Secretary also convened ``Accountability \nReview Boards'' to examine the bombings. The Boards, chaired by retired \nAdmiral William Crowe, concluded that the United States must--\n\n     undertake a comprehensive and long-term strategy for \n     protecting American officials overseas, including sustained \n     funding for enhanced security measures, for long-term costs \n     for increased security personnel, and for a capital building \n     program based on an assessment of requirements to meet the \n     new range of global terrorist threats. This must include \n     substantial budgetary appropriations of approximately $1.4 \n     billion per year maintained over a ten-year period. . \n     .Additional funds for security must be obtained without \n     diverting funds from our major foreign affairs programs.\n\n  Last fall, Congress provided $1.4 billion in supplemental \nappropriations to address the security situation.\n  But as the conclusions of the Crowe panels underscored, this was just \na down payment.\n  In his budget request, the President requested an additional $300 \nmillion in security enhancements in Fiscal Year 2000, and advance \nappropriations totaling $3 billion from Fiscal 2001 to 2005 for an \nembassy construction program. I believe this amount is insufficient, a \nconcern echoed by many members of the Committee on Foreign Relations \nduring a hearing held on March 11.\n  We must recognize, as the Crowe panels did, that the kind of money \nrequired to enhance embassy security cannot be borne within the current \nState Department budget.\n  For example, the $1.4 billion in annual spending recommended by the \nCrowe panels amounts to more than one-third of the operating budget of \nthe Department requested for Fiscal 2000. We are kidding ourselves to \nsuggest that these resources can be found within the existing State \nDepartment budget.\n  It should be emphasized that funding for embassy security benefits \nthe entire federal government. Embassies are not merely foreign \noutposts of the Department of State. They are platforms for the \nrepresentation of American interests.\n  Everyone should recognize this essential fact: nearly two-thirds of \nthe personnel in our embassies are from departments other than the \nState Department. They are from all over the government--the Commerce \nDepartment, the Agriculture Department, the Department of Defense, even \nthe Federal Aviation Administration. In sum, embassy security is a \ngovernment-wide imperative, for which the State Department should not \nbear an undue funding burden.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is this: security costs money, and we \ncannot pinch pennies. We send our people overseas to do a job. They are \non the front lines of our national defense, representing our interests.\n  It is our duty to do that all that we reasonably can to protect them. \nAnd if we fail to protect our embassies, the costs will be not just in \nlives lost. They will be in wars not prevented, in narcotics \ntrafficking unchecked, and in American jobs lost due to trade \nopportunities unattained.\n  So I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance of embassy \nsecurity as a high priority and support my amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 204 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are withdrawing an amendment of \nSenator Biden numbered 204.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 204) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how long did the last vote take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last vote took about 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will have some additional votes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the following amendments be the next amendments to be \ndebated and voted on as provided for under the previous agreement: \nSenator Hollings 174, current services; Senator Robb 181, strike pay-\ngo; Senator Lautenberg 183, school modernization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 174\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this continues current policy and uses \nthe surplus moneys to pay down the debt. This amendment by Senator Bob \nKerrey and myself uses what surplus there is over the budget period to \npay down the debt.\n  Members might say, Was this not the amendment of Senator Voinovich \nwhich we voted on? Senator Voinovich uses Chairman Domenici's mark; I \nuse the mark of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  We call this the Greenspan amendment because Senator Sarbanes was \nquestioning the record of the Federal Reserve. He said, How do you save \nthat surplus? How do you keep it from getting spent? Mr. Greenspan \nsaid, ``What happens is, you do nothing.'' In other words, you take \nthis year's budget, we are doing fine. We have growth, low \nunemployment, low inflation rate, and truly pay down the debt.\n  All of these others talk about it, but there is so much spending and \ntax cuts, you will never get any debt paid down. This, when it is paid \ndown, will lower the interest costs which will get everybody a real tax \ncut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment wipes out the tax cut in \nits entirety, wipes out the $6 billion we added for the agricultural \ncommunity, establishes a freeze, and then after that, it goes up to \ncurrent services. The first two points are the most important.\n  I don't believe we ought to adopt this amendment, after all we have \ngone through in trying to provide some tax cuts for the American \npeople.\n  I yield back any time I might have.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield back my time, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the Fiscal Year \n2000 Budget Resolution, I believe it is important that we keep in mind \nthe statement by General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, at the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 29, 1999.\n  ``It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets the U.S. \nmilitary apart from all potential adversaries. These talented people \nare the ones who won the Cold War and ensured our victory in Operation \nDesert Storm. These dedicated professionals make it possible for the \nUnited States to accomplish the many missions we are called on to \nperform around the world every single day.''\n  Although we have the best soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, all \ntheir professionalism is for naught if they do not have the equipment, \nweapons and supplies to carry out their mission. Since the end of \nOperation Desert Storm, which reflected both the professionalism and \nmaterial quality of our Armed Forces, the defense budget has declined \nby $80 billion. Yet the pace of the military operations has not \ndeclined, in fact the pace of operations exceeds that of the Cold War \nera. Not only are the men and women of our military stretched to the \nlimits, but also their equipment. The Air Force Chief of Staff \ntestified that ``Next year, the average age of our aircraft will be 20 \nyears old . . .'' General Reimer, the Chief of Staff of the Army, \nstated: ``Mortgaging our modernization accounts did not come without \ncost. By FY98, Army procurement had declined 73 percent, reaching its \nlowest level since 1959.'' Mr. President, each of the other service \nchiefs had similar quotations. These quotes paint a dismal picture of \nour Armed Forces' readiness and are the challenge to the Congress to \nincrease funding for the Department of Defense.\n  The Fiscal Year 2000 Budget resolution proposed by the able Chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, increases the budget \nauthority for defense by $8.3 billion over the Administration's \nrequest. I congratulate the Budget Committee on this decisive \ndemonstration of support for our Armed Forces. However, this show of \nsupport is diminished by the fact that the Budget Committee reduced the \noutlays for fiscal year 2000 by $8.7 billion. This reduction coupled \nwith the already existing outlay problem, will result in a reduction to \nthe budget authority levels in the $280.5 billion budget request.\n  Mr. President, I want to urge Senator Domenici, to work with Chairman \nWarner and Chairman Stevens, to resolve this outlay problem before we \nact on this Resolution. We must not leave the false impression that the \nincrease in the budget authority proposed in this resolution will \nresult in increased security for our Nation. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the report accompanying the budget \nresolution now before the Senate (Senate Report 106-27), the first \nparagraph on page seven contains this statement:\n\n       A budget resolution is a fiscal blueprint, a guide, a \n     roadmap, that the Congress develops to direct the course of \n     federal tax and spending legislation. It is a set of \n     aggregate spending and revenue numbers covering the twenty \n     broad functional areas of the government, over a long-term \n     fiscal horizon. It is less than substantive law, but is much \n     more than a sense of the Congress resolution.\n\n  Unfortunately, this budget resolution, this guide, this blueprint, is \na roadmap which, if followed for the next ten years, will wreak untold \ndevastation. Having just achieved the first year with a unified budget \nsurplus ($70 billion) in thirty years, last September 30--the end of \nFiscal Year 1998--and having been unable to pass a congressional budget \nresolution for this fiscal year, fiscal year 1999, at all, we now have \nbefore the Senate not the usual five-year budget resolution, but a much \nmore ambitious ten-year budget to carry us for the period fiscal years \n2000-2009. Over that period, we are told by the Congressional Budget \nOffice that unified budget surpluses will total just over $2.5 \ntrillion. Of that amount, Social Security surpluses make up some $1.8 \ntrillion, or 72 percent. Non-Social Security surpluses, according to \nCBO, will total $787 billion over that period. For fiscal year 2000, \nthere is, in fact, a non-social security deficit of some $7 billion. \nThat is, there would be no surplus at all in Fiscal Year 2000 except in \nthe Social Security Trust Fund.\n  What does the blueprint now before the Senate, the Republican budget \nresolution, propose that we do with these multi-trillion-dollar \nsurpluses? Keep in mind that these are only projections; they are not \nreal, and we will not know until after the fact as to whether any of \nthe surpluses projected for any of these 10 years will come to pass. No \nhuman being can ever project accurately what Federal revenues or \nFederal spending will be. No one can know what interest rates will be, \nor unemployment, or GDP growth. We have had tremendous variances \nhistorically with CBO projections, even within one year. To count on \ntheir projections for not one, not five, but for 10 years is extremely \nunwise.\n  But, let us look at the budget resolution now before the Senate. This \nbudget resolution proposes a Federal tax cut which, according to the \ncommittee's report, will approximate $142 billion over the next five \nyears, and $778 billion over the next 10 years. The resolution includes \na reconciliation instruction to the tax writing committees instructing \nthem to report out these huge tax cuts in a reconciliation bill. \nPursuant to that reconciliation instruction, a tax bill of the \nmagnitude contained in the resolution, some $800 billion, will be \nbefore the Senate later this year. If enacted and signed by the \nPresident, those tax cuts will go into effect regardless of whether any \nof the projected surpluses take place.\n  This is the height of irresponsibility. Just when we have succeeded \nin turning the corner on the multi-hundred-billion-dollar annual \ndeficits of the 1980's, here comes the Republican budget resolution \nsaying let us take the as-yet, unachieved future budget surpluses and \ncut Federal revenues now, whether or not those surpluses ever occur.\n  On that basis alone, if for no other reason, I urge Senators to \noppose this budget resolution.\n  But, that is not the only problem we find in this blueprint. There is \nthe question of the levels of discretionary spending that will be made \navailable over the next 10 years if we follow this budget resolution.\n  It is well known that the 1997 Balanced Budget Act placed severe \nconstraints on discretionary spending for the period 1998-2002. Those \ncaps were considered necessary in order to help rid ourselves of the \nannual Federal budget deficits and achieve surpluses. Nevertheless, it \nis my view that the discretionary caps for 2000, as well as for the \nfollowing two years--2001 and 2002--are too tight and will require\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\nmassive cuts which should not be undertaken at the same time we are \nproviding the huge tax cuts which I have just described.\n  This resolution calls for funding non-defense discretionary programs \nin Fiscal Year 2000 at a level of $246 billion, a cut of more than $20 \nbillion, or 7.5 percent, below the present year. To make matters worse, \nthe pending budget resolution would provide increases for a handful of \nfavored programs, such as health, education, and other popular \npriorities. These plus-ups would mean that other vital, yet unprotected \nprograms, would face cuts of more than 11 percent in Fiscal Year 2000. \nCuts of that magnitude, according to the Office of Management and \nBudget, would affect vital programs such as the following: food safety \nwould be undermined with the lay-off of an estimated 1,000 meat and \npoultry inspectors; Head Start funding would be cut in excess of $1 \nbillion--cutting services to as many as 100,000 children; the FBI would \nbe cut $337 million, which could result in a reduction of 2,700 FBI \nagents and support personnel; more than 2,200 air traffic controller \npositions would be cut; IRS Customer Service would suffer a reduction \nof 5,000 employees; the number of students in the Work Study Program \nwould decrease by 112,000; and the list goes on and on throughout the \nentire Federal government.\n\n  While making these cuts in vital human and physical infrastructure \nprograms across the nation, this budget resolution would increase \ndefense by $18 billion above a freeze in Fiscal Year 2000. Yet, even \nwith this large increase in budget authority, the resolution comes \nnowhere near covering the outlays that would be necessary to fund the \nreently-passed pay increase for the military.\n  Mr. President, we are on a collision course, once again, when it \ncomes to passing the thirteen annual appropriation bills. If you liked \nthe omnibus appropriations monstrosity that was necessary to complete \naction on Fiscal Year 1999 appropriation bills, wait until you see the \nsuper-monstrosity that I believe will be necessary for Fiscal Year \n2000, if we fail to provide relief from the massive cuts that I have \njust described.\n  You ain't seen nothin' yet!\n  And, as if Fiscal Year 2000 were not enough, the problems only worsen \nin the subsequent years. By 2004, OMB projects that this budget \nresolution would require cuts in non-defense discretionary programs of \nas much as 27 percent below a freeze. Furthermore, the current \nstatutory discretionary spending caps expire in 2002 but, under this \nbudget resolution, the cuts to non-defense discretionary programs would \ndeepen to 29 percent by 2009, as non-defense discretionary spending \nwould remain substantially below inflation each year through 2009.\n  In conclusion, while I appreciate the difficulties faced by the \nBudget Committee chairman, Mr. Domenici, for whom I have great respect, \nin crafting this budget resolution, I nevertheless have concluded that \nit is a roadmap leading us back to the 1980's--a period when we saw \ntrillions of dollars of tax cuts enacted by the Reagan administration, \nbased on faulty projections of budget surpluses which never came to \npass, as well as spending cuts which were too extreme and likwise never \noccurred. Consequently, once those tax cuts were enacted, we entered a \nperiod of unprecedented budget deficits with their accompanying \ntripling of the national debt and the interest on that debt rose to \nwhere it is today--a level of almost $1 billion per day. We have turned \nthe corner after many years of hard work and a number of deficit \nreduction packages. We appear to be headed to a time of budget \nsurpluses which should be used for reducing the debt and providing \nnecessary increases in our national physical and human infrastructure \nthat are so vital to the 21st Century.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this ill-conceived \njourney along the road back to a repeat of the budgetary disasters of \nthe 1980's. Surely we can do better than this.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, since taking control of Congress in the \n1994 elections, the Republican majority has delivered on their promise \nto balance the federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office says \nthat this year the unified federal budget will have a surplus of $111 \nbillion. Over the next 5 years, these surpluses will total nearly $912 \nbillion. Of the total surplus, $768 billion is attributable to Social \nSecurity, and $144 billion in attributable to the rest of the \ngovernment.\n  The Republican majority has also delivered the tax relief we \npromised. In 1997, we passed the largest tax cut in 16 years, which is \nbringing significant relief to taxpayers this year, including a $400 \nper child tax credit (rising to $500 next year), a 20% capital gains \nrate, expanded IRAs, and tax credits and savings incentives for \neducation. We also enacted a landmark IRS reform bill, eliminated \nPresident's Clinton's 18-month holding period on capital gains, and \npassed an expansion of Education Savings Accounts.\n  The fiscal year 2000 budget we are now considering will build upon \nthese successes. Our budget is based on three principles:\n  1. Devote the entire Social Security surplus ($768 billion over 5 \nyears) to debt reduction, thus saving it for Social Security reform,\n  2. Maintain the fiscal discipline of the 1997 Bipartisan Balanced \nBudget Agreement by sticking to the discretionary spending caps, and\n  3. Return the ``rest of government'' surplus ($144 billion over 5 \nyears) to working Americans in tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, our budget is radically different from the one \nproposed last month by President Clinton.\n  In his 1998 State of the Union address, the President said, ``Tonight \nI propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus, that is every \npenny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to \nstrengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.''\n  However, according to CBO, the President's budget spends $58 billion \nof the Social Security surplus this year, and $253 billion over the \nnext five years. Even if you ``credit'' the President's proposal to \npurchase equities for the Social Security trust fund, he still spends \n$40 billion of the Social Security surplus this year, and $158 billion \nover the next five years.\n  President Clinton's proposal to save Social Security by ``devoting'' \n62 percent of the budget surplus to it is a scam. The President would \ndeposit $446 billion in IOU's into the Social Security trust fund, on \ntop of the $768 billion that would be deposited there anyway. White \nHouse officials admit the President's plan does not extend by one day \nthe year (2013) when Social Security benefits will begin to exceed \npayroll taxes.\n  Additionally, the President's budget includes a Medicare scam based \non the same faulty logic as the Social Security scam. The President \nwould transfer $123 billion of the surplus to the Medicare trust fund \nover the next five years. Again, the practical effect of this transfer \nis nothing more than more IOU's in the trust fund. And the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, a huge applause line in the State of the \nUnion, is nowhere to be found in the budget.\n  Other new programs touted in the President's State of the Union \naddress, such as the promise for Universal Savings Accounts, are also \nnowhere to be found in his budget. The Secretary of the Treasury has \nsaid that the USA accounts are a tax cut, but it is becoming clear that \nthe program will involve a progressive, refundable income tax credit \ntotaling $96 billion over 5 years, $272 billion over 10 years. This \nmassive welfare expansion will nearly double what we will already spend \non the EIC program, $139 billion over 5 years, and $293 billion over 10 \nyears. Secretary Rubin has also hinted that USA accounts will likely be \nlimited to persons without employer-provided pension programs, and that \nanyone making over $100,000 will not be able to participate.\n  Further, despite claims of ``enormous debt reduction'', CBO says the \ndebt held by the public will be $432 billion higher under the Clinton \nplan after five years than under current law. Gross public debt will be \n$973 billion higher.\n  The President's budget also breaks the discretionary spending caps by \n$33 billion in fiscal year 2000, and $434 billion over five years.\n  Finally, despite an estimated $20 trillion in tax revenues over the \nnext 10 years, the President's budget contains no tax cut. In fact, the \nPresident's budget includes a gross tax increase of $165 billion over \nten years, and a net tax increase of $89 billion.\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\n  I would like to include for the Record a couple of tables and a chart \nwhich compares the Republican budget with President Clinton's budget.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the Chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, and his staff for their fine work in \ndeveloping this budget. I think it sets us on the right path to reduce \nthe debt, cut taxes, and reform Social Security and Medicare.\n\n                                       COMPARING BUDGETS--GOP `vs' CLINTON\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           Issue                         GOP                        Clinton                   Bottom line\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security............

S3401]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 145\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, some people have mischaracterized the \nvote yesterday in favor of an amendment by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Ashcroft) as a vote against the President's plan for \ninvesting a portion of the Social Security surplus in private equities. \nSuch investments have been proposed by the President and many others as \na way to boost the return on investment of the Social Security trust \nfund's reserves. Clearly, the amendment did not reflect the President's \nplan.\n  Democrats and Republicans alike are opposed to direct investment by \nthe federal government in private financial markets. That is why the \nPresident and other proponents of diversifying the investment of the \ntrust fund have suggested that firewalls be constructed to insulate \nsuch investments from direct government control, or any interference by \nthe federal government.\n  As the Administration has made clear, such investments would be made \nby private-sector professional fund managers, overseen by a board with \nthe independence of the Federal Reserve Board. The members of the board \nwould not be able to pick and choose which stocks or industries to \ninvest in, nor exercise the voting rights associated with those shares. \nInstead, investments would be limited by law to stock index funds \nbroadly representative of the entire market.\n  Many Senators, including me, drew a very significant distinction \nbetween the government investment and investment by non-governmental \nentity on behalf of the Social Security Administration. There's a big \ndifference. Democrats and Republicans agreed that we cannot support \ndirect government investment. But many of us believe we should have \nprofessional managers oversee a certain portion of the portfolio, which \nis something altogether different. This senator supports that idea, and \nmany senators wanted to leave that option open so we could revisit it \nlater on.\n  The vote on the Ashcroft amendment was not a vote on the President's \nplan. I look forward to full consideration and debate of responsible \nproposals for investing a portion of the surplus in equities in order \nto increase the earnings on the reserves of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the budget resolution before us today \nprovides the first major increase in defense spending since 1985.\n  And I voted for it. I support the increase for National defense. In \nthe past, I have opposed increases in the defense budget. Now, I don't. \nMy colleagues must be wondering why. My colleagues may be thinking that \nthe Senator from Iowa has flip-flopped on defense.\n  I would like to explain my position.\n  I support this year's defense increase for one reason and one reason \nonly.\n  The Budget Committee is calling for financial management reforms at \nthe Department of Defense (DOD). The committee is telling DOD to bring \nits accounting practices up to accepted standards, so it can produce \n``auditable'' financial statements within two years.\n  In a nutshell, the Committee is telling DOD to do what DOD is already \nrequired to do under the law.\n  If those words were not in the Committee report, I would be standing \nhere with an amendment in my hand to cut the DOD budget.\n  Fortunately, that's not necessary.\n  I would like to thank my friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici--\nthe Committee Chairman--for placing those important words in the \nreport.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the language entitled \n``The Need for DOD Financial Reforms'' printed in the Record. It \nappears on pages 25 to 29 of the report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                        A. Spending by Function\n\n                     Function 050: National Defense\n\n\n                            Function Summary\n\n        Approve modifications to existing DoD financial \n     management programs and policies to redress the failure of \n     the Defense Department, as noted by GAO,1 to meet \n     the goals of the Chief Financial Officers Act and, thereby, \n     to produce auditable financial statements for each military \n     service and major DoD component by the year 2000. The \n     Committee's concerns regarding this important issue are \n     stated at greater length at the end of the description of \n     this budget function.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ See High Risk Series: An Update, U.S. General Accounting \n     Office, GAO/HR-99-1, January 1999, pp. 82-94, and Major \n     Management Challenges and Program Risks: Department of \n     Defense, U.S. General Accounting Office, GAO/OGC-99-5, \n     January, 1999.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     The need for DoD financial reforms\n       The Committee is concerned about the longstanding breakdown \n     of discipline in financial management at the Department of \n     Defense. Reports by the DoD Inspector General and General \n     Accounting Office consistently show that DoD's financial \n     accounts and inventories are vulnerable to theft and abuse. \n     These vulnerabilities persist for two reasons: (1) internal \n     controls are weak or nonexistent; and (2) financial \n     transactions are not accurately recorded in the books of \n     account--as they occur. While some progress has been made to \n     improve the financial accounting systems within DoD, it \n     remains a fact that DoD does not observe the age-old \n     principles of separation of duties and double-entry \n     bookkeeping, and attempts to make critical bookkeeping \n     entries weeks, months, and even years after the fact. These \n     unprofessional practices have produced billions of dollars of \n     unreconciled financial mismatches, leaving the department's \n     books of account inaccurate and unreliable.\n       The Committee believes that these deficiencies must be \n     corrected.\n       Under the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA) of 1994, \n     which expanded the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of \n     1990, the DoD Inspector General is required to audit DoD's \n     financial statements, and the General Accounting Office is \n     required to audit the government's consolidated financial \n     statements. This is done annually. Unfortunately, each year \n     the DoD audit agencies issue a disclaimer of opinion. In \n     layman's terms, this means they could not audit the books. \n     And there is nothing on the drawing board to suggest that a \n     ``clean'' audit opinion is feasible in the foreseeable \n     future. DoD has lost control of the money at the transaction \n     level. With no control at the transaction level, it is \n     physically impossible to roll up all the numbers into a top-\n     line financial statement that can stand up to audit scrutiny. \n     The numbers do not add up. DoD resorts to ``unsupported \n     adjustments'' and multi-billion dollar ``plug'' figures to \n     force the books into balance. The IG and GAO reject these \n     practices as unacceptable.\n       Even though DoD's efforts to prepare an auditable financial \n     statement have been unsuccessful so far, the Committee \n     believes that the annual CFO audits constitute a very \n     authoritative and independent assessment of the department's \n     financial management procedures. They function like a \n     critical indicator or barometer. They help to pinpoint the \n     underlying weaknesses in DoD's bookkeeping procedures. The \n     Committee believes that DoD must move in a decisive way to \n     correct these problems. So long as DoD continues to ignore \n     them, the vast audit effort dedicated to the financial \n     statements will continue to result in disclaimers of \n     opinion--an overall indictment of DoD's financial management \n     operations.\n       For these reasons, a plan that is designed to bring the \n     Defense Department into compliance with the CFO and GMRA Acts \n     would be supported by the Committee. These reforms would \n     position DoD to prepare auditable financial statements within \n     two years. The main ingredients of such a plan follow:\n       (1) Double-entry Bookkeeping: The preparation of reliable \n     financial statements is literally impossible without double-\n     entry bookkeeping. A standard accounting procedure in the \n     western world for centuries, double-entry bookkeeping records \n     both the debits and credits appropriate to each transaction. \n     A cash purchase of an asset would add the value of that asset \n     to the inventory balanced by the reduction in cash. If DoD \n     did this for each transaction, the books would ``balance,'' \n     that is, debits would equal credits, the books would \n     accurately reflect the cost of operations, and the taxpayers \n     would be assured that something of value was actually \n     received for the money spent. Under current law, the military \n     services are supposed to have ``asset management systems'' in \n     place today that would provide an accurate and complete \n     accounting for the quantity, cost and location of all \n     inventory items. No such system is in existence, however. DoD \n     must adopt a double-entry bookkeeping system in order to \n     generate reliable financial statements.\n       (2) Recording Transactions Promptly: Financial transactions \n     must be accurately recorded in the books of account--as they \n     occur. Under current DoD policies, billions of dollars of \n     transactions are not posted until long after the fact, if \n     ever. In many cases, it takes DoD weeks, months, and even \n     years to make necessary accounting entries. In other \n     documented cases, DoD policies authorize the posting of \n     transactions to the wrong accounts with the idea of avoiding \n     negative liquidated obligations or correcting errors at \n     ``contract close-out'' years later. Attempting to reconcile \n     contracts with payment records years after-the-fact usually \n     proves to be a futile and very costly task. As long as the \n     department's books of account fail to accurately reflect \n     obligations and expenditures, Congress can not be sure that \n     DoD is spending the money as specified in law or that costs \n     reflected in DoD's financial statements are accurate. DoD \n     must record all transactions in the books of account \n     immediately--as they occur.\n       (3) Transaction-driven General Ledger: To help ensure \n     reliable financial management\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n     information, Congress passed the Federal Financial Management \n     Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). This law required all \n     federal agencies to activate a Standard General Ledger at the \n     transaction level that complied with accepted accounting \n     standards. According to GAO, DoD's financial systems are non-\n     compliant with the FFMIA requirements.2\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ See GAO-AIMD-98-268, Financial Management: Federal \n     Financial Management Improvement Act Results for Fiscal Year \n     1997, US General Accounting Office, September 1998, \n     Washington, D.C.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Had DoD implemented the required Standard General Ledger \n     chart of accounts, as other agencies have, practiced double-\n     entry bookkeeping, and recorded transactions promptly and \n     accurately, all transactions should naturally roll up through \n     subsidiary accounts into general ledger accounts.\n       Moreover, if DoD accounting systems were up to accepted \n     standards, auditors could verify the accuracy of the general \n     ledger accounts by tracing the accumulation of costs back \n     down to the original entries for each transaction. This, in \n     turn, should provide a management accounting system that has \n     integrity--one the taxpayers deserve and one that is \n     necessary for completion of reliable financial statements. A \n     transaction-driven general ledger would be a powerful \n     management tool for evaluating DoD's financial performance. \n     While DoD has general ledger accounts, they lack integrity \n     because of massive gaps and the use of ``plug'' figures. \n     Transactions are simply not recorded in the books of account \n     in a timely and accurate manner. Given these continuing \n     shortcomings, it is impossible to follow the audit trail back \n     down to each original transaction. Until this problem is \n     remedied, and DoD develops reliable controls and integrated \n     financial management systems, DoD financial information will \n     be unreliable and its financial statements will be \n     unauditable.\n       (4) Separation of Duties: Organizational and functional \n     independence must be achieved at each major step in the cycle \n     of transactions. This key internal control helps to detect \n     and prevent theft, inhibits collusive fraud and offers \n     greater efficiencies in organizations that are large enough \n     to accommodate specialized operations. For instance, if truly \n     independent entities perform the separate functions of store-\n     keeping or warehousing and accounting for stores \n     transactions, fraud in either function could be discovered by \n     comparing what the store keepers show as on hand to what \n     accounting records show was purchased, used, and should be on \n     hand. With adequate separation of duties, successful fraud \n     would require collusion by not only the store-keepers and \n     accountants but also by organizationally independent managers \n     of those separate functional areas. IG and GAO reports \n     repeatedly show that DoD does not consistently adhere to the \n     age-old principle of real separation of duties--both \n     organizationally and functionally.\n       Last year, the GAO uncovered a prime example of how DoD \n     does not observe the separation of duties doctrine. The \n     Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), which performs \n     disbursing and accounting functions for the entire \n     department, is authorized to routinely alter remit addresses \n     on checks. A remit address is the address to which a check is \n     sent. Allowing DFAS to alter remit addresses is a violation \n     of the separation of duties principle that leaves the door \n     open to fraud. The office that processes bills for payment \n     should never be allowed to change a remit address on a check. \n     Such changes should be made through an independent \n     verification process. Remit addresses should be tightly \n     controlled in a central registry and only altered at request \n     of the vendor--in writing.\n       (5) Accountability: The DoD CFO and the Financial Managers \n     (FM's) for each of the three military services have been \n     granted the full spectrum of authority under the law. \n     However, these four officials appear to have delegated much \n     of their authority for payment and accounting to DFAS, which \n     disburses over $22 billion a month and employs about 20,000 \n     persons.\n       Despite the authority that has been passed down the chain \n     of command to DFAS, this organization does not exist--at \n     least in law. There is no specific provision in the U.S. Code \n     granting such authority to DFAS. The Committee fears that the \n     military services could use DFAS as a bureaucratic mechanism \n     to deflect responsibility for ongoing financial \n     mismanagement. DFAS can be blamed, but there is no \n     accountability. In fact, there is nothing in law that \n     requires personal financial accountability anywhere in DoD--\n     from the top CFO down to the lowest technician at DFAS. Even \n     DoD disbursing officials have been exempted from the law that \n     makes all other government disbursing officials ``pecuniarily \n     liable'' for erroneous or fraudulent payments.\n       If no one at DoD is held accountable for the continuing \n     pattern of financial mismanagement and ``unclean'' CFO audit \n     opinions, then the department may never succeed in producing \n     reliable financial statements.\n       The CFO and service FM's may delegate authority to DFAS but \n     not personal responsibility. The service FM's must police \n     those to whom they have delegated authority, but the final \n     responsibility resides in their offices with them. They alone \n     should be held accountable for the completion of reliable \n     financial statements.\n       These goals should be achieved with the financial statement \n     for 2000. The 1998 statements are under review at the present \n     time. If the IG and GAO identify deficiencies that preclude \n     the completion of a satisfactory financial statement for 1998 \n     and 1999, then the FM's should be responsible for making the \n     necessary adjustments and corrections.\n       The Committee fully supports actions in Congress to achieve \n     these five financial management initiatives because they are \n     specifically designed to bring the department into compliance \n     with the CFO and FFMIA Acts and to lead to the preparation of \n     reliable financial statements. In the months ahead, it is \n     expected that these initiatives will be converted into a \n     legislative reform package and introduced before \n     consideration of the 2000 defense authorization bill or other \n     appropriate legislation. The Committee intends to work \n     closely with the Armed Services Committee and other \n     appropriate committees of Congress to enact legislation that \n     addresses in a meaningful manner the goals articulated here.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take moment to tell my \ncolleagues why the language on DOD Financial Reforms is so important.\n  I want to help them understand why I am so concerned about the \nbreakdown of discipline and control in financial management at the \nPentagon.\n  I have been investigating the problem for six years, now.\n  I have come here to the floor of the Senate and spoken about it many \ntimes.\n  I have offered amendments.\n  I raised these same concerns during hearings before the Budget \nCommittee earlier this year--on February 24 and again on March 2nd.\n  My Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight held a hearing \nlast September on the lack of effective internal financial controls at \nDOD.\n  I am planning another hearing later this year.\n  The General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Inspector General (IG) \nhave issued report after report after report exposing these problems.\n  Every single shred of evidence points to the breakdown of financial \ncontrols at the Pentagon.\n  IG and GAO reports consistently demonstrate that DOD accounts and \nassets are vulnerable to theft and abuse.\n  They show that internal controls are weak or nonexistent.\n  They show that financial transactions are not recorded in the books \nof accounts--as they occur--promptly and accurately.\n  They show that payments are deliberately posted to the wrong \naccounts. Sometimes transactions are not recorded in the books for \nmonths or even years--and sometimes maybe never.\n  DOD has no effective capability for tracking the quantity, value and \nlocations of assets and inventory.\n  DOD has lost control of the money at the transaction level.\n  With no control at the transaction level, it is physically impossible \nto roll up all the numbers into a top-line financial statement that can \nstand up to scrutiny and audit.\n  Sloppy accounting procedures generate billions of dollars of \nunreconciled transactions--mismatches between official accounting \nrecords and inventory and disbursing records.\n  Billions and billions of dollars of unreconciled mismatches make it \nimpossible to audit DOD's books.\n  As a result, DOD gets a failing grade on its annual financial \nstatements that are required by law. Each year, the IG has to issue a \ndisclaimer of opinion.\n  Unfortunately, there is nothing on the drawing board to suggest that \na ``clean'' audit opinion is feasible in the foreseeable future. DOD \njust doesn't have the accounting tools to get the job done.\n  There will be no improvement in this dismal picture without reform--\nand some pressure from the Budget Committee and other committees.\n  Without reform, the vast effort dedicated to auditing the annual \nfinancial statements will be wasted effort.\n  The report language lays out a general framework for reform.\n  These reforms are not new or dramatic.\n  The Committee report language just tells DOD to get on the stick and \ndo what it is already supposed to be doing--under the law. And it calls \nfor some accountability to help get the job done.\n  This report language should help to move DOD toward a ``clean'' audit \nopinion within two years.\n  And there is another important reason why this language is needed \ntoday.\n  As I stated a moment ago, we are looking at the first big increase in \ndefense spending since 1985.\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\n  I think the Committee needs to be on the record, telling the Pentagon \nto get its financial house in order.\n  If the Pentagon wants all this extra money, then the Pentagon needs \nto fulfill its Constitutional responsibility to the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  First, it needs to regain control of the taxpayers' money it's \nspending right now.\n  And second, it needs to provide a full and accurate accounting of how \nall the money gets spent.\n  DOD must be able to present an accurate and complete accounting of \nall financial transactions--including all receipts and expenditures. It \nneeds to be able to do this once a year.\n  The GAO and IG auditors should be able to examine the Department's \nbooks and its financial statements and render a ``clean'' audit \nopinion.\n  That's the goal.\n  Mr. President, I would like to extend a special word of thanks to the \nCommittee Chairman, my friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for \nincluding this important language in the report.\n  I would like to thank him for understanding and accepting the urgent \nneed for financial management reform at the Pentagon.\n  I would like to thank him for working with me in urging the Pentagon \nto move in the direction of sound financial management.\n  Mr. President, in my mind, DOD financial management reform is \nmandatory as we move to larger DOD budgets.\n  I understand that the language is not binding.\n  It's simply the first step in the effort to bring about financial \nreform and accountability at DOD through legislation later this year.\n  In the months ahead, I look forward to working with the Armed \nServices and Appropriations Committees to make it happen.\n  The Chairman of the Committee has agreed to help me do it.\n  He made a commitment to ``work closely'' with the Armed Services \nCommittee to develop a legislative reform package that addresses the \nissues raised in the report.\n  I hope the Armed Services Committee will cooperate and find a way to \naddress the need for financial reforms in tandem with more defense \nmoney.\n  Higher defense budgets need to be hooked up to financial reforms--\njust like a horse and buggy--one behind the other. They need to move \ntogether.\n  And I hope other members of the Budget Committee will join me in that \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in 1997, we reached an historic agreement on \nthe budget. Building upon the budgets of 1990 and 1993, we brought the \nbudget into balance for the first time in 30 years. Today, the budget \nbefore us is equally significant, as it is the first budget of the 21st \ncentury. It is one that should reflect what we, as the last Senators of \nthe 20th century, believe should be the priorities of our country as we \nmove into the next millenium.\n  As we prepare to enter the next century, we need a budget that will \nprotect our senior citizens--the people who have given a lifetime of \nwork to their families, communities and country. They need to know that \nthey will be secure in their golden years with good health care and a \ndecent income. Unfortunately, this budget fails to provide this measure \nof security, as it fails to provide for the continued strength and \nsolvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n  Although this budget saves projected Social Security surpluses and \nuses those surpluses to retire public debt, it contains no provisions \nto reform the Social Security program and provides no new assets to the \nSocial Security trust fund. In this regard, this budget fails to extend \nthe solvency of the trust fund. In contrast, the Administration's \nbudget proposes specific policies, including transferring publicly held \ndebt to the trust fund, which would extend the life of the Social \nSecurity trust fund until the year 2055.\n  In addition, this budget simply ignores Medicare, Part A of which is \ndue to be bankrupt by the year 2008. It takes funds needed for Medicare \nand uses them to pay for a tax cut that largely benefits the more well-\nto-do in our society. Not a single extra dollar is guaranteed for this \ncritical priority and therefore this budget has the potential to \nnegatively impact the millions of Americans who will depend on Medicare \nfor their health care in the future. The Administration, however, has \nproposed allocating 15 percent of the projected unified budget \nsurpluses for Medicare--nearly $700 billion over the next 15 years--\nwhich would extend the solvency of this program for another 12 years, \nto the year 2020.\n  Mr. President, we also need a budget that will provide for the \neducation needs of our people. Nothing is more critically important \nthan to provide every child with a good education so that they can grow \nup to lead productive lives, contributing to the prosperity of their \nfamilies and country. Unfortunately this budget fails to meet this \npriority, as well. Although I applaud the efforts of Chairman Domenici \nto increase funding for elementary and secondary education, this budget \ndoes so at the expense of equally important education initiatives, like \nHead Start. In fact, under the Republican plan nearly 100,000 children \nwould lose Head Start services.\n  This budget shortchanges our commitment to many other domestic \npriorities, as well. Under this budget, paying for an $800 billion tax \ncut that would benefit the wealthy would require cuts in non-defense \ndiscretionary spending of $20 billion in the next year alone, affecting \nour efforts to police our streets, to clean up our air and water, and \nto wage aggressive diplomacy so that we do not have to wage war. More \nspecifically, Mr. President, under the Republican plan, more than 1 \nmillion low-income women, infants and children would lose nutrition \nassistance each month and 73,000 summer job opportunities for low-\nincome youths would be eliminated.\n  These cuts are draconian and untenable. Newspapers report that even \nRepublican appropriations leaders consider these cuts to be \nunrealistic. They predict that when appropriations bills come to the \nFloor, it is unlikely that they will contain the cuts proposed by this \nbudget.\n  Finally, we need a budget in the 21st century that is fiscally \nresponsible--a budget that sends a message to our trading partners, the \nmarkets, and future generations that the era of runaway deficits is \nover, and that we will not saddle future generations with a national \ndebt that robs them of their ability to make productive investments and \nhurts our nation's ability to grow and prosper. Sadly, this legislation \nis fiscally risky and fails to meet these goals.\n  Although this budget calls for a small tax cut in the first couple of \nyears, the cost explodes in the future. In fact, by the year 2009, \nthese cuts will drain the Treasury by more than $170 billion in that \nyear alone. Let me be clear, I am not opposed to tax cuts, but I \nsupport carefully targeted tax cuts that would provide relief to those \nwho most need our help. Regrettably, this budget provides a sweeping \ntax cut for those in our society who need it least, and does so largely \nat the expense of funding for both Medicare and other domestic \npriorities relied on by millions of working Americans.\n  In conclusion, I regret for a number of reasons that I am unable to \nsupport this budget--not least of which is the high regard and esteem \nwith which I hold Chairman Domenici. I think all of us in this body \nrecognize that the country has been fortunate to have someone of his \nintellect and experience dealing with these extraordinarily complex \nissues. Moreover, while I am grateful that a majority of my colleagues \naccepted the amendment sponsored by my distinguished colleague from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, and myself to increase funding for child \ncare by $5 billion, the modest improvement that this makes to the bill \ndoes not change its fundamentally flawed nature.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity and an obligation to enact a \nbudget that meets the test of time. Unfortunately, I believe that the \nresolution before the Senate has failed to meet that objective. I think \nwe can do better and I believe we must do better as we move forward in \nthe effort to define priorities.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Service Chiefs testified before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee on September 29, 1998, and again on \nJanuary 5, 1999, that they require an additional\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\n$20.0 billion in fiscal year 2000 for defense--over and above the \namounts contained in the Balanced Budget Agreement--to reverse the \nserious problems they are witnessing in military readiness. During the \nPosture Hearings held by the Armed Services Committee in February and \nMarch, the Service Secretaries and Service Chiefs confirmed that \nsignificant funding shortfalls remain--despite the increases contained \nin the budget request. Each service submitted a significant list of \nremaining ``unfunded requirements.''\n  While I appreciate the efforts of the Budget Committee to address \nthese funding shortfalls with an increase of $14.6 billion in budget \nauthority for defense, I am concerned with the serious shortfall in \noutlays. The outlay funding level of $274.6 billion contained in the \nBudget Resolution is insufficient to fund the projected levels of \nbudget authority in either the defense budget request or the budget \nresolution. At least $287.3 billion in outlays is needed to fund the \nbudget authority levels contained in the Budget Resolution. This is an \nincrease of $12.7 billion over the caps listed in the Resolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to add to my colleague's \ncomments. The budget gimmicks in the defense budget as submitted by the \nAdministration create a shortfall of at least $8.3 billion in budget \nauthority. Under Senate rules, we cannot pass a defense appropriations \nbill which buys the programs advertised by the Department of Defense as \nbeing budgeted. We would require at least $10 billion in outlays to \neven fund the Administration's defense request. While the budget \nresolution adds $8.3 billion in budget authority, it cuts outlays by \n$8.7 billion relative to the CBO scoring of the defense budget request. \nEven under OMB scoring, the budget resolution provides only $500 \nmillion in outlays to spend with the $8.3 billion in budget authority. \nThis mix of money will not work, and clearly does not even let us erase \nall of the administration's budget gimmicks.\n  The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has also held hearings to \nreview the readiness requirements of our military forces. If the \ncurrent outlay problem is not resolved satisfactorily, Congress will be \nresponsible for failure to provide adequate resources for our \nmilitary's needs as readiness problems become more apparent. With \nmilitary operations currently being conducted in Kosovo, this would be \nthe wrong signal to be sending at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I agree with both of my distinguished \ncolleagues, the Chairmen of the Appropriations and Armed Services \nCommittees, that the Administration's defense budget request is \ninadequate to meet our national security requirements. My intent is \nthat this Budget Resolution would fully fund the $17.5 billion \nrequested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the next five years. This \nadditional spending would be devoted to restoring military readiness to \nacceptable levels. it is also my intention that the funding in this \nresolution would also provide money, at least in part, to begin the \nmodernization of the currently aging inventory of U.S. weapons, and to \nfund priority quality of life initiatives for the servicemen and women \nin our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Budget Committee to provide some type of funding relief in the form \nof increased outlay funding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would join my colleague in seeking \nclarification on what steps the distinguished Chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee is prepared to take to make it possible to pass a \ndefense spending bill that preserves our military's readiness and limit \nthe erosion of modernization.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my two good friends, I agree \nthat there is an outlay mismatch in this resolution for the National \nDefense function and I will work to resolve this problem. Sufficient \noutlays are necessary to execute the level of budget authority for \nNational Defense in the Budget Resolution to address the serious \nreadiness, recruitment, and retention problems in our military \nservices. I intend to review scorekeeping differences between the OMB \nand CBO on outlays prior, outlay rates, and policy to resolve this \nissue. I will consult with the two distinguished Chairmen and keep them \ninformed during this process. I assure the Chairmen of the \nAppropriations and Armed Services Committees that this problem will \nreceive my full attention until it is resolved to our satisfaction.\n  In addition, I know both Chairmen share my concerns about atomic \nenergy defense capabilities in an increasingly unstable world.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, in my capacity as Chairman of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I want to raise an issue of \ncritical importance with my friend, the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici. Mr. Chairman, it has come to my attention \nthat there is a substantial difference between the Office of Management \nand Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in terms of \nthe estimated outlay costs of the highway and transit firewalls, as \ncontained in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-\n21).\n  As the Chairman is aware, TEA-21 effectively established the \naggregate obligation limitations pertaining to our major federal \nhighway and transit programs for the six years covered by TEA-21. \nDespite the fact that the CBO and OMB are required to strive each year \nto minimize differences in their outlay estimates for each program in \nthe federal government, we find that there is a dramatic difference \nbetween the outlay estimates that CBO and OMB attribute to the cost of \nfully funding the firewalls for highways and transit in FY 2000. \nSpecifically, the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the outlays \nassociated with the highway firewall is a full $772 million higher than \nthe amount estimated by OMB. Similarly, the CBO estimates that the \noutlays associated with the transit firewall is a full $569 million \nhigher than the level assumed by OMB. Taken together, there is more \nthan a $1.3 billion difference between the two agencies' estimates.\n  It is my understanding that, for purposes of developing this budget \nresolution, the Chairman assumed the lower of these outlay figures for \nthe highway and transit firewalls. I want to inquire whether the \nChairman of the Budget Committee intends to score the Transportation \nAppropriations Bill for FY 2000 in an identical fashion when the bill \nis reported by the Appropriations Committee later this year. If the \nTransportation Appropriations bill is scored with the much higher \noutlay estimates associated with the CBO estimate, it is possible that \nthe Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee's entire outlay \nallocation could be needed solely to honor the highway and transit \nfirewalls leaving little or no other resources for the needs for the \nFederal Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard, and the National \nRailroad Passenger Corporation.\n  This illustrates the danger of firewalls within budget functions. \nThey create a perverse incentive for the Administration to \nunderestimate the outlay impacts in order to shift budgetary resources \nto other priorities--but when the request comes to Congress it must be \nscored by CBO. Accordingly, the budget resolution and the \nappropriations bill run the risk of substantially higher outlay scoring \non firewall accounts than the Administration assumed and accordingly \nmust cut the firewalled functions or other discretionary programs to \naccommodate the increased outlays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations \nsubcommittee is quite correct in his observations and I appreciate his \nraising this issue at this time. Indeed, there are dramatic differences \nin the outlay estimates associated with the highway and transit \nfirewalls, as scored by CBO and OMB.\n  The Budget Act provides that the budget resolution cannot set outlay \nlevels in excess of the amounts set forth in TEA-21 as adjusted by OMB. \nThe difference between OMB and CBO outlay estimates presents a problem \nfor meeting the highway and transit outlay limits under CBO's \nestimates.\n  I thank the Senator for raising this issue. We need to find some way \nto address this issue prior to the Senate taking up the Transportation \nAppropriations bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the budget resolution \nwhich the majority has presented to the Senate. In my judgement, this \nbudget represents the wrong priorities. It places\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\ntoo great an emphasis on tax breaks which largely benefit the \nwealthiest among us and too little on the protection of Medicare.\n  Just six years ago, the nation was faced with annual deficits of more \nthan $300 billion as far as the eye could see. In 1993, President \nClinton presented and Congress approved by one vote in each House a \ndeficit reduction plan that continues to pay dividends. Instead of \nbillions of dollars of federal deficits, surpluses are forecast for the \nnext fifteen years. This is a remarkable accomplishment. It presents us \nwith the opportunity to make critical investments in the nation's \nfuture and to reduce the national debt. However, we must act wisely.\n  We have seen many federal budget estimates, and we know well that as \nquickly as these surpluses appeared, they could disappear. The \nestimates of both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \nManagement and Budget have frequently been far off the mark in recent \nyears. That is not their fault. We have some of the brightest \neconomists in the country working at CBO and at OMB and they do a very \ngood job, but they have a difficult task to do. Forecasting the \nperformance of the economy, particularly over the course of several \nyears is more art than science. For instance, last August CBO estimated \nthat the unified budget surplus for fiscal year 2000 was $79 billion. \nJust four months later in a January 1999 CBO document, the surplus for \nfiscal year 2000 is estimated at $130 billion. This is a change of over \n60% in just four months and early indications are that in August the \nsurplus amounts will rise even higher. I believe that if most Americans \nwere confronted with such uncertainty over their own budget situation, \nthey would recommend a cautious course. I agree.\n  The President has established the framework for this new budget \ndebate by his determination to strengthen Social Security. There is no \nmore important or effective program. Two-thirds of those who collect \nSocial Security rely on it for more than 50% of their income. The \nPresident's plan to save Social Security through debt retirement is \nlargely intact in this resolution. This is a significant victory for \nthe President and the American people, and it has broad support in the \nSenate. I look forward to supporting the legislation to implement this \npolicy of debt reduction .\n  Unfortunately, the majority party has not included the President's \npolicy of debt reduction to shore up Medicare in this resolution. The \nPresident set aside fifteen percent of the surplus for Medicare, but \nthis resolution does not. This omission is crucial when one considers \nthat although Social Security is already solvent through 2033, Medicare \nis solvent only until 2008. We all know how important the Medicare \nprogram is. Today the Medicare program provides health care to 39 \nmillion Americans. By 2032, the number of Medicare beneficiaries will \ndouble to 78 million as the baby boomers retire. Considering these \ndemographics, it is unwise not to use part of our current budget \nsurplus to help shore up the Medicare program, which will also need \nstructural reforms. Unfortunately, the budget resolution before us does \nnot shore up existing commitments to Medicare and our seniors. Instead \nthis resolution takes us back to the bad old days of backloaded tax \nbreaks whose real costs explode several years after enactment. For \nexample, the GOP tax plan uses $177 billion of the surplus in the first \nfive years after enactment and actually has no cost in the first year. \nBut, in the second five years, the cost of the tax cut more than \ntriples to $664 billion. This budgetary time bomb is set go off at the \nsame time as the Medicare trust fund is expected to be bankrupt. \nSenator Kennedy's amendment, which I supported, would have set aside \npart of the surplus for the Medicare trust fund and avoided this \noutcome. The Kennedy amendment was defeated. The Republican majority, \nunfortunately, seems headed yet again this year for a showdown with the \nPresident and Democrats in the Congress over the budget.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 145\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, yesterday, I joined \nSenator Ashcroft and others in offering an amendment to the budget \nresolution for Fiscal Year 2000. Our amendment addresses a troubling \naspect of the President's Social Security proposal, about which I would \nlike to say a few words.\n  President Clinton's plan calls for government-controlled investment \nof a sizeable portion of the Social Security trust funds. Our amendment \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal government should \nnot be directly investing the Social Security trust funds in private \nfinancial markets.\n  Enabling the Federal government to own millions of dollars worth of \nprivate shares in corporations is a recipe for disaster. No matter how \nmuch care is taken to avoid bias in government-controlled investment \ndecisions, the potential for abuse would always be present. Even if an \nindependent board is charged with making the investment decisions on \nbehalf of the government, there is always the risk that the board would \nbe overwhelmed by political pressure from lobbyists, lawmakers and \nothers.\n  Inevitably, special interest groups or politicians would seek to \ninfluence the investment decisions. Questions such as whether or not a \nparticular investment would benefit a corporation that hires union \nworkers or is located in a certain state might become important \nconsiderations. The result would be that the rate of return on an \ninvestment would become secondary to numerous political or other \nconcerns.\n  Also, under the President's plan, the government would eventually own \nprivate stocks worth $600 billion or more. That could have perverse \neffects on the free market.\n  Government-controlled investment of the Social Security trust funds \nwould make possible what some have called ``crony capitalism.'' In a \nrecent paper on this subject, Daniel Mitchell of the Heritage \nFoundation warned that government-controlled investment would give \nlawmakers power to control the economy indirectly by attempting to pick \nwinners and losers.\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, is one of the more \nnoteworthy critics of President Clinton's idea for government-\ncontrolled investment. Chairman Greenspan has said that it ``would \narguably put at risk the efficiency of our capital markets and thus, \nour economy.'' Mr. President, the Senate should heed his words and \nreject any plan to have the government directly involved in the \ninvestment of Social Security trust funds.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senator Schumer and I have offered this \namendment to strike Sec. 314 of S. Con. Res. 20, the Fiscal Year 2000 \nbudget resolution. Sec. 314 expresses the Sense of the Senate that \nGovernors Island will be sold during Fiscal Year 2000. The underlying \nassumption is that it will be sold for $500 million. Another \nassumption--not stated in Sec. 314--is that the $500 million will be \nused as an off-set to help pay for Federal crop insurance reform.\n  At the outset, I must say that I support crop insurance reform. Our \nfarmers are the most productive in the world. I wonder, from time to \ntime, if we appreciate just how affordable--and plentiful--food is in \nthis country. If crop insurance reform will help our farmers to weather \nnatural disasters and low commodity prices, I'm for it. But I have a \nserious problem with using the sale of Governors Island to pay for it \nfor two reasons. The first is based on principle; the second, on \npracticality.\n  There is a question of fairness here. Governors Island was part of \nNew York before the United States existed. In 1800, New York State \nrather magnanimously gave jurisdiction--but not title--over Governors \nIsland to the Federal government. Then, New York spent its own monies \nto construct Fort Jay and other harbor fortifications and batteries, \nsuch as Castle Clinton and Castle William. These fortifications \nsuccessfully deterred the British from attempting to enter New York \nHarbor during the War of 1812. Governors Island has served our nation \nwell. It is the site, after all, where Operation Overlord was planned \nfifty-five years ago.\n  On June 18, 1958, a Federal district court determined that the \nFederal government needed to take title to the Island and awarded New \nYork one dollar as ``just compensation''. Since then, the Army moved \nout, and the Island's most recent tenant, the Coast Guard, left in \n1997. Now, the 173-acre island sits vacant in New York Harbor.\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\n  On October 22, 1995, President Clinton invited me to join him at the \n50th anniversary of the United Nations' General Assembly. On the \nhelicopter flight from Kennedy Airport we flew over the Lower Harbor; I \npointed out Castle William, Fort Jay, and some other fortifications and \nbuildings, starting with Cornbury's Queen Anne mansion built in 1708. I \nnoted that the Coast Guard was about to leave and that, presumedly, all \nwould agree that the Island should revert to New York. President \nClinton said that was fine with him, providing it would be used for \npublic purposes. I demurred somewhat--that would involve a whole lot of \npublic purpose--but accepted the offer. We left it there with \nsufficient accord.\n\n  Governors Island belonged to New York. New York lent it to the \nFederal government. Now that the Federal government is no longer using \nit, New York should get it back, for no more than a nominal sum.\n  Unfortunately, and rather to my surprise, when President Clinton \nsubmitted his Fiscal Year 1998 budget request, he proposed selling \nGovernors Island in Fiscal Year 2002 for $500 million. Congress seized \non the idea--so much so, in fact, that we have ``sold'' Governors \nIsland a couple of times already!\n  Now Members propose that we sell Governors Island, in Fiscal Year \n2000, to pay for crop insurance reform. Even if we put principle and \nfairness aside, there are real practical problems with this proposal. I \nguess the first is that there are no buyers. None. Certainly not at the \nasking price. We don't know how the Island will be zoned. There is no \nregular ferry service. It costs about $12 million to $15 million each \nyear just to maintain the buildings, many of which are historic.\n  Back in 1997, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated fair \nmarket value to be between $250 million and $1.0 billion. That's a \npretty big range. There was no appraisal. Any appraisal would be highly \nspeculative since the impact of zoning decisions and ultimate disposal \nof the Island remain unknown. Moreover, I do not believe that any CBO \nofficials ever contacted anyone at the General Services Administration \n(GSA) who would be, perhaps, more knowledgeable about what sort of \nprice the Island might fetch. I can tell you this: New York State, or \nNew York City, won't pay a dime more than a dollar. So, in this \ninstance, the CBO estimate is highly suspect. The site is magnificent, \nbut it will be a considerable achievement to combine some public and \nprivate uses that preserve the historic portion of the Island. The \ncombination eludes us still. In the meantime, we could lose it all if \nit should go unused for a few more New York winters.\n  So I repeat what I said at the outset: I am for crop insurance \nreform. But Governors Island won't pay for it, because the Island will \nnot be sold for $500 million next year. It won't be sold for any price \nbecause there are no buyers. We haven't figured out what to do with it \nyet.\n  Governors Island belonged to New York, and New York ought to have it \nback. It is, at the same time, a national treasure for the historic \nvalue of its fortifications, buildings, and what has taken place there. \nI hope that Congress, and the Administration, will stop this tiresome \ntendency of ``selling'' it whenever some other program or initiative--\nlaudable, I'm sure--needs an off-set. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico (Senator Domenici) and the Senator from New Jersey (Senator \nLautenberg) for their willingness to accept the amendment Senator \nSchumer and I have offered to strike Sec. 314 from S. Con. Res. 20.\n\n\n                governors island and the federal budget\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Moynihan \nto offer an amendment to strike Section 314 of S. Con. Res. 20, the \nFiscal Year 2000 Budget Resolution. Section 314 expresses the Sense of \nthe Senate that Governors Island will be sold during Fiscal Year 2000.\n  While the intention of the sale, to provide an offset for crop \ninsurance reform, is a worthy one, it is an illusory offset and will \nseriously undermine New York's efforts to turn this historic gem into \nan economically viable site. It is also a matter of fundamental \nfairness--President Clinton made the offer to Senator Moynihan to give \nthe Island back to New York for one dollar--the very sum the Federal \nGovernment paid to the State for the Island back in 1958. Now that the \nIsland's last tenant, the U.S. Coast Guard has gone, Governors Island \nshould be returned to New York, not sold to provide offsets for other \nprograms across the country, however well-intentioned those programs \nmight be.\n  I thank Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg for their willingness \nto accept the amendment Senator Moynihan and I have offered. We will \ncontinue to strongly resist all attempts to thwart New York's efforts \nto develop Governors island for use by our own citizens, who are \nunderstandably anxious to reclaim this unique treasure.\n\n\n                                medicare\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we begin debating the budget which takes \nus into the twenty first century, I am disappointed that my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle continue to practice the Medicare \npolitics of the past.\n  Over the course of the last week, I've heard member after member come \nto the Senate floor to decry the Republican budget for allegedly \nthrowing our nation's seniors into destitution by sacrificing Medicare \nin order to pay for tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, as we listen to this discussion about the budget and \nthe Medicare provisions contained within it, I keep coming back to one \nsimple question. If the President's budget plan was so good for the \ncountry and saved Medicare, why did every member of his party on the \nBudget Committee vote against it? There is only one answer: President \nClinton's so-called Medicare set-aside of 15 percent of the budget \nwould do absolutely nothing to address the very real problems facing \nMedicare and we all know that.\n  Indeed, the General Accounting Office (GAO), which we depend upon to \nprovide impartial testimony, investigations and research, has concluded \nPresident Clinton's Medicare plan is meaningless in terms of either the \nbudget or the Medicare program. This corroborates the conclusions \nreached by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, Medicare has always used the 2.9 percent payroll tax \non a worker's wages to pay for current benefits. It has been so since \nthe program was enacted in 1965 and its crafters intended it to stay \nthat way.\n  The president, by promising to use projected surpluses and general \nfunds to shore up the Medicare program, is in fact promising to use \n``IOU's'' to shore up ``IOU's'' and altering the premise under which \nMedicare was enacted.\n\n  I was and is supposed to be a self-sustaining program paid for by \npayroll taxes. It is not funded by general revenues, therefore Democrat \ncharges that our tax relief out of the non-Social Security surplus \ncomes at the expense of Medicare is just not true. Our tax relief \nreturns overpaid income taxes. It does not cut the Social Security or \nMedicare payroll tax that funds Social Security or Medicare. The use of \ngeneral funds to prop-up the program reverts it to a general welfare-\ntype program which was soundly rejected in the early 1960's.\n  So adding more IOU's, as the President would like us to do, does \nnothing but add more meaningless pieces of paper which don't represent \nany new cash within the program to pay for health care services. In \nshort, it is a hoax played upon the American people by its government \nwhich doesn't save Medicare.\n  The budget resolution before us today provides for $10 billion more \nfor the Medicare program than the President requested. It locks away \nSocial Security surpluses to protect them from being spent on non-\nSocial Security programs. It also prepares us for the real task at \nhand--reforming Social Security and Medicare to ensure they will be \nself-sustaining for future beneficiaries.\n  Under our plan, all of the projected Social Security surpluses are \nsaved solely for Social Security. Of the non-Social Security surplus, \nover $100 billion is set-aside in the event it is needed during the \nimportant process of reforming the Medicare program we will soon \naddress. The $100 billion set-aside is real money, not paper promises. \nIt represents real assets which can put us on the road to modernizing a \ncrucially important health care program that has been struck in the \n1960's.\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\n  The practice of medicine has changed dramatically since the Medicare \nprogram was enacted. It's time we reformed Medicare to more accurately \nreflect our health care system, which still provide the most efficient \nand sought-after care in the world.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator Breaux, who \nably co-chaired the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, to \naddress the long term solvency crisis in Medicare. I whole-heartedly \nagree with my colleague from Louisiana when he said that ``Medicare \ncannot, should not, and must not be a `wedge' issue. That is old \npolitics and the old way of looking at this problem. Looking at it in \nthat fashion has led us to never solve it with any serious reform since \nit was passed in 1965. The issue for the 1990's and the 21st century \ncannot be a tax cut versus saving Medicare. That is an improper \nstatement of the problem facing this Congress. . . . It is not an \neither/or situation and should not be made to be so.''\n  Clearly, Senator Breaux and my colleagues have the best interest of \nthe Medicare program in mind as we consider this budget. He understands \ntax relief does not conflict with our goal to reform Medicare. By \nsetting aside over $100 billion for the express purpose of funding the \nreformation of the Medicare program, we do more to ensure the viability \nof the health care program for our nation's seniors than the \nPresident's budget full of empty promises.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support this responsible, truthful and \nmeaningful budget resolution. It protects Social Security and Medicare, \nprovides major tax relief and debt reduction and it continues important \nspending priorities. It represents a tremendous step in the right \ndirection for the United States and its people.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my dissapointment \nwith S. Con. Res. 20, the FY 2000 Budget Resolution. After our economy \nhas enjoyed seven years of strong growth, I had hoped that this year's \nBudget Resolution, the first in the new millenium, would set policy \npriorities that would strengthen our economy. After seven years of \nphenomenal economic growth, it is a shame that we cannot convert our \ngains into ensuring a more secure economic future.\n  This Budget Resolution fails to take positive steps by trying to do \ntoo much. The Resolution calls for using surplus funds for tax cuts, \nwhile maintaining the statutory spending caps.\n  The Budget Resolution fails to protect Medicare or Social Security, \nfails to increase national savings, and cuts important spending \npriorities. It is neither financially prudent nor economically sound.\n  It could endanger our sound economy and squander an historic \nopportunity to raise the living standards of all Americans and to \nensure a dignified retirement for our seniors.\n  S. Con. Res. 20 favors massive tax cuts over paying down the massive \nnational debt, over protecting Medicare and Social Security, and over \nkey important domestic initiatives. By keeping the statutory caps and \nusing the surplus for tax cuts, the Budget Resolution makes deep cuts \nin science technology, in research and development, in important \nenvironmental protection initiatives, while failing to protect Medicare \nand the retirement security of our workers and families.\n\n\n  The Budget Resolution Undermines Current and Future Economic Growth.\n\n  The fiscal policies outlined in the Budget Resolution threaten the \nhealth of our growing economy. The Budget Resolution calls for using \nall surplus funds for tax cuts and nothing for reducing our federal \ndebt. For the past several years, a declining federal debt has \ncontributed to a decline in interest rates. Less government debt has \ntranslated into lower interest rates and lower interest rates have \npromoted greater investment and growth in our economy. It is no \ncoincidence that of the G-7 countries, we are the only country with a \nbalanced federal budget and strong economic growth. Using surplus funds \nfor debt reduction sustains the virtuous cycle of lower interests \nrates, higher investment in our economy, and job creation. By choosing \ntax cuts over any debt reduction, this Budget Resolution has put us \nback to the era of the same trickle down economics that led to \ninflation and stagnation.\n  Achieving a budget surplus has required some very strong measures and \nhas come at some cost. It was not long ago that Congress adopted the \nBudget Enforcement Act to curb our appetite for spending. Since then we \nhave better managed our spending and tax cutting through a number of \nimportant rules and statutes. Unfortunately, this Budget Resolution \nrepeals the pay-as-you-go rule, the very rule that has been most \nresponsible for bringing fiscal discipline to this body.\n\n\n  The Budget Resolution Fails to Protect Medicare and Social Security\n\n  The budget proposal for FY2000 does nothing to restore the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds back to solvency. It is unfortunate \nthat at this time of robust economic growth and projected surpluses, \nthe Republican budget does nothing to solve the looming Medicare and \nSocial Security problems. The Budget Resolution calls for saving the \nSocial Security surplus for Social Security. This is far from an \nadequate solution to the Social Security problem.\n  The resolution also fails to address the more immediate problem of \nMedicare. Projected to go into deficit in 2008, the Medicare trust fund \nis in desperate need of funds. While the President has dedicated $350 \nbillion dollars for Medicare, the Budget proposal dedicates nothing. \nHere again, I cannot understand why we do not take advantage of budget \nsurpluses to help extend the solvency of Medicare.\n\n\n  The Budget Resolution Forces Deep Cuts in Non-Defense Discretionary \n                                Spending\n\n  I would support a decision to adhere to the overall levels of \ndiscretionary spending established in the Budget Enforcement Act.\n  The Budget maintains the current statutory spending caps and then \nchooses tax cuts over spending increases in several key areas. The \nBudget makes a major cut--7.5%--in all non-defense spending. Combined \nwith using surplus funds for tax cuts, this means that many important \ndomestic priorities such as environment and technology research have to \nbe cut.\n\n\n             Reduction in research and development funding\n\n  In the proposed budget before us, the small and declining accounts in \nR are a direct prescription for long term economic decline. There \nhave been at least a dozen major economic studies, including those of \nNobel Prize winner Robert Solow, which conclude that technological \nprogress accounts for 50 percent or more of total growth and has twice \nthe impact on economic growth as labor or capital. Ironically, we have \nspent far more time in Congress debating the economic impact of labor \nand capital, in the form of jobs and tax bills, than we have ever \ndevoted to R This Budget follows in that trend. Mr. President, by \ncutting R funding this budget provides us with another chance to fall \nbehind. It does a disservice to both our well-being as a society, and \nour well-being as an economy. I hope my colleagues will reconsider the \nmeasure.\n\n\n                              Environment\n\n  I am also concerned that funding for natural resources and \nenvironmental protection is being cut too steeply to make way for tax \ncuts. The proposed budget resolution reduces funding for priority \ndomestic environmental programs to roughly 11% below current levels. \nThis cut hurts programs that are critical for building clean, livable \ncommunities and protecting natural resources and wildlife. Ongoing \nefforts to enforce existing public health protections in drinking water \nwould be curtailed. Energy efficiency and clean energy technology \ninitiatives that save consumers money, reduce dependence on foreign oil \nand curb air pollution would be slashed. Funds for states to preserve \nopen space, coast land, and urban parks would be cut. And the list goes \non and on. The direction of these cuts runs directly counter to the \nneeds of our neighborhoods and our nation, and ignores the reality that \na clean environment is integral to building a sustainable and strong \neconomy. We should not allow important public health and environmental \nprotections to be sacrificed. Future generations and the public trust \nwill ultimately pay the price.\n\n\n                            Defense Spending\n\n   The President recently took action to add money to the defense \nbudget, halting a 14-year slide. That slide seriously stressed the \nability of our armed\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\nforces--which are almost 40 percent smaller now than they were during \nthe cold war--to meet present day commitments. The President's increase \nis enough to stop the decline in the readiness of our forces, but it is \nnot enough to modernize the aging military equipment that is so \nimportant to ensuring that our forces are ready in the future. The \nadditional money this budget adds to the defense budget is an essential \ninvestment for the future.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  This budget. While there are some bright spots in, ultimately there \nare just too many weaknesses for me to support it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Senator Domenici, first let me reiterate my admiration \nfor the remarkable budget you have produced. You have produced a budget \nthat, in the first decade of the new millennium, balances the entire \nfederal budget, protects Social Security, increases funding for \neducation by 40%, seeks to protect the Social Security surplus from \npaying for other government operations, reduces federal debt, provides \nfunds requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to strengthen our national \ndefense, and provides an $800 billion tax cut. This is a strong budget \nthat I will support.\n  As you know, I intended to offer an amendment that would eliminate a \n$2.9 billion deficit currently projected for FY 2000. It appears \nlikely, however, that when the final budget resolution is written and \nwe have the latest budget and economic forecasts, that this deficit \nwill be eliminated and, in fact, the budget will be in surplus. As I \nunderstand, the budget resolution, as reported by the committee, \nprovides that any FY 2000 surplus should be devoted to tax cuts.\n  Mr. Domenici. I appreciate your support for this budget. Given \ncurrent estimates the budget resolution will show a $2.9 billion \ndeficit. That $2.9 billion represents only 1.7% of the entire $1.7 \ntrillion budget, and even that small deficit will probably be \neliminated when we get CBO's updated estimates this summer. With the \nnumbers available at the time of the production of this resolution, \nspecifically CBO's February baseline, it was impossible to declare that \nthe budget we produced would be fully in balance according to those \nnumbers.\n  I want to salute the Senator from Missouri's efforts to make \nabsolutely certain that we balance the budget excluding the Social \nSecurity surplus and I look forward to working with him to bring about \nthat result.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I would like to comment on S. Con. Res. \n20, the Concurrent Resolution on the FY 2000 Budget. Specifically, I \nwill address the funding allowances for Function 700--Veterans Benefits \nand Services.\n  At the outset, let me note that this budget resolution is a departure \nfrom past budget resolutions which have cut veterans' spending. The \nresolution emanating from the Senate Budget Committee includes total \nspending for an additional $0.9 billion in new budget authority and \n$1.1 billion in outlays for FY 2000. I am grateful for this increase. \nIt is a valid attempt to infuse the VA with badly needed resources. \nHowever, the spending needs of the Veterans Health Administration \nexceed this recommended level. I believe we can and should do better.\n  The VA health care system is being squeezed by lack of funding. It's \nhigh time that we realized that if this track continues, we will see \nthe closure of VA hospitals. Many VA hospitals are already on the \nbrink; another year of no-growth budgets will close hospitals. Small \nrural hospitals in New York State and Arizona will be closed. Large \nurban hospitals, like the ones in Illinois and California, will not be \nimmune and will be shut down.\n  Various estimates exist about what amount VA would need to simply \nmaintain the level of current services. Conservatively, we are talking \nabout an increase of $850 million to cover payroll inflation, increases \nin the costs of goods, and other increases beyond the control of VA. So \ndespite VA's efforts to mitigate the increasing cost of \npharmaceuticals, for example--efforts which have been lauded by others \nas the model for Medicare to follow--VA must budget for $850 million \njust to maintain current services. The concurrent budget resolution \nbefore us today fully addresses these uncontrollable costs. It does \nnot, however, make allowances for increased growth of any kind.\n  In our Committee Views and Estimates, Chairman Specter and I outlined \nthe costs associated with unanticipated VA spending requirements, as \nwell as those costs linked to unmet needs. I refer my colleagues to \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs Views and Estimates for a more complete \nlisting of these substantial costs. However, I do want to highlight \nsome of these areas.\n  Caring for veterans with the Hepatitis C virus is certainly one of \nthose unanticipated spending requirements. VA studies now indicate that \nat least 20 percent of hospitalized veteran-patients test positive for \nthe virus. This is twice the rate reported in the general population. \nVA anticipates that to fully screen and treat these patients, $625 \nmillion will be necessary in FY 2000.\n  A second priority is to provide veterans with access to the same \nhealth care services as other Americans. VA cannot now provide \nemergency care services to all veterans. Many veterans have gone to \ncommunity emergency rooms believing that VA would reimburse them. Of \ncourse, in most cases, VA would not and they were left with substantial \nmedical bills. Providing emergency care and the subsequent hospital \nadmission to veterans would cost the VA $548 million in FY 2000.\n  Third, a funding need which should not be overlooked is long-term \ncare. We know that the percent of veterans over the age of 65 years \nwill grow from 35 percent of the total veteran population to \napproximately 42 percent of the total population over the next ten \nyears. Does VA have the necessary resources to care for this influx of \naging veterans? Under the current financial construct, the answer is a \nresounding ``no.'' A funding increase of at least $1 billion is \nrequired to meet this unmet need.\n  It should come as no surprise to my colleagues that the financial \nconstraints that have been placed upon the VA are also having a \nnegative effect on the health care provided to our veterans.\n  Through our oversight efforts on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nwe have documented serious problems with quality which are the result \nof staffing shortages. The increase of dangerous pressure ulcer sores \nin VA nursing homes is only one example of deteriorating inpatient \ncare. A recent report issued by the VA Medical Inspector's office \nclearly states that at the DC Medical Center, ``bedside patient care, \nsuch as turning patients at frequent intervals to prevent pressure \nulcers, was affected by the shortage of staff.'' These staffing \nshortages exist at medical centers all across the country.\n  With regard to outpatient treatment, the trend points to a disturbing \nlack of access. VA is rightly moving more patients into ambulatory care \nsettings; however, the system as it is currently funded cannot handle \nthe increased workload.\n  In some cases, waiting times for routine clinic appointments--like \ncardiology and gastroenterology--reach 100 days or longer. Mental \nhealth services are simply unavailable at 60 percent of VA's outpatient \nclinics. Finally, while other health care providers and payers are \nseeing increased per patient costs, the VA must live within forecasts \nwhich assume a drop in per patient expenditures. This cannot continue \nwithout drastically impacting quality.\n  I think many of my colleagues would also be disturbed to learn that \nVA's specialized health care services--blind rehabilitation, traumatic \nbrain injury care, post traumatic stress disorder services, spinal cord \ninjury care, and mental health services--have buckled under the strain. \nWe have spent a tremendous amount of time visiting hospitals and \nlooking deeply into these mandated programs. We have seen budgets for \nVA PTSD services in Ohio and New York cut at the expense of services. \nWe have found VA substance abuse programs in Delaware, Alabama, New \nJersey, and Ohio virtually decimated.\n  In my home State of West Virginia, we have four small, rural VA \nmedical centers. And I can tell you that simply covering the cost of \ncurrent services won't help much. In fact, the continued financial \nstress of the VA budget will\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\nhave devastating effects on services and veterans at each of these VA \nhospitals in my State.\n  In one hospital alone we could be faced with the elimination of \naudiology and speech pathology, the reduction of dental services, the \ncomplete closures of the inpatient surgery, outpatient surgery, and the \noutpatient mental health programs.\n  I believe that West Virginia veterans, and veterans across the \ncountry, deserve quality health care--and I, for one, will not allow \nthese reductions and program closures.\n  And I can assure you, my friends, that if these situations exist in \nthe small VA hospitals in my state of West Virginia, then they exist in \nother VA hospitals--whether they are small rural VA hospitals or large \nurban VA hospitals.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to comment on \nanother aspect of the VA budget. On the benefits side, I was very \npleased to see the President request and the Budget Committee accept \nthe increase of $49 million in the General Operating Expenses account \nto provide for an increase of 164 FTE in FY 2000. These new 164 FTE \nwill join FTE shifted over from other duties to provide an additional \n440 adjudication FTE.\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has experienced an \nincrease in pending compensation and pension workload of close to \n50,000 cases per year, over the last two years. This is a reversal of \nthe downward trend from FY 92-96. The age of those cases is also \ngrowing, with an average in FY 98 of 168 days to process original \ncompensation claims, resulting in 33 percent of cases pending over six \nmonths, up from 26 percent in FY 97. This increase in the backlog is in \nspite of a small decrease in the number of claims being filed. VBA also \nhas real problems with the quality of their decision making. Their own \nreview (STAR) revealed an error rate of 36 percent.\n  VBA is taking measures to address its quality and workload problems, \nbut they need more resources to deal with some of their biggest \nchallenges, such as: the loss of their most experienced decision makers \nas they become retirement eligible; the lack of training and the lack \nof uniformity of that training; the struggle to improve customer \nservice through case management and the reduction of blocked call \nrates.\n  It is critical that VBA not only improve their quality and \ntimeliness, but also ensure the integrity of the measures of those \nfactors. They must require accountability in the effort or failure to \nachieve those goals. These are things that VBA has not been \nparticularly motivated or driven to do in the past. I look to VBA to \nstrive for data integrity and accountability and hope that additional \nstaffing resources will aid in these efforts.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we must do more to restore quality and \naccess to health care for America's veterans today and those service \nmembers who will be veterans tomorrow.\n\n\n                         federal r investment\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to focus for a minutes on an \nimportant, yet often ignored aspect of the federal budget--our \ninvestment in R While I strongly support the Chairman's contention \nthat we must strive to stay within the budget caps, I also firmly \nbelieve that funding for research and development should be allowed to \ngrow in fiscal year 2000 and beyond. Many economists argue that such an \ninvestment, through its impact on economic growth, will not drain our \nresources, but will actually improve our country's fiscal standing.\n  A dozen economic studies, including those of Nobel Prize winner \nRobert Solow, have demonstrated that technological progress has \nhistorically been the single most important factor in economic growth, \nhaving more than twice the impact of labor and capital. In today's \nbooming economy, this fact is particularly evident. Our high tech \ncompanies provide one third of our economic output and generate one \nhalf of our economic growth. More amazing is the realization that \ncommunications and technology stocks now comprise 80% of the value of \nthe stock market.\n  But it is crucial for everyone to understand that our prosperous high \ntech companies and revolutionary applications of today were created by \nscientific advances that occurred in the 1960's, when the U.S. \ngovernment was prioritizing its resources on R In 1965, the federal \ngovernment spent 2.2% on civilian and defense R, as a fraction of \nGDP. Now in 1999, we spend approximately 0.8 percent--almost one third \nof its value. If Congress were to follow the President's current \nbudget, the number would dramatically decrease in the next five years.\n  We simply cannot afford not to invest in R Our future prosperity \ndepends on maintaining an innovative environment--with a solid research \nbase and robust talent pool. If we allow our investment in our \ninnovative capacity to continue to slip, current policy commitments and \nrates of reinvestment may not be high enough to sustain future \nimprovements in our standard of living.\n  I urge each of you to join me in cosponsoring this Sense of the \nSenate that outlines budgetary goals for increasing the federal \ninvestment in R in a fiscally responsible manner over time.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                  idea amendment to budget resolution\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in the early seventies, two landmark \nfederal district court cases--PARC versus Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \nand Mills versus Board of Education of the District Court of Columbia--\nestablished that children with disabilities have a constitutional right \nto a free appropriate public education.\n  In 1975, in response to these cases, the Congress enacted PL 94-142, \nthe precursor to IDEA, to help states meet their constitutional \nobligations.\n  When we enacted PL 94-142, the Congress authorized the maximum state \naward as the number of children served under the special education law \ntimes 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure.\n  Congress has fallen far short of this goal. Indeed, in fiscal year \n1999, Congress appropriated only 11.7 percent of the national average \nper pupil expenditure for Part B of IDEA.\n  Congress needs to do much more to help school districts meet their \nconstitutional obligations. Indeed, whenever I go home to Iowa, I am \nbesieged by requests for additional federal funding for special \neducation.\n  These requests increased in intensity following the Supreme Court \ndecision in Cedar Rapids Community School District versus Garrett F. \nThat decision reaffirmed the court's long-standing interpretation that \nschools must provide those health-related services necessary to allow a \nchild with a disability to remain in school.\n  This is a terribly important decision, which reaffirms that all \nchildren with disabilities have the right to a meaningful education. As \nJustice Stevens wrote, ``Under the statute, [Supreme Court] precedent, \nand the purpose of the IDEA, the District must fund such `related \nservices' in order to help guarantee that students like Garret are \nintegrated into the public schools.''\n  The child in this case, Garret Frey, happens to come from Iowa. He is \na friendly, bright, articulate young man, who is also quadriplegic and \nventilator-dependent. Twenty years ago, he probably would have been \nshunted off to an institution, at a terrible cost to taxpayers. \nInstead, he is thriving as a high school student, and will most likely \ngo off to college and become a hard-working, tax paying citizen.\n  An editorial in USA Today summed up the situation well.\n  We've learned a lot about the costs of special education over the \npast 24 years. In addition to the savings realized when children can \nlive at home with their families, we also know there are astronomical \ncosts associated with not educating students with disabilities. \nResearch shows that individuals who did not benefit from IDEA are \nalmost twice as likely to not complete high school, not attend college \nand not get a job. The bottom line: Providing appropriate special \neducation and related services to children saves government hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in dependency costs.\n  The Garrett Frey decision, however, also underscores the need for \nCongress to help school districts with the financial costs of educating \nchildren with disabilities. While the excess costs of educating some \nchildren with disabilities is minimal, the excess of educating other \nchildren with disabilities, like Garrett, is great.\n  The pending amendment, of which I am pleased to be a cosponsor, would\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\ntake two important steps. First, it would fully fund IDEA at the 40 \npercent goal. Secondly, the amendment would provide a mandatory stream \nof funding for this important program. Finally, the amendment is paid \nfor by taking a portion of the funds set-aside for tax breaks and \ninstead invest those funds in IDEA.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would provide real money to help school \ndistricts meet their constitutional obligations. Local school districts \nshould not have to bear the full costs of educating children with \ndisabilities.\n  Again, the USA Today editorial said it well.\n  Let's be clear: The job of educating all children is no small feat. \nBut kids in special education and kids in ``gifted and talented'' \nprograms are not to blame for tight resources. We, as a nation, must \nincrease our commitment to a system of public education that has the \ncapacity to meet the needs of all children, including children with \ndisabilities.\n  Of course, in providing increased funding for IDEA, we must make sure \nwe do not do so at the expense of other equally important education \nprograms. We need to fully fund Head Start so that all children start \nschool ready to learn. We need to fully fund Title I so that all \nchildren get the extra help they need in reading and math. We need to \nfully fund Pell Grants so that all students have a chance to go to \ncollege. There are many other important education initiatives, such as \nreducing class size, improving teacher training, and modernizing our \ncrumbling schools, that will also help children with disabilities.\n  Finally, I'd like to point out that when we reauthorized IDEA in \n1977, we made clear that the cost of serving students with disabilities \nshould fall not just on school districts, but should be shared by all \nresponsible states agencies, including state Medicaid agencies and \nstate health departments. While Garrett does not qualify for any state \nprograms, many children in his situation do, and the school districts \ncan and should avail themselves of that money.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about setting rational national \npriorities. We must make education our nation's top priority since the \nreal threat to our national security is an inability to compete in the \nglobal marketplace. We must have the best-educated, most-skilled, \nhealthiest workers in the world to secure our nation's future. \nInvestments in education are essential if we are to reach that goal.\n  The amendment targets one important area--special education--and \nfully funds this important program. As an editorial in the March 15 \nedition of the New York Times explained, ``Educating disabled \nyoungsters is a national responsibility. The expense should be borne on \nthe nation as a whole, not imposed haphazardly on states or financially \nstrapped districts that happen to serve a large number of disabled \nstudents.''\n  By providing these additional resources for special education, we \nwould free up funds both here and in local school districts for other \nimportant education priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant amendment to fully fund IDEA by reducing the tax breaks in \nthe budget.\n\n\n elimination of marriage tax penalty and uniform across the board tax \n                                  cuts\n\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. President, this amendment states that it is the sense \nof the Senate that the marriage penalty should be eliminated and that \nCongress should provide equal, across the board reductions in the \nindividual income tax rates as soon as we have a non-Social Security \nsurplus.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will put the Senate on record as \nfavoring or opposing the elimination of the marriage penalty. Every \nyear, married couples pay a total of $29 billion per-year in extra \ntaxes for getting married with an average penalty of $1,400 per couple \nfor those married couples affected. Any tax system that discourages the \ntime-honored institution of marriage is unjust and counterproductive. \nAfter all, the society of tomorrow is only as good as the families of \ntoday.\n  This amendment calls on Congress to eliminate the marriage penalty in \na manner that respects all married couples: couples with two-wage \nearners and those in which only one spouse works outside the home.\n  The second part of this sense of the Senate calls for an across the \nboard and equal reduction in each income tax rates as soon as we get a \nreal budget surplus. This proposal is fair, feasible, and responsible. \nFirst, it compliments the lock box proposal which saves all of the \nsocial security surplus for future social security beneficiaries.\n  Second, it is fair since it calls for a uniform tax rate reduction \nfor all taxpayers. This proposal would actually provide a greater \npercentage cut for lower income taxpayers. For example, if we cut each \nof the income tax rates by 1 percentage point, taxpayers in the highest \nbracket would receive a 2.6 percent reduction in their marginal tax \nrate, while those taxpayers in the lowest bracket would receive a 6.5 \npercent reduction in their tax rate. Over 5 years, the 15 percent rate \nwould become 10 percent the 39.6 percent rate would become 34.6--each \nrate dropping by 5 percentage points, but the 15 percentage rate \ngetting a 33 percent reduction--really a full \\1/3\\ reduction.\n  If each of the rates was cut 1 percent per year over a five year \nperiod, the final result would be a 33.3 percent reduction in the \nincome tax burden of those in the lowest rate and a 12.7 percent \nreduction in the top tax rate. But each bracket, each rate, gets the \nsame reduction. Such a plan provides substantial tax relief for all \ntaxpayers and would keep congress on track for fiscal discipline and \nresponsible budgeting.\n  I want to emphasize the wording that says, as soon as we have a non-\nsocial security surplus. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis sense of the senate that honors marriage and families and calls \nfor uniform tax rate cuts for all Americans.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 168\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have introduced in the Senate a \nsense of the Senate amendment to the budget resolution to provide funds \nfor a grant program to build new schools.\n  The goal of this amendment is to first, reduce the size of schools; \nand second, reduce the size of classes. The amendment would give the \nSenate's support for grant funding to enable states to build new \nschools.\n\n\n                              The Problem\n\n  Why do we need this amendment?\n  First, many of our schools are too big. In particular, schools in \nurban areas are huge. The ``shopping mall'' high school is all too \ncommon. ``It's not unusual to find high schools of 2,000, 3,000, or \neven 4,000 students and junior high schools of 1,500 or more, \nespecially in urban school systems,'' writes Thomas Toch in the \nWashington Post. In these monstrous schools, the principal is just a \ndisembodied voice over the public address system.\n  Second, another serious problem is that our classes are too big for \neffective learning and as public school enrollment soars, the problem \nwill only worsen. Even though we have begun to reduce class sizes in my \nstate, California still has highest pupil-teacher ratios in the nation, \nsays the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\n\n                              The Solution\n\n  This amendment supports legislation providing flexibility in grant \nfunding so that school districts can build new schools and reduce both \nschool size and class size.\n  The U.S. Department of Education estimates that we need to build \n6,000 new schools just to meet enrollment growth projections. This \nestimate does not take into account the need to cut class and school \nsizes. The needs are no doubt huge.\n\n\n                    California's Schools Are Too Big\n\n  My state that has some of the largest schools in the country. Here \nare some examples: Roosevelt High School, Fresno, 3,692 students; Clark \nIntermediate School, Clovis, 2,744 students; Berkeley High School, \nBerkeley, 3,025 students; Rosa Parks Elementary School, San Diego, \n1,423 students; Zamorano Elementary School, San Diego, 1,424 students.\n  California also has some of the largest classes sizes in the nation. \nIn 1996-1997, California had the second highest teacher-pupil ratio in \nthe nation, at 22.8 students per teacher. Fortunately since 1996, the \nstate has significantly cut class sizes in grades K-3, but 15 percent \nor 300,000 of our K-3 students have not benefitted from this reform. \nAnd students have grade 3 have not been touched.\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\n                       Examples of Large Classes\n\n  Here are some of the classes in my state: Fourth grade, statewide, 29 \nstudents; sixth grade, statewide, 29.5 students. National City Middle \nSchool San Diego, English and math, 34 to 36 students. Berryessa school \nDistrict in San Jose--fourth grade, 32 students; eighth grade, 31 \nstudents. Long Beach and El Cajon School Districts, tenth grade \nEnglish, 35 students. Santa Rose School District--fourth grade 32, \nstudents. San Diego City Schools, tenth grade biology, 38 students. \nHoover Elementary and Knox Elementary in E. San Diego Elementary, \ngrades 5 and 6, 31, to 33 students. Hoover High School 10th grade \nAlgebra, 39 students.\n  To add the problem, California will have a school enrollment rate \nbetween 1997 and 2007 of 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 \npercent. We will have the largest enrollment increase of all states \nduring the next ten years. By 2007, our enrollment will have increased \nby 3.3. percent. To put it another way, California needs to build seven \nnew classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the \nsurge in student enrollment. The California Department of Education \nsays that we need to add about 327 schools over the next three years, \njust to keep pace with the projected growth.\n\n\n           Smaller Schools, Smaller Classes, Better Learning\n\n  Studies show that student achievement improves when school and class \nsizes are reduce.\n  The American Education Research Association says that the ideal high \nschool size is between 600 and 900 students. Study after study shows \nthat small schools have more learning, fewer discipline problems, lower \ndropout rates, higher levels of student participating, higher \ngraduation rates (The School Administrator, October 1997). The nation's \nschool administrators are calling for more personalized schools.\n  California's education reforms relied on a Tennessee study called \nProject STAR in which 6,500 kindergartners were put in 330 classes of \ndifferent sizes. The students stayed in small classes for years and \nthen returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. the test scores and \nbehavior of students in the small classes were better than those of \nchildren in the larger classes. A similar 1997 study by Rand found that \nsmaller classes benefit students from low-income families the most.\n  Take the example of Sandy Sutton, a teacher in Los Angeles's Hancock \nPark Elementary School. She used to have 32 students in her second \ngrade class. In the fall of 1997, she had 20. She says she can spend \nmore time on individualized reading instruction with each student. She \ncan now more readily draw out shy children and more easily identify \nslow readers early in the school year.\n\n  The November 25, 1997, Sacramento Bee reported that when teachers in \nthe San Juan Unified School Districts started spending more time with \nstudents, test scores rose and discipline problems and suspensions \ndropped. A San Juan teacher, Ralphene Lee, said, ``This is the most \nwonderful thing that has happened in education in my lifetime.''\n  A San Diego initiative to bring down class sizes found that smaller \nclasses mean better classroom management; more individual instruction; \nmore contact with parents; more time for team teaching; more diverse \ninstructional methods; and a higher morale.\n  Teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better attention, \nask more questions and have fewer discipline problems. Smaller schools \nand smaller classes make a difference, it is clear.\n\n\n                            Many Old Schools\n\n  Other amendments and other bills that I am supporting provide \nmechanisms to modernize old schools and we have many old schools. One \nthird of the nation's 110,000 schools were built before World War II \nand only about one of 10 schools was built since 1980. More than one-\nthird of the nation's existing schools are currently over 50 or more \nyears old and need to be repaired or replaced. The General Accounting \nOffice has said that nationally we need over $112 billion for \nconstruction and repairs to bring schools up to date.\n\n\n              California's School Building Needs Critical\n\n  My state needs $26 billion from 1998 to 2008 to modernize and repair \nexisting schools and $8 billion to build schools to meet enrollment \ngrowth. In November 1998, California voters approved state bonds \nproviding $6.5 billion for school construction.\n  In addition to the need to reduce school and class sizes, there are \nseveral key factors driving our need for school construction:\n  1. High Enrollment: California today has a K-12 public school \nenrollment at 5.6 million students which represents more students than \n36 states have in total population, all ages. We have a lot of \nstudents.\n  Between 1998 and 2008, when the national enrollment will grow by 4 \npercent, in California, it will escalate by 15 percent, the largest \nincrease in the nation. California's high school enrollment is \nprojected to increase by 35.3 percent by 2007. Each year between \n160,000 and 190,000 new students enter California classrooms. \nApproximately 920,000 students are expected to be admitted to schools \nin the state during that period, boosting total enrollment from 5.6 \nmillion to 6.8 million.\n  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per \nclass between now and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student \npopulation. By 2007, California will need 22,000 new classrooms. \nCalifornia needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years \njust to keep pace with the projected growth.\n  2. Crowding: Our students are crammed into every available space and \nin temporary buildings. Today, 20 percent of our students are in \nportable classrooms. There are 63,000 relocatable classrooms in use in \n1998.\n  3. Old Schools: Sixty percent of California's schools are over 40 \nyears old. 87 percent of the public schools need to upgrade and repair \nbuildings, according to the General Accounting Office. Ron Ottinger, \npresident of the San Diego Board of Education has said; ``Roofs are \nleaking, pipes are bursting and many classrooms cannot accommodate \ntoday's computer technology.''\n  4. High Costs: The cost of building a high school in California is \nalmost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in \nCalifornia, it is $27 million. In California, our costs are higher than \nother states in part because our schools must be built to withstand \nearthquakes, floods, El Nino and a myriad of other natural disasters. \nCalifornia's state earthquake building standards add 3 to 4 percent to \nconstruction costs. Here's what it costs to build a schools in \nCalifornia: an elementary school (K-6), $5.2 million; a middle school \n(7-8), $12.0 million; a high school (9-12), $27.0 million.\n  5. Class Size Reduction: Our state, commendably, is reducing class \nsizes in grades K through 3, but this means we need more classrooms.\n  And so to exacerbate the need to build smaller schools and to reduce \nclass sizes, our school districts are saddled with overwhelming \nconstruction demands.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Big schools and big classes place a heavy burden on teachers and \nstudents. They create an impersonal learning environment.\n  The American public supports increased federal funding for school \nconstruction. The Rebuild American Coalition this month announced that \n82 percent of Americans favor federal spending for school construction, \nup from 74 percent in a 1998 National education Association poll.\n  Every parents knows the importance of a small class where the teacher \ncan give individualized attention to a student. Every parents knows the \nimportance of the sense of a school community that can come with \nschool.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me today in supporting this important \neducation reform.\n\n\n                      federal anti-drug strategies\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of sending a strong \nanti-drug message during consideration of the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget \nResolution.\n  As we approach the new millennium, one of the most difficult \nchallenges facing our country is the sale, manufacture and distribution \nof illegal drugs. Drug abuse is a daily threat to the lives of young \npeople and the health and safety of our families. We must strengthen \nour resolve to developing and innovative and effective drug strategy.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse recently reported that 54 \npercent\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\nof high school seniors reported illegal use of a drug at least once in \ntheir lives, 42 percent reported use of an illegal drug in the past \nyear and 26 percent reported use of an illegal drug in the past month. \nClearly the American people need Congress to recommit this nation to \nridding our schools and streets of drugs.\n  I believe that our nation can reverse these troubling trends in drug \nabuse and decrease the number of Americans who use drugs. First and \nforemost, we must enforce our existing drug laws. Second, we must make \na commitment to public education and community-based prevention \nprograms, as well as effective treatment for those drug abusers who are \nmotivated enough to accept treatment. We must ensure that local \ncommunities and law enforcement agencies have the tools to develop \neffective drug prevention and education programs. In my view, adequate \nfunding for programs such as the Byrne grant program, the federal \n``Weed and Seed'' initiative and the ``Drug Free Communities Act'' \nprogram is critical to providing resources and guidance to local \ncommunities in my home state of Minnesota to help develop solutions to \nthis problem and expand their anti-drug education and prevention \nprograms.\n  And finally, we must actively support the eradication and \ninterdiction of drugs before they reach our borders. Illegal drugs are \neasy to find and cheap to buy. And there is no doubt that contributes \nto the high rate of drug use among our nation's children. We've got to \ninvest this nation's resources in making sure more of these drugs never \nreach our shores. If we can reduce the supply of drugs, the price will \ngo up. If we can reduce the supply of drugs, they'll be harder to find, \nand fewer American children will fall into drug use. That is why the \nWestern Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and the Drug Free Century Act \nis so important. A counter-drug strategy which does not give sufficient \nweight to international interdiction and eradication efforts cannot \nsucceed.\n  The federal government must continue to work closely with local \nofficials to combat the threat of illegal drug use, trafficking, and \nmanufacturing to our children's future. A united commitment by \nCongress, parents, schools, city councils, faith-based organizations \nand medical institutions will help to create a drug-free America. \nFailure to act will only increase the likelihood that we will lose \ncontrol of our neighborhoods to drug-related crime and violence.\n\n\n        Sense of the Senate on Federal Research and Development\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Sense of the \nSenate regarding Federal Research and Development, Section 310 of the \nConcurrent Budget Resolution.\n  The past few years of economic growth have led us to a remarkable \nstage in this country's history. For the first time, we have both low \ninflation and low unemployment, a stock market which seems boundless \nand, more germane to the discussion at hand, a historic budget surplus. \nHowever, the budget we have prepared for the turn of the new millenium \nis not one which promotes growth. Specifically, the small and declining \naccounts in research and development (R) are a direct prescription \nfor long term economic decline. Let me explain.\n  There have been at least a dozen major economic studies in recent \nyears, including those of Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow, which \nconclude that technological progress is the primary ingredient in \neconomic growth, accounting for 50% or more of total growth. These \nstudies further show that technological progress has twice the impact \non economic growth of labor or capital. Ironically, we have spent far \nmore time in Congress debating the economic impact of labor and \ncapital, in the form of jobs and tax bills, than we have ever devoted \nto R, which is the true workhorse of economic growth. Today, the \nrelationship between technological progress and economic growth is \napparent even to the lay person. The Internet, cancer drugs, cellular \nphones, and computer-related services are ubiquitous. Communications \nand technology stocks now account for 80% of the value of today's \nbooming $1.4 trillion stock market. Furthermore, the productivity \nimprovements generated by leap-ahead advances in communications and \ncomputers have translated into an economic strength that makes us the \nenvy of the world.\n  Because it takes 20-30 years for fundamental discoveries to evolve \ninto market products, we happen to be benefitting handsomely from the \ngovernment's large investment in R in the mid-1960's. However, we \nhave historically been poor guardians of that investment. This year is \nno exception. The Budget Committee's proposed cuts in research in R, \ntotaling as much as 40% in some areas, sit atop a long historical \ndecline which has already more than halved our total R investment (as \na percent of GDP) over the past 34 years. In 1965, we spent an amount \nequivalent to 2.2% of our GDP on R in 1998, that amount was 0.8%. \nCommenting on our nation's 34 year decline in R investments, the \ninvestment guru Peter Lynch has said, ``If I saw a business with an R \ntrend like this, I wouldn't buy the stock.''\n  Almost every other country understands the rationale for R, and is \nespecially conscious of the government's unique role in supporting \nbasic research. As a result, thirteen countries now spend more on basic \nR as a percent of GDP than do we. What is the result of that \ninvestment? One result is that these countries maintain their base of \nexcellence in science. If one looks at the set of nations with \n``significantly higher'' high school science achievement scores than \nthe US, eight of the top eleven nations which comprise that list are \nthe same eight nations which are in the top ten of basic science \nfunding as a fraction of GDP. Exactly why there is such a strong \ncorrelation between research investment and high school science scores \nis not clear, but the correlation there, it is strong, and it bears \ninvestigation.\n\n  Last year, the Senate began to recognize the value of R to the \neconomy and to our innovation base. We passed, without opposition, S. \n2217, which sought to double R spending over the next decade. The \nbill was bipartisan, had 36 cosponsors, and passed without dissent. A \nSense of the Senate amendment was also unanimously passed during this \nyear's budget committee mark-up, calling for greater R investment. In \ncontrast to these mandates for more R spending, the budget we see \nhere today cuts R substantially.\n  Although much of the discussion regarding R investment has focused \non civilian R, I would like to point out the special and troubling \ncase of military R Historically, DoD has funded the lion's share of \nresearch in mathematics, engineering, and the physical sciences, both \nin our military laboratories and in our university system. The output \nof this innovation enterprise is unmatched. If one looks at the U.S. \ncadre of Nobel Prize winners, 58% of the physics laureates and 43% of \nthe chemistry laureates were funded by DoD prior to winning their Nobel \nprizes. What I find disturbing is the fact that we are dismantling this \nengine of innovation through dramatic cuts in DoD R, even as we are \nin the process of transforming from the Cold War Era to the much more \ntechnologically demanding era of--if I may use the term--``techno-\nwarfare.'' Every scenario of future military dominance by the U.S. \nassumes that we will inevitably have superior technology. However, if \nwe are dramatically cutting military R, and we are simultaneously not \nsupporting civilian R, exactly where is that technological \nsuperiority going to come from? Each of our services currently spends \n60-80% of its funds on readiness issues (i.e., operations and \nmaintenance) and 20-40% of their funds on modernization tasks for \nincremental improvements (i.e., procurement, testing and evaluation). \nThe obligation authority for science and technology--the military of \nthe future--is currently less than 2% of the military budget. Even this \nminute fraction is destined to decline further under the budget we see \nbefore us today. Though we face daunting readiness problems in the \npresent, we are far less ready for the future.\n  The president's budget for military R proposed significant cuts, on \nthe order of 6%, that the budget committee's budget will probably \nworsen. The budget committee's 19 billion increase for DoD is unlikely \nto accommodate all of DoD's readiness, modernization, retention, \nrecruitment, and ballistic missile defense needs. The Armed Services'\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\nCommittee's probable response will be to squeeze the already small R \nbudget enormously. DoD itself has requested extensive cuts in S \n(science and technology) which contrast sharply with its request for \n$112 billion in increases for readiness and modernization over the next \n5-6 years. The DoD budget requests, in conjunction with the budget \ncommittee's actions, make it clear that the problems the military is \nexperiencing at present--though undoubtedly pressing--are actively \npreventing adequate long-term strategic planning.\n  A recent Council on Competitiveness report shows that, as a nation, \nwe are currently unmatched in our potential to innovate, due to our \npast investments in R through our military, industry, and university \nsystems, and due to our vibrant venture capital sector. Let us not make \nthe mistake of starving the system that gives us our greatest strength, \njust as we embark on the ``Innovation Economy'' of the new millenium.\n  The budget resolution before us dramatically fails in its commitment \nto nourish R, which is the key to our future economy, our future \nsecurity, and our future well being. The major cuts it makes in both \ncivilian and military R our innovation system--are not \nsupportable.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today marks a dramatic turning point for \nthe Senate. Because, although Senators Thurmond, Hollings, Byrd, and a \nhandful of others were members of this body the last time the Federal \nGovernment ran a unified budget surplus in 1969, no member of the \nSenate has even been involved in the crafting of a budget resolution \nunder these all too unique fiscal circumstances.\n  Furthermore, the consideration of this budget resolution is not only \na significant moment for the Senate, but for more than a generation of \nAmericans who never lived in a time without federal budget deficits.\n  Mr. President, in light of the unified surpluses we are now \nenjoying--and the on-budget surpluses we are projected to soon enjoy--I \nwould like to thank the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Pete \nDomenici, for his unwavering commitment to a balanced budget and \nfiscally responsible decision-making over the years. Thanks, in part, \nto his leadership and efforts, the turbulent waves of annual deficits \nand mounting debts have been temporarily calmed. And, if we are willing \nto adhere to these principles in this year's budget resolution and \nothers yet to come, we may be able to maintain the current budgetary \ncalm for many years in the future.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution reported by the Senate Budget \nCommittee--and that we are now considering on the floor--not only \nmaintains fiscal discipline, but it also ensures that critical \npriorities are protected and addressed in fiscal year 2000 and beyond.\n  Specifically, the Senate budget resolution contains the following key \nprovisions:\n  First, it protects every penny of the Social Security surplus in \nupcoming years by devoting it solely to reducing publicly-held debt.\n  Second, through an amendment I offered in the Budget Committee \nmarkup, it provides monies from the on-budget surplus for a new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit--something that President Clinton \nfailed to include in his own budget proposal after touting the need for \nthis benefit in his State of the Union address.\n  Third, it adheres to the spending levels established just two years \nago in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, while increasing funding for \ncritically needed priroties including education and defense.\n  Fourth, it provides tax relief for Americans at a time when the \ntypical family's tax burden exceeds the cost of food, clothing, and \nshelter combined. And as a result of another amendment I offered during \nmarkup, it places marriage penalty relief as a top priority in any tax \ncut package that is ultimately crafted. When considering that 42 \npercent of all married couples incurred a marriage tax penalty \naveraging $1,400 in 1996, I think of no tax cut that would be more \nappropriate in any upcoming tax package.\n  Collectively, I believe these principles and priorities reflect those \nof most Americans--especially the protection of Social Security's \nmonies. Accordingly, I believe this resolution deserves broad \nbipartisan support in the Senate and, ultimately, by the entire \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, to truly appreciate what is contained in this budget \nresolution, I believe it is appropriate to compare it with the only \nother major proposal on the table: the budget proposal put forth by \nPresident Clinton on February 1.\n  As mentioned, the first priority that is protected in the Senate \nbudget resolution is Social Security and the annual surpluses it is \ncurrently accruing.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Social Security surplus was \nresponsible for the unified budget surplus of $70 billion we accrued in \nFY98. In fact, without the Social Security surplus, the federal \ngovernment actually ran an on-budget deficit of $29 billion last year.\n  By the same token, Social Security's surpluses will account for the \nbulk of our unified budget surpluses in coming years as well. \nSpecifically, over the coming 5 years, Social Security surpluses will \ntotal $769 billion and account for 82 percent of CBO's projected \nunified surpluses--and over 10 years, they will total $1.7 trillion and \naccount for 69 percent of unified surpluses.\n  To protect Social Security's surpluses, the Senate budget resolution \nsets the stage for ``lock-box'' legislation that will accomplish what \nmany of us have desired for years: a bonafide means of taking Social \nSecurity off-budget. Put simply, this resolution ensures that Social \nSecurity surpluses will no longer be raided and used to fund other \ngovernment programs in any upcoming year. Instead, every dollar of \nSocial Security's current and projected surpluses will be set aside and \nused to bury-down publicly held debt.\n  In contrast, President Clinton's budget offers no protection for the \nSocial Security surplus and, in fact, would spend it on other federal \nprograms in upcoming years.\n  Specifically, as the chart behind me indicates over the coming five \nyears, the President proposes we take a $158 billion ``bite'' out of \nSocial Security surpluses and spend these monies on other federal \nprograms. That means that, under the President's budget, fully 21 \npercent of Social Security's upcoming surpluses would be spent on other \nprograms over the next five years.\n  Although the President has proposed that we spend a portion of the \nSocial Security surplus on other programs, I was pleased that an \noverwhelming majority of my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Budget \nCommittee voted for an amendment I offered during markup that rejected \nthe President's proposed use of Social Security's surpluses.\n  Specifically, my amendment outlined that fact that the President's \nbudget would spend $40 billion of the Social Security surplus in \nFY2000; $41 billion in FY01; $24 billion in FY02; $34 billion in FY03; \nand $20 billion in FY04. Furthermore, the amendment called on Congress \nto reject any budget proposal that spent Social Security surplus monies \non other federal programs. Appropriately, after my amendment was \nadopted by a vote of 21 to 1, the President's budget proposal--which \nspends Social Security's surplus monies--was unanimously rejected by \nthe Committee when offered as an amendment later in the markup.\n  Mr. President, not only does the President's budget propose that we \nspend Social Security's money at the same time as he expresses a desire \nto save the program, but he also fails to achieve the goals he laid out \nin the State of the Union address regarding the utilization of the \nunified surplus.\n  First, it's worth nothing that--based on that goals he laid out in \nthe State of the Union address--the President apparently double-counts \nthe surplus and proposes that we spend 151 percent of the surplus over \nthe coming 15 years! That's 51 percent than you or I could spend, Mr. \nPresident, and 51 percent more than would ever exist.\n  The next chart--taken from the February 1 article in Newsweek--shows \nhow this ``double counting'' would occur. As you can see, the President \nproposed that we spend $500 billion for the new Universal Savings \nAccounts, $500 billion for other federal spending, $700 billion for \nMedicare, and $2.8 trillion for Social Security. In total, these\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\nfive items would run $4.5 trillion--the total projected surplus over \nthe 15 year period.\n  However, what the President forgot to mention is that $2.3 trillion \nof this amount is already Social Security's money because it is the \ntotal of the annual Social Security surpluses that will accrue over the \ncoming 15 years. As a result, the true total of the Clinton proposals \nwould be $6.8 trillion--which is $2.3 trillion more than the surpluses \nwe would accrue over the same period of time!\n  Setting aside the questionable math of the President's proposals, \nit's also worth noting that there is a significant difference between \nhow the President portrays his proposals, and what they actually \naccomplish.\n  Specifically, as my next chart indicates, there is a gap between the \n``rhetoric'' and the ``reality'' of the President's plan. In fact, in \nlight of this gap, I believe the President's budget should have earned \nan Oscar for ``Best Actor'' during Sunday's Academy Award presentation!\n  As we can see on this chart, the President claimed that his budget \nwould give 62 percent of the unified surplus to Social Security, 15 \npercent to Medicare, 12 percent to new Universal Savings Accounts \n(USAs), and 11 percent to new spending.\n  However, in reviewing CBO's analysis of the President's budget--and \nby removing the rhetoric from the various proposals and identifying \nthem for what they truly are--it's clear that the ``reality'' of the \nPresident's budget is far different from how it has been presented.\n  Specifically, instead of devoting a combined 77 percent of the \nunified surplus to Medicare and Social Security--65 percent to Social \nSecurity and 12 percent to Medicare respectively--the truth of the \nmatter is that the President is simply proposing that we artificially \nincrease the number of IOUs held by the Social Security and Medicare \nTrust Funds.\n  Furthermore, we find that the President's goal to set-aside 77 \npercent of the unified surplus will not even be met. Specifically, over \nthe coming five years, only 65 percent of the unified surplus would be \nset aside--and that is only achieved if we assume that the President's \nproposal to have Social Security monies invested in the stock market is \nultimately used for the same purpose.\n  Also, the new Universal Savings Accounts (USAs) proposed by the \nPresident are just another name for a tax cut--and would utilize 11 \npercent of the surplus accordingly. As I mentioned earlier, I believe \nreducing the marriage penalty should be the top priority of any tax cut \npackage, and already had an amendment included in the budget resolution \naccordingly.\n  Finally, over the coming five years, the President would actually \nspend 24 percent of the surplus on other federal programs--far above \nthe 11 percent target that he laid out to the American people.\n  Mr. President, as mentioned, for all the talk about devoting 62 \npercent of the surplus to Social Security and 15 percent to Medicare, \nthe President really is proposing that we simply increase the number of \nIOUs held by the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds to make them \nmore solvent on paper.\n  Not only does this accounting scheme give the false impression that \nsaving these critically needed programs can occur without lifting a \n``fiscal finger,'' but it could also lead to a false sense of \ncomplacency that will lead to true reforms being put off until it's too \nlate. If that happens, the changes that will need to be made to these \nprograms will need to be draconian--and all because we chose to give \nthe public the false belief that nothing needed to be done to \nlegitimately strengthen these programs today.\n  Of note, the President's own budget highlights the futility of simply \nincreasing trust fund balances without true reforms, and discredits his \naccounting scheme accordingly. On page 337 of the President's \n``Analytical Perspectives'' book for the FY 2000 budget, we read\n\n       (Trust Fund) balances are available to finance future \n     benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only \n     in a bookkeeping sense . . . They do not consist of real \n     economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund \n     benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when \n     redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, \n     borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other \n     expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, \n     therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the \n     Government's ability to pay benefits.\n\n  So, what does this mean? In a nutshell, the President isn't putting a \npenny of real money into these programs--he's simply increasing the \nnumber of IOUs held by the Trust Funds and hoping that someone figures \nout how to pay them back with real money in the future. There's \nabsolutely no commitment of a single dollar from the surplus to these \nprograms today.\n  As I said during the Budget Committee markup this past week, the \nPresident should win a Pulitzer prize for fiction by claiming that this \nplan somehow ``saves'' Medicare!\n  In contrast, the Senate budget resolution contains a mechanism and \nmoney to truly strengthen and improve Medicare. Specifically, an \namendment I offered during the Committee markup--that was subsequently \nadopted by a bipartisan vote of 21 to 1--would allow a portion of \nremaining on-budget surpluses to be used for the creation of a new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. As my colleagues are aware, the \nneed for such a benefit was one of the key sticking points in the \ndiscussions of the Bipartisan Medicare Commission--so my provision \nensures that this critically needed benefit can be funded.\n  Yet even as it allows for the creation of a new prescription drug \nbenefit, it also will encourage the development of a comprehensive plan \nto truly save Medicare without accounting gimmicks. Specifically, to \naccess the on-budget surplus to pay for this new benefit, my provision \nrequires that the Senate consider legislation that will ``significantly \nincrease the solvency'' of the Medicare Trust Fund without artificially \nextending it in the manner prescribed by the President. While this \nprovision in no way endorses one type of reform over another, it \nprovides tantalizing ``carrot'' for Congress and the President if they \nare willing to sit down and legitimately work to strengthen Medicare.\n  Mr. President, now that we've separated the rhetoric from the reality \nof the President's budget, it's possible to do an honest comparison of \nthe President's budget proposal and the Senate budget resolution we are \nnow considering.\n  As my next chart indicates, the Senate budget resolution handily \nbeats the President's budget at reducing publicly-held debt over the \ncoming five years. In fact, by walling-off the Social Security surplus, \nthe Republican plan would ensure that 82 percent of the unified surplus \nis used for debt reduction, versus 65 percent in the President's plan.\n  Why is the President's debt reduction so much lower? In a nutshell, \nbecause of the magnitude of his new spending proposals. While the \nSenate budget resolution exercises fiscal austerity by only using 18 \npercent of the surplus over the next five years for purposes other than \ndebt reduction, the President uses 35 percent of the surplus for other \npurposes--the vast majority of which is increased spending.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that whether you compare these \nbudgets based on reality or on rhetoric, the Senate budget resolution \nis superior to the Clinton plan, especially in terms of protecting \nSocial Security's money.\n  As a result, I hope that the partisan attacks against the Senate \nbudget resolution will end.\n  Mr. President, by maintaining fiscal discipline, protecting Social \nSecurity surpluses, buying down debt, providing funds for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, and enhancing funding for shared priorities \nsuch as education, I believe the Senate budget resolution deserves \nstrong support by the full Senate.\n  Ultimately, while members from either side of the aisle may disagree \nwith specific provisions in the resolution that has been crafted, the \nsimple fact is that this is a budget framework--or ``blueprint''--that \nestablishes parameters and priorities, but is not the final word on \nthese individual decisions. Rather, specific spending and tax decisions \nwill initially be made in the Appropriations and Finance Committees, \nand ultimately by members on the floor.\n  Therefore, I am hopeful that amendments offered to this framework do \nnot\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\nharm the broad and reasoned parameters that have been set, and that \nkeep in mind that--unlike the President's proposal--the budget \nresolution should not be about rhetoric, but about fiscal reality.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 169\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is a sense of the Senate \namendment to make room in the FY 2000 budget for remedial education \nfunds for schools to end social promotion.\n  My amendment would assume enactment of legislation or competitive \ngrants to school districts to help provide remedial education, after \nschool and summer school courses for needy and low-performing students \nwho are not making passing grades.\n  The purpose is to provide federal incentives and federal help to \nschool districts that abolish and do not allow social promotion and \nprovide interventions to help students meet state achievement standards \nin the core curriculum.\n  This amendment seeks the endorsement of the Senate for providing \nremedial education that help students meet achievement standards and \nhelp school systems end social promotion.\n\n\n                              The Problem\n\n  Why do we need this amendment? In short, our students are failing.\n  I truly believe that the linchpin to education reform is the \nelimination of the path of least resistance whereby students who are \nfailing are simply promoted to the next grade in hopes that somehow \nthey will learn, by virtue of sitting in the classroom.\n  To promote youngsters when they are failing to learn has produced a \ngeneration of young people who cannot read or write, count change in \ntheir pockets or fill out an employment application. It has been called \n``educational malpractice.'' It is inexcusable for our education system \nto hand out a high school diploma to a youngster who does not have the \nskills to get a job.\n  It is that bad. And California is just about the worst.\n  On March 5, we received the bad news that California ranked second to \nlast among 39 states in fourth-grade reading skills.\n  This report by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also \nshowed that in California:\n  Eighty percent of fourth-graders are ``not proficient readers,'' \nmeaning they do not have a solid command of challenging reading \nmaterials.\n  Fifty-two percent of the fourth-graders scored below the basic level, \nmeaning they had failed to even partially master basic skills.\n  The news was not must better for California eighth-graders who ranked \n33rd out of 36 states and only 22 percent were proficient readers.\n  In a December 1998 study by the Education Trust, California ranked: \nlast in the percent of young adults with a high school diploma; 37th in \nSAT scores; and 31st (of 41 states) in 8th grade math.\n  And nearly half of all students entering the California State \nUniversity system require remedial classes in math or English or both.\n\n\n                     U.S. Students Lagging As Well\n\n  The news is grim throughout the United States, where students are \nfalling behind their international peers:\n  The lowest 25 percent of Japanese and South Korean 8th graders \noutperform the average American student (source: Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development study, November 1998).\n  In math and science, U.S. 12th grade students fell far behind their \ncounterparts, which is especially troubling when we consider the skills \nthat will be required to stay ahead in the 21st Century. (Source: Third \nInternational Mathematics and Science Study, 1998).\n  Specifically, U.S. 12th graders:\n  Were significantly outperformed by 14 countries and only performed \nbetter than students in Cyprus and South Africa.\n  Scored last in physics and next to last in math.\n\n\n                       What Is Social Promotion?\n\n  Social promotion is the practice of schools' advancing a student from \none grade to the next regardless of the student's academic achievement.\n  It is time to end social promotion, a practice which misleads our \nstudents, their parents and the public.\n  And apparently, the American Federation of Teachers agrees. Let me \nquote from their September 1997 study:\n\n       Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school \n     failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, who are \n     deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be \n     successful or get the message that achievement doesn't count; \n     for teachers who must face students who know that teachers \n     wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the \n     business community and colleges that must spend millions of \n     dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal with a \n     growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared to \n     contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the \n     nation.\n\n  That is well said, from those faced with the problem everyday.\n\n\n           Remedial Education Needed for Student Achievement\n\n  Merely ending social promotion and holding students in grade will not \nsolve the problem. We cannot just let them languish without direction \nand without help in a failing system.\n  Instead, ongoing remedial work, specialized tutoring, after-school \nprograms and summer school all must be used--intensively and \nconsistently.\n  That is why I am proposing a new federal infusion of funds for \nremedial education, as embodied in this amendment.\n\n\n                  How Widespread Is Social Promotion?\n\n  Social promotion is widespread. Although there is no hard data on the \nextent of social promotion, most authorities, in the schools and out, \nknow it is happening--and in some districts it is standard operating \nprocedure.\n   In fact, 4 in 10 teachers reported that their schools automatically \npromote students when they reach the maximum age for their grade level \n(Source: Los Angeles Times, January 14, 1998).\n  And the September 1998 American Federation of Teachers study says \nsocial promotion is ``rampant.''\n  This study involved 85 of the nation's 820 largest school districts \nin 32 states--representing one-third of the nation's public school \nenrollment. It found most school districts:\n  Use vague criteria for passing and retaining students.\n  Lack explicit policies of social promotion, but have an implicit \npractice of social promotion, including a loose and vague criteria for \nadvancing students to the next grade.\n  View holding students back as a policy of last resort and often put \nexplicit limits on retaining students.\n  Also, the study found that only 17 states have standards in the four \ncore disciplines (English, math, social studies and science) which are \nwell grounded in content and that are clear enough to be used.\n\n\n                     Social Promotion in California\n\n  In July 1998, I wrote 500 California school districts and asked about \ntheir policy on social promotion.\n  Their responses, which are vague and often misleading, include the \nfollowing:\n  Some school districts say they do not have a specific policy.\n  Some say they simply figure what is ``in the best interest of the \nstudent.''\n  Some say teachers provide recommendations, but final decisions on \nretention can be overridden by parents.\n  And some simply promote regardless of failing grades, non-attendance, \nor virtually anything else.\n  In short, the policies are all over the place.\n\n\n                Social Promotion Is Ending in California\n\n  Last year, in California, the Legislature passed and the Governor \nsigned into law a bill to end social promotion in public education.\n  This new law requires school districts to identify students who are \nfailing based on their grades or scores on statewide performance tests.\n  The schools have to hold back the student unless their teachers \nsubmit a written finding that the student should be allowed to advance \nto the next grade.\n  In such a case, the teacher is required to recommend remediation to \nget the student to the next level, which could include summer school or \nafter-school instruction.\n  In one example, the Los Angeles Unified School District is currently \nworking to develop a plan to end social promotion.\n  The LAUSD Board plans to identify those students who are at risk of \nflunking and require them to participate in remedial classes.\n  The alternative curriculum will stress the basics in reading, \nlanguage arts and math through special after-\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nschool tutoring. The district's plan would take effect in the 1999-2000 \nschool year and target students moving in the third through sixth \ngrades and into the ninth grade.\n\n\n                      The Cost of Social Promotion\n\n  Here are some of the painful results of social promotion:\n  Half of California's students--3 million children--perform below \nlevels considered proficient for their grade level.\n  One third of college freshmen nationwide take remedial courses in \ncollege and three-quarters of all campuses, public and private, offer \nremediation.\n  More than two-thirds of students entering California State University \ncampuses in Los Angeles lack the math or English they should have \nmastered in high school. At some high schools, not one graduate going \non to one of Cal State's campuses passed a basic skills test.\n  And these numbers represent an increase. In the fall of 1998, almost \n50 percent of freshmen needed remedial help. In 1997, it was 47 \npercent, compared to 43 percent in each of the previous three years.\n\n\n           The Public Recognizes the Flaw in Social Promotion\n\n  President Clinton called for ending social promotion in his last two \nState of the Union speeches. Last year, he said, ``We must also demand \ngreater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who \nhasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time \nto end social promotion in America's schools.''\n  Seven states have a policy in place that ties promotion to state \nlevel standards. They are California, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia.\n  The Chicago Public Schools have ditched social promotion. After their \nnew policy was put in place, in the spring of 1997, over 40,000 \nstudents failed tests in the third, sixth and eight and ninth grades \nand then went to mandatory summer school.\n  In my own state, the San Diego School Board in February adopted \nrequirements that all students in certain grades must demonstrate \ngrade-level performance.\n  And they will require all students to earn a C overall grade average \nand a C grade in core subjects for high school graduation, effectively \nending social promotion for certain grades and for high school \ngraduation. For example, San Diego's schools are requiring that eighth \ngraders who do not pass core courses be retained or pass core courses \nin summer school.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers and college \nprofessors whether they believe a high school diploma guarantees that a \nstudent has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63 percent of \nemployers and 76 percent of professors said that the diploma is not a \nguarantee that a graduate can read, write or do basic math.\n  California employers tell me that many applicants are unprepared for \nwork and they have to provide very basic training to make them \nemployable.\n  High tech companies say they have to recruit abroad. For example, \nlast year, MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic skills training.\n  On December 17, 1998, the California Business for Education \nExcellence announced that they were organizing a major effort to reform \npublic education.\n  This group includes the State's major corporations and organizations \nlike the California Business Roundtable, the California Manufacturers \nAssociation, and the American Electronics Association, and companies \nlike Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Boeing and Pacific Bell. They had to \norganize because they see firsthand the results of a lagging school \nsystem.\n  I offer this amendment today to get the Senate, officially, on \nrecord, to support the notion that we have to provide our students and \nteachers the resources they need to help students achieve.\n  The amendment is not meant as an indictment of our schools and the \nmany able educators who work hard everyday.\n  This amendment is being offered because we must face up to these \ndeficiencies and do the hard work that reform requires.\n  We can no longer tolerate doing what is ``politically correct'' or \nthe latest teaching fad. It takes hard, proven, concentrated work by \nstudents, teachers, and families. And we have to have the ability to \nknow the difference.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment, to give educators the \nresources they need to help students achieve and to tie federal \nresources to real results.\n  Mr. BURNS. I stand in support of the Senate's Concurrent Budget \nResolution for Fiscal Year 2000 since I believe it establishes the \nright priorities and balance for the Federal Government going into the \nnext millennium. It preserves the future retirement and health care for \nour aging population by ensuring the financial integrity of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Programs. It reduces the financial burden of the \nFederal Government on American taxpayers by reducing the national debt \nand returning excess taxes to them. And finally it limits the growth of \nthe Federal Government by adhering to the statutory spending caps \nagreed to between Congress and the President in 1997.\n  Saving Social Security is not a partisan issue. Principles, not \npolitics should guide us when it comes to providing for our senior \ncitizens who have been our guide through life thus far. We need to fix \nthis program not only for our parents but also our grandchildren. We \nneed to trust the American people that they can make their own choices \non how their retirement will be financed. I believe all Americans \nshould be given the opportunity to invest in a personalized savings \naccount to control their own future. I do not agree that we should \nmandate the creation of a politically constituted Federal commission to \ncontrol the investments of Social Security trust funds in the stock \nmarkets.\n  The President's plan doesn't add up. His FY 2000 budget projects a \n$4.5 trillion surplus over the next 15 years. One half of that $2.3 \ntrillion, is the surplus for the Social Security trust fund. That \nleaves us with a working surplus of $2.2 trillion. I just don't \nunderstand where we come up with the $2.8 trillion for the Social \nSecurity trust fund out of this non-Social Security surplus of $2.2 \ntrillion especially after the President proposes to spend $1.7 trillion \nof the remaining $2.2 working surplus. His plan just doesn't add up. As \nwe say in Montana--looks like it, smells like it, taste like it, glad \nwe didn't step in it.\n  Medicare is another tricky issue that we need to fix. I want the \nrecord to show that Republicans have never proposed cutting Medicare. \nRather Republicans have allowed Medicare to grow at twice the rate of \ninflation. Our FY 2000 Budget Resolution assures that Medicare is fully \nfunded--every dollar that is projected to go to beneficiaries will do \nso instead of what the President proposes with $9 billion in cuts to \nMedicare. This means that the Republican plan will continue to preserve \nMedicare for our seniors in this FY 2000 Budget Resolution.\n  In the State of the Union, the President proposed that $1 out of \nevery $6 of the surplus will be used to guarantee the soundness of \nMedicare until the year 2020. What he claims actually is to set aside \n$700 billion--15 percent of the $4.5 trillion total budget surplus of \nthe next fifteen years--and then credit this with another $300 billion \nin interest payments.\n  While this sounds attractive, the President doesn't have the money to \nimplement this plan plus his claims are based on IOUs and phony \nnumbers. However, the worst part is that his plan still wouldn't help \nMedicare.\n  Since the total Federal budget deficit was eliminated in FY 1998, the \nFY 2000 Budget Resolution will focus now on eliminating the on-budget \ndeficit in FY 2001--the first time this has occurred since the 1960s. \nFurthermore, the FY 2000 Budget Resolution will cut the public debt \nover the next 10 years by 50 percent versus the 20 percent reduction \nproposed in the President's budget. Correspondingly, Federal interest \npayments on the national debt will be cut in half--from $229 billion \nthis year to $115 billion in 2009--releasing capital previously set \naside to pay for interest on the national debt to more productive \nprivate economic activities, such as helping our struggling farmers and \nranchers. Also we will not have to make the American public go further \ninto debt. The statutory debt limit for the total government (currently \nat\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\n$5.95 trillion) will not have to be increased until 2004 as opposed to \nthe President's budget which would have to raise the statutory debt \nlimit as early as 2001.\n  The FY 2000 Concurrent Budget Resolution further accommodates a tax \ncut of $15 billion in the first year and $142 billion over the first \nfive years from the non-Social Security surplus. Congress is not only \nreceptive to paying down the national debt, but also to refund excess \ntaxes to the American people.\n  Let me assure you that the Republican tax cut will have no effect on \nSocial Security or Medicare because they are not funded by general \nrevenues but by dedicated payroll taxes. Also, tax cuts from a surplus \ndiscretionary budget have no impact on Social Security or Medicare.\n  With a budget surplus well over $100 billion, I believe it is \narrogant for the Administration to believe it has the best perspective \non how to spend the American taxpayers money. Furthermore it is even \nharder to believe tax increases are justified as the President \nproposes. Our nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates, under \ncurrent law, American taxpayers will overpay their taxes by $787 \nbillion over the next 10 years which is the equivalent of $7,000 for \nevery American taxpayer.\n  However, two areas of importance to me in the Budget Resolution are \nincreased spending for education and agriculture. I support the \nincrease of $47.4 billion over the Senate Budget Committee baseline and \nby $21.2 billion over the President's request for the next ten years. \nThe FY 2000 Budget Resolution also provides for a $28 billion over five \nyears and an $82 billion over ten years net increase in discretionary \nspending for elementary and secondary education. Overall discretionary \nspending for education increases by $2.4 billion in 2000--double the \nPresident's request--and $31 billion over the next five years--five \ntimes the President's request.\n  The President's budget for the coming fiscal year contains 66 new \nprograms and $45 billion in tax increases. His budget plans for the \nnext 15 years call for over $500 billion in new spending and not one \ndollar in non-credit tax cuts.\n  I am pleased that the FY 2000 Budget Resolution contains a mandatory \nspending allocation of $6 billion for the next 5 years (FY 2000-2004) \nbased upon legislation proposed by the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry. I am also pleased that the Committee-reported \nResolution provides a total of over $4 billion more in budget authority \nfor mandatory programs. Farmers need protection against the weather \nrelated and economic losses they have sustained this past year. It is \ncritical that Congress provide adequate Federal funding in the FY 2000 \nBudget Resolution so the Agriculture Committee can address the severe \nproblems faced by our nation's farmers and ranchers.\n  Unfortunately, every credible economic forecast indicates the farm \neconomy will recover slowly at best. The Agriculture Committee needs \nadequate budget authority to develop and strengthen programs which \nprovide production credit, risk management, and economic assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  Beyond these concerns, I call upon my colleagues to support the \nBudget Resolution for FY 2000 to continue the progress Congress has \nmade to strengthen our financial future into the 21st Century.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few observations on \nthe budget resolution, and on some recent developments that relate \nclosely to our budget position.\n  In particular, I want to sound a note of caution to my colleagues, \nand urge that we refrain from basing our budget on the assumption that \nwe will have significant budget surpluses in the near future.\n  Mr. President, the last six years or so have seen some dramatic \nimprovements in our Federal budget position.\n  In part, this has been due to some tough budget discipline on the \npart of the White House and Congress.\n  In part, it has come as a result of a strong economy, itself the \nbeneficiary of our budget discipline.\n  In January of 1993, I don't think anyone would have seriously \npredicted that we would be on the brink not only of balancing the \nunified budget, but also of eliminating the on-budget deficit, \nproducing a balanced budget without having to rely on the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund balances to make up the difference.\n  Now that we are so close to actually balancing the government's books \nwithout using Social Security, some recent developments are all the \nmore troubling to me.\n  I'll just note a few of them.\n  Let me begin with last year's half trillion dollar omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  That measure was not only loaded up with special interest provisions, \nit ended up spending $20 billion over budget by using the emergency \nspending exceptions to our budget caps.\n  There were a number of reasons the bill ended up the way it did, and \nlet me say that I hope the biennial budget measure offered by the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee (Mr. Domenici) can help \nprevent such situations from arising again.\n  I served in the Wisconsin State Legislature for 10 years using a \nbiennial approach to budgeting, and I think such a structure at the \nFederal level might help prevent the kind of last minute omnibus \nappropriations bill we had last year where abuse of the budget process \nis almost inevitable.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped the new Congress would start off on a more \nfiscally responsible foot after having produced the omnibus \nappropriations bill last fall.\n  But I was disappointed that the first major piece of legislation we \ntook up was just more of the same.\n  The bill that passed the Senate recently, S. 4, was another giant \nbudget buster, providing spending increases of more than $50 billion \nover the next 10 years without a penny of offsetting savings elsewhere.\n  And it did so before Congress has had a chance to pass a budget \nresolution, even before this committee has produced a budget resolution \nfor floor debate.\n  Mr. President, there was no reason to rush that bill through.\n  A pay hike for our armed forces would have received solid support as \npart of an overall budget plan. S. 4 was a politically popular bill, \nand rightly so.\n  There are good arguments for providing members of our armed forces \nand the national guard and reserve a pay hike.\n  Indeed, I very much want to support a pay hike for them.\n  But not outside of an overall budget plan, and not in a measure that \nbusts the budget.\n  Mr. President, this brings me to the President's budget, the budget \nresolution reported out of the Budget Committee, and the alternative \nbudgets various interests have proposed.\n  Each of these budget proposals is centered around the use of \nprojected budget surpluses.\n  Indeed, it is the use of those very surpluses that in a sense defines \nthe goals of these budget proposals, and distinguishes one from \nanother.\n  Mr. President, as I noted before, we have come a long way in the last \n6 years.\n  We now have the opportunity to achieve a truly balanced budget, one \nthat does not rely on Social Security Trust Fund balances.\n  We are within striking distance of producing genuine surpluses.\n  But let me emphasize, we may be within striking distance, but we \naren't there yet.\n  Mr. President, we do not have a budget surplus now, and I am \nconcerned that for several reasons we may not achieve one.\n  While subsequent estimates may change, the most recent CBO estimates \nshow we do not have a budget surplus this year, and CBO does not \nproject a genuine on-budget surplus of any significant size until \nFY2002, when a $55 billion on-budget surplus is projected.\n  Mr. President, even those modest surpluses are based on assumptions \nthat may prove to be overly optimistic.\n  CBO currently projects non-Social Security surpluses of slightly over \n$800 billion over the next ten years.\n  But in making those projections, CBO assumes that total discretionary \nspending will remain under the caps we agreed to in 1997, and that \nafter 2002,\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\ntotal discretionary spending will be held to inflationary increases \nonly.\n  Mr. President, according to the Center for Budget and Policy \nPriorities, these assumptions mean that discretionary spending over the \nnext 10 years will be $580 billion below current levels in real terms.\n  Put another way, if we simply held discretionary spending at a level \nwhich reflects current services, and adjusted only for inflation, \nnearly three-quarters of the projected surpluses over the next 10 years \nwill vanish.\n  Mr. President, some will argue Congress and the White House will hold \nto the spending caps, and will cut the amount of spending necessary to \nproduce the projected surpluses.\n  Let me suggest that given the omnibus appropriations bill of last \nfall, the military pay increase bill of last month, and the desire of \nso many to focus on the surpluses we hope for, those assumptions about \nlimiting our spending appear to be extremely fragile.\n  Beyond our ability to live up to the spending and tax assumptions \nthat produce the projected surpluses, we know that projections can \nchange quickly.\n  Just since last August, the CBO projections for unified budget \nsurpluses over the next 10 years have increased by about $1 trillion--a \nchange that is itself larger than the non-Social Security surplus over \nthat same period.\n  Estimates that can grow by $1 trillion in a few months can shrink by \nthe same amount just as quickly.\n  Altogether, Mr. President, the projected surpluses are far from a \nsure thing, and we should not be writing budgets that commit us to \nspending and taxing policies that are so utterly dependent on them.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 211\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues \nabout some of my thoughts about Amendment 211 that was authored by my \ngood friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum. This Amendment to S. \nCon. Res. 20, was accepted by the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I know that I am not alone in stating that many of us \nin the Senate believe that, first and foremost, we believe that the \nDavis-Bacon Act should be repealed. If full repeal is not possible at \nthis time, there are meaningful steps we should take in the meantime to \nget us to that end.\n  Mr. President, we must allow widespread use of ``helpers'' on federal \nconstruction projects. Considering our nation's changing welfare-to-\nwork environment and with the importance of revitalizing disadvantaged \ncommunities, it is particularly critical that the government not limit \nopportunities for entry-level jobs.\n  Congress should exempt schools from the outdated rules and \nrestrictions and give local school districts the flexibility to spend \nresources where they will most effectively meet students' educational \nneeds.\n  The Davis-Bacon wage process has been shown to be inaccurate, subject \nto bias, and used as a tool to defraud taxpayers. In March 1997, a DOL \nInspector General's report confirmed that 2/3 of the wage surveys were \ninaccurate. In January 1999, a General Accounting Office report found \nerrors in 70% of the wage forms, and confirmed frequent errors go \nundetected and the high proportion of erroneous data ``poses a threat \nto the reliability'' of prevailing wage determinations.\n  Mr. President, again, I know that I am not the only Senator who would \nprefer repealing Davis-Bacon, but in light of the spirit of Senator \nSantorum's Amendment to the FY2000 budget measure, I ask that we at \nleast consider the reform points I outlined above.\n\n\n                          veterans health care\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I was pleased that I was able to join \nwith my colleague Mr. Wellstone from Minnesota in passing an amendment \nto the Fiscal Year 2000 budget resolution to increase funding for \nveterans health care. This amendment will help correct a serious \ninjustice to our nation's veterans that I believe demands urgent \nattention by Congress and the Clinton Administration.\n  This will be the fourth consecutive year, that the Clinton \nAdministration has proposed a flat-line appropriation for veterans' \nhealth care in its FY 2000 budget request. The VA's budget includes a \n$17.3 billion appropriation request for the Veterans Health \nAdministration (VHA). Although, the Clinton Administration's request \nincludes allowing the VA to collect approximately $749 million from \nthird-party insurers--$124 million more than in FY 1999, this cap on \nmedical spending places a greater strain on the quality of patient care \ncurrently provided in our nation's VA facility, especially when meeting \nthe needs and high health costs of our rapidly aging World War II \npopulation.\n  In a memo to VA Secretary Togo West, Under Secretary for Health Dr. \nKenneth Kizer expressed concern that the Administration's FY 2000 \nrequested budget ``poses very serious financial challenges which can \nonly be met if decisive and timely actions are taken.'' He indicates \nthat cuts must be made now to preclude even deeper cuts such as \n``mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of services or \nelimination of programs, and possible unnecessary facility closures.'' \nDr. Kizer also states that ``. . . changes are absolutely essential if \nwe are to prepare ourselves for the limitations inherent in the \nproposed FY 2000 budget.''\n  I have met with several representatives of South Dakota's veterans' \norganizations who have expressed their justifiable fears and \nfrustrations that the VA's flat-lined health care budget is causing \nmandatory reductions in outpatient and inpatient care and VA staff \nlevels. Since 1992, over 150 full-time employees at the Ft. Meade VA \nfacility have been cut do to insufficient budgets. There are legitimate \nfears in South Dakota that inpatient care will be eliminated from one \nof our VA facilities if an immediate solution is not found to augment \nthe VA's budget.\n  Peter Henry, Director of the Ft. Meade/Hot Springs VA facilities has \nbeen raiding from other budgets and has been forced to close other \nservices in order to provide health care for veterans in western South \nDakota. If the FY 2000 VA budget is not increased, Dr. Henry will soon \nbe forced to reduce inpatient care and could result in possible denial \nof certain category veterans.\n  South Dakota's veterans are tired of hearing what the VA cannot do \nfor them. It is time for Congress and the VA to tell veterans ``Yes, we \ncan and will help you.''\n  Many of South Dakota's 70,000 veterans contend that four years of \nflat-lined budgets for VA health care has left the system in danger of \nlosing as many as 8,000 employees nationwide, eliminating health care \nprograms and possibly closing VA facilities like the one in Sioux \nFalls. I have heard from people like Harry VandeMore, a Korean war \nveteran, who said, ``There was plenty of money to send me to Korea. \nThere was plenty of money for hand grenades, plenty of money for rifle \nshells. I guess the government would like to throw me out in the weeds. \nI don't know where I would go for health care [without the VA]. The \ndays of the hospital here in Sioux Falls are numbered if this keeps \nup.''\n  Gene Murphy, a former national commander of the Disabled American \nVeterans and now state adjutant for the South Dakota DAV, feels that \n``. . . our government is always happy to send us off to war, but \napparently they're not so happy to take care of us when we come back.''\n  Since I began my service in Congress over twelve years ago, I have \nheld countless meetings, marched in small town Memorial Day parades, \nand participated in Veterans Day tributes with South Dakota's veterans. \nAs the years go on their concerns remain the same. To ensure that \nCongress provides the VA with adequate funding to meet the health care \nneeds for all veterans. Without additional funding South Dakota VA \nfacilities will continue to face staff reductions, cutbacks in \nprograms, and possible closing of facilities.\n  Too often, I have received letters from veterans who must wait up to \nthree months to see a doctor. For many veterans who do not have any \nother form of health insurance, the VA is the only place they can go to \nreceive medical attention. They were promised medical care when they \ncompleted their service and now many veterans are having to jump \nthrough hoops just to see a doctor.\n  Our nation's veterans groups have worked extensively on crafting a \nsensible budget that will allow the VA to\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nprovide the necessary care to all veterans. They have offered an \nIndependent Budget that calls for an immediate $3 billion increase for \nVA health care to rectify two current deficiencies in the VA budget. \nFirst, the VA has had to reduce expenditures by $1.3 billion due to \ntheir flatlined budget at $17.3 billion. These were mandatory \nreductions in outpatient and inpatient care and VA staff levels that \nthe VA had to make due to their flatlined budget.\n  The remaining $1.7 billion is needed to keep up with medical \ninflation, COLAs for VA employees, new medical initiatives that the VA \nwants to begin (Hepatitis C screenings, emergency care services), long \nterm health care costs, funding for homeless veterans, and treating \n54,000 new patients in 89 outpatient clinics.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee I was encouraged \nthat an additional $1 billion was added for veterans health care. \nAlthough this will help relieve some of the VA's budgetary constraints, \nI believe that more needs to be done. The veterans community has \nrequested that VA health care needs to be augmented by $3 billion to \nensure the provision of accessible and high quality services to \nveterans. That is why I offered an amendment during the Budget \nCommittee mark up of the budget resolution that would have raised VA \nhealth care by an additional $2 billion. The nation's top veterans \ngroups (AMVETS, Blinded Veterans Association, Disabled American \nVeterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars and \nVietnam Veterans of America) voiced their strong support for my \namendment in a letter that I shared with members of the Committee. \nUnfortunately, my amendment failed 11-11.\n  Therefore, I along with Senator Wellstone offered an amendment that \nonce again increased veterans health care by $2 billion. I was pleased \nthat the Senate accepted my amendment by a vote of 99-0. The future of \nhealth care for veterans at the Sioux Falls, Hot Springs, and Ft. Meade \nVA facilities and in VA hospitals across the country will be sustained \nby this $3 billion total increase for veterans health care. The VA must \nbe provided with every resource to provide quality care for all \neligible veterans who walk into a VA facility.\n  Mr. President, I feel that our VA facilities are on the verge of a \ncatastrophic collapse if we continue to remain idle on this issue. In \n1972, the Sioux Falls VA medical facility contained 269 beds for \ninpatient care. Today, they are down to 44 beds. This is a facility \nthat saw 75,000 people walk through their doors last year. Some \nveterans have told me that when they go to the VA they see more \njanitors than nurses. This is unacceptable. If we want to provide care \nfor all eligible veterans who walk into a VA facility Congress needs to \nact now.\n  The funding required for this amendment represents a minute fraction \nof the total federal budget that we are debating here today. However, \nthe funding we set aside to improve accessibility and quality of care \nwithin our veterans health care system will provide a tremendous boost \nfor an already stretched and fractured VA medical system.\n  As we enter the twilight of the Twentieth Century, we can look back \nat the immense multitude of achievements that led to the ascension of \nthe United States of America as the preeminent nation in modern \nhistory. We owe this title as world's greatest superpower in large part \nto the twenty-five million men and women who served in our armed \nservices and who defended the principles and ideals of our nation.\n  From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, to the beaches of \nNormandy, and to the deserts of the Persian Gulf, our nation's history \nis replete with men and women who, during the savagery of battle, were \nwilling to forego their own survival not only to protect the lives of \ntheir comrades, but because they believed that peace and freedom was \ntoo invaluable a right to be vanquished. Americans should never forget \nour veterans who served our nation with such dedication and patriotism.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Wellstone and my Senate \ncolleagues for supporting my amendment. Acceptance of my amendment was \njust one victory in the war to provide decent, affordable health care \nfor South Dakota's veterans. By passing this amendment we live up to \nour obligation to our nation's veterans and ensure that they are \ntreated with the respect and honor that they so richly deserve.\n\n\n              Media Coverage of Federal Court Proceedings\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley in \nintroducing this legislation to permit federal trials and appellate \nproceedings to be televised, at the discretion of the presiding judge.\n  Former Chief Justice Warren Burger once said of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, ``A court which is final and unreviewable needs more careful \nscrutiny than any other. Unreviewable power is the most likely to \nindulge itself and the least likely to engage in dispassionate self-\nanalysis . . . In a country like ours, no public institution, or the \npeople who operate it, can be above public debate.''\n  I believe that these words are applicable to the entire federal \njudiciary. As such, I strongly support giving federal judges discretion \nto televise the proceedings over which they preside. When the people of \nthis nation watch their government in action, they come to understand \nhow our governing institutions work and equip themselves to hold those \ninstitutions accountable for their deeds. If there are flaws in our \ngoverning institutions--including our courts--we hide them only at our \nperil.\n  The federal courts are lagging behind the state courts on the issue \nof televising court proceedings. Indeed, 48 out of the 50 states allow \ncameras in their courtrooms in at least some cases. Moreover, a two-\nand-a-half year pilot program in which cameras were routinely permitted \nin six federal district courts and two courts of appeals revealed near \nuniversal support for cameras in the courtroom.\n  Our bill would simply afford federal trial and appellate judges \ndiscretion to permit cameras in their courtrooms. It would not require \nthem to do so. Furthermore, to protect the privacy of non-party \nwitnesses, the legislation would give such witnesses the right to have \ntheir voices and images obscured during their testimony.\n  A version of this legislation passed the House in the previous \nCongress. I eagerly anticipate Senate passage and the day when openness \nis the norm in our federal courtrooms, not the exception.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I oppose the Republican Budget Resolution \nbecause it supports the wrong priorities.\n  1998 was an exceptional year in this country's modern economic \nhistory. We enjoyed the first budget surplus in 29 years and the \neconomy exceeded expectations and continued to expand in the face of \ninternational instability--unemployment remained low; wages continued \nto increase; welfare recipients declined; home ownership increased; and \ninterest rates remained low. All of is good news has allowed the White \nHouse, the Congress, and the American people to begin debating how to \nuse future surpluses which are projected for the foreseeable future.\n  As a Member of Congress who arrived in Washington when the annual \nfederal budget deficit was over $220 billion and still growing, I am \nextremely pleased and a little amazed that we have gotten to where we \nare today. That said, I think it is extremely important that Congress \nproceed carefully in the coming years to ensure we make wise choices \nthat will keep this country's budget running in the black for years to \ncome.\n  Writing the FY 2000 budget is our first test of how we will handle \nexisting and future surpluses to ensure long-term economic growth and \nstability, and it is a test too important to coming generations for us \nto fail. I believe that this year's budget resolution should follow \nfour principles: first, we must save Social Security and Medicare; \nsecond, we should pay down the national debt; third, we should support \ntargeted tax relief to low and middle-income Americans; and finally, we \nshould identify and support critically needed discretionary priorities.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican Budget Resolution doesn't follow these \nprinciples, which I believe are critical to balancing the many pressing \nneeds of this nation. First, the Republican Budget Resolution does \nnothing to preserve Medicare. Second, while I support targeted tax \ncuts, I cannot support the\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\nuse of essentially all future on-budget surpluses for tax cuts at the \nexpense of Medicare solvency and other critical discretionary \ninvestments such as veterans health care. Third, the Republican budget \nresolution reduces non-defense discretionary spending by $20 billion in \nFY 2000. Finally, while the resolution increases funding for some \nprograms and protects others from cuts, the bottom line is that \ndiscretional programs such as agriculture, head start, law enforcement, \nand many other critically important programs could be cut by more than \n12% under the Republican Budget Resolution. I support preserving the \ndiscretionary caps and acknowledge that the caps force many tough \ndecisions on decisions on discretionary spending priorities. However, I \nfirmly believe that we can do a better job of balancing discretionary \npriorities than what is included in the Republican Budget Resolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 197\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a Sense of the \nSenate resolution as an amendment to the Budget Resolution. I am \npleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senators Santorum, Bingaman, \nand Abraham. As my colleagues know, saving is empowering. It allow \nfamilies to weather the bad times, to live without aid, and to deal \nwith emergencies. But more than just being a safety net, savings offer \nfamilies a ladder up. That is because saving is the first step towards \ndeveloping assets. And assets beget assets. Having them can actually \nchange a family's economic station and set a better course for \ngenerations to come.\n  Yet, despite our booming economy we know that fully a third of all \nAmerican households have no financial assets to speak of. For those \nwith children the outlook is even worse. Almost half of all American \nchildren live in households that have no financial assets. This, in my \nview, is an untenable situation that should be changed.\n  Mr. President, we in the Senate have produced some innovative \nlegislation in recent years that are designed to encourage Americans to \nbuild assets for retirement. That is due in no small part to the \nleadership of Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan; Senate leaders who \nunderstand the importance of savings. However, I believe that we have \nbeen remiss in neglecting the American that assets can benefit the \nmost: the working poor. They need to build assets not just for \nretirement, but also for the betterment of their lives and those of \ntheir children.\n  So Mr. President I, along with my distinguished colleagues offer this \nSense of the Senate. It simply says that the tax laws should encourage \nlow-income workers and their families to build assets. Similar language \nwas offered by Representative Thompson, and passed unanimously in the \nHouse Budget Committee mark-up. I hope that this resolution will also \nbe accepted here unanimously. Thank you and I cede the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 224\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to pose a question to my \ncolleague, Mr. Baucus. I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Baucus \nfor working with me on our amendment concerning Korea's compliance with \ntheir trade agreements. For our beef and pork producers, this couldn't \ncome at more pressing time. Particularly since the South Korean \nGovernment reportedly has been subsidizing its pork exports to Japan \nand these subsidies are hindering U.S. pork producers from capturing \ntheir full potential in the Japanese market.\n  However, I would like to take a moment to pose a question to Mr. \nBaucus in order to clarify paragraph (4). My question is what kind of \nreport do we intend to request? And how shall we define what \n``resources'' shall be reported upon?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank you for working with me on this measure and agree \nwith you that it is critical that South Korea live up to its trade \nagreements concerning beef and pork. For that reason, I agree that we \nshould clarify the implications of paragraph (4). In answer to your \nquestions, I would respond that reporting to Congress is meant to say \nthat any reporting will: be in verbal form. And, second, that reports \non resources used to stabilize the South Korean market will be provided \nby the Department of Treasury and the Department of Agriculture as \nappropriate.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I concur with your suggestions and urge all of my \ncolleagues to support the measure as defined.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Crapo in \noffering a Sense of the Senate amendment rejecting a new tax proposed \nby the Clinton Administration. I am very pleased that this amendment \nhas been cleared on both sides of the aisle and will be accepted by the \nfull United States Senate. This unanimous voice vote for the Abraham-\nCrapo amendment demonstrates beyond shadow of a doubt that this \nassociation tax increase proposal is dead on arrival here in the United \nStates Senate.\n  As part of the Administration's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal, \nthis tax would be levied on the investment income earned by non-profit \ntrade associations and professional societies. This proposal, which \nwould tax any income earned through interest, dividends, capital gains, \nrents and royalties in excess of $10,000, imposes a tremendous burden \non thousands of small and mid-sized trade associations and professional \nsocieties currently exempt under 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue \nCode.\n  The Administration would like us to believe that this tax is targeted \nto a few large associations, affecting only those ``lobbying \norganizations'' which exist as tax shelters for members and to further \nthe goals of special interests. Mr. President, nothing could be further \nfrom the truth.\n  This new tax would affect an estimated 70,000 registered trade \nassociations and professional societies. The bulk of these associations \noperate at a state and local level, many of whom perform little, if \nany, lobbying function. In fact, associations rely on investment income \nto perform such vital services as education, training, standard \nsetting, industry safety, research and statistical data, and community \noutreach. Through association organized volunteer programs, Americans \ncontribute more than 173 million volunteer hours per year, at a value \nestimated at over $2 billion annually.\n  These organizations already contribute millions in taxes for any \nactivities which place them in competition with for-profit businesses. \nYet the Administration would like to impose a new tax on income earned \noutside of the competitive business environment, income which is used \nto fund functions serving the public welfare. Unlike for-profit \ncorporations, investment income does not go to shareholders, \nindividuals, or other companies. Associations do not have the liberty \nof simply raising prices, as do ordinary corporations, to cover \nincreased costs.\n  Mr. President, faced with an additional increase in taxes of $1.44 \nbillion over the next five years, many trade associations will be \nforced to cut back on important services, and some may not survive an \neconomic downturn without the small cushion their investments provide. \nWithout such services provided by associations, the government will be \nforced to step in, increasing expenditures and creating additional \ngovernment programs and departments.\n  During a time when the government is projecting on-budget tax \nsurpluses of more than $800 billion over the next 10 years, it is \nunconscionable that we allow the Administration to levy a new tax on \nthese non-profit organizations.\n  Mr. President, in summary, the unanimous vote puts the entire Senate \non record as rejecting this misguided tax increase on trade \nassociations. Should this association tax proposal surface as a part \nof--or as an amendment to--tax reduction legislation reported by the \nSenate Finance Committee later this year, I will fight to ensure that \nthe Senate adheres to the vote that we have taken today expressing the \nSense of the Senate that it ought to be rejected outright.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this is the third time this year that I've \ncome to the floor to express my strong support to help states and \nlocalities build and repair our children's schools. I am concerned that \nthis budget resolution, which often serves as our roadmap throughout \nthe appropriations process, does not adequately take into account the \nurgent need that school districts are facing throughout the country. \nNot only do we have old schools in desperate need of repair, we also \nhave a growing student population. States and localities simply cannot \nkeep up with\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\ntheir school construction and repair needs. They cannot pay for major \ninfrastructure projects without our help.\n  Mr. President, this is what we know. We know that the average school \nbuilding in the country is 50 years old. We know that GAO estimates \nthat we need $112 billion just to repair old buildings to make them \nsafe. And Mr. President, we know that over the last ten years, public \nschool enrollment has increased 16.4% and that GAO estimates that it \nwill cost an additional $73 billion to build the new schools we need to \naccommodate this surge in enrollment.\n  Mr. President, in Virginia, there are over 3,000 trailers in use. \nThese trailers are not wired to the Internet; they're not even wired to \ntheir own schools network. Over the last two years, 38% of our school \ndistricts have been forced to close at least one building in each \ndistrict due to facility-related problems. The most commonly reported \nproblem was the insufficiency of air-conditioning and ventilation. In \nfact, our students have lost 38 days of instructional time--that's \nseven weeks--because of problems with the air conditioning.\n  But these problems are not unique to Virginia. School infrastructure \nproblems exist everywhere. In Alabama, it is reported that the roof of \nan elementary school collapsed just after the children had left for the \nday. In Chicago, teachers place cheesecloth over air vents to filter \nout lead-based paint flecks from getting into their classrooms. In \nOhio, there are even some children who use outhouses instead of modern-\nday restrooms. Roughly forty percent of New Mexico schools have \ninadequate electrical wiring, and fifty percent of Delaware schools \nreport inadequate plumbing systems.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Developing a budget is about setting priorities. I have long believed \nthat we have three basic priorities which should come before all \nothers: we should provide for our citizens a strong national defense, \nwe should provide quality education for our children, and we should not \npass on debt to the next generation.\n  When we consider the federal role in education, we should focus on \nhelping states and localities to meet their pressing needs. And Mr. \nPresident we have pressing needs when it comes to the condition of our \nschools. It is a pressing need when we see children fainting in school \nbecause the building has no air conditioning. It is a pressing need \nwhen we see a child attending class in a trailer. It is a pressing need \nwhen we see leaky, unsafe roofs. I don't believe that any parent would \ndeny that their children's needs come first.\n  We should not procrastinate in finding a solution to this problem. \nThis amendment is broadly worded. It doesn't target the money to any \nparticular population. It doesn't impede stats' efforts to begin their \nconstruction projects. Where there are disagreements on how to allocate \nfederal funds to the states, or whether or not to target a certain \nportion of those funds, or whether to have more private sector \ninvolvement, or what amount of federal dollars we can afford, let's \ntalk about those issues. But let's at least agree that we in Congress \ndo have an important role to play. This amendment is merely an attempt \nto determine whether this Congress is going to recognize our national \nschool construction crisis. Our states and localities have recognized \nthe crisis and are reaching out for our help.\n  Mr. President, last session Congress recognized another \ninfrastructure need--our national transportation need--and appropriated \n$216 billion for roads and transit projects. If we can recognize this \nnational need, come together on a bipartisan basis, and pass \nlegislation to build roads, surely we can come together to build \nschools. Schools are more than just classrooms, they're community \ncenters. Schools provide more than just classroom instruction, they \nprovide the keys to the future.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a starting point. Let's at least \nsend the right message to this Nation: that we see the leaking roofs, \nthat we see the cracked walls, that we see all the trailers--and that \nwe are willing to help.\n  I thank my friends, Senator Lautenberg and Senator Harkin, and all \nthose who have co-sponsored this amendment and I urge its adoption. \nWith that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senator Gregg and \nmyself to offer a Sense of the Senate Amendment to reaffirm the \ncommitment of the United States government to make good on the promise \nit made in 1975 to fund special education and to reject the President's \nefforts to undermine this commitment.\n  When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nin 1975, the federal government promised states and local school \ndistricts that Washington would help them meet the cost of educating \nstudents with special needs. The federal government pledged to pay 40 \npercent of the average cost of providing elementary and secondary \neducation for each student receiving special education. Unfortunately, \nthe federal government has failed to meet this obligation, creating an \nunfunded mandate that must be borne by every state and community in \nAmerica.\n  Due to the efforts of Senator Gregg and others, we are making \nprogress. The appropriation for Fiscal Year 1999 contained a 13 percent \nincrease in special education funding. As the Table behind me shows, \nthe Budget Resolution before the Senate increases funding for K-12 \neducation by $27.5 billion more than the President's budget over the \nnext five years. This includes an increase of $2.5 billion dollars for \nspecial education over the next five years.\n  We must not retreat from our commitment to fund special education, as \nthe President's budget proposes to do. This Sense of the Senate \nresolution will make clear that we reject the President's flat funding \nof special education grants to the states. Instead, it expresses the \nSenate's intention to fulfill the pledge made years ago.\n  What would this mean for our states and local school districts? Let's \ntake my home State of Maine as an example. In the 1997-1998 school \nyear, the total cost of special education was $189 million dollars. The \nIndividuals with Disabilities Act promised Maine $2,318 per student \nreceiving special education services, but the federal government only \nsent the states slightly more than $535 per student--which means that \nMaine received $57 million dollars less than what had been promised.\n  For the current school year, the increased appropriation for special \neducation brings the federal payment to $638 per student but still \nleaves a shortfall that exceeds $55 million. The President's budget \nproposal for fiscal year 2000, however, reverses this progress and \nallows the federal shortfall in Maine alone to grow to almost $59 \nmillion. According the U.S. Department of Education, the unmet mandate \nwill reach over $11 billion nationally. We can not continue to shift \nthis burden to our local communities. We must meet the federal \ncommitment to help pay for special education and end this unfunded \nmandate.\n\n  I want to quote briefly from a letter I received last week from the \nGovernor of Maine. In the letter, Governor Angus King describes the \nconsequence of this mandate on Maine's communities.\n\n       The costs of special education (in Maine) . . . continue to \n     grow dramatically, at nearly twice the rate of increase in \n     overall education spending. The federal mandate to provide \n     all children with a free and appropriate education is being \n     met, but the rising costs of special education are borne by \n     local property taxpayers. The fiscal pain of meeting this \n     mandate is dividing our communities around an issue on which \n     we should be united--helping every child meet this or her \n     full potential, without regard to disability.\n\n  In Maine, meeting this mandate accounts for millions of dollars \nannually, dollars that otherwise could be used for school construction, \nteacher salaries, new computers, or any other state effort to improve \nthe performance of our students.\n  We need to increase federal spending on education, but we do not need \nnew federal categorical programs with more federal regulations and \ndollars wasted on administrative costs. Rather we need to meet our \ncommitment to bear our fair share of special education costs. As \nGovernor King told President Clinton several weeks ago, ``If you want \nto do something for schools in Maine, then fund special education and \nwe can hire our own teachers and build our own schools.'' This is true \nfor every state. The best thing this Congress can do for education is \nto move toward fully funding, the federal government's share of special \neducation--not standing in place as the President's budget would have \nus do.\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commitment to give our states \nand local communities the financial help they have been promised and so \ndesperately need. Let's finally keep the promise made more than 20 \nyears ago.\n  Mr. SNOWE. I support the Chafee amendment that assumes funding of \n$200 million specifically for the stateside program of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund to come out of Function 370. It is my \nunderstanding that no specific program in Function 370 has been \ndesignated as an offset for the Chafee amendment. The ultimate funding \ndecision of course rests with the appropriators, but I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to cast my support for funds for the LWCF stateside \nprogram, which has not received any funding since 1995.\n  Up until 1995, LWCF stateside program funds were used in my state to \nassist communities for planning, acquiring and developing outdoor \nrecreation facilities that would not otherwise have been affordable, \nespecially in the smaller communities in Maine.\n  The LWCF stateside program has funded such local projects in Maine as \nthe community playground in Durham, the Mt. Apatite trails in Auburn, \nthe Dionne Park Playground in Madawaska, the East-West Aroostook Valley \ntrail in Caribou, the Williams Wading Pool in Augusta, multi-purpose \nfields in St. George, Hampden, Buxton, Calais, and Bradford, the \nskating rink in Bucksport, and wharf rehabilitation in Greenville.\n  By leveraging state dollars with critical LWCF stateside funds, \nMaine's communities have been able to enjoy recreational facilities \nsuch as neighborhood parks, swimming pools, and ball fields, and also \nhave had the opportunity to conserve certain highly valued lands that \nthe citizens of the state wish to save for outdoor recreational \nactivities for themselves and for generations to come.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to stand with my colleague \nfrom Maine in offering this important amendment to the Budget \nResolution. Senator Collins has been a leader in the area of higher \neducation and she has contributed a great deal as a member of the \nHealth, Education and Labor and Pensions Committee.\n  Last year, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nreported and Congress passed the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. \nWe adopted the conference report to accompany that bill by \noverwhelming, bipartisan vote of 96-0. Throughout the process, we were \ndetermined to craft legislation that offered students more \nopportunities. We kept our sights clearly focused on the goal of \nincreasing educational opportunities for all our nation's students.\n  We achieved our goal and as a result, students will receive \nsignificant benefits from the passage of that legislation. They will \nbenefit from the lowest interest rate in 17 years on their new student \nloans. They will benefit from strengthened and improved student grant \nprograms and campus based programs. They will benefit from the creation \nof a performance based organization housed in the Department of \nEducation which will vastly improve the delivery of student financial \naid. More of our nation's aspiring students will be prepared for and \nable to pursue higher education because of programs like TRIO and GEAR \nUP. Clearly, that bill went far in opening the door to all who dream of \npursuing higher education.\n  We have an opportunity today to take another step forward in meeting \nthe goals that we set out in the Higher Education Amendments of 1998.\n  The Sense of Senate offered by Senator Collins, myself and others \nfollows the blueprint that we laid out during reauthorization and \nencourages the Appropriations Committee to increase funding for some of \nthe most critical programs designed to help our neediest students \nsucceed at the undergraduate level.\n  Earlier this year I called for a $400 increase in the maximum Pell \ngrant. The importance of this program cannot be overstated--it is the \ncornerstone of our federal investment in need-based grant aid. It has \nhelped millions of young people obtain a degree. The Pell grant has \nmade a positive difference in the lives of individual students who \nreceived it and it is has made a positive difference in the well being \nof our nation. Thanks to the Pell grant, more Americans have received a \npost secondary degree, the knowledge base of our nation has been \nexpanded and the earnings base of our nation has increased.\n  This Sense of the Senate also calls on Congress to increase funds for \nother programs that have as their goal increasing access to post \nsecondary study for our nation's neediest students. The SEOG program, \nPerkins Loans, LEAP, Federal Work Study and TRIO all are targeted to \nprovide additional assistance, both financial and educational, to \nstudents who really need it the most. These funds often times make the \ndifference for a student between making it through school or dropping \nout. Therefore, our efforts today in support of these programs are \ncritical.\n  We are pleased to have the support of nearly all the major higher \neducation groups on this amendment. These organizations represent the \nstudents and institutions and they have a deep, first-hand \nunderstanding of how important this federal investment is to today's \nundergraduate students.\n  I applaud my colleague from Maine, Ms. Collins for her contributions \nto the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 and for the effort she is \nmaking today.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to introduce this \namendment, which would once again put this Senate on record in support \nof restoring our nation's military science and technology base. \nSpecifically, our amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the \nbudgetary levels for the Defense Science and Technology program should \nbe consistent with the 2% real increases in the budget request called \nfor by Congress in last year's Defense Authorization Act.\n  Without question, our nation has built the most technologically \nsuperior military force in the history of mankind. During our recent \ndemonstration of resolve against Saddam Hussein, the men and women who \nparticipated in Operation Desert Fox were virtually untouchable. The \nresults of their efforts were amazing: we attacked over 100 separate \ntargets in an effort to degrade Saddam Hussein's military \ninfrastructure. We totally destroyed 85 percent of these targets, and \npartially damaged the remainder, all without so much as a scratched \nairplane.\n  Why are our aircraft so overwhelmingly dominant and untouchable on \nthe battlefield? The answer: the Air Force made an investment many \nyears ago in science and technology research and we are now reaping the \nreturns of that investment.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, the Air Force, as well as our other \nservice branches, have made significant reductions in its investment in \nscientific research which may cast a long, dark shadow on the success \nof tomorrow's military. Over the last 10 years, the Air Force, for \nexample, has reduced the S workforce by 2,375 people. A large number \nof these talented individuals came from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base \nin Dayton, Ohio. And unless we in Congress take action, Wright-\nPatterson and other similar bases across our country will continue to \nlose this unrivaled expertise.\n  Mr. President, this should be of great concern to all of us. \nContinued investment in Defense S research is crucial if we are to \nmeet the challenges ahead. Yes, our nation's central security concern \nof the past half century--the threat of communist expansion--is gone. \nHowever, the world is far from being a safe place. Every day, our \nnation faces more and more diverse and complex challenges--as \nhighlighted by recent events in the Middle East, Kosovo, international \nterrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means \nto deliver them, and the flooding of illegal drugs into our country. \nThese threats to stability and security require an enduring commitment \nto diplomatic engagement and military readiness. In both instances, \nscience and technology research plays a critical role.\n  Today we lead the world in virtually every measure of technological \ndevelopment, but we can't rest on our recent successes. To remain the \nbest we have to continue to offer the best technology and employ the \nbest scientists,\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\nengineers, technicians, and innovators. The brave men and women of \ntomorrow's military will have to fight with the technology we invest in \ntoday--what we do today will have a direct impact on our success \ntomorrow.\n  Since the founding of our great nation, scientific discovery and \ntechnological innovation have advanced our military capabilities and \neconomic prosperity, ensuring the United States' position as a world \nleader. I must confess a great deal of personal pride in the dedicated \nmen and women at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base--the Defense \nDepartment's largest research site--who play no small part in this \nendeavor.\n  Wright-Patterson, founded in 1917 and formerly known as McCook Field, \nhas given the nation technological advancements too numerous to count. \nThese include advanced lightweight aerodynamic designs, advanced jet \nengines, hypersonic lifting bodies, development of the first ``smart \nweapons,'' and many, many others.\n  It is doubtful we will see that kind of achievement in the near \nfuture. My colleagues and I are here offering this amendment because we \nare very concerned that the proposed level of funding for Defense S \nprograms for next year is nearly $400 million below the level Congress \nprovided this year.\n  I am very troubled about the Air Force's proposal to use Air Force \nS resources to fund the Space Based Laser and Discoverer II (space-\nbased radar) program beginning in FY 2000. It is our understanding that \nthese previously non-S programs were inserted into the FY 2000 Air \nForce late in the budget process, while providing no additional funding \nto cover the costs of current S programs. This represents a \nsignificant reduction in our Air Force S investment in FY 2000 and \nthe outyears, and unless Congress acts, will result in drastic cuts in \ncritical Air Force research programs, severe reductions in force, and \nweaken our overall Air Force technology base. In fact, earlier this \nmonth, the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force \nBase (WPAFB) announced it would lose 163 civilian positions as a result \nof the Air Force's proposed FY 2000 S budget.\n  Now that Congress has agreed to address emerging readiness issues and \nincrease our investment in our national defense, our long term \nreadiness requires Congress to reverse the dangerous decline in S \nfunding. Last year, Congress recognized this downward trend in our S \ninvestments and passed legislation that called for an increase in the \nbudget for Defense S programs in all the Services by at least two \npercent above the rate of inflation for each year for the next nine \nyears.\n  Rebuilding Defense S is more than in investment in programs, but in \npeople as well. Simply restoring funding for S will not automatically \nbring that lost expertise back. It has to be built up over time. In \norder to take advantage of next generation technology, we need to begin \nrecruiting the next generation of innovators.\n  For these reasons, it's important that we pass a long-term budget \nplan that is consistent with the goal we set last year to rebuild our \nDefense S programs and personnel. We can start that effort by passing \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico. If we abide by \nthe commitment embodied in this amendment, we will give tomorrow's \nmilitary the tools it needs to ensure our national security needs are \nmet. In addition, by investing in highly qualified personnel, we are \nmaking it possible to devote the best minds toward developing the best \ntechnology. We must invest now so our children can enjoy the peace and \nprosperity that comes with being second to none in military \ntechnological superiority.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a sense of \nthe Senate amendment to the budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 20.\n  As we prepare to work on this year's federal budget, everyone seems \nto be talking about what we should and should not do with the Social \nSecurity trust funds. There is a growing understanding that the federal \ngovernment mixes the revenues of the Social Security trust fund in with \nthe revenues of the general fund in order to cover-up continuing annual \ndeficits. What many people may not know is that the government does the \nsame thing with over 150 other trust funds, mixing them all in with the \ngeneral fund.\n  The ``surpluses'' now being talked about are entirely fictitious, the \nresult of misleading and deceptive accounting practices. The \n``surpluses'' disappear once borrowing from the Social Security trust \nfunds ($121.9 billion in the current fiscal year) and borrowing from \nall other trust funds ($67.9 billion in the current fiscal year) are \nsubtracted. That's why the national debt will rise by $395.6 billion \nbetween FY 1998 and FY 2004.\n  I believe it is wrong for our government to use deceptive accounting \npractices. I believe it is wrong to encourage the perception that we \nare running annual surpluses, when in fact we are continuing to run \nannual deficits and continuing to add to the national debt. Anyone in \nthe private sector who engaged in similar practices would, by our own \nlaws, be subjected to prosecution and imprisonment. Why do we allow the \ngovernment to use accounting shell games that would be illegal anywhere \nelse?\n  To provide a more accurate picture of our country's financial \nsituation to the American people, I have this amendment to the Budget \nResolution. This Sense of the Senate amendment states that the Office \nof Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office should \nseparate the revenues of all government trust funds from the general \nfund and report the budget deficit or surplus when all trust funds are \nexcluded.\n  This is an incremental first step toward changing the way Congress \nand the President budget and spend taxpayer money.\n  I ask for your support in this effort to provide truthful budget \nnumbers to the American people. This amendment is, in my judgment, \ncompletely non-partisan. It makes no pre-judgments about tax cuts or \nspending increases. Instead, it simply seeks to expose a deceptive \naccounting practice long used by our federal government.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to urge the passage of my Sense of the Senate \namendment to the budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 20. This amendment \nwill require truth-in-budgeting with respect to the on-budget trust \nfunds.\n  There is a growing understanding that the federal government mixes \nthe revenues of the Social Security trust fund in with the revenues of \nthe general fund in order to cover-up continuing annual deficits. What \nmany people may not know is that the government does the same thing \nwith over 150 other trust funds, mixing them all in with the general \nfund.\n  I believe it is wrong for our government to use deceptive accounting \npractices. I believe it is wrong to encourage the perception that we \nare running annual surpluses, when in fact we are continuing to run \nannual deficits and continuing to add to the national debt. Anyone in \nthe private sector who engaged in similar practices would, by our own \nlaws, be subjected to prosecution and imprisonment. Why do we allow the \ngovernment to use accounting shell games that would be illegal anywhere \nelse?\n  To provide a more accurate picture of our country's financial \nsituation to the American people, I have offered this amendment to the \nBudget Resolution. This Sense of the Senate amendment states that the \nOffice of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office \nshould separate the revenues of all government trust funds from the \ngeneral fund and report the budget deficit or surplus when all trust \nfunds are excluded.\n  I ask for your support in this effort to provide truthful budget \nnumbers to the American people. This amendment is, in my judgement, \ncompletely non-partisan. It makes no pre-judgements about tax cuts or \nspending increases. Instead, it simply seeks to expose a deceptive \naccounting practice long used by our federal government.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this new era of budget surpluses \npresents us with a tremendous opportunity to expand our investment in \neducation, particularly our efforts to improve our public schools and \nraise academic achievement. This opportunity could not come at a better \ntime, given the growing importance of knowledge in this Information Age \neconomy, the\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\ngrowing concerns parents have about the ability of our schools to \nadequately prepare America's children for the challenges ahead of them, \nand the growing interest here in Congress in retooling our Federal \neducation policy this year through the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  The budget resolution before us makes an attempt to seize that \nopportunity providing for a $32 billion increase in elementary and \nsecondary education programs over the next five years. But I am \ndisappointed that the architects of this plan did not go further, that \nrather than making a dramatic statement about the priority we place on \neducation quality, this resolution instead opts to devote far more \nresources to broad-based tax cuts. In particular, I am disappointed \nthat, because of this preference for tax cuts, we have failed to fund \nthe President's plan to help local school districts reduce elementary \nschool class sizes by hiring 100,000 new teachers, a plan I am proud to \nhave cosponsored. And I am disappointed that we have failed to fully \nfund our share of IDEA, to finally meet the pledge Congress made to \ncover 40 percent of the cost of providing a free and appropriate \neducation to children with special needs. Eliminating this shortfall is \nby far the top priority of the teachers and principals and \nadministrators in my state of Connecticut, whose budgets are being \nbusted by the spiraling costs of meeting the requirements of IDEA, and \nwho tell us that all children are suffering as a result.\n  It is my hope that we could rectify this imbalance, which is why I am \njoining many of my colleagues in cosponsoring an amendment that would \nsignificantly strengthen our investment in education. Specifically, it \nwould shift one-fifth of the funding reserved for tax cuts, $156 \nbillion over the next 10 years, into education accounts. This shift \nwould enable us to fully fund the class-size initiative and meet our \nIDEA obligations, as well as provide additional resources to several \nimportant K-12 programs. This amendment is broadly supported by a wide \narray of education groups, and I believe that it truly reflects the \nwill of the American, people who have repeatedly expressed their \npreference for using the surplus to lift up our schools over broad-\nbased tax cuts.\n  I would strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this amendment and send a clear signal to the American people \nabout the priorities of this Congress, about our willingness to seize \nthe unique opportunity this new budget environment affords to invest in \nour children's future.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Kennedy-Dodd amendment. This amendment helps right a wrong that \nwas committed during the Senate Ed-Flex debate several weeks ago. \nDuring that debate, the Senate adopted an amendment that effectively \nforces our school districts to choose between hiring teachers and \nproviding services for students with special needs. This was unfair and \nunnecessary, and I am still hopeful that the amendment will be dropped \nin conference. However, I believe we need to do more than that--we need \nto send a strong signal to our school districts that we are committed \nto fulfilling our obligations to fully fund both IDEA and hiring \nteachers. The Kennedy-Dodd amendment does just that.\n  School districts in Wisconsin and across the nation are working hard \nto improve public education for all children. However, we in Congress \nmust also live up to our obligation to assist them. Although the \nFederal government has the responsibility to fund 40% of the costs of \nspecial education, we are currently only funding about 10%. In \naddition, school districts will need to hire 2 million new teachers \nover the next decade, and we should continue to provide funding for \nthem to do that.\n  The Kennedy-Dodd amendment provides full funding for the next six \nyears for both IDEA and the hiring of teachers. This amendment sends a \nstrong message--backed up by real dollars--that we will continue to be \npartners with local communities in improving education. It tells them \nwe will not tie their hands and force them to choose between hiring \nteachers and serving students with special needs. It is our duty to \nlive up to our obligations and fully fund both. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support the Kennedy-Dodd amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment along \nwith Senators, Abraham, Coverdell, Burns, Santorum, Smith of Oregon, \nGrams, Baucus, and Ashcroft to the budget resolution on the importance \nof counter-narcotic funding. I offer this amendment because I want to \nmake it crystal clear that this budget, and this Congress, should make \na serious investment in anti-drug activities.\n  This amendment expresses a Sense of Senate that funding for federal \ndrug control activities should be at a level higher than that proposed \nin the President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2000 and that funding \nfor federal drug control activities should allow for investments in \nprograms authorized in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and \nin S.5, the proposed Drug Free Century Act, which I introduced earlier \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, history has proven that a successful anti-drug \nstrategy is balanced and comprehensive in three key areas: demand \nreduction--such as education and treatment; domestic law enforcement; \nand international supply reduction.\n  This is why last year, I introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act, a $2.6 billion authorization initiative over three \nyears for enhanced international eradication, interdiction and crop \nalternative programs.\n  Two factors motivated me to launch this bi-partisan effort: a \nsignificant rise in teen drug use and a significant decline in our \ninvestment to seize drugs outside our borders. This dramatic decrease \nin our international efforts is one of the reasons why drugs have \nbecome more available and more affordable.\n  This wasn't always the case. The budget numbers tell an alarming and \nundeniable story. In 1987, the federal government's drug control budget \nof $4.79 billion was divided as follows: 29% for demand reduction \nprograms; 38% for domestic law enforcement; and 33% for international \nsupply reduction. This funding breakdown was the norm during the Reagan \nand Bush Administrations' efforts against illegal drugs, from 1985-92.\n  And during that time, our investment paid off. From 1988-1991, total \ndrug use was down 13%. Cocaine use dropped by 35%. Marijuana use was \nreduced by 16%.\n  After President Clinton took office in 1993, this Administration \npursued an anti-drug strategy that upset this careful funding balance. \nAnd by 1995, the federal drug control budget of $13.3 billion was \ndivided as follows: 35% for demand reduction programs; 53% for domestic \nlaw enforcement, and only 12% for international supply reduction. The \nshare of our anti-drug investment dedicated to stopping drugs outside \nour country dropped from 33% in 1987 to 12% in 1995.\n  Mr. President, our country is paying the price for this unfortunate \nchange in strategy. Since 1992, overall drug use among teens aged 12 to \n17 rose by 70 percent. Drug-abuse related arrests more than doubled for \nminors between 1992 and 1996. And the price of drugs also decreased \nduring this time period.\n  Last year we passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and \nalso provided a down payment of $829 million to get this initiative \nstarted.\n  Today, however, it is clear that the Administration is not yet ready \nto exercise the leadership Congress demanded on this Act. First, the \nAdministration's Fiscal Year 2000 budget would invest less in our anti-\ndrug efforts than what Congress provided this year. Second, regardless \nof repeated efforts to work with the Administration to get serious \nabout eradication and interdiction, not one of the top priorities \noutlined in our bi-partisan Act were funded in the Administration's \nproposed budget.\n  So, once again, it is up to us in Congress to set the example and \nprovide the leadership to ensure we implement a serious and balanced \ndrug control policy.\n  Let me conclude by thanking the Chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici, and his staff, for their efforts to make sure this \nbudget resolution represents the commitment we must make if we are \ntruly serious about reducing drugs. It will take that kind of \ncommitment to help us achieve\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nonce again a comprehensive and balanced drug control strategy. Most \nimportant, it will put us back on a course toward ridding our schools \nand communities of illegal and destructive drugs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important and \ntimely amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this month, under the impressive \nbipartisan leadership of Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, the Finance \nCommittee approved the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 by a 16-\n2 vote. This important legislation sends a strong message that all \nAmericans with disabilities have access to the affordable health care \nthey need in order to work and live independently.\n  The Jeffords amendment endorses that legislation as part of the \nbudget resolution, and will put the Senate on record that now is the \ntime for barriers that prevent disabled people from obtaining \nemployment to come down.\n  Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is now \nenjoying, people with disabilities continue to struggle to live \nindependently and become fully contributing members of their \ncommunities. We need to do more to see that the benefits of our \nprosperous economy are truly available to all Americans, including \nthose with disabilities. Children and adults with disabilities deserve \naccess to the benefits and support they need to achieve their full \npotential.\n  Large numbers of the 54 million Americans with disabilities have the \ncapacity to work and become productive citizens but they are unable to \ndo so because of the unnecessary barriers they face. For too long \npeople with disabilities have suffered from unfair penalties if they go \nto work. They are in danger of losing their cash benefits if they \naccept a paying job. They are in danger of losing their medical \ncoverage, which may well mean the difference between life and death. \nToo often, they face a harsh choice between eating a decent meal and \nbuying their needed medication.\n  The goal of the Work Incentives Improvement Act is to reform and \nimprove existing disability programs so that they do more to encourage \nand support every disabled person's dream to work and live \nindependently, and be productive and contributing members of their \nsociety. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans--and when \nwe say all, we mean all.\n  It is a privilege to be part of this bipartisan effort with Senator \nJeffords, Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, and sixty-six other Senate \ncolleagues. Work is a central part of the American dream, and it is \ntime for Congress to give greater support to disabled citizens in \nachieving that dream. This legislation is the right thing to do, it is \nthe cost effective thing to do, and now is the time to do it. I urge \nthe Senate to make this commitment a part of the budget resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have worked for many years to try to keep \nthe costs of prescription drugs down. Too many Americans are unable to \nafford the costly medications they need to stay healthy. Seniors in \nVermont living on fixed incomes should not be forced to choose between \nbuying food or fuel for heat, and paying for prescription drugs.\n  As part of this continuing effort, I am pleased to cosponsor the \nPrescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999, which is being \nintroduced today. This bill is an important step toward increasing the \naccess of older Americans to the prescription drugs they need for their \nhealth and well-being. The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act \nwill allow pharmacies to purchase prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries at the same discounted rates available to the federal \ngovernment and large insurance companies. Seniors should no longer foot \nthe bill for generous discounts to the favored customers of \npharmaceutical companies. Under this legislation, seniors could see \ntheir medication costs decrease by more than 40 percent.\n  This is only the first step. We must begin to address the greater \nproblem that the costs of most prescription drugs are not covered by \nMedicare. As drug costs skyrocketed 17 percent in the last year alone, \npaying for prescription drugs has become a tremendous out-of-pocket \nburden for seniors, who fill 18 prescriptions a year on average. I am \nencouraged by the debate on the Senate floor on the Budget Resolution \nwhich has focused on addressing the lack of a drug benefit. I will \nsupport efforts to include coverage of prescription drugs in the \nMedicare program. This is the right thing to do for seniors, and this \nis the right time to do it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senators \nKennedy, Johnson, Leahy, Wellstone, Inouye, Kerry, and others in \nintroducing the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act.\n  Mr. President, the sky-rocketing cost of prescription drugs has long \nbeen among the top 2 or 3 issues my constituents in Wisconsin call and \nwrite to me about. The problem of expensive prescription drugs is \nparticularly acute among Wisconsin senior citizens who live on fixed \nincomes. Nationally, prescription drugs are Senior Citizens' largest \nsingle out-of-pocket health care expenditure: the average Senior spends \n$100-$200 month on prescription drugs.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, last fall, a study by the House \nGovernment Reform and Oversight Committee found that the average price \nseniors pay for prescription drugs is twice as high as that enjoyed by \nfavored customers--big purchasers such as HMOs and the federal \ngovernment. The Committee's report found a price differential in one \ncase was 1400%, meaning that the retail price a typical senior citizen \npaid was $27.05, while the favored customer was charged only $1.75.\n  To be sure, Mr. President, the Committee's report did find that \nWisconsin had lower price differentials compared to other parts of the \ncountry, an 85% differential compared to a high of 123% in California. \nBut I think my constituents would find that a pretty hollow \ndistinction. There's not doubt in my mind that paying 85% more than \nothers are charged for the same product is unfair, plain and simple.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, traditional Medicare does not cover \nprescription drugs. While some Medicare managed care plans offer a \nprescription drug benefit, few of those managed care plans operate in \nWisconsin or in other largely rural states. So, while pharmaceutical \ncompanies give lower prices to favored customers who buy in bulk, small \ncommunity pharmacies such as we have throughout Wisconsin lack this \npurchasing power, meaning that Seniors who purchase their prescriptions \ndrugs at those small pharmacies get the high prices passed on to them.\n  Mr. President, I regularly get calls from Seniors on tight, fixed \nincomes who tell me that they have to choose between buying groceries \nand buying groceries and buying their prescription drugs. I would guess \nthat many of my colleagues receive similar calls from their \nconstituents. Calls like these, and the fact that prices are only \ngetting higher as scientific advances develop new medications, tell me \nthat we must take action to make prescription drugs more affordable to \nSeniors.\n  The legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today will \nrequire that pharmaceutical companies offer senior citizens the same \ndiscounts that they offer to their most favored customers. Through this \nlegislation, we take an important step in making costly but vitally \nimportant prescription drugs more affordable to the Seniors who need \nthem. I thank the chair.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, with a little assistance, I believe we can \nfinish this bill within the next 45 minutes.\n  I commend Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked hard to \nwork out these amendments and accept them by voice vote. The managers \nhave been doing an excellent job, and Senator Reid, and Senator Dorgan, \nso that we can do this.\n  But I want to try to explain where we are. The votes are still taking \nclose to 10 minutes. But there is a physical problem with just how long \nit takes to call the roll. We will continue to try to do those as \nquickly as possible.\n  I believe we have no more than five amendments left. We have two that \nwe already had ready to go, and we have possibly three more, and two \nmore on that side. We could be down to, I think, no more than five. I \ndon't want to say fewer than that until we are sure what we have done. \nBut let me ask unanimous consent and see if we can identify this \nproperly.\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \namendments remaining in order, other than those previously in order by \nSenator Domenici, and except those agreed to by the two managers, and, \nfollowing the disposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H. Con. Res. 68, the House companion bill.\n  I further ask that all after the enacting clause be stricken in the \nHouse resolution, the text of the Senate resolution be inserted, \npassage occur immediately, and the Senate resolution be placed back on \nthe Calendar.\n\n  The amendments are as follows. I believe we have two that are still \npending.\n  Robb, No. 181. I believe we are going to be able to do that one by \nvoice vote.\n  Lautenberg, No. 183, which I believe will very likely take a recorded \nvote. Voice vote? All right. We will do those two by voice vote.\n  Then Kerry No. 190;\n  Kennedy, No. 196;\n  And Chafee, No. 238.\n  I further ask that the votes occur in sequence, as provided in the \nprevious consent, with all provisions of the previous consent still in \norder.\n  I want to emphasize, we may still work out one or two of those that \nare on the list. But we are locking it down to the two that we are \ngoing to do by voice vote and the three that may require a recorded \nvote.\n  I yield to the manager.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have a question. Mr. President, I understand a \nvote will be asked for on the amendment of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have another list of ones we will accept, that the \nleader hasn't mentioned, that we agreed on.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. All right.\n  Mr. REID. There is also No. 182, the Robb amendment. Whatever the \nbody decides on that by voice vote will do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. My question is, does the leader's request preclude a vote \nup or down on the resolution itself?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, my understanding is it does not. It would \nnot be my intent to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I believe that I have 236. I believe that has been \ncleared.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. I believe it has. No. 236 is on the list.\n  Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Let's proceed.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed to the question on \nthe Robb amendment No. 182.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could I do the house cleaning? That will \nget us to the unanimous consent agreement.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 164, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Graham No. 164, as modified. We ask that \nit be accepted. We send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR COUNTER-\n                   NARCOTICS INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) from 1985-1992, the Federal Government's drug control \n     budget was balanced among education, treatment, law \n     enforcement, and international supply reduction activities \n     and this resulted in a 13-percent reduction in total drug use \n     from 1988 to 1991;\n       (2) since 1992, overall drug use among teens aged 12 to 17 \n     rose by 70 percent, cocaine and marijuana use by high school \n     seniors rose 80 percent, and heroin use by high school \n     seniors rose 100 percent;\n       (3) during this same period, the Federal investment in \n     reducing the flow of drugs outside our borders declined both \n     in real dollars and as a proportion of the Federal drug \n     control budget;\n       (4) while the Federal Government works with State and local \n     governments and numerous private organizations to reduce the \n     demand for illegal drugs, seize drugs, and break down drug \n     trafficking organizations within our borders, only the \n     Federal Government can seize and destroy drugs outside of our \n     borders;\n       (5) in an effort to restore Federal international \n     eradication and interdiction efforts, in 1998, Congress \n     passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act which \n     authorized an additional $2,600,000,000 over 3 years for \n     international interdiction, eradication, and alternative \n     development activities;\n       (6) Congress appropriated over $800,000,000 in fiscal year \n     1999 for anti-drug activities authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act;\n       (9) the proposed Drug Free Century Act would build upon \n     many of the initiatives authorized in the Western Hemisphere \n     Drug Elimination Act, including additional funding for the \n     Department of Defense for counter-drug intelligence and \n     related activities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) funding for Federal drug control activities should be \n     at a level higher than that proposed in the President's \n     budget request for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (2) funding for Federal drug control activities should \n     allow for investments in programs authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and in the proposed Drug Free \n     Century Act.\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 226, 223, And 167, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Senator Lautenberg, do you have your amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we accept it right now?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We can accept it. This is on school modernization. It \nhas my list of cosponsors.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We accept the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 183) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that we should enact legislation to help local school \ndistricts modernize their schools. This is a critical need for our \nschool districts.\n  This school modernization proposal is supported by the National \nSchool Boards Association, the National PTA, the National Association \nof Elementary School Principals, and the entire range of education \nadvocates.\n  Mr. President, help with school modernization is what the education \ncommunity wants from the Federal Government. They don't want lip \nservice, they want action. Here is our chance. I ask for my colleagues' \nsupport.\n  I thank my principal cosponsor Senator Robb for his support for this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is it so far.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 182\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I hope I may have the 60 seconds, even \nthough I am going to have a voice vote, and I know the result of that \nvote.\n  Mr. President, may I simply say pay-as-you-go has served this \ninstitution and this country well. It has helped reduce deficits, and \nit has helped us not to spend money we did not have. Senator Graham and \nI thought it would be appropriate to continue that discipline. \nRegrettably, in an effort to spend money that we do not have, it is \nbeing withdrawn in this amendment.\n  I yield to my distinguished friend from Florida to use up any time \nthat I have not used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the threat to the surplus is not the \nthreat that it will or will not be placed in a lockbox. It is a threat \nwhether the surplus will be dissipated by expenditures that are not \noffset by either other spending or by sources of revenue to support \nthose additional expenditures.\n  I believe if you are seriously committed to preserving the surplus so \nit can be used to strengthen our Social Security system, you should \ngive strong support to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the fiscally responsible vote is yea. With \nthat, Mr. President, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't believe we should vote yea. We \nshould not be required to follow a pay-as-you-go that was there when we \nhad big deficits and require we have 60 votes when you have a surplus \nor to spend any money when you have a surplus. We should not do that. \nWe will not support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 182) was rejected.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 196\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment up is the Kennedy amendment \nNo. 196.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We understand that amendment should be called a \nRockefeller amendment. Is that correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is the Rockefeller amendment. \nThe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I may have the attention of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Senate.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, our senior citizens in the United \nStates deserve a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The amendment that \nI am offering, together with Senator Kennedy, creates a credible \nreserve fund to accommodate such if a bill which reforms Medicare, in \nfact, passes. This will not add to the debt. There are no unacceptable \nconditions. There is no uncertainty about whether the funds will be \nthere. The idea is clear and simple, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There will be order in the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fellow Senators, this amendment sets up a reserve fund \nfor any taxes that might be forthcoming from cigarettes without \nrequiring any reform or any changes in the Medicare program. It just \nsays that is out there to be used for Medicare. And whatever you want \nto call it, prescription drugs or what, it just doesn't seem to this \nSenator we ought to be doing that when we have a bipartisan Commission \nand many others saying let's reform Medicare and then let's see where \nwe are.\n  So I don't believe we should be doing this, and I move to table the \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 190\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we spent a lot of effort in the last years \ntrying to assert discipline on the budget process. This amendment is an \nopportunity to continue that discipline and to vote against deficit \nspending. As my colleagues know, I think the vast majority of the \nSenate is in favor of a tax cut. But this tax cut is loaded in a way \nthat of $780 billion, $630 billion is not until the last years. In \nfact, it will not even take effect until about 2005.\n  What we say is we do not take away the tax cut. We simply say if CBO \nsays that will result in deficit spending, we delay for the 1 year \nuntil we know we are in surplus rather than having to deficit spend in \norder to fund a tax cut.\n  The vast majority of the American people want to get out of debt. \nThey do not want a tax cut if it means deficit spending to provide it. \nThe danger is that the economic statistics, or realities, could turn \ndownwards, but the law will require a tax cut we cannot afford.\n  So, this is a way of saying there is an automatic delay. We do not \ntake it away. It affects nothing on Social Security and guarantees no \ndeficit spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the simplest way I can explain this is \nthis is the kind of tax cut we give, but we take it way. It is kind of \na reverse trigger. Instead of putting a tax on, we put tax on and then \nwe stop it in the event we get an estimate from the Congressional \nBudget Office that the surpluses are not quite what we figured out.\n  We do not do that for spending. Spending can go on up. We have no \ntriggers on or off. But when it comes to tax cuts, we kind of give \nthem, but we do not quite give them. I do not think that is the way we \nought to treat the taxpayer.\n  Having said that, the amendment violates the Budget Act. It is not \ngermane and I make the point of order it does not comply with the \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                     motion to waive the budget act\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr President, I rise to offer a Sense of the Senate \namendment to express the commitment of the Senate to expand needs-based \nFederal student aid programs. I am joined in this effort by Senators \nJeffords, Reed, Dodd, Kennedy, and Lieberman.\n  I am pleased by the large increase in funding for education included \nin the Budget Resolution and thank Senator Domenici and the other \nmembers of the Budget Committee for taking a forward-looking stance in \nfavor of our children. I am offering this amendment to help ensure that \nas these increased funds for education are appropriated--and as the \n``hard decisions'' are made about appropriations for specific \nprograms--need-based student financial aid programs are given priority.\n   Although the federal government cannot guarantee that every American \nwill complete a postsecondary education program, we can ensure that \nevery qualified American has an equal opportunity to do so. This is the \nprimary purpose of the student financial aid programs authorized by the \nHigher Education Act.\n  The evidence is overwhelming that individuals from low-income \nfamilies pursue higher education at a significantly lower rate than \nindividuals from middle- and upper-income families. This educational \ngap, which is rooted in economic disparity, threatens to divide our \nnation into two self-perpetuating classes: an educated class that \nparticipates fully in the tremendous economic opportunities that demand \na postsecondary education and a class of ``have nots'' lacking the \nskills and education needed to be successful members of the modern work \nforce.\n  Congress created need-based student financial aid programs to ensure \nthat individuals from low-income families are not denied postsecondary \neducation because they cannot afford it. These are the programs that \nassist the most disadvantaged Americans. They are the programs that \nhelp the students who come from families with no history of pursuing \npostsecondary education. They are the programs that will close the gap \nbetween educational ``haves'' and the ``have nots''\n  Federal Pell Grants are the cornerstone of our country's need-based \nfinancial aid. These grants provide essential financial assistance to \nalmost 4 million students a year. Eighty percent of the dependent \nstudents receiving Pell Grants come from families with annual family \nincomes of less than $30,000. Yet, over the last 20 years, while the \ncost of postsecondary education has grown at an unprecedented rate, the \nmaximum Pell Grant has declined in constant dollars by 14 percent. This \nSense of the Senate amendment states that we should increase the \nmaximum Pell Grant by $400 dollars to $3525. We still will not be back \nto the 1980 level in terms of purchasing power, but we will be getting \ncloser.\n\n  This amendment also urges an increase in two other important grant \nprograms. The Federal Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grant and \nthe Leveraged Educational Assistance Program (formerly SSIG) are grant \nprograms managed by schools and states respectively. These programs \nleverage federal dollars through matching funds from schools and states \nand provide additional assistance for those students most in need of \nfinancial aid.\n  In addition to these important educational grants, my amendment calls\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nfor increased funding for two other need-based programs that assist \nstudents from low income families: the Federal Work Study Program and \nthe Perkins Loan Program. These are campus-based programs in which the \nfederal contribution is leveraged by matching funds from participating \nschools. Work Study is a self-help student aid program under which \nneedy students pay some of the cost of their education through jobs \nthat contribute to their education and often involve important \ncommunity service. The Perkins Loan program allows schools to make low-\ninterest loans to needy students. Both of these programs, along with \nthe Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grants, give financial aid \noffices flexibility in creating individualized student aid packages \nthat will minimize the student's debt burden upon graduation.\n  Unfortunately, during the last 20 years, funding for the work study \nprogram had declined by 25 percent in constant dollars and the capital \ncontribution to Perkins Loans has declined by 78 percent. This Sense of \nthe Senate Amendment expresses our support for these important \nprograms, which aid our neediest students.\n  Providing financial aid is only one aspect of the challenge to \nequalize education opportunity. Before financial aid can help, a \npotential student must aspire to higher education. This is one of the \ngoals of the TRIO programs. There is no question that thousands of \nindividuals who would never have considered a college education have \nbeen identified by Talent Search and Upward Bound and gone on to \ncollege and successful careers. Thousands of other individuals have \nbeen assisted while in college by the Academic Support Services \nProgram, while many non-traditional students have entered college \nbecause of the Educational Opportunity Centers.\n  Despite this strong record of success, the existing TRIO programs \nreach only a very small percentage of the individuals who are eligible \nfor their services. The additional funds that this Sense of the Senate \nAmendments urges will extend the reach of these programs to more \ndisadvantaged youth and adults who could so benefit from the support \nthe TRIO programs provide.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that more of our \ncitizens can pursue the American dream of college education.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 247) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 170\n\n  Mr. REID. Amendment No. 170 was acceptable with a modification. It \nwas cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you accept that as if I said it, please, so I do \nnot have to say it. It has been accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 170) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for participating \nand for permitting us to get this bill done today. It has been a big \nstruggle for many of us. And while we had a lot of fun with many of the \namendments and many of the concepts, it is a serious budget resolution. \nIt has been a pleasure serving you as chairman of the Budget Committee. \nAnd I thank all of those who vote for it. For those who do not vote for \nit, I think you are missing the boat, missing a great path. It is the \nbest budget we have produced in an awful long time.\n  I thank Senator Lautenberg for all his cooperation and certainly all \nthe good he has done in bringing this budget to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I say to Senator Domenici, I too had \nfun, not as much fun as the Senator had, but it was good working \ntogether. We put our most difficult disagreements to the side at times. \nSenator Domenici invented a new index for debate. And the index that \nSenator Domenici has is a ``red'' neck. When it gets above your collar, \nthat is when you have to sit back.\n  So we have no ``red'' necks in the Budget Committee. We have had a \ngood time in getting it done. I thank all of my colleagues, \nparticularly the members on my side, who worked so arduously.\n  I do want to say a word about the staff while the Senators are here. \nI thank Bill Hogan and his team; but I also want to make particular \nmention of the fact that Bruce King, our chief of staff, Sue Nelson, \nLisa Konwinski, Amy Abraham, Claudia Arko, Jim Esquea, Dan Katz, Marty \nMorris, Paul Saltman, Jeff Siegel, Mitch Warren, Ted Zegers, and Jon \nRosenwasser--I thank all the staff. They worked very hard, on both \nsides, and they deserve our deep thanks and our appreciation.\n\n  With that, I surrender the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senate will \nbe in order.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 238\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I made a mistake. We have been working \nvery hard to get Senator Chafee's amendment No. 238 accepted on the \nother side. It was. And we would like to offer it at this time. I think \nit is at the desk, amendment No. 238.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not believe there are any objections to it.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 238 previously offered by the Senator from \n     New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. Chafee.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor, \nalong with the gentleman from Rhode Island and others, an amendment to \nincrease funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Our \namendment would accomplish two important goals.\n  First, the amendment authorizes $200 million in matching grants to \nstates for their conservation and recreation programs. The amendment \ntherefore would help fulfill a thirty-five year-old Federal commitment \nthat has been largely ignored in recent years.\n  Second, our amendment maintains Congress' commitment to living within \nthe budget agreement by offsetting the increased LWCF funding with an \nequivalent reduction in programs within the Department of Commerce.\n  Let me speak first about the LWCF. As most of my colleagues know, the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund was established in 1964, and it has \nbeen the main source of Federal funding for Federal and state \nrecreational lands. The LWCF accumulates revenues from outdoor \nrecreation user fees, the federal motorboat fuel tax, surplus property \nsales, and, most significantly, revenue from oil and gas leases on the \nOuter Continental Shelf. Due to early successes and strong support, \nauthorized funding levels increased steadily from the initial \nauthorization of $60 million to the program's current $900 million \nlevel--although appropriations have consistently fallen far short of \nauthorized levels.\n  Until Fiscal Year 1995, about one third of the total $10 billion \nappropriated under this program went directly to the states. The rest \nof the revenue was split between four Federal agencies: the Park \nService, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  Matching grants to states have funded some 37,000 projects and helped \nconserve 2.3 million acres of land. While the law requires at least a \n50% match from states receiving funds, in some cases the Federal grants \nenabled states to leverage up to seven times the grant amount.\n  The LWCF has enjoyed widespread support, both in my home State of New \nHampshire and across the nation. The LWCF has truly been, up until \nrecent years, a Federal-state partnership that works.\n\n  In the early years of the program, the bulk of the funding for LWCF \nwent directly to the states. However, the state share of LWCF funding \nhas declined dramatically since Fiscal Year 1978, when annual LWCF \nappropriations stabilized at between $200 and $300 million after fiscal \nyear 1978, but the state portion of LWCF appropriations steadily \ndeclined until Fiscal\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\nYear 1996, when grants to states were completely eliminated. Since \nFiscal Year 1996, overall funding for LWCF has begun to increase again, \nbut all of the money has been appropriated for the Federal-side of the \nprogram, and none for the states.\n  Mr. President, to put it simply: that is wrong. These revenues were \noriginally intended to be shared between the Federal Government and the \nstates. We should not penalize states like New Hampshire that can \neffectively manage these funds and that have critical needs which must \nbe addressed. The idea that only the Federal government can be trusted \nto conserve resources is again, Mr. President, simply wrong.\n  Last month, more than 100 elected officials, community \nrepresentatives and other New Hampshire citizens sent a letter to the \nChairman of the Budget Committee, expressing their strong support for \nthe LWCF and other conservation partnership programs. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their letter be inserted into the Record, along with a \nletter that I and thirty-five of my colleagues sent to the Chairman on \nthis topic as well.\n  Today's amendment will help bring back some balance to this program \nby providing $200 million for states from the LWCF. Our amendment will \nnot reduce LWCF appropriations to Federal agencies, but will, as I \nstated earlier, offset this increased funding with a corresponding \nreduction in appropriations for certain Commerce Department activities \nwithin Budget Function 370.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, while I support the underlying Chafee \namendment providing $200 million in increased funding for the state-\nside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Program, I object to \nthe use of funds from Function 370 as an offset. The Land and Water \nFund monies are of critical importance to communities in my state and \naround the nation, and I have pledged to work hard to ensure that the \nstate-side portion of the Fund is revived. I believe that revival of \nthe State-side Fund represents the commitment of all Americans to \nconserving natural treasures and preserving open space.\n  Nevertheless, Function 370 is not the place to target offsets. \nImportant programs under this budget function in the Commerce \nDepartment are vital to small businesses around the country and to our \neconomic growth and our global competitiveness. Function 370 contains \ncost-effective initiatives that directly contribute to our economic \nwell-being. Clearly, it makes little sense to take funds from some of \nthe numerous cost effective programs in this Function when other areas \nin other Functions could better serve as offsets. I will support the \namendment because I trust that the conference and the appropriations \nprocess will locate preferable offsets to fund this important Land and \nWater Conservation initiative.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Chafee, Bob \nSmith, and Feingold in offering this amendment to restart the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund (LWCF) state assistance program. Our amendment \nwill recognize the outpouring of support for open space conservation \nand urban revitalization demonstrated by the passage of 124 ballot \nmeasures dedicating tax revenues to these goals.\n  Our amendment will allocate $200 million to the state grants program \nof LWCF. More than thirty years ago Congress made a promise to future \ngenerations that we would use the revenues from offshore oil and gas \nleases to protect the ``irreplaceable lands of natural beauty and \nunique recreational value.'' The revenues would be placed into the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and used by the federal government, states \nand local communities to build a network of parks, refuges, hiking \ntrails, bike paths, river accesses and greenways.\n  Unfortunately, only half of that promise has been kept. For the past \nthree years, Congress has not funded the state grants program of the \nFund. Instead, we have been diverting these revenues for other purposes \nat a time when these investments are needed more than ever. We have all \nseen the impact of urban sprawl in our home states, whether it be \nlarge, multi-tract housing or mega-malls that bring national \nsuperstores and nation-sized parking lots. We are losing farm and \nforest land across the country at an alarming rate. If we are going to \nreverse this trend, Congress has to step in to the debate and start \nfunding federal land conservation programs that help states address \ntheir land conservation priorities. The LWCF state grants program is \none of the few federal programs available to do this--Congress now \nneeds to make a commitment to fund it.\n  By funding the state grants program we will be investing in a proven \nsuccess. The program has proved itself by helping to fund more than \n37,000 projects across the country. As the National Park Service has \ntestified, these projects are in ``every nook and cranny of the country \nand serve every segment of the public.'' I am sure every one of us have \nvisited one of these places without even knowing that federal funds--\nwhich leveraged state and local funds--made it happen.\n  But it is not happening any more. By not funding the state grants \nprogram we are leaving state and local governments to fill the gap. In \nVermont, we are fortunate. Most Vermonters are within a few hours of \nthe Green Mountain National Forest or the Appalachian Trail. Most \nAmericans, however, are much further away from a national park, \nnational forest or wildlife refuge. They depend on their local parks \nand bike paths for weekend getaways or evening excursions.\n  I have seen the success of the state-side program in Vermont, where \nmore than $27 million from the Fund has helped conserve more than \n66,000 acres of land that was set aside as open space, parks and \nrecreation places. I have a list of more than 500 projects that touch \nevery corner of Vermont. However, there are still many special places \nin Vermont that remain unprotected. I constantly hear from Vermonters \nwhat are trying to protect their town green, a local wetland or access \nto their favorite fishing hole.\n  By restarting the state grant program we will be able to protect some \nof these special places in each of our states. In Vermont, I would like \nto see the Long Trail, which follows the spine of the Green Mountains \nthrough my state and attracts more than 200,000 hikers a year, \ncompleted. I would like to see better access to the banks of one of the \npremier fly-fishing rivers, the Battenkill. Although these will not \nbecome part of our federal network of conservation areas, we still have \na federal responsibility to ensure they remain open and accessible for \nfuture generations to enjoy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 238) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are ready now for the last vote of the \nnight and the last vote on the budget resolution. I commend the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member, the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  This is a record handling of a budget resolution. I think, in at \nleast the 5 years that I have been watching it closely, this is the \nshortest time--2 days--and a limited number of votes in the ``vote-\narama.'' I think it makes more sense when you have a more limited \nnumber. We understand a little bit better about what we are voting on.\n  So you have done an exceptional job. But it would not have happened \nwithout the leadership and cooperation of Senator Daschle, his team, \nSenator Reid and Senator Dorgan; on our side, Senator Nickles, Senator \nCraig, and a lot of other people who cooperated and were willing to \nforgo votes on their amendments. So I think, sincerely, a lot of \ncongratulations should be passed out for the cooperation on this \nconcurrent resolution.\n  It has been a very good legislative period. Senator Daschle and I----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The majority \nleader has the floor. The Senate will be in order. Would the Senators \nsuspend to my right. Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT. This is actually so much fun, we might want to stay on and \ntake up another bill. But I want to give a little more credit here \nbecause it has been a very productive legislative period. With this \nbudget resolution, we\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\nhave also passed the national missile defense bill; we passed the Ed-\nFlex bill; the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of \nRights Act; the supplemental appropriations bill, on a voice vote; the \nY2K small business bill; and the resolution supporting our men and \nwomen overseas in Kosovo.\n\n  Particularly this week, we took up the vote on Kosovo, the \nsupplemental, and the budget resolution. It is one of the most \nproductive weeks I have seen in a long time.\n  When we adjourn shortly, the Easter recess will, of course, begin \ntonight. There will be no recorded votes until Tuesday, April 13.\n  We will not be in session this Friday. We will be in session on \nMonday, April 12, but there will be no recorded votes. At that time, we \nexpect to take up the supplemental appropriations conference report, if \navailable, and a budget conference report, if available, and other \nlegislation that may be cleared at that time.\n  Thank you all very much. Have a good Easter recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Pursuant to the previous order, \nthe Senate will now proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 68. \nAll after the enacting clause is stricken and the text of S. Con. Res. \n20, as amended, is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The question is on agreeing to H. Con.

There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the concurrent \nresolution.

Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the first \nanniversary of National Tartan Day. While it is observed on April 6 of \neach year, I make this recognition today because Congress will be in \nrecess on that day. I want to remind my colleagues that the resolution \nwhich establishes National Tartan Day was Senate Resolution 155. It \npassed by unanimous consent on March 20th of last year.\n  As an American of Scottish descent, I appreciate the efforts of \nindividuals, clan organizations, and other groups such as the Scottish \nCoalition, who were instrumental in generating support for the \nresolution. These groups worked diligently to foster national awareness \nof the important role that Americans of Scottish descent have played in \nthe progress of our country.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of National Tartan Day is to recognize the \ncontributions that Americans of Scottish ancestry have made to our \nnational heritage. It also recognizes the contributions that Scottish \nAmericans continue to make to our country. I look forward to National \nTartan Day as another opportunity to pause and reflect on the role \nScottish Americans have played in advancing democracy and freedom. It \nis my hope that this annual event will grow in prominence. Scottish \nAmericans have helped shape this nation. Their contributions are \ninnumerable. In fact, three fourths of all American Presidents can \ntrace their roots to Scotland.\n  Mr. President, in addition to recognizing Americans of Scottish \nancestry, National Tartan Day reminds us of the importance of liberty. \nIt honors those who strived for freedom from an oppressive government \non April 6th, 1320. It was on that day that the Declaration of Arbroath \nwas signed. It is the Scottish Declaration of Independence. This \nimportant document served as the model for America's Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  In demanding their independence from England, the men of Arbroath \nwrote, ``We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with \nhis live.'' These words are applicable today to the heroism of our \nAmerican veterans and active duty forces who know the precious cost of \nfighting for liberty.\n  Mr. President, Senate Resolution 155 has served as a catalyst for the \nmany states, cities, and counties that have passed similar resolutions \nrecognizing the important contributions of Scottish Americans.\n  I would like to thank all of my colleagues who supported this \nresolution last year and who helped to remind the world of the stand \nfor liberty taken on April 6--almost seven hundred years ago--in \nArbroath, Scotland. A call for liberty which still echoes through our \nhistory and the history of many nations across the globe.\n  I believe April 6th can also serve as a day to recognize those \nnations that have not achieved the principles of freedom which we hold \ndear. The example of the Scotsmen at Arbroath--their courage--their \ndesire for freedom--serves as a beacon to countries still striving for \nliberty today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3432-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3432-S3433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADMIRAL ROY L. JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the nation lost one of its most \ndistinguished military leaders when Admiral Roy L. Johnson passed away \non March 20. He was 93. His Naval career spanned 38 years, at the end \nof which he was Commander in Chief of the U.S. Naval Forces in the \nPacific at the height of the Vietnam conflict in 1965-1967. Prior to \nthat, as Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, he had given the orders \nto the U.S.S. Maddox and U.S.S. Turner Joy to fire back at Viet Cong \ngunboats in the Tonkin Gulf incident.\n  The Admiral was a pioneer of Naval aviation. He received his wings in \n1932 and served as a flight instructor at the U.S. Navy flight school \nat Pensacola, both in the era of the biplane in the early 1930s and at \nthe dawn of the space age in the 1950s.\n  This remarkable man was born March 18, 1906 in Big Bend, Louisiana, \nthe eldest of twelve children of John Edward Johnson and Hettie May \nLong. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in the class of 1929 and \ndevoted his life thereafter to the security of his country. During \nWorld War II, serving on the U.S.S Hornet, he was awarded the Bronze \nStar, the Air Medal and the Legion of Merit with gold star. He saw \naction in the places\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\nwhose names have become a litany of courage: the Philippines, Wake \nIsland, Truk, Iwo Jima, Okinawa. A few year later, as Commanding \nOfficer of the escort carrier U.S.S. Badoeng Strait, he again saw \naction in the Korean War.\n  In 1955, he became the first commanding officer of the U.S.S. \nForrestal, the first of the ``super-carriers,'' was promoted to the \nrank of Rear Admiral, and later assumed command of Carrier Division \nFour, with the Forrestal as his flagship. In 1960, he was named \nAssistant Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy, was later \npromoted to Vice Admiral, and in 1963 became Deputy Commander in Chief \nof the U.S. Pacific Fleet. A year later, he was appointed Commander of \nthe Seventh Fleet, and in that capacity was awarded his second \nDistinguished Service Medal. In 1965, he was promoted to full Admiral \nand became Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the last \nMilitary Governor of the Bonin Islands, which include Iwo Jima.\n  After his retirement in 1967, Admiral Johnson remained active in \ncivic affairs. He was Chairman of the Board of Virginia Beach General \nHospital, a founding trustee of the U.S.S. Forrestal Memorial Education \nFoundation, president of the Early and Pioneer Naval Aviators \nAssociation (The Golden Eagles), President of the Naval Academy Alumni \nAssociation, and other organizations. He was an active contributor to \nthe U.S. Naval Institute's Oral History Program, which published his \nmilitary memoirs, served as an advisor on national security matters, \nand was on the national board of Senator Bob Dole's veterans' group in \nhis presidential campaign.\n  The Admiral's wife of 69 years, the former Margaret Louise Gross, \ndied last year. Anyone who has been close to a military life theirs \nknows that it has to be a joint enterprise, in which both husband and \nwife share the sacrifices, the uncertainties, and the satisfaction of a \njob heroically done.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to offer one last salute \nto Roy Johnson, a patriot from the beginning, a patriot to the last. As \nwe extend our condolences to all his family--especial his daughter, Jo-\nAnne Lee Coe, our former Secretary of the Senate--we know they share \nour pride and our appreciation for all that Admiral Johnson did, and \ngave, to the country he loved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3433-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE SENATE SAYS GOODBYE\n\n\n                     helen c. scott (4/1/85-4/1/99)\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The organization fosters an enduring civic \nawareness by placing students in internships and by holding academic \nseminars that introduce students to the exciting culture and history of \nour nation's capital. In addition to helping students experience the \nextraordinary educational opportunities that exist in the District of \nColumbia, The Center has made an invaluable contribution to public \nservice by helping those of us in Congress to identify talented and \nenergetic young men and women to assist in our work on behalf of the \nAmerican public.\n  I know that many of my colleagues share my deep appreciation for this \nextraordinary achievement, and join me in commending The Center for its \npioneering efforts over the last quarter century to promote \nparticipatory learning in the nation's capitol. On this, The Center's \n25th anniversary, it deserves the recognition and thanks of all of us \nwho work in our nation's capitol and who have benefitted from The \nCenter's important work.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I wish the Washington Center continued \nsuccess in fulfilling its vital mission to enhance the lives and \nlearning of our nation's college students. This Center's work has \nimmeasurably enriched the lives of students and the lives of those who \nhave been fortunate enough to work with them, and I know it will \ncontinue to do so for many years to come.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Wyoming; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       Whereas, the U.S. Constitution requires an actual \n     enumeration of the population every ten years, and entrusts \n     Congress with overseeing all aspects of each decennial \n     enumeration;\n       Whereas, the sole constitutional purpose of the decennial \n     census is to apportion the seats in Congress among the \n     several states;\n       Whereas, an accurate and legal decennial census is \n     necessary to properly apportion U.S. House of Representatives \n     seats among the 50 states and to create legislative districts \n     within the states;\n       Whereas, an accurate and legal decennial census is \n     necessary to enable states to comply with the constitutional \n     mandate of drawing state legislative districts within the \n     states;\n       Whereas, Article 1, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, in \n     order to ensure an accurate count, and to minimize the \n     potential for political manipulation, mandates an ``actual \n     enumeration'' of the population, which requires a physical \n     headcount of the population and prohibits statistical \n     guessing or estimates of the population;\n       Whereas, Title 13, Section 195 of the U.S. Code, consistent \n     with this constitutional mandate, expressly prohibits the use \n     of statistical sampling to enumerate the U.S. population for \n     the purpose of reapportioning the U.S. House of \n     Representatives;\n       Whereas, legislative redistricting conducted by the states \n     is a critical subfunction of the constitutional requirement \n     to apportion representatives among the states;\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court, in No. 98-404, \n     Department of Commerce, et al. v. United States House of \n     Representatives, et al., together with No. 98-564, Clinton, \n     President of the United States, et al. v. Glavin, et al. \n     ruled on January 25, 1999 that the Census Act prohibits the \n     Census Bureau's proposed uses of statistical sampling in \n     calculating the population for purposes of apportionment;\n       Whereas, in reaching its findings, the United States \n     Supreme Court found that the use of statistical procedures to \n     adjust census numbers would create a dilution of voting \n     rights for citizens in legislative redistricting, thus \n     violating legal guarantees of `one-person, one-vote;'\n       Whereas, consistent with this ruling and the constitutional \n     and legal relationship of legislative redistricting by the \n     states to the apportionment of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the use of adjusted census data would raise \n     serious questions of vote dilution and violate `one-person, \n     one-vote' legal protections, thus exposing the State of \n     Wyoming to protracted litigation over legislative \n     redistricting plans at great cost to the taxpayers of the \n     State of Wyoming, and likely result in a court ruling \n     invalidating any legislative redistricting plan using census \n     numbers that have been determined in whole or in part by the \n     use of random sampling techniques or other statistical \n     methodologies that add or subtract persons to the census \n     counts based solely on statistical inference;\n       Whereas, consistent with this ruling, no person enumerated \n     in the census should ever be deleted from the census \n     enumeration;\n       Whereas, consistent with this ruling, every reasonable and \n     practical effort should be made to obtain the fullest and \n     most accurate count of the population as possible, including \n     appropriate funding for state and local census outreach and \n     education programs; as well as a provision for post census \n     local review; Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Wyoming State Legislature calls on the \n     Bureau of the Census to conduct the 2000 decennial census \n     consistent with the aforementioned United States Supreme \n     Court ruling and constitutional mandate, which require a \n     physical headcount of the population and bars the use of \n     statistical sampling to create, or in any way adjust the \n     count; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Wyoming State Legislature opposes the \n     use of P.L. 94-171 data for state legislative redistricting \n     based on census numbers that have been determined in whole or \n     in part by the use of statistical inferences derived by means \n     of random sampling techniques or other statistical \n     methodologies that add or subtract persons to the census \n     counts; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Wyoming State Legislature demands that \n     it receive P.L. 94-171 data for legislative redistricting \n     identical to the census tabulation data used to apportion \n     seats in the U.S. House of Representatives consistent to the \n     aforementioned United States Supreme Court ruling and \n     constitutional mandates, which requires a physical headcount \n     of the population and bars the use of statistical sampling to \n     create, or in any way adjust the count; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Wyoming State Legislature urges \n     Congress, as the branch of government assigned the \n     responsibility of overseeing the decennial enumeration, to \n     take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the 2000 \n     decennial census is conducted fairly and legally; and be it \n     further.\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Majority \n     Leader of the U.S. Senate, Vice President and the President \n     of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-25. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada; to the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, Few environmental challenges have proven more \n     daunting than the problems posed by high-level nuclear waste; \n     and\n       Whereas, The proposed Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999 is a \n     disastrous response to these problems and if enacted would \n     attack state authority, create massive taxpayer liabilities \n     and unwisely require an ``interim'' storage facility for \n     high-level nuclear waste which would directly threaten the \n     environment; and\n       Whereas, By requiring construction of an ``interim'' \n     storage facility at the Nevada Test Site, the proposed \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999 would require the \n     unprecedented shipment of high-level nuclear waste through 43 \n     states endangering the lives of fifty million American \n     citizens who live within one-half mile of the proposed \n     transportation routes; and\n       Whereas, Although there is the expectation that high-level \n     waste at reactors will eventually have to be moved, the \n     provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999 exacerbate \n     the risk of this dangerous activity; and\n       Whereas, Despite the serious flaws with the proposed Yucca \n     Mountain site, studies are being conducted to determine \n     whether the site is capable of hosting a permanent repository \n     for high-level nuclear waste, but if enacted, the Nuclear \n     Waste Policy Act of 1999 would prejudice those studies by \n     explicitly revoking federal regulations that establish \n     guidelines for determining the suitability of the site; and\n       Whereas, Upon the revocation of such regulations, \n     requirements for establishing the characteristics of the \n     site, such as the time it takes for water to travel and \n     climactic stability, would be eliminated, thereby undermining \n     the integrity of any determination regarding the suitability \n     of the site for the storage of high-level nuclear waste; and\n       Whereas, A major cause for concern in designating the \n     Nevada Test Site as the ``interim'' storage facility is the \n     high seismic activity that has been taking place in the area, \n     including seven earthquakes just last month at 3.0 or greater \n     with three jolts recorded at a magnitude of between 4.3 \n     and 4.7 that struck at the eastern edge of the site; and\n       Whereas, Geologists have expressed concern over this \n     seismic activity stating that these recent earthquakes are \n     part of a swarm of tremors that have occurred along the Rock \n     Valley Fault zone, including a 5.8 magnitude quake on June \n     29, 1992, at Little Skull Mountain, which knocked out \n     windows, cracked walls and brought down ceiling panels at a \n     fields operations center approximately 12 miles from the site \n     of the proposed repository; and\n       Whereas, Federal law directs the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to enact regulations to protect the environment from \n     repository radiation releases, but the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act of 1999 prohibits all efforts of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to carry out this responsibility; and\n       Whereas, The reality is that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     of 1999 would create a single performance standard that would \n     allow annual radiation exposures of up to 100 millirems to an \n     average member of the surrounding population, a level four \n     times the amount allowed by regulation for storage \n     facilities; and\n       Whereas, The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999 contains \n     broad preemptions for environmental legislation including a \n     provision stating that any state or local law that is \n     ``inconsistent'' with the requirements of the proposed Act is \n     preempted; and\n       Whereas, This proposed Act does not allow the Environmental \n     Impact Statement to question the size, need or timing of any \n     ``interim'' storage facility nor does it allow any questions \n     relating to alternative locations or design criteria; and\n       Whereas, The proposed ``interim'' storage facility site \n     will have a capacity of 40,000 MTUs which is sufficient space \n     to store all of today's commercial nuclear waste and the \n     license is to be a 100-year renewable license which suggests \n     that this proposed ``interim'' storage facility is expected \n     to become permanent; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     (jointly), That the members of the 70th session of the Nevada \n     Legislature\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\n     do hereby urge the Congress of the United States not to enact \n     the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999, H.R. 45; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that the Nevada Legislature is opposed to any \n     further consideration of the use of the Nevada Test Site as a \n     national site for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, that this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n       POM-26. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas \n     Islands; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      House Resolution No. 11-126\n\n       Whereas, the Covenant to establish the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands (Commonwealth) in political union \n     with the United States of America was entered into for two \n     reasons: first, to secure and maintain the national security \n     and defense of the United States in the Pacific rim and far \n     east Asia; and second, to secure among the people of the \n     Commonwealth the right to self-government with respect to \n     their own internal affairs; and\n       Whereas, the people of the Commonwealth gave up their \n     precious political sovereignty and some control over their \n     lands, sea and air in order to secure and maintain the \n     national security and defense of the United States; and\n       Whereas, in exchange for what the people of the \n     Commonwealth gave up for the benefit of the United States \n     under the Covenant, the United States agreed to extend to the \n     Commonwealth financial assistance; agreed to assist the \n     Commonwealth in developing its economic resources; agreed to \n     protect the small population of the Commonwealth from being \n     overwhelmed by permanent immigrants from the nearby Asian \n     countries; and extended third class US citizenship to the \n     people of the Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, first class US citizens are those who have \n     representatives and senators in Congress and vote for the \n     President; second class citizens are those who have only non-\n     voting delegates to Congress: and third class citizens are \n     those who have no representative,  no senator, no vote for \n     the president and have no voice at all in their democratic \n     government, the United States of America; and\n       Whereas, the economic goal of the Commonwealth as \n     envisioned in the Covenant was to reduce its requirement for \n     financial assistance from the United States and to become \n     self-reliant; and\n       Whereas, in order to facilitate economic development in the \n     Commonwealth, and at the same time maintain political control \n     among the Commonwealth people, the United States left to the \n     Commonwealth complete control over immigration and minimum \n     age, and exempted the Commonwealth from the U.S. import \n     duties; and\n       Whereas, as a direct result of these economic incentives, \n     the local control of immigration and minimum wage, and the \n     waiver of import duties, the Commonwealth's annual gross \n     product ballooned from a mere few million dollars in 1978 \n     when the Commonwealth Government came into being to over one \n     billion dollars in 1997, making her the envy of other \n     colonies and independent states in the region; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth imports U.S. products to the tune \n     of one billion dollars per year; and\n       Whereas, the success story of the Commonwealth's economy, \n     concentrated in the industries of tourism and garment \n     manufacturing, is the result of innovative provisions in the \n     Covenant, the effectiveness of which the United States and \n     the Commonwealth should be proud of; and\n       Whereas, the economic boom in the Commonwealth resulted in \n     the importation of a large number of temporary non-immigrant \n     workers, as envisioned in the Covenant, to supplement its \n     small pool of local manpower; and\n       Whereas, it has been the experience of developed and \n     developing countries, including the United States, that any \n     rapid social and demographic changes which naturally breed \n     social and political problems; and\n       Whereas, in the case of the Commonwealth, the success of \n     the garment industry is claimed by the Office of Insular \n     Affairs to have adversely affected the textile industry in \n     the United States, causing some first class U.S. citizens to \n     lose their jobs, and the United States Government to lose \n     about $200,000,000,00 in waived import duties; and\n       Whereas, the Office of Insular Affairs, insinuating \n     arrogantly that the third class US citizens of the \n     Commonwealth should not and cannot improve their economic \n     status at the expense of secured jobs for the first class US \n     citizens in the United States, has embarked on a vicious \n     campaign to destroy the garment industry in the Commonwealth \n     by persuading the US Congress to take away control of \n     immigration and minimum wage and end the waiver of import \n     duties with respect to garment; and\n       Whereas, as part of this campaign, the Office of Insular \n     Affairs has submitted annual reports to Congress and in these \n     reports attempts to paint a deceptive picture of these \n     paradise islands as being evil, governed by abusive people, \n     controlled by alien tycoons, and has exaggerated the social \n     problems associated with the recent economic boom; and\n       Whereas, this legislature denounces the most recent report \n     to Congress which purposely ignores major reform programs, \n     legislative actions, improved enforcement,and the immense \n     progress made in solving the consequential social problems \n     associated with the recent economic boom, and instead, \n     repeated old and inaccurate facts; and\n       Whereas, some members of the US Congress have complimented \n     the Commonwealth for its economic miracle and for showcasing \n     what free-enterprise and democracy, working hand in hand, \n     could accomplish; and others have stated that the social \n     problems resulting from the economic boom are local problems \n     deserving local solutions; now, therefore\n       Be it resolved, by the House of Representatives, Eleventh \n     Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature, that the Office \n     of Insular Affairs is urged to be honest and sincere in its \n     presentation of the facts about the Commonwealth to Congress \n     and the news media; and\n       Be it further resolved That the Office of Insular Affairs \n     acknowledge the tremendous benefit that the United States has \n     received from the people of the Commonwealth through the \n     Covenant and to show some appreciation for such gain; and\n       Be it further resolved That the US Congress is hereby \n     requested to continue allowing the Commonwealth to work on \n     its internal problems and to not take away control of \n     immigration, but to uphold the intent and integrity of the \n     Covenant; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the Speaker of the House shall \n     certify and the House Clerk shall attest to the adoption of \n     this resolution and thereafter transmit copies to Office of \n     Insular Affairs, President of the United States, Speaker of \n     the House of the US Congress, President of the US Senate, the \n     president and governor's representatives to the 902 talks, \n     the Honorable Pedro P.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na charitable deduction for certain expenses incurred in support of \nNative Alaskan subsistence whaling; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             native alaskan subsistence whaling act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nStevens to introduce legislation that would resolve a dispute that has \nexisted for several years between the IRS and native whaling captains \nin my state. Our legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to \nensure that a charitable donation tax deduction would be allowed for \nnative whaling captains who organize and support subsistence whaling \nactivities in their communities.\n  Substence whaling is a necessity to the Alaska Native community. In \nmany of our remote village communities, the whale hunt is a tradition \nthat has been carried on for generations over many millennia. It is the \ncustom that the captain of the hunt make all provisions for the meals, \nwages and equipment costs associated with this important activity.\n  In most instances, the Captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuck, \nwhich is blubber and skin. However, as part of the tradition, the \nCaptain is required to donate a substantial portion of the whale to his \nvillage in order to help the community survive.\n  The proposed deduction would allow the Captain to deduct up to $7,500 \nto help defray the costs associated with providing this community \nservice.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that if the Captain incurred all \nof these expenses and then donated the whale meat to a local charitable \norganization, the Captain would almost certainly be able to deduct the \ncosts he incurred in outfitting the boat for the charitable purpose. \nHowever, the cultural significance of the Captain's sharing the whale \nwith the community would be lost.\n  This is a very modest effort to allow the Congress to recognize the \nimportance of this part of our Native Alaskan tradition. When this \nmeasure passed the senate two years ago, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimated that this provision would cost a mere three million \ndollars over a 10 year period. I think that is a very small price for \npreserving this vital link with our natives' heritage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to maintain \nexemption of Alaska from dyeing requirements for exempt diesel fuel and \nkerosene; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   DIESEL DYEING EXEMPTION FOR ALASKA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Ted \nStevens in introducing legislation that would clarify a provision in \nthe tax code that exempts the State of Alaska from the IRS diesel \ndyeing rules.\n  The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 included a provision \nthat exempted Alaska from the diesel dyeing requirements during the \nperiod the state was exempted from the Clean Air Act low sulfur diesel \ndyeing rules. For various reasons, it was believed at the time that \nAlaska would ultimately be permanently exempted from the Clean Air Act \nrules. However, technological changes suggest that Alaska may in the \nnext few years lose its exemption from the low sulfur rules.\n  However, in our view, whether Alaska is exempted from the low sulfur \nrules, it is imperative that Alaska be permanently exempted from the \nIRS diesel dyeing rules. That is what our bill does.\n  Today, more than 95 percent of all diesel fuel used in Alaska is \nexempt from tax because it is used for heating, power generation, or in \ncommercial fishing boats. Under the diesel dyeing rules in place in 49 \nstates, exempt diesel must be dyed. If these diesel dyeing rules were \napplied to Alaska, refiners would have to buy huge quantities of dye, \nalong with expensive injection systems, to dye all of this non-taxable \ndiesel fuel.\n  Although the Joint Tax Committee originally estimated in 1996 that \nrepealing the dyeing rules for Alaska could cost the Treasury $500,000 \na year, some refiners were spending as much as $750,000 on dye alone. \nAdd on another $100,000 for injection systems and you begin to wonder \nwhat happened to common sense regulation. Congress saw it that way and \ndecided to exempt Alaska. Now that exemption should be made permanent.\n  Approximately 65 percent of the state's communities are served solely \nby barges. For many of these communities, the fuel oil barge comes in \nonly once a year when the waterways are not frozen. It is absurd to \nrequire these communities to build a second storage facility for undyed \ntaxable fuel simply for the few vehicles in town that are subject to \ntax.\n  It is currently projected that the state will have to spend from $200 \nmillion to $400 million just to repair fuel storage tanks in hundreds \nof rural communities because of leaking fuel problems. If IRS dyeing \nrules were in place, millions more would have to be spent simply to \nmaintain a small supply of taxable diesel in each of these communities.\n  Mr. President, in 1996, Congress acted sensibly in exempting Alaska \nfrom the IRS diesel dyeing rules. It is my hope that we will again see \nthe wisdom of exempting Alaska, this time making it a permanent \nexemption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n       (a) Exception to Dyeing Requirements for Exempt Diesel Fuel \n     and Kerosene.--Paragraph (1) of section 4082(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exception to \n     dyeing requirements is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) removed, entered, or sold in the State of Alaska for \n     ultimate sale or use in such State, and''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     applies with respect to fuel removed, entered, or sold on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Wyden and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 715. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a \nportion of the Columbia River as a recreational river, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            HANFORD REACH WILD AND SCENIC RIVER LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River as a Wild and Scenic \nRiver. Simply stated, this is the best, most cost-effective, and \nsmartest way to protect the Northwest's dwindling wild salmon runs.\n  The Hanford Reach is an extraordinary and unique place.\n  While most of the Columbia River Basin was being developed during the \nmiddle of this century, the Hanford Reach and other buffer areas within \nthe Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine, ironically, by the \nsame veil of secrecy and security that lead to the notorious nuclear \nand chemical contamination of the central Hanford Site. Today, these \nrelatively undisturbed areas are the last wild remnants of a great \nriver and vast ecological community that have been tamed by dams, \nfarms, and other development elsewhere.\n  As the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, the \nsignificance of the Hanford Reach cannot be overstated. Mile for mile, \nit contains some of the most productive and important fish spawning \nhabitat in the lower 48 states. The volume and velocity of the cool, \nclear waters of the Columbia River produce ideal conditions for \nspawning and migrating salmon. The Reach produces eighty percent of the \nColumbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as thriving runs of \nsteelhead trout and sturgeon. It is the only truly healthy segment of \nthe mainstem of the Columbia River.\n  The Reach is also rich in other natural and cultural resources. Bald \neagles, wintering and migrating waterfowl, deer, elk, and a diversity \nof other wildlife depend on the Reach. It is home to dozens of rare, \nthreatened, and endangered plants and animals, some found only in the \nReach. Native American culture thrived on the shores and islands of the \nReach for millennia, and there are over 150 archeological sites in the \nproposed designation, some dating back more than 10,000 years. The \nReach's naturally spawning salmon and cultural sites remain a vital \npart of the culture and religion of Native American groups in the area.\n  It is remarkable that the Reach offers so much in such close \nproximity to the cities of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, Washington. \nThe Reach offers residents and visitors recreation of many types--from \nhunting, fishing, and hiking to kayaking, waterskiing, and \nbirdwatching--and adds greatly to the quality of life and economy of \nthe area.\n  Back in 1994, only the locals in and around the Tri-Cities had heard \nabout the last-free flowing stretch of the mighty Columbia River. \nSeveral residents had been working more than\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\nthirty years to save the Reach and they got me involved to do the same. \nThey showed me what a precious resource the Hanford Reach is, and I \npromised to do everything in my power to protect it.\n  I convened a Hanford Reach Advisory Panel to develop a consensus plan \nto protect the river corridor. Their work has been the basis of the \nbills I have introduced in the past and that I am introducing today, \nand builds on the foundation begun by Senators Dan Evans and Brock \nAdams, and Congressman Sid Morrison who enacted legislation imposing a \nmoratorium on development within the river corridor in 1987.\n  I am confident this is the year we will finally achieve our goals and \ncreate a new Wild and Scenic River. We cannot wait any longer to save \nthe Reach. Since the recent listing of the Puget Sound chinook, \neveryone across the Northwest is focused on what we all must do to save \nour wild salmon.\n  Designating the Hanford Reach as a Wild and Scenic River is the \nsimplest and most effective way to provide real, permanent protection \nfor our wild salmon stocks. Only under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act \nwill we get the expertise, resources and permanency that federal \nmanagement agencies, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, provide. \nThe Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is recognized as the best way to protect \nendangered rivers across the nation. The Reach deserves no less than \nthe best.\n  And this designation will not cost a penny. The land surrounding the \nriver is already publicly held. The Department of Energy owns land on \nboth sides of the river, so no private lands will be acquired or taken \nout of production to save this special place.\n  In addition to public ownership, this section of the river is in \nsuperb ecological condition. It offers the best salmon spawning grounds \non the mainstem of the Columbia. It will not require the millions of \ndollars for remediation that we've spent on other rivers and streams \nacross the country. All the Hanford Reach requires is our protection, \nand it will continue to produce salmon runs unsurpassed anyplace in the \nregion.\n  Creating a Wild and Scenic River will help us avoid drastic measures \nlike breaching the dams along the Columbia and Snake River systems to \nrestore salmon. The recent Endangered Species Act listing of nine more \nnorthwest salmon runs as threatened, is another indication that we must \ntake immediate action. Protecting the Reach is an insurance policy \nagainst the future possibility of expensive clean-up efforts and \nlawsuits. We must make this investment now to demonstrate we're serious \nabout protecting not only wild salmon, but also the economic and social \nstructure in the inland West.\n  This bill differs from my previous legislation in some important \nways. Not only does it create a federally-designated recreational Wild \nand Scenic River, it also establishes an innovative management approach \nthrough the creation of a multi-party commission. The management \ncommission will develop a plan to guide the US Fish and Wildlife \nService and will be comprised of three federal representatives from the \nDepartments of Energy, Interior, and Commerce (National Marine \nFisheries Service); three Washington state representatives from the \nDepartments of Fish and Wildlife, Ecology, and Community, Trade and \nEconomic Development; three representatives of local government from \nthe counties of Benton, Grant, and Franklin; three tribal \nrepresentatives from the Yakama, Umatilla, and Nez Perce peoples; and \nthree local citizen representatives from conservation, recreation, and \nbusiness interests.\n  This bill also takes us a step closer to consolidating lands on the \nHanford reservation itself in order to facilitate economic development, \npreservation of sacred tribal sites, and protection of important \nbiological resources. It requires the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \nand the Department of Energy to examine the best ways to consolidate \nBLM lands on the south side of the river on the Hanford site. It \nestablishes the objectives of the study to clear title to lands along \nthe railroad and in the 200 Area for industrial development; to protect \nwildlife and native plants; and to preserve cultural sites important to \nNative Americans.\n  This bill does not address the critical and sensitive lands of the \nNorth Slope (also known as the Wahluke Slope) because the land is still \nneeded by the Department of Energy for safety reasons. However, I hope \nto work through the administrative process to ensure these lands are \nnot disturbed in any way that could possibly impact the healthy salmon \nspawning grounds below the White Bluffs. I remain committed to \nenlarging the existing Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge \nbecause, again, I am convinced we must provide the strongest, surest \nprotection for the North Slope to offer our wild salmon their best hope \nfor survival.\n  At a time when the Pacific Northwest is spending hundreds of millions \nof dollars annually on restoration and enhancement efforts, and \nstruggling to restore declining salmon runs, protecting the Hanford \nReach is the most cost-effective measure we can take. That is why the \nNorthwest Power Planning Council, Trout Unlimited, conservation groups, \ntribes, and many other regional interests involved in the salmon \ncontroversy all support designation of the Reach under the National \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n  These are some of the many good reasons for this Congress to take up \nand pass this legislation to ensure the Hanford Reach becomes a part of \nthe National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. I urge the other members of \nCongress to join us in demanding the permanent protection of this \nriver. It has given us so very much. The least we can do for the \nColumbia River is to protect the last fifty-one miles of free-flowing \nwaters and the wild salmon that call it home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 716. A bill to provide for the prevention of juvenile crime, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            the 21st century safe and sound communities act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a proposal for reducing \njuvenile crime -- the ``21st Century Safe and Sound Communities Act.'' \nIn the past few years, we have begun to make real advances in fighting \nyouth violence; in fact, in cities across the country, juvenile crime \nhas started to fall. For example, in three ``Weed & Seed'' \nneighborhoods in Milwaukee, violent felonies dropped 47 percent, gun \ncrimes fell 46 percent, and crime overall was down 21 percent. And \nafter Boston implemented a citywide anti-crime plan, the number of \njuveniles murdered declined 80 percent, and in more than two years not \na single child was killed by a gun. Not one child. Through a program \ncalled ``Safe and Sound,'' I have already worked hard with other public \nofficials and business leaders to expand Milwaukee's success citywide. \nNow we need to build on what works, in order to protect our children \nand to make as many of our communities across the nation ``safe and \nsound.'' This measure will be an important step in the right direction.\n  We do not have to reinvent the wheel to reduce juvenile crime. The \nlesson from Milwaukee, Boston and other cities is clear. There is no \nsingle magic solution, but a number of steps, taken together, can and \nwill make a difference: put dangerous criminals behind bars; keep guns \nout of the hands of juveniles; and create after-school alternatives to \ngangs and drugs. That's what works, and that's what this proposal is \nall about. It builds on each of these three basic strategies and \nexpands them to more cities and more rural communities across the \nnation. Let me explain.\n  First, we can't even begin to stop violent kids unless we have police \nofficers on the street to catch them, and state and local prosecutors \nto try them. So this proposal makes it easier to lock up dangerous \njuveniles by extending the highly successful COPS program, which is due \nto expire after next year, through the year 2004. That will allow us to \nhire at least 50,000 new community police officers. And it provides \n$100 million per year for state and local prosecutors to go after \njuvenile criminals.\n  Of course, we can't keep criminals off the streets unless we have a \nplace to send them. Unfortunately, although we provide states with \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year to build new prisons, most \nstates use all of these\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\nfunds for adult prisons only. So this measure requires states to set \naside 10 percent of federal prison funding to juvenile prisons or \nalternative placements of delinquent children. This commitment is \nconsistent with dedicated funding for juvenile facilities in the \nSenate-passed 1994 crime bill, which set the stage for spending \nbillions of dollars on prisons through the 1994 Crime Act.\n  This proposal also helps rural communities keep dangerous kids behind \nbars. Now, although the closest juvenile facility may be hundreds of \nmiles away, federal law prohibits rural police from locking up violent \njuveniles in adult jails for more than 24 hours. This means that state \nlaw enforcement officials either have to waste the time and resources \nto criss-cross the state even for initial court appearances, or simply \nlet dangerous teens go free. In my view, that's a no-win situation. \nThis measure gives rural police the flexibility they need by letting \nthem detain juveniles in adult jails for up to 72 hours, provided they \nare separated from adult criminals.\n  Moreover, this measure will help lock up gun-toting kids--and the \npeople who illegally supply them with weapons. It builds on my 1994 \nYouth Handgun Safety Act by turning illegal possession of a handgun by \na minor into a felony. And the same goes for anyone who illegally sells \nhandguns to kids. Kids and handguns don't mix, and our Federal law \nneeds to make clear that this is a serious crime.\n\n  And this measure makes it easier to identify the violent juveniles \nwho need to be dealt with more severely--by strongly encouraging states \nto share the records of violent juvenile offenders and providing the \nfunding necessary for improved record-keeping. The fact is that law \nenforcement officials need full disclosure in order to make informed \njudgments about who should be incarcerated, but current law allows too \nmany records to be concealed or to vanish without a trace when a teen \nfelon turns 18.\n  Second, this proposal will help keep firearms out of the hands of \nyoung people. It promotes gun safety by requiring the sale of child \nsafety locks with every new handgun. Child safety locks can help save \nmany of the 500 children and teenagers killed each year in firearms \naccidents, and the 1,500 kids each year who use guns to commit suicide. \nJust as importantly, they can help prevent some of the 7,000 violent \njuvenile crimes committed every year with guns children took from their \nown homes.\n  It also helps identify who is supplying kids with guns, so we can put \nthem out of business and behind bars. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms has been working closely with cities like Milwaukee and \nBoston to trace guns used by young people back to the source. Using \nATF's national database, police and prosecutors can target illegal \nsuppliers of firearms and help stop the flow of firearms into our \ncommunities. This measure will expand the program to other cities and, \nwith the increased penalties outlined above, help cut down illegal gun \ntrafficking.\n  In addition, it closes an inexcusable loophole that allows violent \nyoung offenders to buy guns legally when they turn 18. Under current \nlaw, violent adult offenders can't buy firearms, but violent juveniles \ncan--even the kids convicted of the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, \nArkansas--at least once they are released at age 18. This has to stop. \nSo this measure declares that all violent felons are disqualified from \nbuying firearms, regardless of whether they were 10, 12, 14 or just a \nday short of their 18th birthday at the time of their offense.\n  And not only will this proposal prohibit all violent criminals from \nowning firearms, no matter what their age, it also encourages \naggressive enforcement of this federal law by dedicating federal \nprosecutors and investigators to this task. This builds on a successful \nprogram, supported by the NRA, that has helped reduce gun violence in \nRichmond through increased federal prosecution, public outreach and \nfewer plea bargains.\n  Third, a balanced approach also requires a significant investment in \ncrime prevention, so we can stop crime before it's too late. In fact, \nno one is more adamant in support of this approach than our nation's \nlaw enforcement officials. For example, last year more than 400 police \nchiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors nationwide endorsed a call for after-\nschool programs for all children. And in my home state of Wisconsin, 90 \npercent of police chiefs and sheriffs I surveyed agreed that we need to \nincrease federal prevention spending.\n  This proposal promotes prevention by concentrating funding in \nprograms that already have a record of success, like Weed & Seed, and \nthose that rely on proven strategies, like the ones that give children \na safe place to go in the after-school hours between 3 and 8 p.m., when \njuvenile crime peaks.\n  For example, it expands the Weed & Seed program, a Republican program \nwhich combines aggressive enforcement and safe havens for at-risk kids. \nThe measure also gives more schools the resources necessary to stay \nopen after school, through expansion of the 21st Century Learning \nCenter program. It promotes innovative prevention initiatives by \nreauthorizing and expanding the Title V At-Risk Children Challenge \nGrant program, which I authored, which encourages investment, \ncollaboration, and long-range prevention planning by local communities, \nwho must establish locally tailored prevention programs and contribute \nat least 50 cents for every federal dollar. It builds on our support \nfor the valuable work of Boys & Girls Clubs, by continuing to dedicate \nfunding to the Clubs and expanding funding to other successful \norganizations like the YMCA. And it requires that at least 20 percent \nof the new juvenile crime funds--namely the recently-appropriated $500 \nmillion juvenile accountability block grant--be dedicated to \nprevention.\n\n  Of course, we shouldn't blindly invest in prevention programs, just \nbecause they sound good. Quality, not quantity, matters. And it would \nbe foolish to throw good money after bad. That's why my measure cuts \nnearly $1 billion in prevention programs authorized by the Crime Act--\nso we don't waste money on redundant programs which don't have records \nof success or bipartisan support. And that's why my measure requires 5 \nto 10 percent of all prevention funds to be set aside for rigorous \nevaluations--so we can keep funding the programs that work, and \neliminate the programs that don't. We also reward cities that adopt \ncomprehensive anti-juvenile crime strategies, like Milwaukee's and \nBoston's--so prevention is part of a balanced, coordinated overall \nplan.\n  Mr. President, the question about how to reduce juvenile crime is no \nlonger a mystery. We have a good idea about what works. The real \nquestion is this: Will we act to make our communities safer and sounder \nplaces to live and to prevent teen crime before it happens? I have \nfaith that we will, and I believe this measure moves us forward. I ask \nunanimous consent that a summary of this proposal be printed for the \nRecord. There being no objection, the summary was ordered printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Summary of the 21st Century Safe and Sound Communities Act\n\n       Title I: Increased Placement of Juveniles in Appropriate \n     Correctional Facilities\n       States must dedicate 10 percent of all prison funding from \n     the 1994 Crime Act to juvenile facilities or alternative \n     placements for delinquent juveniles. Expands ability to \n     detain juveniles temporarily in rural adult jails by \n     permitting detention for up to 72 hours and ending \n     requirement of separate staff to oversee juveniles and \n     adults.\n       Title II: Reducing Youth Access to Firearms\n       Limits access of juveniles and juvenile offenders to \n     firearms. Requires the sale of child safety locks with all \n     handguns. Expands Department of the Treasury's youth crime \n     gun tracing program to identify more illegal gun traffickers \n     who are supplying guns to children. Increases jail time for \n     individuals who transfer handguns to juveniles and for \n     juveniles who illegally possess handguns. Prohibits the sale \n     of firearms to violent juvenile offenders after they become \n     18 years old. Increases enforcement of federal laws to \n     prohibit illegal possession of firearms by violent criminals, \n     including violent juvenile offenders.\n       Title III: Consolidation of Prevention Programs\n       Repeals nearly $1 billion in authorized prevention programs \n     from the 1994 Crime Act. Expands Weed & Seed to $200 million \n     per year (from $33.5 million in 1999), the Title V At-Risk \n     Children Challenge Grants to $200 million per year (from $55 \n     million), and the 21st Century Learning Centers to $600 \n     million per year (from $200 million), and extends Boys \n     & Girls Club funding for five more\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\n     years, increasing funding to $100 million per year (from \n     $40 million) and expanding the program to support other \n     successful community organizations like the YMCA. \n     Consolidates several gang prevention programs into one $25 \n     million program. Rewards cities that adopt a comprehensive \n     anti-juvenile crime strategy based on the Boston model. \n     Sets aside 5 to 10 percent of prevention funding for \n     evaluation, implementing the proposal of the DOJ-sponsored \n     University of Maryland report.\n       Title IV: Juvenile Crime Control and Accountability Block \n     Grant\n       Promotes funding for prosecutors, improved-record keeping, \n     juvenile prisons, and prevention through $500 million block \n     grant. Qualifying states must trace all firearms recovered \n     from individuals under age 21 to identify illegal firearm \n     traffickers, and must share criminal records of all juvenile \n     violent offenders with other jurisdictions. $100 million of \n     this grant program must be dedicated to both prevention and \n     to hiring more prosecutors.\n       Title V: Extension of COPS and Juvenile Justice programs\n       Extends program to hire new community police officers. \n     Reauthorizes Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention.\n       Title VI: Extension of Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund\n       Extends trust fund established by 1994 Crime Act to pay for \n     anti-crime programs with savings from reduction of federal \n     workforce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 717. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that the reductions in social security benefits which are \nrequired in the case of spouses and surviving spouses who are also \nreceiving certain Government pensions shall be equal to the amount by \nwhich two-thirds of the total amount of the combined monthly benefit \n(before reduction) and monthly pension exceeds $1,200, adjusted for \ninflation; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Government Pension Offset Reform Act\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to \nmodify a harsh and heartless rule of government that is unfair and \nprevents current workers from enjoying the benefits of their hard work \nin their retirement. This legislation is very important to me, very \nimportant to my constituents in Maryland, and very important to \ngovernment workers and retirees across the nation. I want the middle \nclass of this Nation to know that if you worked hard to become middle \nclass you should stay middle class when you retire.\n  Under current law, there is something called the Pension Offset law. \nThis is a harsh and unfair policy. Let me tell you why.\n  If you are a retired government worker, and you qualify for a spousal \nSocial Security benefit based on your spouse's employment record, you \nmay not receive what you qualify for. Because the Pension Offset law \nreduces or entirely eliminates a Social Security spousal benefit when \nthe surviving spouse is eligible for a pension from a local, state or \nfederal government job that was not covered by Social Security.\n  This policy only applies to government workers, not private sector \nworkers. Let me give you an example of two women, Helen and her sister \nPhyllis.\n  Helen is a retired Social Security benefits counselor who lives in \nWoodlawn, Maryland. Helen currently earns $600 a month from her federal \ngovernment pension. She's also entitled to a $645 a month spousal \nbenefit from Social Security based on her deceased husband's hard work \nas an auto mechanic. That's a combined monthly benefit of $1,245.\n  Phyllis is a retired bank teller also in Woodlawn, Maryland. She \ncurrently earns a pension of $600 a month from the bank. Like Helen, \nPhyllis is also entitled to a $645 a month spousal benefit from Social \nSecurity based on her husband's employment. He was an auto-mechanic, \ntoo. In fact, he worked at the same shop as Helen's husband.\n  So, Phyllis is entitled to a total of $1,245 a month, the same as \nHelen. But, because of the Pension Offset law, Helen's spousal benefit \nis reduced by \\2/3\\ of her government pension, or $400. So instead of \n$1,245 per month, she will only receive $845 per month.\n  This reduction in benefits only happens to Helen because she worked \nfor the government. Phyllis will receive her full benefits because her \npension is a private sector pension. I don't think that's right, and \nthat's why I'm introducing this legislation.\n\n  The crucial thing about the Mikulski Modification is that it \nguarantees a minimum benefit of $1,200. So, with the Mikulski \nModification to the Pension Offset, Helen is guaranteed at least $1,200 \nper month.\n  Let me tell you how it works. Helen's spousal benefit will be reduced \nonly by 2/3 of the amount her combined monthly benefit exceeds $1,200. \nIn her case, the amount of the offset would be 2/3 of $45, or $30. \nThat's a big difference from $400, and I think people like our federal \nworkers, teachers and our firefighters deserve that big difference.\n  Why should earning a government pension penalize the surviving \nspouse? If a deceased spouse had a job covered by Social Security and \npaid into the Social Security system, that spouse expected his earned \nSocial Security benefits would be there for his surviving spouse.\n  Most working men believe this and many working women are counting on \ntheir spousal benefits. But because of this harsh and heartless policy, \nthe spousal benefits will not be there, your spouse will not benefit \nfrom your hard work, and, chances are, you won't find out about it \nuntil your loved one is gone and you really need the money.\n  The Mikulski modification guarantees that the spouse will at least \nreceive $1,200 in combined benefits. That Helen will receive the same \namount as Phyllis.\n  I'm introducing this legislation, because these survivors deserve \nbetter than the reduced monthly benefits that the Pension Offset \ncurrently allows. They deserve to be rewarded for their hard work, not \npenalized for it.\n  Many workers affected by this Offset policy are women, or clerical \nworkers and bus drivers who are currently working and looking forward \nto a deserved retirement. These are people who worked hard as federal \nemployees, school teachers, or firefighters.\n  Frankly, I would repeal this policy all together. But, I realize that \nbudget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise, I hope we \ncan agree that retirees who work hard should not have this offset \napplied until their combined monthly benefit exceeds $1,200.\n  In the few cases where retirees might have their benefits reduced by \nthis policy change, my legislation will calculate their pension offset \nby the current method. I also have a provision in this legislation to \nindex the minimum amount of $1,200 to inflation so retirees will see \ntheir minimum benefits increase as the cost of living increases.\n\n  I believe that people who work hard and play by the rules should not \nbe penalized by arcane, legislative technicalities. That's why I'm \nintroducing this bill today.\n  Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana has introduced similar \nlegislation in the House. I look forward to working with him to modify \nthe harsh Pension Offset rule.\n  If the federal government is going to force government workers and \nretirees in Maryland and across the country to give up a portion of \ntheir spousal benefits, the retirees should at least receive a fair \nportion of their benefits.\n  I want to urge my Senate colleagues to join me in this effort and \nsupport my legislation to modify the Government Pension Offset.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 718. A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to extend the civil service retirement provisions of such chapter \nwhich are applicable to law enforcement officers, to inspectors of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, inspectors and canine \nenforcement officers of the United States Customs Service, and revenue \nofficers of the Internal Revenue Service; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n         Hazardous Occupations Retirement Benefits Act of 1999\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Hazardous \nOccupations Retirement Benefits Act of 1999. This legislation will \ngrant an early retirement package for revenue officers of the Internal \nRevenue Service, customs inspectors of the U.S. Customs Service, and \nimmigration inspectors of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  Under current law, most Federal law enforcement officers and \nfirefighters are eligible to retire at age 50 with 20\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\nyears of Federal service. Most people would be surprised to learn that \ncurrent law does not treat revenue officers, customs inspectors and \nimmigration inspectors as federal law enforcement personnel.\n  This legislation will amend the current law and finally grant the \nsame 20-year retirement to these members of the Internal Revenue \nService, Customs Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. \nThe employees under this bill have very hazardous, physically taxing \noccupations, and it is in the public's interest to have a young and \ncompetent work force in these jobs.\n  The need for a 20-year retirement benefit for inspectors of the \nCustoms Service is very clear. These employees are the country's first \nline of defense against terrorism and the smuggling of illegal drugs at \nour borders. They have the authority to apprehend those engaged in \nthese crimes. These officers carry a firearm on the job. They are \nresponsible for the most arrests performed by Customs Service \nemployees. The Customs Service interdicts more narcotics than any other \nlaw enforcement agency--over a million pounds a year. In 1996, they \nseized 180,946 pounds of cocaine, 2,895 pounds of heroin, and 775,225 \npounds of marijuana. They are required to have the same law enforcement \ntraining as all other law enforcement personnel. These employees face \nso many challenges. They confront criminals in the drug war, organized \ncrime figures, and increasingly sophisticated white-collar criminals.\n  Revenue officers struggle with heavy workloads and a high rate of job \nstress. Some IRS employees must even employ pseudonyms to hide their \nidentity because of the great threat to their personal safety. The \nInternal Revenue Service currently provides it's employees with a \nmanual entitled: `Assaults and Threats: A Guide to Your Personal \nSafety' to help employees respond to hostile situations. The document \nadvises IRS employees how to handle on-the-job assaults, abuse, \nthreatening telephone calls, and other menacing situations.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is \ncreated by this act is more than offset by savings in training costs \nand increased revenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these \ncritical employees will reduce turnover, increase productivity, \ndecrease employee recruitment and development costs, and enhance the \nretention of a well-trained and experienced work force.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me again in this Congress in expressing \nsupport for this bill and finally getting it enacted. This bill will \nimprove the effectiveness of our inspector and revenue officer work \nforce to ensure the integrity of our borders and proper collection of \nthe taxes and duties owed to the Federal Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 719. A bill to provide for the orderly disposal of certain Federal \nland in the State of Nevada and for the acquisition of environmentally \nsensitive land in the State, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             the nevada public land management act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, the Nevada \nPublic Land Management Act of 1999. This Act provides a process for the \nsale of public lands to support the expansion and economic development \nof rural communities in Nevada.\n  Many of Nevada's rural counties are actively planning for economic \ngrowth and expansion. However, they are hampered, because more than 87 \npercent of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government and some Nevada \ncounties are more than 90 percent owned by the federal government. As \nthese counties seek to expand economic diversification, they find \nthemselves land-locked by Federal lands.\n  But a lack of land is not the only problem these counties face. Many \nlack an adequate tax base, due to their lack of private lands. As the \ntax roles shrink and they experience some growth, officials are unable \nto adequately provide the basic public services expected of them. \nAdequate police and fire protection, education, road maintenance, and \nbasic health care are suffering.\n  The legislation we introduce today will allow for the coordinated \ndisposal of Federal lands that have already been identified by the \nFederal government and the Bureau of Land Management as suitable for \ndisposal. Simply put, we are setting up a willing seller-willing buyer \nscenario. Sale of these lands will allow for economic diversification \nwhile implementing smart growth practices. Local governments will \nbenefit from an infusion of revenue and a stable tax base to fund basic \npublic services.\n  Senator Bryan's and my bill requires that disposal of Nevada's lands \nbe accomplished by competitive bidding, a process which will ensure \nthat the sale of these public lands yield the highest return for the \npublic. It is crucial to rural Nevada that we provide revenues for the \nbasic services so many Americans take for granted, while also giving \nthe Federal government the revenues they need to acquire truly special \nlands for future generations to enjoy.\n  Mr. President, this bill was drafted with conscious regard for the \nlaws governing the management of public lands. In particular, the bill \nmeets the intent of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act in three \nways. First, it only involves lands determined to be suitable for \ndisposal by the Bureau of Land Management's own land use planning \nprocess. Secondly, the bill assures that state and local governments \nare provided meaningful public involvement in land use decisions for \npublic lands. And finally, the bill would allow for expansion of \ncommunities and economic development.\n  Two years ago I convened a Presidential Summit on the shores of Lake \nTahoe to save the Lake. This Summit created a model of federal, state, \nlocal, public and private partnership. It is a model that the President \nsaid can apply across the nation and across the world. We learned there \nthat we can call work together to preserve the nation's special places \nand promote economic growth. The legislation we introduce today is \ncrafted with the Lake Tahoe Model in mind. It encourages cooperation \nbetween all levels of government and the private sector. It is \nsupported by Nevada state and local officials on a bi-partisan basis \nand our Republican colleague Representative Jim Gibbons has introduced \nsimilar legislation today in the House.\n  This kind of bill shows truly how government can work for the people \nin partnership. I urge its swift passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 719\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nevada Public Land \n     Management Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal holdings in the State of Nevada constitute over \n     87 percent of the area of the State, and in 10 of the 17 \n     counties the Federal Government controls at least 80 percent \n     of the land;\n       (2) the large amount of federally controlled land in Nevada \n     and the lack of an adequate private land ownership base has \n     had a negative impact on the overall economic development of \n     rural counties and communities and severely degraded the \n     ability of local governments to provide necessary services;\n       (3) under general land laws less than 3 percent of the \n     Federal land in Nevada has moved from Federal control to \n     private ownership in the last 130 years;\n       (4) in resource management plans, the Bureau of Land \n     Management has identified for disposal land that is difficult \n     and costly to manage and that would more appropriately be in \n     non-Federal ownership;\n       (5) implementation of Federal land management plans has \n     been impaired by the lack of necessary funding to provide the \n     needed improvements and the lack of land management programs \n     to accomplish the goals and standards set out in the plans; \n     and\n       (6) the lack of a private land tax base prevents most local \n     governments from providing the appropriate infrastructure to \n     allow timely development of land that is disposed of by the \n     Federal Government for community expansion and economic \n     growth.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       (1) the orderly disposal and use of certain Federal land in \n     the State of Nevada that was not included in the Southern \n     Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-\n     263; 112 Stat. 2343);\n       (2) the acquisition of environmentally sensitive land in \n     the State; and\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\n       (3) the implementation of projects and activities in the \n     State to protect or restore important environmental and \n     cultural resources.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote the development of a government in the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) based on \ndemocratic principles and the rule of law, and that respects \ninternationally recognized human rights, to assist the victims of \nSerbian oppression, to apply measures against the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n                   serbia democratization act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this is a significant piece of legislation, \nI believe, the Serbia Democratization Act of 1999, on which I am \nhonored by the cosponsorship of a number of distinguished colleagues--\nSenators Gordon Smith, Lugar, Lieberman, Lautenberg, DeWine, McCain, \nand Orrin Hatch.\n  More than a year ago, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sent \nSerbian troops into Kosovo to launch a brutal assault on the ethnic \nAlbanian population there. This action was the beginning of a merciless \nand unjustified Serbian offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. \nTwo thousand victims of Milosevic's cruelty lie dead--many of them \ninnocent civilians. And hundreds of thousands of people have been \ndriven from their homes.\n  Mr. President, this tragedy in Kosovo has emphasized the obvious: \nthat if the United States continues to foolishly hope for good will on \nthe part of Milosevic, the United States will be dragged into the \ncrises this cruel man manufactures time and again. Instead of pursuing \na strategy that leads to NATO airstrikes or the deployment of thousands \nof United States troops in peacekeeping operations, I believe it is the \ncourse of wisdom to examine the root cause of instability in that \nregion--the bloody regime of Slobodan Milosevic.\n  President Milosevic has imposed rigid controls on, or launched \noutright attacks against, the media, universities, and the judicial \nsystem in Serbia to prevent the possibility that a democracy and an \nindependent civil society can be developed. The massacres of innocent \nwomen and children in Kosovo demonstrate Milosevic's disregard \nfor basic human rights. This man, in a word, forbids the very thought \nof a democratic system in Serbia.\n\n  For too long this Administration has claimed that no viable \ndemocratic opposition exists in Serbia or that the United States has no \nchoice but to work with Milosevic. Mr. President, I refuse to accept \nthis argument. There are individuals and organizations in Serbia that \ncan be a force for democratic change in that country. Milosevic is not \nthe only option. And in no case should the United States treat that \ndictator as a responsible leader or as someone with whom we can do \nbusiness.\n  The Serbia Democratization Act, which I am introducing today, has but \none purpose--to get rid of the murderous regime of Mr. Milosevic. Let \nme briefly summarize the key points of the legislation:\n  It authorizes $100 million over a two year period to support the \ndevelopment of a government in Yugoslavia based on democratic \nprinciples and the rule of law.\n  It calls for increased Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio \nLiberty broadcasting to Serbia to undermine state control of the media \nand spread the message of democracy to the people of Serbia.\n  It calls for humanitarian and other assistance to the victims of \noppression in Kosovo.\n  It adds new sanctions or strengthens those that exist against Serbia \nuntil the President certifies that the government is democratic. For \nexample, it codifies the so-called ``outer wall'' of sanctions that the \nUnited States has informally in place. It blocks Yugoslav assets in the \nUnited States. It prevents senior Yugoslav and Serbian government \nofficials, and their families, from receiving visas to travel to the \nU.S. And it requires a democratic government to be in place in Serbia \nbefore extending MFN status to Yugoslavia.\n  It states that the U.S. should send to the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia all information we have on the \ninvolvement of Milosevic in war crimes.\n  Now, as for Mr. Milosevic's future, I do not care one way or the \nother if he lives out his days in sunny Cyprus if he will agree to step \naside and make way for democracy in Serbia. The important thing is that \nhe be removed from power, whether voluntarily or not.\n  Once the Milosevic regime has been replaced by a democratic \ngovernment in Yugoslavia, this legislation calls for immediate and \nsubstantial U.S. assistance to support the transition to democracy. \nWhen that day comes, I will lead the way in encouraging Yugoslavia to \ntake its place among the democratic nations of the West. Until that \ntime, I will work to implement a policy that will undermine the \nautocratic regime of Slobodan Milosevic in every way possible.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today as one of a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators introducing the Serbia Democratization Act of 1999.\n  We've been developing this legislation for some time, to address our \nlong-term interest in fostering democracy and human rights in what \nremains of the former Yugoslavia. But this legislation sends an \nimportant message at a time when our Armed Forces are conducting air \noperations and missile strikes against the so-called Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro.\n  The message this legislation sends to the people of Serbia and \nMontenegro is\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\nthis: We are determined to punish those leaders responsible for such \nhorrific violence throughout the former Yugoslavia. But we are also \nready to support the development of democracy and civil society to help \nthe people of Serbia and Montenegro overcome the repression which they, \ntoo, have suffered under the Milosevic regime.\n  The measures outlined in this act will help free thought and free \nspeech to survive in Serbia-Montenegro. This legislation will also give \nvictims of Serbian attacks, particularly in Kosovo, a degree of comfort \nknowing the American people stand with them in their hour of need even \nas our aircraft fly overhead.\n  This legislation also puts Slobodan Milosevic on notice that the \nreign of terror he has unleashed against the people of the Balkans--\nincluding Serbs and others within Serbia--will soon be over. Along with \ndemocratization measures for Serbia-Montenegro, this act contains \nnarrow sanctions to make it more difficult for Milosevic to sustain his \ncorrupt regime and carry on his bloody war.\n  The years Milosevic has been in power have left the region \ndevastated. Americans remember all too well his brutal handiwork in the \nwar in Bosnia. The images of destroyed homes, ethnically cleansed \nvillages, of decaying corpses in mass graves, are indelibly etched in \nall our minds.\n  Now, less than two years after the signing of the Dayton peace \nagreement which brought about the end of that war, Milosevic has \nunleashed a similarly brutal campaign against people within Serbia. \nYugoslav tanks and soldiers are attempting to crush the Kosovar \nAlbanians' resistance. Belgrade's brutal crackdown has left thousands \ndead, tens of thousands homeless, and hundreds of thousands displaced \nfrom their towns and villages.\n  The man known in the Balkans as the Butcher of Belgrade, does not \nreserve his repression for Croats, Bosniaks, or Albanians. In his quest \nto gain and hold power, he has not spared his capital of Belgrade.\n  For years now, Slobodan Milosevic has carried out a sustained \ncampaign to destroy his country's democratic institutions and its \npeople's freedoms. He is a communist thug, a relic of the bad old days \nof Central Europe. For years, he has run whole of the so-called Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia from his position as head of the constituent \nRepublic of Serbia, leaving the constitution of the former Yugoslavia \nin tatters.\n  The Milosevic regime has tried for years to prevent the development \nof independent media outlets to provide accurate news and other \ninformation to the people of Serbia and Montenegro. Journalists who \nhave pursued stories unflattering to the regime have been threatened \nand beaten by police. Independent television stations and newspapers \nare being shut down through litigation under a draconian press law \npassed last fall. As the State Department's 1998 Human Rights Report \nnotes, that law allows private citizens and organizations to bring suit \nagainst media outlets for publishing information not deemed patriotic \nenough or considered to be ``against the territorial integrity, \nsovereignty and independence of the country.''\n\n  The effects of this policy are chilling. The people of Serbia-\nMontenegro are getting a filtered message about the events in their \ncountry and around the world. They see and hear and read only the news \ntheir Government chooses to disseminate.\n  Since NATO announced the approval of air operations and missile \nstrikes, Belgrade has cracked down further on the independent media. \nRadio B92, operated courageously by Veran Matic, was shut down at \ngunpoint. Instead of hearing what is really happening, instead of \nhearing our reasons for conducting air strikes, people in Belgrade hear \nthe regime's propaganda on Government radio.\n  The university in Belgrade--one of the great institutes of higher \nlearning in Central Europe--has been purged of professors who refuse to \ntow the party line. Students who have protested this action have been \nharassed. As a result, there are virtually no progressive professors or \nstudents left in several programs.\n  The economy, too, is in tatters. Unemployment and underemployment \nhovers at 60 percent, primarily because the government has been \nunwilling to carry out needed economic reforms. Privatization, the \ncornerstone of a market economy, remains at a standstill, allowing \ncronyism and corruption to flourish.\n  I would like to draw particular attention to a section of this law \nconcerning the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia.\n  As many of you know, for the past two years I have introduced \nlegislation that bans U.S. aid to communities in the former Yugoslavia \nharboring war criminals. I introduced that legislation because it is my \nfirm belief that democracy cannot come to a country, that a nation \ncannot begin to face the sins of its past, and that people cannot feel \nsecure in their own communities, until individuals who persecuted \nothers are brought to justice.\n  Milosevic has a deplorable record in cooperating with the Tribunal. \nHe has continually scorned his obligations to the United Nations to \nturn over war criminals to the Tribunal for prosecution, citing \nconstitutional constraints. Consequently, indicted war criminals--\nincluding Ratko Mladic, who is responsible for the massacre of hundreds \nof people during the Bosnian war, and the so-called Vukovar three who \nwere indicted for the murder of 260 unarmed men during the 1991 attack \non that Croatian city--reportedly live freely in Serbia.\n  He denied officials from the Tribunal access to Kosovo to investigate \nalleged crimes in the village of Racak, after 40 people were found \ndead, their mutilated bodies dumped in a ravine. Milosevic tried to \nclaim that the victims--children, women and old men--were combatants \nand shot in a confrontation with Serbian police. To lend his story \ncredence, Milosevic instead allowed a so-called independent forensic \nteam from Belarus--itself caught in the Stalinist past--and a group of \nFinns to analyze the corpses.\n  Milosevic's tactic backfired. The forensic team found that the \nvictims were unarmed civilians, executed in an organized massacre. Some \nof these Kosovars ``were forced to kneel before being sprayed with \nbullets,'' as the Washington Post reported it.\n  Those who master-minded and perpetrated the massacres in Racak must \nface justice. Our Congress has already made very clear our view that \nSlobodan Milosevic is a war criminal and should be indicted and tried \nby the International Tribunal.\n  Mr. President, United States policy toward Belgrade is and must be \nmuch more than the use of air strikes. The legislation before us today \nwill help Secretary Albright's efforts to bring lasting peace, \ndemocracy and prosperity to Serbia and Montenegro, as well as to Kosovo \nand the rest of the Balkans, by helping democracy and freedom prevail \nover a brutal dictator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 721. A bill to allow media coverage of court proceedings.\n\n\n        legislation to allow media coverage of court proceedings\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, along with Senator Schumer and others, \ntoday I am introducing legislation that would make it easier for every \nAmerican taxpayer to see what goes on in the federal courts that they \nfund. The bill, which would allow the photographing, electronic \nrecording, broadcasting, and televising of Federal court proceedings, \nis needed to address the growing public cynicism over this branch of \ngovernment.\n  Fostering a public that is well-informed about the law, including \npenalties and offenses, will, in turn, foster a healthy judiciary. As \nThomas Jefferson said, ``[t]he execution of the laws is more important \nthan the making of them.'' Because federal court decisions are far-\nreaching and often final, it is critical that judges operate in a \nmanner that invites broad observation.\n  In addition, allowing cameras in the federal courtrooms is consistent \nwith the founding fathers' intent that trials be held before as many \npeople as choose to attend. Also, the First Amendment requires that \ncourt proceedings be open to the public, and by extension, the news \nmedia. The public's right to observe them first-hand is hardly less \nimportant. Put differently, the Supreme Court has said, ``what \ntranspires in the courtroom is public property.''\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\n  In 1994 The Federal Judicial Center conducted a pilot program that \nstudied the effect of cameras in a select number of federal courts. \nTheir findings supported the use of electronic media coverage and \nfound, ``small or no effects of camera presence on participants in the \nproceedings, courtroom decorum, or the administration of justice.'' In \naddition to this three year study in the federal courts, we are \nfortunate to be able to draw upon the experience of state courts. A \ncommittee in New York established to study the effect of cameras in \ncourtrooms concluded, ``Audio-visual coverage of court proceedings \nserves an important educational function, and promotes public scrutiny \nof the judicial system. The program had minimal, if any, adverse \neffects.'' 15 states specifically studied the educational benefits \nderiving from camera access and all of them determined that camera \ncoverage contributed to greater public understanding of the judicial \nsystem.\n  The use of state courts as a testing ground for this legislation as \nwell as the Federal pilot program make this very well trod ground. We \ncan be extremely confident that this is the next logical step and the \nwell documented benefits far outweigh the ``minimal or no detrimental \neffects''. Yet, despite the strong evidence of the successful use of \ncameras in state courtrooms, we are going the extra mile to make sure \nthis works in federal courtrooms by adding a 3 year sunset provision to \nour bill. This will give us a reasonable amount of time to determine \nhow the process is working and whether it should be permanent.\n  The two leading arguments against cameras in federal courtrooms are \neasily countered. First, there is a fear that courtrooms will \ndeteriorate into the carnival-like atmosphere of the O.J. Simpson \ntrial. However, the O.J. Simpson case is obviously an exceptional and \nisolated instance. Not every court case is or need be like the Simpson \ncase. It is this image of court proceedings that this bill is designed \nto dispel. Furthermore, even the minimal effects of a camera in a trial \nsetting do not apply to an appellate hearing that has no jury and \nrarely requires witnesses.\n  The second argument against greater public access to court \nproceedings is the legitimate concern for the witnesses' safety when \nthey are required to testify. This concern has merit and is therefore \naddressed in our bill. Technological advances make it possible to \ndisguise the face and voice of witnesses upon request, thus not \ncompromising their safety.\n  Allowing greater public access to federal court proceedings will help \nAmericans fulfill their duty as citizens of a democratic nation to \neducate themselves on the workings of their government, and their right \nto observe and oversee the fundamental and critical role of the \njudiciary. The evidence compiled by 48 states and a federal study \nclearly supports this bill, the Constitution demands this bill, and the \nAmerican people deserve this bill.\n  For all these reasons, I urge others to join me and my colleagues in \nsupporting our attempt to provide greater public access and \naccountability of our federal courts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Grassley and \nSchumer in sponsoring the ``Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.''\n  Our democracy works best when our citizens are fully informed. That \nis why I have supported efforts during my time in the Senate to promote \nthe goal of opening the proceedings of all three branches of our \ngovernment. We continue to make progress in this area. Except for rare \nclosed sessions, the proceedings of Congress and its Committees are \nopen to the public, and carried live on cable networks. In addition, \nmore Members and Committees are using the Internet and Web sites to \nmake their work available to broader audiences.\n  The work of Executive Branch agencies is also open for public \nscrutiny through the Freedom of Information Act, among other \nmechanisms. The FOIA has served the country well in maintaining the \nright of Americans to know what their government is doing--or not \ndoing. As President Johnson said in 1966, when he signed the Freedom of \nInformation Act into law:\n\n       This legislation springs from one of our most essential \n     principles: A democracy works best when the people have all \n     the information that the security of the Nation permits.\n\n  The work of the third, Judicial Branch, of government is also open to \nthe public. Proceedings in federal courtrooms around this country are \nopen to the public, and our distinguished jurists publish extensive \nopinions explaining the reasons for their judgments and decisions.\n  Forty-eight states, including Vermont, permit cameras in the courts. \nThis legislation simply continues this tradition of openness on the \nfederal level.\n  This bill permits presiding appellate and district court judges to \nallow cameras in the courtroom; they are not required to do so. At the \nsame time, it protects non-party witnesses by giving them the right to \nhave their voices and images obscured during their testimony. Finally, \nthe bill authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to \npromulgate advisory guidelines for use by presiding judges in \ndetermining the management and administration of photographing, \nrecording, broadcasting or televising the proceedings. The authority \nfor cameras in federal district courts sunsets in three years.\n  In 1994, the Judicial Conference concluded that the time was not ripe \nto permit cameras in the federal courts, and rejected a recommendation \nof the Court Administration and Case Management Committee to authorize \nthe photographing, recording, and broadcasting of civil proceedings in \nfederal trial and appellate courts. A majority of the Conference were \nconcerned about the intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses \nand jurors.\n  The New York Times opined at that time, on September 22, 1994, that \n``the court system needs to reconsider its total ban on cameras, and \nCongress should consider making its own rules for cameras in the \nFederal courts.''\n  I am sensitive to the concerns of the Conference, but believe this \nlegislation grants to the presiding judge the authority to evaluate the \neffect of a camera on particular proceedings and witnesses, and decide \naccordingly on whether to permit the camera into the courtroom. A \nblanket prohibition on cameras is an unnecessary limitation on the \ndiscretion of the presiding judge.\n  Allowing a wider public than just those who are able to make time to \nvisit a courtroom to see and hear judicial proceedings will allow \nAmericans to evaluate for themselves the quality of justice in this \ncountry, and deepen their understanding of the work that goes on in our \ncourtrooms. This legislation is a step in making our courtrooms and the \njustice meted out there more widely available for public scrutiny. The \ntime is long overdue for federal courts to allow cameras on their \nproceedings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 722. A bill to provide for the immediate application of certain \norders relating to the amendment, modification, suspension, or \nrevocation of certificates under chapter 447 of title 49, United States \nCode; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                        Emergency Revocation Act\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been involved in the \naviation industry for over forty years. In that time, I have logged \nroughly 8,000 flight hours and have had my share of flight challenges \nin all sorts of weather and conditions. For instance, in 1980 during a \nhumanitarian mission to Dominica, I led ten airplanes through hurricane \nDavid to deliver medical supplies to the island. As recently as 1991 I \npiloted a Cessna 414 around the world reenacting the same flight of \nWiley Post sixty years earlier. I mention this to establish my \ncredentials as someone who is an experienced pilot. As such, I have a \ngreat respect for the important job that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) does to make our air system the safest and best in \nthe world. Notwithstanding my admiration for the job that the FAA does, \nI believe there are some areas of FAA enforcement that need to be \nexamined. One such area is the FAA's use of ``emergency revocation''.\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\n  After talking with certificate holders and based on my own \nobservations, I believe the FAA unfairly uses this necessary power to \nprematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support \nsuch drastic action. In a revocation action, brought on an emergency \nbasis, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate immediately, \nwithout an intermediary review by an impartial third party. The result \nis that the certificate holder is grounded and in most cases out of \nwork until the issue is adjudicated.\n  Simply put, I believe the FAA unfairly uses this necessary power to \nprematurely revoke certificates when the circumstances do not support \nsuch drastic action. A more reasonable approach when safety is not an \nissue, would be to adjudicate the revocation on a non-emergency basis \nallowing the certificate holder continued use of the certificate.\n  In no way do I want to suggest that the FAA should not have emergency \nrevocation powers. I believe it is critical to safety that FAA have the \nability to ground unsafe airmen or other certificate holders; however, \nI also believe that the FAA must be judicious in its use of this \nextraordinary power. A review of recent emergency cases clearly \ndemonstrates a pattern by which the FAA uses their emergency powers as \nstandard procedure rather than an extraordinary measure. Perhaps the \nmost visible case has been Bob Hoover.\n  Bob is a highly regarded and accomplished aerobatic pilot. In 1992, \nhis medical certificate was revoked based on alleged questions \nregarding his cognitive abilities. After getting a clean bill of health \nfrom four separate sets of doctors (just one of the many tests cost Bob \n$1,700) and over the continuing objections of the federal air surgeon \n(who never examined Bob personally) his medical certificate was \nreinstated only after then Administrator David Henson intervened. \nUnfortunately, Bob is not out of the woods yet. His medical certificate \nexpires each year. Unlike most airmen who can renew their medical \ncertificate with a routine application and exam, Bob has to furnish the \nFAA with a report of a neurological evaluation every twelve months.\n\n  Bob Hoover's experience is just one of many. I have visited with \nother pilots who have had their licenses revoked on an emergency basis. \nPilots such as Ted Stewart who has been an American Airlines pilot for \nmore than 12 years and is presently a Boeing 767 Captain. Until January \n1995, Ted had no complaints registered against him or his flying. In \nJanuary 1995 the FAA suspended his examining authority as part of a \nlarger FAA effort to respond to a problem of falsified ratings. The \nfull National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) exonerated Ted in July \n1995. In June 1996, he received a second revocation. One of the charges \nin this second revocation involved falsification of records for a \nFlight Instructor Certificate with Multiengined rating and his Air \nTransport Pilot (ATP) certificate dating back to 1979. Remember, an \nemergency revocation means you lose your certificate immediately, so in \nmost cases this means the certificate holder loses his source of \nincome. Fortunately in Ted's case, his employer put him on a desk job \nwhile the issue was adjudicated.\n  Like most, I have questioned how an alleged 17\\1/2\\ year old \nviolation in the Stewart case could constitute an emergency; \nespecially, since Ted had not been cited for any cause in the \nintervening years. Nonetheless, the FAA vigorously pursued this action. \nOn August 30, 1996, the NTSB issued its decision in this second \nrevocation and found for Ted. A couple of comments in the Stewart \ndecision bear closer examination. First, the board notes that ``The \nadministrator's loss in the earlier case appears to have prompted \nfurther investigation of respondent . . .'' I find this rather \ntroubling that an impartial third party appears to be suggesting that \nthe FAA has a vendetta against Ted Stewart. This is further emphasized \nwith a footnote in which the Board notes:\n\n       [We,] of course, [are] not authorized to review the \n     Administrator's exercise of his power to take emergency \n     certificate action . . . We are constrained to register in \n     this matter, however, our opinion that where, as here, no \n     legitimate reason is cited or appears for not consolidating \n     all alleged violations into one proceeding, subjecting an \n     airman in the space of a year to two emergency revocations, \n     and thus to the financial and other burdens associated with \n     an additional 60-day grounding without prior notice and \n     hearing, constitutes an abusive and unprincipled discharge of \n     an extraordinary power.\n\n  Another example is Raymond A. Williamson who was a pilot for Coca-\nCola Bottling Company. Like Ted Stewart, he was accused of being part \nof a ``ring'' of pilots who falsified type records for ``vintage'' \naircraft.\n  As in all of the cases I have reviewed, Mr. Williamson biggest \nconcern is that the FAA investigation and subsequent revocation came \nout of the blue. In November 1994, he was notified by his employer \n(Coca-Cola) that FAA inspectors had accused him of giving ``illegal'' \ncheck rides in company owned aircraft. He was fired. In June 1995, he \nreceived an Emergency Order of Revocation. In over 30 years as an \nactive pilot, he had never had an accident, incident, or violation. Nor \nhad he ever been ``counseled'' by the FAA for any action or \nirregularities as a pilot, flight instructor, FAA designated pilot \nexaminer.\n  In May 1996, FAA proposed to return all his certificates and ratings, \nexcept his flight instructor certificate. As in the Ted Stewart case, \nit would appear that FAA found no real reason to pursue an \n``emergency'' revocation.\n  I obviously cannot read the collective minds of the NTSB, but I \nbelieve a reasonable person would conclude that in the Ted Stewart case \nthe Board, believes as I do, that there is an abuse of emergency \nrevocation powers by the FAA.\n  This is borne out further by the fact that since 1989, emergency \ncases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB has more \nthan doubled. In 1989 the NTSB heard 1,107 enforcement cases. Of those, \n66 were emergency revocation cases or 5.96 percent. In 1995, the NTSB \nheard 509 total enforcement cases, of those 160 were emergency \nrevocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that the FAA \nhas begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice.\n  At my request, the General Accounting Office (GAO) did a study of \nemergency revocation actions taken by the FAA between 1990 and 1997. \nThe most troubling result of the GAO study is that during time frame \nstudied, 50 percent of the emergency renovations were issued four \nmonths to two years after the violation occurred. In only 4% of the \ncases was the emergency revocation issued within ten days or less of \nthe actual violation. In fact, the median time lapse between the \nviolation and the emergency order was a little over four months (132 \ndays).\n  Clearly, at issue is ``what constitutes an emergency?'' After working \nwith industry representatives, I believe we have come up with a \nbalanced and prudent approach to answer that question. Today I, along \nwith Senators Murkowski, Burns, Grassley, Breaux, Stevens, Crapo and \nFrist am introducing a bill which will provide a certificate holder the \noption of requesting a hearing before the NTSB within 48 hours of \nreceiving an emergency revocation to determine whether or not a true \nemergency exists. The board will have to decide within five days of the \nrequest if an emergency exists. During the board's deliberation, the \ncertificate will be suspended. Should the board decide an emergency \ndoes not exist, the certificate holder will be able to use his \ncertificate while the issue is adjudicated. Should the board decide an \nemergency does exist, the certificate will continue to be suspended \nwhile the issue is adjudicated.\n  Not surprisingly, Mr. President the FAA opposes this language. They \nalso opposed changes to the civil penalties program where they served \nas the judge and jury in civil penalty actions against airmen. \nFortunately, we were able to change that so that airmen can now appeal \na civil penalty case to the NTSB. This has worked very well because the \nNTSB has a clear understanding of the issues.\n  This bill is supported by the Air Line Pilots Association, \nInternational; the Air Transport Association; the Allied Pilots \nAssociation, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; the Experimental \nAircraft Association; National Air Carrier Association; National Air \nTransportation Association; National Business Aircraft Association; the \nNTSB Bar Association; and the Regional Airline Association.\n  In closing, this bill will provide due process to certificate holders \nwhere\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\nnow none exists, without compromising aviation safety. This is a \nreasonable and prudent response to an increasing problem for \ncertificate holders. I hope our colleagues will support our efforts in \nthis regard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 723. A bill to provide regulatory amnesty for defendants who are \nunable to comply with federal enforceable requirements because of \nfactors related to a Y2K system failure; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   y2k regulatory amnesty act of 1999\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nintroduce Y2K Regulatory Amnesty Act of 1999. I believe this is a \ntimely piece of legislation considering the current debate over the \nYear 2000 issue. Senators Bennett, Dodd, Hatch, Feinstein, and McCain \nhave been working diligently on Year 2000 issues for quite some time. I \napplaud them for their efforts in dealing with such a unique and \ncomplex issue.\n  However, as I have watched their progress and listened to their \nreports, I have noticed one significant omission in their discussions. \nVirtually nothing has been said about the potential regulatory \nnightmare that regulated entities could face as a result of a Y2K \ndisruption. While the debate has been centered on getting government \nand businesses ready for the date change, very little has been said \nabout how the government will actually deal with the private sector's \nproblems associated with the year 2000. The last thing we need is for \nRegulatory Agencies to view a Y2K problem as an opportunity for a fine.\n  As a result, I began to ask several regulated communities about their \nconcerns over regulatory penalties as a result of a Y2K disruption. \nSurprisingly, many had not yet begun to think about the potential for \nregulatory problems. Instead, they have been focusing on becoming Y2K \ncomplaint, which is what they should be doing. However, one question \nremains; how will the federal government react to regulatory \nnoncompliance due to a Y2K systems disruption?\n  In response to that unanswered question, I am introducing the Y2K \nRegulatory Amnesty Act. My legislation will create a ``Y2K upset'', \nwhich is defined as an exception in which there is unintentional and \ntemporary noncompliance beyond the reasonable control of the party. It \nwill provide regulated communities with an affirmative defense from \npunitive actions from the federal government should they encounter a \nY2K systems disruption.\n  My legislation does not create a ``free pass'' for entities to \nviolate federal regulations. A ``Y2K upset'' is strictly defined and \ncan only be invoked if the entity has made all possible efforts to \nbecome Y2K complaint and meets other stringent requirements. \nAdditionally, if the noncompliance would result in an immediate or \nimminent threat to public health, the defense is not applicable. For \nthose individuals who do attempt to use this defense frivolously or \nfraudulently, there will be severe criminal penalties.\n  Let me give you an example of how this provision will work. Assume \nthat a small, local flower shop is run by a simple 3-computer network. \nThe flower shop uses its computer network to manage payroll, accounts \npayable/receivable, and to track orders from customers. In an effort to \nbecome Y2K complaint, the flower shop hires an outside consultant to \nexamine his network for signs of the Y2K bug and solve any problems \nthat exist. This process costs the flower shop just over $1,000 but is \nwell worth the investment considering the shop wants to be in business \nin January 2000.\n\n  On January 1, 2000, flower shop finds that its payroll software is \nfailing to operate. The shop owner contacts the software manufacturer, \nthe computer manufacturer, and his consultant in order to find a \nsolution. From the outset, the shop owner knows this delay means that \nhe will be unable to calculate how much he owes the IRS in payroll \ntaxes--not to mention, they will be late. For that small business owner \nthat means a hefty penalty on top of the hassle and lost business the \nfailure caused in the first place.\n  Under my legislation, this small business owner would not be facing \nIRS penalties. The flower shop will still have to pay the taxes, but \nthey won't be hit with a fine for a computer problem outside of their \ncontrol.\n  This is just one example of how this legislation would assist \nbusinesses as they attempt to become compliant. However, this \nlegislation would also help many others. I have heard from several \nschools in my state that fear that if they lose federally required \nreporting information, they may face losses in federal funding. I have \nalso heard from small, rural telephone cooperatives who fear that even \na short-term Y2K-related systems disruption could result in significant \nFCC fines and penalties. The list is exhaustive. Virtually, anyone \nregulated by the federal government faces the unanswered question as to \nhow the federal government will handle a Y2K systems disruption.\n  There is also an added benefit to this legislation. Because this \ndefense would only apply to those who have made good faith efforts to \nbecome compliant, it will serve as an added incentive for everyone to \nfix their Y2K problems upfront.\n  Some people will say this legislation is unnecessary. However, I \nbelieve it is prudent to define how the federal government will \napproach Y2K systems disruptions in a regulatory context. But, more \nimportantly, I believe we need to establish the rules of the game in \nadvance so that everyone is operating from the same page.\n  In closing, I would urge each of my colleagues to become a cosponsor \nof the Y2K Regulatory Amnesty Act and join with me in working to \nremediate the potential regulatory problems associated with the coming \ndate change.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be inserted in \nthe Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to clarify that \nunderground injection does not include certain activities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    hydraulic fracturing legislation\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nwith my colleagues from Alabama, Senator Sessions, that will help our \ndomestic oil and gas industry by reducing one of the many regulatory \nburdens that they must comply with.\n  Last year, I was informed of a case in Alabama in which the EPA was \nsued over their policy regarding underground injection and \nspecifically, ``hydraulic fracturing''. This procedure is used in cases \nwhere product, such as gas is located in a tight geological formation \nsuch as a coalbed. A hole is drilled into that area and a fluid \nconsisting of water, gel and sand is pumped down the wellbore into the \nformation creating a fracture zone. The gel and water are extracted \nduring the initial production stage of the well while the sand is left \nto prop open the cracks in the formation.\n  When Congress originally passed the safe drinking water act (SDWA) in \n1974, they intentionally left the underground protection control (UIC) \nprogram to the states. That act stated: ``the Administrator . . . may \nnot prescribe requirements which interfere with or impede (injection \nactivities associated with oil and gas production) unless such \nrequirements are essential to assure that underground sources of \ndrinking water will not be endangered by such injection.'' That concept \nwas re-affirmed in 1980 when a provision was enacted specifically to \nrecognize the adequacy of state programs, none of which required \npermitting for hydraulic fracturing in the construction or maintenance \nof oil and gas production wells.\n  So, when the lawsuit was filed in Alabama, and the court ruled in \nfavor of the environmental organization that filed the suit, I was \nshocked. It seemed clear to me that the intent of the law was to leave \nthe regulation of this procedure to the states. I have neither heard \nnor seen anything that would lead me to the conclusion that there is \nany contamination of drinking water because of hydraulic fracturing. In \nfact, I believe the EPA agrees with me. Let me read a letter from Carol \nBrowner, the Administrator of the EPA, to Mr. David A. Ludder, General \nCouncil for the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation, Inc (LEAF), \nthe group that sued EPA over this procedure.\n\n       There is no evidence that the hydraulic fracturing at issue \n     has resulted in any contamination or endangerment of \n     underground sources of drinking water. Repeated testing, \n     conducted between May of 1989 and March of 1993, of the \n     drinking water well which was the subject of this petition \n     failed to show any chemicals that would indicate the presence \n     of fracturing fluids.\n\n  That statement seems pretty straight forward and implies to me that \nEPA would be willing to work with us to solve this problem. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case. Senator Sessions and I, with \nassistance from Senator Chafee, have received nothing but stalling \ntactics. In late January, we drafted this language and sent it over to \nEPA hoping that we could resolve this issue quickly to provide relief \nto our producers. Unfortunately, they were not willing to work with us.\n  So here we are introducing a bill that is simple and solves the \nproblem. This bill is short and to the point. In less than two pages we \nclarify that hydraulic fracturing is not underground injection and re-\naffirm that the administrator has the ability to determine what is \nregulated as underground injection, which is simply a clarification of \nan ability the administrator already possesses.\n  It is my hope that EPA will work with us as this bill moves through \ncommittee and come up with a solution that will allow our oil and gas \nguys to get back to work and get EPA to focus on issues which may pose \na more immediate threat.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill along \nwith my colleague Senator Inhofe, which makes a technical correction to \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill will end a frivolous lawsuit, \nclarify the intent of Congress and allow our State regulators and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to focus on protecting underground \ndrinking water.\n  This bill clarifies the Safe Drinking Water Act by exempting \nhydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection. \nHydraulic fracturing is a process used in the production of coalbed \nmethane. This process uses high pressure water, carbon dioxide and sand \nto create microscopic fractures in coal seams to release and extract \nmethane, oil and gas. Most states in which hydraulic fracturing is \nused, including my own state of Alabama, have in place regulations to \nensure hydraulic fracturing continues to be a technique used in a safe \nmanner. This technique has been used safely by coalbed methane, oil and \ngas producers for over fifteen years and has never been attributed to \ncausing even a single case of contamination to an underground drinking \nwater source.\n  On May 3rd of 1994, the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation \n(LEAF) submitted a Petition for Promulgation of a Rule to withdraw the \nEPA's approval for the state of Alabama's Underground Injection Control \n(UIC) program. LEAF cited a case in Alabama of alleged drinking well \ncontamination to justify its lawsuit. The EPA carefully reviewed this \npetition and on May 5th of 1995 the Administrator of the EPA, Carol \nBrowner wrote to LEAF and stated ``based on that review, I have \ndetermined that Alabama's implementation of the UIC program is \nconsistent with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act''. \nAdministrator Browner continued ``There is no evidence that the \nhydraulic fracturing at issue has resulted in any contamination or \nendangerment of underground sources of drinking water''. I ask \nunanimous consent that a complete copy of the text of that letter be \ninserted into the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS: This single case in Alabama which initiated the LEAF \nlawsuit was investigated by three regulatory agencies; the State Oil \nand Gas Board of Alabama, the Alabama Department of Environmental \nManagement and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. None of the \nthree regulatory agencies could find any contamination attributable to \nhydraulic fracturing activities or levels of any contaminate exceeding \nSafe Drinking Water Act standards. In fact, a nationwide search for \ncases of contamination attributed to hydraulic fracturing was conducted \nby the Environmental Protection Agency and the Ground Water Protection \nCouncil. Not a single case of contamination was discovered.\n  As a result of the baseless lawsuit brought by the Legal \nEnvironmental Assistance Foundation, the EPA has begun the process of \nstripping away the authority of the State of Alabama to implement its \nUnderground Injection Control program. Both the EPA and the state of \nAlabama must now spend precious resources, which could otherwise be \nused to address real drinking water problems, to establish federal \nregulations for a technique which poses no environmental threat. The \nimpact of this action will undoubtably be felt by the people in Alabama \nand across the nation who are threatened by and in many cases, \nexperiencing the effects of ground water contamination as regulating \nagencies waste their resources to address this non-problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this technical fix to the \nSafe Drinking Water Act.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1995.\n     David A. Ludder, Esq.,\n     General Counsel, Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation, \n         Inc., Tallahassee, FL.\n       Dear Mr. Ludder: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     has received and carefully reviewed your May 3, 1994, \n     Petition for Promulgation of a Rule Withdrawing Approval of \n     Alabama's Underground Injection\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\n     Control (UIC) Program. Based on that review, I have \n     determined that Alabama's implementation of its UIC Program \n     is consistent with the requirements of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 300h, et seq.) and EPA's UIC \n     regulations (40 CFR Part 145). EPA does not regulate--and \n     does not believe it is legally required to regulate--the \n     hydraulic fracturing of methane gas production wells under \n     its UIC Program.\n       There is no evidence that the hydraulic fracturing at issue \n     has resulted in any contamination or endangerment of \n     underground sources of drinking water (USDW). Repeated \n     testing, conducted between May of 1989 and March of 1993, of \n     the drinking water well which was the subject of this \n     petition failed to show any chemicals that would indicate the \n     presence of fracturing fluids. The well was also sampled for \n     drinking water quality and no constituents exceeding drinking \n     water standards were detected. Moreover, given the horizontal \n     and vertical distance between the drinking water well and the \n     closest methane gas production wells, the possibility of \n     contamination or endangerment of USDWs in the area is \n     extremely remote. Hydraulic fracturing is closely regulated \n     by the Alabama State Oil and Gas Board, which requires that \n     operators obtain authorization prior to all fracturing \n     activities.\n       Accordingly, I have decided to deny your petition. Enclosed \n     you will find a detailed response to each contention in your \n     petition, which further explains the basis for this denial.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carol M. Browner,\n                                                    Administrator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 725. A bill to preserve and protect coral reefs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                THE CORAL REEF CONSERVATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coral Reef \nConservation Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator McCain, Chairman of \nthe Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, is joining me as a \ncosponsor in this effort to protect, sustain, and restore the health of \ncoral reef ecosystems.\n  Coral reefs are among the world's most biologically diverse and \nproductive ecosystems. Reefs serve as essential habitat for many marine \norganisms, enhancing commercial fisheries and stimulating tourism. They \nprovide protection to coastal areas from storm surges and erosion, and \noffer many untold potential benefits such as new pharmaceuticals, some \nof which are presently being identified, developed, and tested. \nUnfortunately, coral reef ecosystems are in decline.\n  In 1998, coral reefs around the world appear to have suffered the \nmost extensive and severe bleaching damage and subsequent mortality in \nmodern times. Reefs in at least 60 countries were affected, and in some \nareas, more than 70 percent of the corals died off. These impacts have \nbeen attributed to the warmest ocean temperatures in 600 years. In \naddition to these impacts, however, it is estimated that 58 percent of \nthe world's reefs are threatened by human activity such as \ninappropriate coastal development, destructive fishing practices, and \nother forms of overexploitation.\n  As a result of these stressors, coral reef habitat has been damaged \nand destroyed. Diseases of coral and reef-based organisms are expanding \nrapidly. Most of the diseases being tracked have only recently been \ndiscovered and are not widely understood. These serious problems \nhighlight the need for more research to unravel the complex interactive \neffects between natural and human-induced stressors on coral reefs, and \nfor more conservation and management activities.\n  The United States is not immune to these problems. Large coral reef \nsystems exist in Florida, Hawaii, Texas, and various U.S. territories \nin the Caribbean and the Pacific. These reefs produce significant \neconomic benefits for surrounding communities. In Florida, for example, \nthe reefs contribute approximately 1.6 billion dollars annually to the \nstate economy. But despite these clear benefits, U.S. reefs suffer from \nsome of the same problems that affect reefs in other parts of the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, this bill authorizes $3,800,000 in each of fiscal \nyears 2000, 2001, and 2002 for a Coral Reef Conservation Program in the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide conservation \nand research grants to states, U.S. territories, and qualified non-\ngovernmental institutions. Eligible conservation projects will focus on \nthe promotion of sustainable development and work to ensure the \neffective, long-term conservation of coral reefs. Potential research \nprojects will address use conflicts and develop sound scientific \ninformation on the condition of and threats to coral reef ecosystems.\n  The bill also authorizes NOAA to enter into an agreement with a \nqualified non-governmental organization to create a trust fund that \nwill match private contributions to federal contributions and provide \nadditional funding for worthy conservation and research projects. \nThrough this mechanism, federal dollars can be used to leverage more \ndollars from the private sector for grants.\n  In addition, this bill authorizes $200,000 for each of fiscal years \n2000, 2001, and 2002 for emergency assistance, which would be be \nprovided through grants to address unforeseen or disaster-related \nproblems pertaining to coral reefs.\n  Based on early reports, the repercussions of the 1998 mass bleaching \nand mortality events will be far-reaching in time and economic impact. \nThis development, along with the continuing pressures from other \nsources, demonstrates the need for an increase in the effort to protect \nour coral reefs. The legislation I am introducing today provides a \nreasonable, cooperative vehicle to address these concerns.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nCoral Reef Conservation Act of 1999. The bill that I have sponsored, \nalong with Senator Snowe, the Chair of the Commerce Committee's \nSubcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, represents strong and balanced \nenvironmental policy. I wish to thank Senator Snowe for her leadership \nin this area. This bill is a positive step forward to improve the \nconditions of our coral reefs and the many types of life that live in \nand among these reefs.\n  The bill is designed to build partnerships with local and State \nentities to facilitate coral reef conservation. It creates a \ncompetitive matching-grant program which would provide funding for \nlocal and State governments and qualified non-profit organizations \nwhich have experience in coral reef monitoring, research, conservation, \nand public education projects. The bill requires that federal funds \nprovide no more than 50 percent of the cost of the project. However, it \nalso helps local communities that do not have the ability to raise \nsufficient matching funds. Therefore, the matching requirement may be \nwaived for qualified proposals under $25,000.\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\n  Under the bill that Senator Snowe and I have introduced today, the \nmatching-grant program will maximize funding for important coral reef \nconservation projects. Our coral reefs are certainly in need of this \ntype of funding. Indeed, coral reefs are the foundation of one of the \nEarth's most productive and diverse ecosystems, providing food and \nshelter for at least one million different types of animals, plants and \nother sea life. Coastal communities realize the benefit of coral reefs \nthrough enhanced fisheries, coastal protection, tourism, and the \ndevelopment of medicines used to fight cancer and produce antibiotics \nand pain relievers. Unfortunately, in 1998, coral reefs suffered some \nof the most extensive damage ever recorded. What caused so much damage? \nThere are no certain answers. Record-breaking ocean temperatures and a \nsevere El Nino event are the most likely culprits. What we do know is \nthat these global events triggered massive die-offs of coral reefs \nthrough a process known as coral ``bleaching''. In essence, bleaching \noccurs when coral reefs are exposed to environmental stress, including \nelevated sea temperatures. This results in the loss of an essential \nfood source, so the coral--a living creature--may starve to death. This \ncoral reef bleaching makes the identification of the most injured reefs \nfairly obvious. The difficult task then becomes what can be done to \nprevent such a loss in the future and what, if anything, can be done to \nrevive already damaged reefs?\n  I think this bill is a very good starting point. With this \nlegislation, Senator Snowe and I will put in place a way to provide \nresponsible and effective funding for coral reef conservation, \nmonitoring, research, and public education. One half of our country's \npopulation lives and works in a coastal community. This bill is good \nfor the environment and good for the many Americans who depend on the \nocean for their livelihoods. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 726. A bill to establish a matching grant program to help State \nand local jurisdictions purchase bullet resistant equipment for use by \nlaw enforcement departments; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act \n                                of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp our nation's state and local law enforcement officers acquire the \nbullet resistant equipment they need to protect themselves from would-\nbe killers.\n  I am joined today by my colleague, Senator Torricelli, as an original \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  This bill, the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police \nProtective Equipment Act of 1999,'' is based on S. 2253, which I \nintroduced in the 105th Congress. This bill is named in memory of Dale \nClaxton, a Cortez, Colorado, police officer who was fatally shot \nthrough the windshield of his patrol car last year. A bullet resistant \nwindshield could have saved his life.\n  Unfortunately, incidents like this are far from isolated. All across \nour nation law enforcement officers, whether in hot pursuit, driving \nthrough dangerous neighborhoods, or pulled over on the side of the road \nbehind an automobile, are at risk of being shot through their \nwindshields. We must do what we can to prevent these kinds of tragedies \nas better, lighter and more affordable types of bullet resistant glass \nand other equipment become available. For the purposes of this bill I \nuse the technically more accurate term ``bullet resistant'' instead of \nthe more commonplace ``bullet proof'' since, even though we all wish \nthey could be, few things are truly ``bullet proof.''\n  While I served as a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, California, \nI became personally aware of the inherent dangers law enforcement \nofficers encounter each day on the front lines. Now that I serve as a \nU.S. senator here in Washington, DC, I believe we should do what we can \nto help our law enforcement officers protect themselves as they risk \ntheir lives while protecting the American people from violent \ncriminals.\n  One important way we can do this is to help them acquire bullet \nresistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held bullet \nresistant shields and other life saving bullet resistant equipment. \nThis assistance is especially crucial for small local jurisdictions \nthat often lack the funds needed to provide their officers with the \nlife saving bullet resistant equipment they need.\n  The Officer Dale Claxton bill builds upon the successes of the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, S. 1605, which I introduced in \nthe 105th Congress and the president signed into law last June. This \nprogram provides matching grants to state and local law enforcement \nagencies to help them purchase body armor for their officers. This bill \nbuilds upon this worthy program by expanding it to help them acquire \nadditional types of bullet resistant equipment.\n\n  The bill I introduce today has four main components. The first part \nauthorizes continued funding for the current Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act program at $25 million per year.\n  The second and central part of this legislation authorizes a new $40 \nmillion matching grant program to help state, local, tribal and other \nsmall law enforcement agencies acquire bullet resistant equipment such \nas bullet resistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held \nbullet resistant shields and other life saving equipment.\n  The third component of this bill, as promoted by Senator Torricelli, \nwould authorize a $25 million matching grant program for the purchase \nof video cameras for use in law enforcement vehicles.\n  These three matching grants are authorized for fiscal years 2000 \nthrough 2002 and would be allocated by the Bureau of Justice Assistance \naccording to a formula that ensures fair distribution for all states, \nlocal communities, tribes and U.S. territories. To help ensure that \nthese matching grants get to the jurisdictions that need them the most \nthe bureau is directed to make at least half of the funds available to \nthose smaller jurisdictions whose budgets are the most financially \nconstrained.\n  The final key part of this bill provides the Justice Department's \nNational Institute of Justice (NIJ) with $3 million over 3 years to \nconduct an expedited research and development program to speed up the \ndeployment of new bullet resistant technologies and equipment. The \ndevelopment of new bullet resistant materials in the next few years \ncould be as revolutionary in the next few years as Kevlar was for body \narmor in the 1970s. Exciting new technologies such as bonded acrylic, \npolymers, polycarbons, aluminized material and transparent ceramics \npromise to provide for lighter, more versatile and hopefully less \nexpensive bullet resistant equipment.\n  The Officer Dale Claxton bill also directs the NIJ to inventory \nexisting technologies in the private sector, in surplus military \nproperty, and in use by other countries and to evaluate, develop \nstandards, establish testing guidelines, and promote technology \ntransfer.\n  Under the bill, the Institute would give priority in testing and \nfeasibility studies to law enforcement partnerships developed in \ncoordination with existing High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \n(HIDTAs).\n  Our nation's state, local and tribal law enforcement officers \nregularly put their lives in harm's way and deserve to have access to \nthe bullet resistant equipment they need. The Officer Dale Claxton bill \nwill both get life saving bullet resistant equipment deployed into the \nfield where it is needed and accelerate the development of new \nlifesaving bullet resistant technologies. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Dale Claxton Bullet \n     Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Officer Dale Claxton of the Cortez, Colorado, Police \n     Department was shot and killed by bullets that passed through \n     the windshield of his police car after he stopped a stolen \n     truck, and his life may have been saved\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\n     if his police car had been equipped with bullet resistant \n     equipment;\n       (2) the number of law enforcement officers who are killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States had access to \n     additional bullet resistant equipment;\n       (3) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n     enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       (4) the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the \n     risk of fatality to law enforcement officers while not \n     wearing bullet resistant equipment, such as an armor vest, is \n     14 times higher than for officers wearing an armor vest;\n       (5) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet-\n     resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 \n     law enforcement officers in the United States; and\n       (6) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply, despite a decrease in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of \n     law enforcement officers by helping State, local, and tribal \n     law enforcement agencies provide officers with bullet \n     resistant equipment and video cameras.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to exempt qualified current and former law enforcement \nofficers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms \nand to allow States to enter into compacts to recognize other States' \nconcealed weapons permits; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3457-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3457-S3516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                 Law Enforcement Protection Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to authorize \nStates to recognize each other's concealed weapons laws and exempt \nqualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws \nprohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms. This legislation is \ndesigned to support the rights of States and to facilitate the right of \nlaw-abiding citizens as well as law enforcement officers to protect \nthemselves, their families, and their property. I am pleased to be \njoined by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch as an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The language of this bill is based on my bill, S. 837, in the 105th \nCongress and is similar to a provision in S. 3, the Omnibus Crime \nControl Act of 1997, introduced by Senator Hatch. In light of the \nimportance of this provision to law-abiding gunowners and law \nenforcement officers, I am introducing this freestanding bill today for \nthe Senate's consideration and prompt action.\n  This bill allows States to enter into agreements, known as \n``compacts,'' to recognize the concealed weapons laws of those States \nincluded in the compacts. This is not a Federal mandate; it is strictly \nvoluntary for those States interested in this approach. States would \nalso be allowed to include provisions which best meet their needs, such \nas special provisions for law enforcement personnel.\n  This legislation would allow anyone possessing a valid permit to \ncarry a concealed firearm in their respective State to also carry it in \nanother State, provided that the States have entered into a compact \nagreement which recognizes the host State's right-to-carry laws. This \nis needed if you want to protect the security individuals enjoy in \ntheir own State when they travel or simply cross State lines to avoid a \ncrazy quilt of differing laws.\n  Currently, a Federal standard governs the conduct of nonresidents in \nthose States that do not have a right-to-carry statute. Many of us in \nthis body have always strived to protect the interests of States and \ncommunities by allowing them to make important decisions on how their \naffairs should be conducted. We are taking to the floor almost every \nday to talk about mandating certain things to the States. This bill \nwould allow States to decide for themselves.\n  Specifically, the bill allows that the law of each State govern \nconduct within that State where the State has a right-to-carry statute, \nand States determine through a compact agreement which out-of-State \nright-to-carry statute will be recognized.\n  To date, 31 States have passed legislation making it legal to carry \nconcealed weapons. These State laws enable citizens of those States to \nexercise their right to protect themselves, their families, and their \nproperty.\n  The second major provision of this bill would allow qualified current \nand former law enforcement officers who are carrying appropriate \nwritten identification of that status to be exempt from State laws that \nprohibit the carrying of concealed weapons. This provision sets forth a \nchecklist of stringent criteria that law enforcement officers must meet \nin order to qualify for this exemption status. Exempting qualified \ncurrent and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting \nthe carrying of concealed weapons, I believe, would add additional \nforces to our law enforcement community in our unwavering fight against \ncrime.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 727\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto increase the maximum term of imprisonment for offenses involving \nstolen firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many crimes in our country are being \ncommitted with stolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in \na number of recent studies and news reports. Therefore, today I am \nintroducing the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1999 to increase \nthe maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.\n  Reports indicate that almost half a million guns are stolen each \nyear. As of March 1995 there were over 2 million reports in the stolen \ngun file of the FBI's National Crime Information Center including 7,700 \nreports of stolen machine guns and submachine guns. In a 9 year period \nbetween 1985 and 1994, the FBI received an annual average of over \n274,000 reports of stolen guns.\n  Studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms \nnote that felons steal firearms to avoid background checks. A 1991 \nBureau of Justice Statistics survey of State prison inmates notes that \nalmost 10 percent had stolen a handgun, and over 10 percent of all \ninmates had traded or sold a stolen firearm.\n  This problem is especially alarming among young people. A Justice \nDepartment study of juvenile inmates in four states shows that over 50 \npercent of those inmates had stolen a gun. In the same study, gang \nmembers and drug sellers were more likely to have stolen a gun.\n  In my home State of Colorado, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation \nreceives over 500 reports of stolen guns each month. As of this month, \nthe Bureau has a total of 36,000 firearms on its unrecovered firearms \nlist. It is estimated that one-third of these firearms are categorized \nas handguns.\n\n  All these studies and statistics show the extent of the problem of \nstolen guns. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will increase \nthe maximum prison sentences for violation of existing stolen gun laws.\n  Specifically, my bill increases the maximum penalty for violating \nfour provisions of the firearms laws. Under title 18 of the U.S. Code, \nit is illegal to knowingly transport or ship a stolen firearm or stolen \nammunition. It is also illegal to knowingly receive, possess, conceal, \nstore, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen \nammunition.\n  The penalty for violating either of these provisions is a fine, a \nmaximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, or both. My bill increases \nthe maximum prison sentence to 15 years.\n  The third statutory provision makes it illegal to steal a firearm \nfrom a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer. For violating this \nprovision, the maximum term of imprisonment would be increased to a \nmaximum 15 years under by bill.\n  And the fourth provision makes it illegal to steal a firearm from any \nperson, including a licensed firearm collector, with a maximum penalty \nof 10 years imprisonment. As with the other three provisions, my bill \nincreases this maximum penalty to 15 years.\n  In addition to these amendments to title 18 of the U.S. Code, the \nbill I introduce today directs the United States Sentencing Commission \nto revise the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to these \nfirearms offenses.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding \ngun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tough penalties for the \nillegal use of firearms.\n  The Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1999 will send a strong \nsignal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. I \nurge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 728\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STOLEN FIREARMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 924 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(i), (j),''; and\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) Whoever knowingly violates subsection (i) or (j) of \n     section 922 shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not \n     more than 15 years, or both.'';\n       (2) in subsection (i)(1), by striking ``10 years'' and \n     inserting ``15 years''; and\n       (3) in subsection (l), by striking ``10 years'' and \n     inserting ``15 years''.\n       (b) Sentencing Commission.--The United States Sentencing \n     Commission shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n     reflect the amendments made by subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Murkowski,  Mr. Lott, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Burns, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        Hagel and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 729. A bill to ensure that Congress and the public have the right \nto participate in the declaration of national monuments on federal \nland; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         THE NATIONAL MONUMENT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nensures the public will have a say in the management of our public \nlands. I am pleased that Senators Murkowski, Lott, Stevens, Burns, \nGordon Smith, Crapo, Shelby, Hagel, and Bennett are joining me as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  After President Clinton's proclamation of four years ago, declaring \nnearly two million acres of southern Utah a national monument, I \nintroduced the Idaho Protection Act of 1999. That bill would have \nrequired that the public and the Congress be included before a national \nmonument could be established in Idaho. When I introduced that bill, I \nwas immediately approached by other Senators seeking the same \nprotection for their state. This bill, The National Monument Public \nParticipation Act, will provide that protection to all states.\n  The National Monument Public Participation Act amends the Antiquities \nAct to require the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to \nprovide an opportunity for public involvement prior to the designation \nof a national monument. It establishes procedures to give the public \nand local, State, and federal governments adequate notice and \nopportunity to comment on, and participate in, the formulation of plans \nfor the declaration of national monuments on public lands.\n  Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, the President has the unilateral \nauthority to create a national monument where none existed before. In \nfact, since 1906, the law has been used some 66 times to set lands \naside. It is important to note that with very few exceptions, these \ndeclarations occurred before enactment of the National Environmental \nPolicy Act of 1969, which recognized the need for public involvement in \nsuch issues and mandated public comment periods before such decisions \nare made.\n  The most recent use of the Antiquities Act came on September 18, \n1996, with Presidential Proclamation 6920, Establishment of the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument. Without including Utah's \nGovernor, Senators, congressional delegation, the State legislature, \ncounty commissioners, or the people of Utah--President Clinton set off-\nlimits forever approximately 1.7 million acres of Utah. What the \nPresident did in Utah, without public input, could also be done in \nIdaho or any other States where the federal government has a presence. \nThat must not be allowed to happen.\n  My state of Idaho is 63 percent federal lands. Within Idaho's \nboundaries, we have one National Historic Park, one National Reserve, \ntwo National Recreation Areas, and five Wilderness Areas, just to name \nthe major federally designated natural resource areas. This amounts to \napproximately 4.8 million acres, or to put things in perspective, the \nsize of the state of New Jersey. Each of these designations has had \npublic involvement and consent of Congress before being designated. As \nyou can tell, the public process has worked in the past, in my state, \nand I believe it will continue to work in the future.\n  In Idaho, each of these National designations generated concerns \namong those affected by the designation, but with the public process, \nwe were able to work through most of the concerns before the \ndesignation was made. Individuals who would be affected by the National \ndesignation had time to prepare, but Utah was not as fortunate. With \nthe overnight designation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National \nMonument, the local communities, and the State and federal agencies \nwere left to pick up the pieces and work out all the ``details.''\n  The President's action in Utah has been a wake-up call to people \nacross America.We all want to preserve what is best in our States, and \nI understand and support the need to protect valuable resources. That \nis why this bill will not, in any way, affect the ability of the \nfederal government to make emergency withdrawals under the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). If an area is truly worthy \nof a National Monument designation, Congress will make that designation \nduring the time frame provided in FLPMA.\n  Our public lands are a national asset that we all treasure and enjoy. \nWesterners are especially proud of their public lands and have a stake \nin the management of these lands, but people everywhere also understand \nthat much of their economic future is tied up in what happens on their \npublic lands.\n  In the West, where public lands dominate the landscape, issues such \nas grazing, timber harvesting, water use, and recreation access have \nall come under attack by this administration seemingly bent upon \nkowtowing to a segment of our population that wants these uses kicked \noff our public lands.\n  Everyone wants public lands decisions to be made in an open and \ninclusive process. No one wants the President, acting alone, to \nunilaterally lock up enormous parts of any State. We certainly don't \nwork that way in the West. There is a recognition that with common \nsense, a balance can be struck that allows jobs to grow and families to \nput down roots while at the same time protecting America's great \nnatural resources.\n  In my view, the President's actions in Utah were beyond the pale, and \nfor that reason--to protect others from suffering a similar fate I am \nintroducing this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 729\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Congress and the \n     public have the right and opportunity to participate in \n     decisions to declare national monuments on Federal land.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \nNational Monument Public Participation Act of 1999. This legislation \nputs the ``Public'' back into public land management and the \n``Environment'' back into environmental protection.\n  Passage of this Act will insure that all the gains we have made over \nthe past quarter century in creating an open participatory government \nwhich affords strong environmental protection for our public lands are \nprotected.\n  For those of you who thought those battles were fought and ``won'' \nwith the passage of National Environmental Protection Act in 1969, the \nFederal Land Policy Management Act in 1976, and the National Forest \nManagement Act of 1976, I have bad news. There is one last battle to be \nfought.\n  Standing in this very Chamber on January 30, 1975, Senator Henry M. \n``Scoop'' Jackson spoke to the passion Americans feel for their public \nlands. He said:\n\n       The public lands of the United States have always provided \n     the arena in which we American's have struggled to fulfill \n     our dreams. Even today dreams of wealth, adventure, and \n     escape are still being acted out on these far flung lands. \n     These lands and the dreams--fulfilled and unfulfilled--which \n     they foster are a part of our national destiny. They belong \n     to all Americans.\n\n  Amazingly, there exists today ``legal'' authorities by which the \nPresident, without public process or Congressional approval and without \nany environmental review, can create vast special management units. \nSpecial management units which can affect how millions of acres of our \npublic lands are managed, what people can do on these lands, and what \nthe future will be for surrounding communities.\n  This is a powerful trust to bestow upon anyone--even a President.\n  On September 12, 1996, the good people of Utah woke up to find \nthemselves the most recent recipient of a philosophy that says: ``Trust \nus we're from the federal government, and we know what's best for \nyou''. On that day, standing in the State of Arizona, the President \ninvoked the 1906 Antiquities Act to create a 1.7 million acre Nation \nMonument in Southern Utah. By using this antiquated law the President \nwas able to avoid this nation's environmental laws and ignore public \nparticipation laws. With one swipe of the pen, every shred of public \ninput and environmental law promulgated in this country over the past \nquarter of a century was shoved into the trash heap of political \nexpediency.\n  What happened in Utah is but the latest example of a small cadre of \nAdministration officials deciding for all Americans how our public \nlands should be used. It is a classic example of a backroom deal, \ncatering to special interests at the expense of the public. It is by no \nmeans the only one.\n  As a Senator from Alaska, I have a great deal of personal experience \nin this area. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter used this law to create \n``17'' National Monuments in Alaska covering more than 55 millions \nacres of land. This was followed in short order by this Secretary of \nthe Interior Cecil Andrus who withdrew an additional 50 million acres. \nAll this land was withdrawn from multiple uses without any input from \nthe people of Alaska, the public, or the Congress of the United States. \nAll this occurred while Congress was considering legislation affecting \nthese lands, while Congress was conducting workshops throughout Alaska \nand holding hearings in Washington, DC to involve the public.\n  With over 100 million acres of withdrawn land held over Alaska's head \nlike the sword of Damocles, we were forced to cut the best deal we \ncould. Twenty years later the people of my state are still struggling \nto cope with the weight of these decisions. President Carter cut his \ndeal for his special interests to avoid the public debate on \nlegislation, just as President Clinton did with the Grand Staircase/\nEscalante.\n  I would not be here this afternoon if the public, and Congress were \nnot systematically being denied a voice in the creation of National \nMonuments. I would not be here if environmental procedures were being \nfollowed. But the people of this nation are being denied the \nopportunity to speak, Congress is being denied its opportunity to \nparticipate, and environmental procedure are being ignored. The only \nvoice we hear is that of the President. Without bothering to ask what \nwe thought about it, he told the citizens of Utah and the rest of the \ncountry that he knew better than they what was best for them.\n  It has been a long time since anyone has had the right to make those \nkinds of unilateral public land use decisions for the American public. \nSince passage of the Forest Service Organic Act and the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act in 1976 we have had a rock hard system of law \non how public land use decisions are to be made. Embodied within these \nlaws are public participation. Agencies propose an action, they present \nthat action to the public, the public debates the issue, bad decisions \ncan be appealed, the courts resolve disputes, and finally the \nmanagement unit is created. Where was this public participation in the \nspecial use designation of 1.7 million acres of federal land in \nsouthern Utah?\n  Since the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969 \nactivities which effect the environment are subject to strict \nenvironmental reviews. Does anyone believe there is no environmental \nthreat posed by the creation of a national monument?\n  The economic and social consequences of this decision will have \nenormous and irrevocable impacts not only on the land immediately \naffected, but on surrounding lands and communities. All these effects \non the human environment would have been evaluated under the land \nmanagement statutes and the environmental procedural review. Where is \nthe NEPA compliance documentation associated with this action?\n  The Constitutions explicitly provides that ``The Congress shall have \nthe power to dispose of, and make all needful rules and regulations \nrespecting the territory or other property belonging to the United \nStates.'' The creation of specialized public use designations such as \nNational Parks and Wilderness Areas are debated within the Halls of \nCongress. These Debates provide for the financial and legal \nresponsibilities which come with the creation of special management \nunits. Where are the proceedings from those debates?\n  They simply do not exist because, in the heat of political \nexpediency, the Administration determined that public process, \nenvironmental analyses, and Congressional deliberations were a waste of \ntime.\n  Mr. President, either you believe in public process or you do not, \nyou can't have it both ways. We can no longer trust the Administration \nto involve the public in major land use decisions and we can no longer \ntolerate the blanket evasion of the laws designed to protect our \nnatural resources. The time has come for Congress to reassert its \nConstitutional responsibility under Article IV.\n  The legislation which Senator Craig and I offer today will require \nthat any future designations of National Monuments to follow the public \nparticipation principals laid down in law over the past 25 years.\n  No poetic images, no flowery words, no smoke and mirrors, no special \ncoverage on Good Morning America, just good old fashion public land \nmanagement process.\n  Before these special land management units can be created, our \nlegislation will require that agencies gather and analyze resource data \naffected by these land use decisions; that full public participation in \nthe designation of\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\nthe units takes place (with all appeal rights protected); that there be \ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act; and that \nCongress review and approve final designation. No longer will an \nadministration be able to side-step public participation and \nenvironmental reviews to further its political agenda and cater to \nspecial interest.\n  Nobody--not even the President--should be above the law. The National \nMonument Participation Act will make all future land use decisions a \njoint responsibility of the public through the Congress, that they \nelect. This legislation reasserts the Constitutional role of the \nCongress in public land decisions.\n  I do not question the need for National Monuments. If the national \nbenefit can be demonstrated, then by all means a national monument \nshould be created. But, if they are to serve the common good, they must \nbe created under the same system of land management law that has \nmanaged the use of the public domain for the past 25 years and pursuant \nto the document that has governed this Nation for the past 225 years.\n  There has always been a sacred bond between the American people and \nthe lands they hold in common ownership. No one-regardless of high \nstation or political influence--has the right to impose his will over \nthe means by which the destiny of those land is decided.\n  This legislation re-establishes that bond.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my \ncolleagues in introducing The National Monument Participation Act of \n1999. This bill would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 to clearly \nestablish the roles for public participation and Congressional \ninvolvement in declaring national monuments on federal lands. This bill \nrequires specific processes and requirements to ensure that the public, \nlocal, state, and Federal government are both informed and involved in \nthe formulation of any plans to declare national monuments on federal \nlands.\n  It requires that the public be actively involved in the formulation \nof any plans to declare a national monument. Considering the recent \ncontroversy surrounding the designation of monuments with the stroke of \na pen rather than through open debate and assessment, it only makes \nsense to include the public in any future designation decisions. I \nremind my colleagues and the administration that we are managing our \nland resources for the people. This bill suggests that perhaps we \nshould listen to them before drastically changing the management of our \nland resources.\n  Additionally, the legislation requires that the Secretary of the \nInterior and the Secretary of Agriculture perform an assessment of \ncurrent land uses on the land proposed for designation. This is \nnecessary to provide information about the impact of declaring any \nnational monument before recommendations are made by the President. It \nmakes absolutely no sense to pursue designation changes without \nlearning what is at stake. What mineral interests are affected? Does it \nchange traditional grazing uses? These are questions that will have to \nbe answered before new monuments are designated.\n  The legislation also requires that we look at the impact a monument \nwould have on state or private land holdings. Once again, common sense \nis needed. If the federal designation change affects state an private \nlands, Congress must be informed of these impacts before a decision is \nfinally reached. It is irresponsible to make decisions without the \nproper information.\n  Finally, this legislation would require the President to submit his \ndecision on these recommendations to the Congress for final review and \napproval. If we are going to change our designations and impact local \ncommunities, Congress must weigh in on the decision.\n  Public involvement in federal decision making is critical today to \nensure that local citizens are involved in the decision changing how \nfederal lands near their homes are used. This bill will mandate broader \ninvolvement to ensure the public and the legislative branch have an \nopportunity to participate in any plans to establish new national \nmonuments on federal lands. In addition, this ensures the information \nis available for the public and ourselves to understand the impacts of \nany proposed declaration and make an informed decision.\n  Overall, I believe this bill establishes a clear set of roles and \nresponsibilities for all parties involved in the declaration of new \nnational monuments on federal lands to ensure that such decisions are \nmade in a manner that respects the rights of both local communities and \nthe interests of the nation as a whole. I encourage my colleagues to \ncarefully examine this legislation and lend their support to its \nultimate passage.\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-\nsponsor of the National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999. I \ncommend my colleague, Senator Craig, for bringing forward this \nimportant measure and am pleased to offer it my support.\n  The National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999 will establish \nguidelines for public and local, State, and federal government \ninvolvement in the designation and planning of national monuments. \nCurrently, under the 1906 Antiquities Act, the President has the \nauthority to proclaim a national monument and determine its composition \nand scope without any prior or subsequent public involvement. Although \nthis authority has rarely been invoked since the implementation of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which mandates public \ncomment periods prior to federal land management actions, the recent \nexercise of this authority by the current Administration has called \nattention to the need to revise the Antiquities Act. These proposed \namendments to the Antiquities Act reflect the contemporary recognition \nthat public involvement in federal land management decisions is both \nproper and beneficial.\n  This measure, beyond requiring the Secretaries of the Interior and \nAgriculture to include the public and the different levels of \ngovernment in the decision to designate and form national monuments, \nalso directs the Secretaries to research and make available information \nabout the land to be designated. Factors such as the mineral values \npresent and identification of existing rights held on federal lands \nwithin the area to be designated have an obvious bearing on the \ndecision of whether designation is appropriate and, if it is, how it \nshould be structured. An understanding of these factors should be a \npart of an inclusive decision-making process and, hence, it is \nappropriate to require that they be explored and publicly shared prior \nto the designation of a national monument.\n  The strongest protection, however, that the National Monument Public \nParticipation Act of 1999 provides for public oversight of national \nmonument designation is the requirement that any recommendation of the \nPresident for declaration of land as a national monument shall become \neffective only if so provided by an Act of Congress. By subjecting \nproposals for monument designations to congressional approval, this Act \nensures that when national monuments are established they are truly \nsupported, both nationally and by local communities. This Act provides \nan important level of protection for public involvement in land use \nissues and I am pleased to offer it my support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 730. A bill to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \npromulgate fire safety standards for cigarettes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    fire safe cigarette act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the First Safe \nCigarette Act of 1999. This legislation would solve a serious fire \nsafety problem, namely, fires that are caused by a carelessly discarded \ncigarette.\n  The statistics regarding cigarette-related fires are truly startling. \nIn 1996 there were 169,500 cigarette-related first that resulted in \n1,181 deaths, 2,931 injuries and $452 million in property damage. \nAccording to the National Fire Protection Association, one out of every \nfour fire deaths in the United States in 1996 was attributed to tobacco \nproducts.\n  In my state of Illinois, cigarette-related fires have also caused too \nmany senseless tragedies. In 1997, alone, there were more than 1,700 \ncigarette-related fires, of which more than 900\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\nwere in people's homes. These fires led to 109 injuries and 8 deaths. \nAlso in 1997, smoking-related fires in Illinois led to property loss of \nmore than $10.4 million. According to statistics from the U.S. Fire \nAdministration, half of the known residential fire deaths in Illinois \nfrom 1993 to 1995 were from arson and careless smoking. During that \nthree-year period, 69 deaths in Illinois were attributed to careless \nsmoking.\n  A Technical Study Group (TSG) was created by the Federal Cigarette \nSafety Act in 1984 to investigate the technological and commercial \nfeasibility of creating a self-extinguishing cigarette. This group was \nmade up of representatives of government agencies, the cigarette \nindustry, the furniture industry, public health organizations and fire \nsafety organizations. The TSG produced two reports that concluded that \nit is technically feasible to reduce the ignition propensity of \ncigarettes.\n  The manufacture of less fire-prone cigarettes may require some \nadvances in cigarette design and manufacturing technology, but the \ncigarette companies have demonstrated their capability to make \ncigarettes of reduced ignition propensity with no increase in tar, \nnicotine or carbon monoxide in the smoke. For example, six current \ncommercial cigarettes have been tested which already have reduced \nignition propensity. The technology is in place now to begin developing \na performance standard for less fire prone cigarettes. Furthermore, the \noverall impact on other aspects of the United States society and \neconomy will be minimal. Thus, it may be possible to solve this problem \nat costs that are much less than the potential benefits, which are \nsaving lives and avoiding injuries and property damage.\n  The Fire Safe Cigarette Act would give the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission the authority to promulgate a fire safety standard for \ncigarettes. Eighteen months after the legislation is enacted, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission would issue a rule creating a safety \nstandard for cigarettes. Thirty months after the legislation is \nenacted, the standards would become effective for the manufacture and \nimportation of cigarettes.\n  Here are some examples of changes that could be made to cigarettes \nthat would reduce the likelihood of fire ignition: reduced \ncircumference or thinner cigarettes, making the paper less porous, \nchanging the density of the tobacco in cigarettes, and eliminating or \nreducing the citrate added to the cigarette paper. Also, there is \nlimited evidence suggesting that the presence of a filter may reduce \nignition propensity. Again, there are cigarettes on the market right \nnow that show some of these characteristics and are less likely to \nsmolder and cause fires.\n  While the number of people killed each year by fires is dropping \nbecause of safety improvements and other factors, too many Americans \nare dying because of a product that could be less likely to catch fire \nif simple changes were made. I strongly believe that this issue demands \nimmediate and swift action in order to prevent further deaths and \ninjuries.\n  An industry that can afford to spend more than $4 billion in \nadvertising every year cannot claim it would be too expensive to make \nthese changes. It is not unreasonable to ask these companies to make \ntheir products less likely to burn down a house.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 730\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for substantial reductions in the price of \nprescription drugs for medicare beneficiaries; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             the prescription drug fairness for seniors act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are well on our way to doubling the \nbudget of the National Institutes of Health. Scientists are discovering \nnew cures and developing new therapies for previously incurable and \nuntreatable illnesses on a regular basis. Breakthrough medications are \nmodern medical miracles that allow people with previously crippling \nconditions to lead normal lives. Yet too many of our nation's elderly \ncitizens are denied access to these life-saving and life-improving \ntherapies because they lack basic coverage for prescription \nmedications.\n  Today I am introducing the ``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors \nAct of 1999,'' the Senate companion bill to H.R. 664, introduced in the \nHouse last month by Representatives Tom Allen, Jim Turner, Marion \nBerry, Henry Waxman, and sixty-one other House Members. This \nlegislation responds to the need for affordable prescription drugs for \nsenior citizens by requiring pharmaceutical companies to make the same \ndiscounts available to senior citizens that are offered to their most \nfavored customers. Prescription drugs represent the largest single \nsource of out-of-pocket costs for health services paid for by the \nelderly. The Prescription Drug Fairness Act will provide significant \nbenefits to elderly citizens struggling to pay for the prescription \ndrugs they need.\n  This Act represents one important way to improve senior citizens' \naccess to affordable medications. Other steps are necessary as well to \ndeal with the overall prescription drug crisis facing millions of \nelderly citizens. I plan to introduce legislation soon that will offer \nadditional protections. Providing fair access to prescription drugs for \nsenior citizens is a high priority, and I hope to see quick action by \nCongress on this critical issue this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 731\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prescription Drug Fairness \n     for Seniors Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price \n     discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to \n     pay substantially more for prescription drugs than the drug \n     manufacturers' most favored customers, such as health \n     insurers, health maintenance organizations, and the Federal \n     Government.\n       (2) On average, older Americans who buy their own \n     prescription drugs pay twice as much for prescription drugs \n     as the drug manufacturers' most favored customers. In some \n     cases, older Americans pay over 15 times more for \n     prescription drugs than the most favored customers.\n       (3) The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers \n     sustains their annual profits of $20,000,000,000, but causes \n     financial hardship and impairs the health and well-being of \n     millions of older Americans. More than 1 in 8 older Americans \n     are forced to choose between buying their food and buying \n     their medicines.\n       (4) Most federally funded health care programs, including \n     medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, the Public \n     Health Service, and the Indian Health Service, obtain \n     prescription drugs for their beneficiaries at low prices. \n     Medicare beneficiaries are denied this benefit and cannot \n     obtain their prescription drugs at the favorable prices \n     available to other federally funded health care programs.\n       (5) Implementation of the policy set forth in this Act is \n     estimated to reduce prescription drug prices for medicare \n     beneficiaries by more than 40 percent.\n       (6) In addition to substantially lowering the costs of \n     prescription drugs for older Americans, implementation of the \n     policy set forth in this Act will significantly improve the \n     health and well-being of older Americans and lower the costs \n     to the Federal taxpayer of the medicare program.\n       (7) Older Americans who are terminally ill and receiving \n     hospice care services represent some of the most vulnerable \n     individuals in our Nation. Making prescription drugs \n     available to medicare beneficiaries under the care of \n     medicare-certified hospices will assist in extending the \n     benefits of lower prescription drug prices to those most \n     vulnerable and in need.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect \n     medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug \n     manufacturers and to make prescription drugs available to \n     medicare beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices.\n\n     SEC. 3. PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each participating manufacturer of a \n     covered outpatient drug shall make available for purchase by \n     each pharmacy such covered outpatient drug in the amount \n     described in subsection (b) at the price described in \n     subsection (c).\n       (b) Description of Amount of Drugs.--The amount of a \n     covered outpatient drug that a participating manufacturer \n     shall make available for purchase by a pharmacy is an amount \n     equal to the aggregate amount of the covered outpatient drug \n     sold or distributed by the pharmacy to medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       (c) Description of Price.--The price at which a \n     participating manufacturer shall make a covered outpatient \n     drug available for purchase by a pharmacy is the price equal \n     to the lower of the following:\n       (1) The lowest price paid for the covered outpatient drug \n     by any agency or department of the United States.\n       (2) The manufacturer's best price for the covered \n     outpatient drug, as defined in section 1927(c)(1)(C) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8(c)(1)(C)).\n\n     SEC. 4. SPECIAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO HOSPICE PROGRAMS.\n\n       For purposes of determining the amount of a covered \n     outpatient drug that a participating manufacturer shall make \n     available for purchase by a pharmacy under section 3, there \n     shall be included in the calculation of such amount the \n     amount of the covered outpatient drug sold or distributed by \n     a pharmacy to a hospice program. In calculating such amount, \n     only amounts of the covered outpatient drug furnished to a \n     medicare beneficiary enrolled in the hospice program shall be \n     included.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Edward M. Kennedy, today by introducing the ``Prescription Drug \nFairness for Seniors Act of 1999''. Earlier this year, Representatives \nTom Allen, Jim Turner, Marion Barry, and Henry Waxman were joined by \nsixty-one of their colleagues when they introduced H.R. 664, ``The \nPrescription Drug Fairness For Seniors Act of 1999'' in the U.S. House \nof Representatives.\n  This legislation addresses the critical issue facing our older \nAmericans--the cost of their prescription drugs. Studies have shown \nthat older Americans spend almost three times as much of their income \n(21%) on health care than those under the age of 65 (8%), and more than \nthree-quarters of Americans aged 65 and over are taking prescription \ndrugs. Even more alarming is the fact that seniors and others who buy \ntheir own prescription drugs, are forced to pay over twice as much for \ntheir drugs as are the drug manufacturers' most favored customers, such \nas the federal government and large HMOs.\n  The ``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act'' will protect \nsenior citizens from drug price discrimination and make prescription \ndrugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at substantially reduced \nprices. The legislation achieves these goals by allowing pharmacies \nthat serve Medicare beneficiaries to purchase prescription drugs at the \nlow prices available under the Federal Supply Schedule, similar to the \nVeterans Administration, Public Health Service and Indian Health \nService. Estimated to reduce prescription drug prices for seniors by \nover 40%, this bill will help those seniors who often times have to \nmake devastating choices between buying food or medications. Choices \nthat no human being should have to make.\n  Research and development of new drug therapies is an important and \nnecessary tool towards improving a persons quality of life. But due to \nthe high price tag that often accompanies the latest drug therapies, \nseniors are often left without access to these new therapies, and \nultimately, in far too many instances, without access to medication at \nall. This legislation is an important step towa4rds restoring the \naccess to affordable medications for our medicare beneficiaries. I look \nforward to working on this important issue in the months to come and \nhope that Congress will work swiftly in a bipartisan manner to enact \nlegislation that will benefit millions of senior citizens across our \nnation.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to joint my colleagues, \nSenators Kennedy, Johnson, Leahy, Wellstone, Inouye, Kerry and others \nin introducing the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act.\n  Mr. President, the sky-rocketing cost of prescription drugs has long \nbeen among the top 2 or 3 issues my constituents in Wisconsin call and \nwrite to me about. The problem of expensive prescription drugs is \nparticularly acute among Wisconsin senior citizens who live on fixed \nincomes. Nationally, prescription drugs are Senior Citizens' largest \nsingle out-of-pocket health care expenditure: the average Senior spends \n$100-$200 month on prescription drugs.\n  As you may know, Mr. President, last fall, a study by the House \nGovernment Reform and Oversight Committee found that the average price \nseniors pay for prescription drugs is twice as high as that enjoyed by \nfavored customers--big purchasers such as HMOs and the federal \ngovernment. The Committee's report found a price differential in one \ncase was 1400%, meaning that the retail price a typical senior citizen \nwas $27.05, while the favored customer was charged only $1.75.\n  To be sure, Mr. President, the Committee's report did find that \nWisconsin had lower price differentials compared to other parts of the \ncountry, an 85% differential compared to a high of 123% in California. \nBut I think my constituents would find that a pretty hollow \ndistinction. There's no doubt in my mind that paying 85% more than \nothers are charged for the same product is unfair, plain and simple.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, traditional Medicare does not cover \nprescription drugs. While some Medicare managed care plans offer a \nprescription drug benefit, few of those managed care plans operate in \nWisconsin or in other largely rural states. So, while pharmaceutical \ncompanies give lower prices to favored customers who buy in bulk, small \ncommunity pharmacies such as we have throughout Wisconsin lack this \npurchasing power, meaning that Seniors who purchase their prescription \ndrugs at those small pharmacies get the high prices passed on to them.\n  Mr. President, I regularly get calls from Seniors on tight, fixed \nincomes who tell me that they have to choose between buying groceries \nand buying their prescription drugs. I would guess that many of my \ncolleagues receive similar calls from their constituents. Calls like \nthese, and the fact that prices are only getting higher as scientific \nadvances develop new medications, tell me that we must take action to \nmake prescription drugs more affordable to Seniors.\n  The legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today will \nrequire that pharmaceutical companies offer senior citizens the same \ndiscounts that they offer to their most favored customers. Through this \nlegislation, we take an important step in making costly but vitally \nimportant prescription drugs more affordable to the Seniors who need \nthem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 732. A bill to require the Inspector General of the Department of \nDefense to conduct an audit of purchases of military clothing and \nrelated items made during fiscal year 1998 by certain military \ninstallations of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                        buy american legislation\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will help ensure that American soldiers are using \nAmerican made products. ``Buy American'' laws guarantee that our \nnation's military has access to a reliable domestic supply of uniforms, \ncoats, and other apparel. This critical national security requirement \nhas allowed U.S. garment manufacturers to consistently provide our \narmed forces with high-quality, durable clothing products made to exact \nmilitary specifications.\n  Last year, I was deeply troubled to learn that an Inspector General \naudit found that 59 percent of government contracts at 12 military \norganizations failed to include the appropriate clause to implement Buy \nAmerica laws. The results of this audit indicates a high likelihood \nthat there have been widespread violations of these laws throughout the \nmilitary.\n  In response to these findings, I have introduced legislation \ndirecting the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (DoD) to \nconduct an audit of fiscal year 1998 procurements of military clothing \nby four installations of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. \nThese audits will help determine whether contracting officers are \ncomplying with the law when they procure military clothing and related \nitems.\n  Mr. President, the Buy American laws are an invaluable tool for \nensuring our military readiness while supporting American jobs. Most of \nthese jobs are created by small U.S. contractors. This legislation will \nprovide an important follow-up audit to determine whether DoD is \neffectively enforcing the Buy American laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask at this time that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 732\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enact the Passaic River Basin Flood Management \nProgram; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n         Protection and Improvement of the Passaic River Basin\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator \nLautenberg, to introduce a bill to create a comprehensive flood \nmanagement plan for the Passaic River Basin.\n  In 1990, Congress, with my support, authorized a plan to create a 21-\nmile long tunnel, which would have stretched from Wayne to Newark Bay \nto divert flood water from the Pompton and Passaic Rivers in New \nJersey. At the time it was believed that the tunnel was the best method \nto end recurring floods that caused deaths and property losses for the \nregion's 2.5 million residents.\n  Flooding has plagued the Passaic River Basin since colonial times. \nThe State of New Jersey attempted to present solutions to the public as \nearly as 1870 with no success. After major floods in 1902 and 1903, a \nseries of engineering studies were completed but never implemented. In \n1936, the Corps of Engineers were directed by Congress to solve the \nflooding problems. Since that time (63 years), several proposals have \nbeen presented only to be rejected. Flooding in the Passaic River \nBasin, in 1993, caused $15 million in damage. The last major flooding, \nin 1984, killed three people, caused 9,400 evacuations and $425 million \nin damage.\n  Ten years ago, I supported the tunnel plan. I believed that it was \nthe best possible answer for the region. I understood the plan for the \ntunnel to be environmentally and economically sound, and the most \nprotective option for the public's health. It promised to create jobs \nfor the region and solve the persistent flooding within the Passaic \nRiver Basin, which encompasses 132 towns in 10 counties.\n  It has now become clear that this project is no longer viable and \ndoes not enjoy the support of the state or most of the surrounding \ncommunities. So last year, along with so many other of my fellow New \nJerseyans, I came to the realization that the flood tunnel was not the \nanswer for the Passaic. At a cost of $1.8 billion, the plan was too \nexpensive. As a matter of engineering, it was too complex. As a matter \nof environmental protection, it was too uncertain. More importantly, \nafter countless hearings, counties and municipalities within the \nPassaic River Basin rejected the current plan.\n  It will be far less costly and more environmentally sound to control \nthe flooding by shoring up the banks of the Passaic and Ramapo Rivers \nand purchasing properties in the flood zone so the river's natural \nwetlands may rebound. We should also fund plans to reduce flooding from \ncombined sewer overflow systems in the state's older, larger cities, \nwhich dump raw sewage into waterways during heavy rainfall. Our plan \nwould be more cost effective and more environmentally acceptable than \nthe flood tunnel.\n  The proposed Passaic River Basin Flood Management Program selects a \nqualified acquisition and hazard mitigation plan as the preferred \nalternative for flood control in the Passaic River Basin, superseding \nthe Passaic River flood tunnel.\n  The plan calls for acquiring freshwater wetlands in the State of New \nJersey and lands in the Highlands Province of the States of New Jersey \nand New York to prevent increased flooding. In key sections of the \nfloodplain of the Central Passaic River Basin structures would be \nacquired, demolished, removed or floodproofed. The plan also calls for \nthe acquisition of river front land from Little Falls to Newark Bay \nalong the Passaic River Basin. The plan would also authorize assistance \nin the implementation of remedial actions for the combined sewer \noverflows in the lower Passaic River Basin from the Great Falls to \nNewark Bay. Finally, it established an Oversight Committee for the \nimplementation of the Program, and reaffirms authorization for \ncompletion of Joseph G. Minish Passaic River Waterfront Park and \nHistoric Area, New Jersey.\n  The original legislation that created the tunnel, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1990, also authorized many other very important \nprojects for the Passaic River Basin region. The Streambank project \ncalled for the construction of environmental and other restoration \nmeasures, including bulkheads, recreation, greenbelt, and scenic \noverlook facilities. The Wetlands Bank program developed initiatives to \nrestore, acquire, preserve, study, and enhance wetlands.\n  I want to make clear that our interest in this legislation is only to \nreplace construction of the tunnel with a more environmentally and \neconomically appropriate plan. I still support, and will continue to \nsupport, those sections of the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 \nthat address issues other than the flood tunnel. Programs, such as the \nStreambank project and the Wetlands Bank, remain important building \nblocks for creating an effective flood management plan for the Passaic \nRiver Basin.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 734. A bill entitled the ``National Discovery Trails Act of \n1999''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 National Discovery Trails Act of 1999\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, trails are one of America's most \npopular recreational resources. Millions of Americans hike, ski, jog, \nbike, ride horses, drive snow machines and all-terrain vehicles, \nobserve nature, commute, and relax on trails throughout the country. A \nvariety of trails are provided nationwide, including urban bike paths, \nbridle paths, community green ways, historic trails, motorized trails, \nand long distance hiking trails.\n  The American Discovery Trail, or ADT, will be established by this \nlegislation. The ADT is being proposed as a continuous, coast to coast \ntrail to link the nation's principal north-south trails and east-west \nhistoric trails with shorter local and regional trails into a \nnationwide network.\n  By establishing a system of Discovery Trails, this new category will \nrecognize that using and enjoying trails close to home is equally as \nimportant as traversing remote wilderness trails. Long-distance trails \nare used mostly by people living close to the trail and by week-\nend'ers. Backpacking excursions are normally a few days to a couple of \nweeks. For example, of the estimated four million users of the \nAppalachian Trail each year, only about 100 to 150 walk the entire \ntrail annually. This will be true of the American Discovery Trail as \nwell, especially because of it proximity to urban locations throughout \nthe country.\n  The ADT, the first of the Discovery Trails, will connect six of the \nnational scenic trails, 10 of the national historic trails, 23 of the \nnational recreational trails and hundreds of other local and regional \ntrails. Until now, the element that has been missing in order to create \na national system of ``connected'' trails is that the existing trails \nfor the most part are not connected.\n  The ADT is about access. The trail will connect people to large \ncities, small towns and urban areas and to mountains, forest, desert \nand natural areas by incorporating local, regional and national trails \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\n  What makes the ADT so exciting is the way it has already brought \npeople together. More than 100 organizations along the trail's 6,000 \nmiles support the effort. Each state the trail passes through already \nhas a volunteer coordinator who leads an active ADT committee. This \nstrong grassroots effort, along with financial support from Backpacker \nmagazine, Eco USA, The Coleman Company and others have helped take the \nADT from dream to reality.\n  Only one more very important step on the trail needs to be taken. \nCongress needs to authorize the trail as part of our National Trails \nSystem.\n  The American Discovery Trail begins (or ends) with your two feet in \nthe Pacific Ocean at Point Reyes National Seashore, just north of San \nFrancisco. Next are Berkeley and Sacramento before the climb to the \nPacific Crest National Scenic Trail and Lake Tahoe, in the middle of \nthe Sierra Nevada Mountains.\n  Nevada will offer Historic Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode, \nthe Pony Express National Historic Trail, Great Basin National Park \nwith Lehman Caves and Wheeler Peak.\n  Utah will provide National Forests and Parks along with spectacular \nred rock country, until you get to Colorado and Colorado National \nMonument and its 20,445 acres of sandstone monoliths and canyons. Then \nthere's Grand Mesa over Scofield Pass, and Crested Butte, in the heart \nof ski country as you follow the Colorado and Continental Divide Trails \ninto Evergreen.\n  At Denver the ADT divides and becomes the Northern and Southern \nMidwest routes. The Northern Midwest Route winds through Nebraska, \nIowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. The Southern Midwest Route leaves \nColorado and the Air Force Academy and follows the tracks and wagon \nwheel ruts of thousands of early pioneers through Kansas and Missouri \nas well as settlements and historic places in Illinois, Indiana, \nKentucky until the trail joins the Northern route in Cincinnati.\n  West Virginia is next, then Maryland to the C Canal into Washington \nD.C. The Trail passes the Mall, the White House, the Capitol, and then \nheads on to Annapolis. Finally, in Delaware, the ADT reaches its \neastern terminus at Cape Henlopen State Park and the Atlantic Ocean.\n  Between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans one will experience some of \nthe most spectacular scenery in the world, thousands of historic sites, \nlakes, rivers and streams of every size. The trail offers an \nopportunity to discover America from small towns, to rural countryside, \nto large metropolitan areas,\n  When the President signs this legislation into law, a twelve year \neffort will have been achieved--the American Discovery Trail will have \nbecome a reality. The more people who use it, the better.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 735. A bill to protect children from firearms violence; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             children's gun violence prevention act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Boxer, \nSenator Durbin, and Senator Schumer in introducing the Children's Gun \nviolence Prevention Act of 1999.\n  The continuing epidemic of gun violence involving children demands \naction by Congress. The School tragedies in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, \nOregon, Kentucky, and Mississippi in the last year are still very much \nin the nation's mind and on the nation's conscience. We deplore the \nsenseless injury and loss of life, the families torn apart, and the \ncommunities in fear.\n  Sadly and tragically, the horrific shootings of last year do not tell \nthe whole story. The fact is: We are losing 13 children every day in \nthis country to gunshot wounds. Think about that--13 children die every \nsingle day because of guns. We must do more--much more--to prevent this \nsenseless loss of children's lives.\n  We require aspirin bottles to be child-proof. We know how to make \nhandguns child-proof too--and it is long past time we did so.\n  The legislation we propose today is an important step in meeting our \nresponsibility for the safety of children. We can take common sense, \nreasonable steps to keep children safer from gun violence by developing \nand using cutting-edge technology and by educating families and \ncommunities about preventing gun violence involving children.\n  This legislation will help all of us to deal more responsibly with \nthis festering crisis. Under this proposal, gun owners must take \nresponsibility for securing their guns, so that children cannot use \nthem. Gun dealers must be more vigilant in not selling guns and \nammunition to children. Child-proof safety locks must be used. Other \nchild safety features for guns must be developed.\n  America does more today to regulate the safety of toy guns than real \nguns--and it is a national disgrace. Practical steps can clearly be \ntaken to protect children more effectively from guns, and to achieve \ngreater responsibility by parents, gun manufacturers and gun dealers. \nThis legislation calls for such steps--and it deserves to be enacted \nthis year by this Congress.\n  I urge the Senate to act quickly on this important legislation, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to bring it to a vote. I ask \nunanimous consent that a more detailed description of the bill may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, of follows:\n\n         Summary of the Children's Gun Violence Prevention Act\n\n\n               title i: the children's firearm safety act\n\n       The bill establishes, after 18 months, new safety standards \n     on the manufacture and importation of handguns, requiring a \n     child-resistant trigger, a child resistant safety lock, a \n     magazine safety, a manual safety, and satisfactory compliance \n     with a drop test.\n       The bill authorizes the Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     to study, test, and evaluate various technologies and means \n     of making guns more child-resistant, and to report to \n     Congress within 12 months on its findings.\n\n\n                 title ii: children's firearm age limit\n\n       The bill prohibits the sale of an assault weapon to anyone \n     under the age of 18, and increases the criminal penalties for \n     selling a gun to a juvenile.\n\n\n            title iii: responsibilities of firearms dealers\n\n       The bill requires the automatic revocation of the license \n     of any dealer found to have willfully sold a gun to a \n     juvenile.\n       It requires two forms of identification, including one \n     government issued, for purchasers under the age of 24.\n       It requires gun store owners to implement minimum safety \n     and security standards to prevent the theft of firearms.\n\n\n             title iv: children's firearm access prevention\n\n       The bill imposes fines on a gun owner of up to $10,000 if a \n     child gains access to a loaded firearm, and criminal \n     penalties of up to one year in prison if the gun is used in \n     an act of violence.\n\n\n            title v: children's firearm injury surveillance\n\n       The bill authorizes $25 million over five years to be used \n     for the creation and implementation of a children's firearm \n     surveillance system by the Injury Prevention Center of the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n         title vi: children's gun violence prevention education\n\n       The bill creates an education program with the help of \n     parent-teacher organizations, local law enforcement, and \n     community-based organizations. The program will teach \n     children what to do if they hear that a classmate has brought \n     a gun to school, or if they are faced with a violent \n     situation.\n\n\n                 title vii: children's firearm tracking\n\n       The bill expands the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction \n     Initiative and creates a grant program for local law \n     enforcement agencies for the tracing of guns used in juvenile \n     crime.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 737. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide States with options for providing family planning services and \nsupplies to women eligible for medical assistance under the Medicaid \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 family planning state flexibility act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator \nFeinstein in introducing the Family Planning State Flexibility Act, \nlegislation to give states the option to expand their family planning \ncoverage under Medicaid.\n  Family planning reduces the rate of unintended pregnancies and \nabortions by providing women with the knowledge and supplies necessary \nto time\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\ntheir pregnancies to protect their health and the health of their \nchildren. The importance of family planning is clear. According to a \nstudy recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine women \nwho wait 18 to 23 months after delivery before conceiving their next \nchild lower the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including low birth \nweight, pre-term birth and small size for gestational age. In addition, \nwomen who wait less than six months between pregnancies are 40% more \nlikely to have premature newborns and 30% to 40% more likely to have \nsmall babies.\n  In addition to improving health outcomes for childbearing women and \ntheir children, family planning is cost effective. Studies have found \nthat for every $1 of public funds invested in family planning, $3 are \nsaved in pregnancy and other related costs. This is particularly \nimportant for the Medicaid Program, which currently pays for 38% of all \nbirths in this country.\n  Recognizing that family planning is a vital service to women, a 1972 \namendment to the Medicaid statute mandated inclusion of family planning \nservices and supplies to women who are eligible for the program. Each \nstate is free to determine the specific services and supplies provided. \nIt is important to note that abortions are not considered a family \nplanner service. Congress further noted the importance of family \nplanning services by requiring the federal government to reimburse \nstates for 90% of their family planning expenditures.\n  Eligible women are either those with children who have income below a \nthreshold set by the state or those who are pregnant and have incomes \nup to 133% of poverty. States currently have the option to raise the \nincome limit for pregnant women to 185% of poverty. Women who qualify \nfor Medicaid due to pregnancy are currently eligible for family \nplanning services for six months after delivery.\n  Recognizing the importance of family planning beyond the six month \npost-partum period, many states have applied for waivers to extend \ntheir coverage period or to include additional groups of women in the \nprogram. Thirteen states are currently operating under family planning \nwaivers. Unfortunately, the waiver process can be extremely cumbersome \nand time consuming, which may discourage states from applying.\n  Our bill would allow states to expand their family planning coverage \nto women who earn up to 185% of poverty without having to spend the \ntime and resources going through the waiver application process. States \nwhich are currently operating under waivers allowing for coverage of \nwomen who have higher incomes would continue using their current limit.\n  Family planning reduces unwanted pregnancies and abortions, improves \nthe health of women and their children, reduces welfare dependency and \nis cost effective. I am very proud of this legislation which would \nprovide these vital services to increased numbers of low-income women. \nI ask unanimous consent that the legislation and a congressional \nrationale be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Non-pregnant women should be put on parity with \n     pregnant women with regard to coverage of family planning \n     services.\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nwith Senator Chafee to enable states to extend family planning services \nwithout getting a federal waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  Under our bill, states could do two things they cannot do under \ncurrent law without the waiver of federal rules:\n  (1) States could expand by income level coverage for family planning \nservices to ``near-poor'' women, women whose incomes are slightly above \nthe currently allowed levels; and\n  (2) States could provide family planning for more than 60 days after \na woman delivers a baby.\n  Our bill will enable states to automatically take these two steps \nwithout getting a federal waiver.\n  Every year in this country, there are 3 million pregnancies, half of \nwhich are unintended. To a poor woman, struggling to find a job, keep a \njob, or provide for the children she already has, an unplanned \npregnancy can be devastating. In an effort to reduce unintended \npregnancies, Medicaid provides a higher federal matching rate (90 \npercent, instead of the roughly 50 percent, in federal funds) for \nfamily planning services. This bill can further enhance these goals by \npreventing pregnancies and by helping women plan their pregnancies.\n  In addition, family planning saves money. Ironically, under current \nlaw, the group of women whom this bill covers become eligible for \nMedicaid once they are pregnant, so Medicaid then pays for their \nprenatal care, their delivery and 60 days of family planning following \ndelivery. Medicaid pays for 38 percent of all births in the United \nStates. Studies show that for every $1.00 invested in family planning, \n$3.00 are saved in pregnancy and health-related costs. Recognizing the \nvalue of expanding family planning services, 13 states have received \nwaivers to make the expansions and California has applied for one.\n  It is my hope that the bill we introduce today can improve the health \nof women and their children by reducing unwanted pregnancies, welfare \ndependency, the incidence of abortion, the incidence of low-birth \nweight babies and the incidence of infant mortality. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 739. A bill to amend the American Indian Trust Fund Management \nReform Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to contract with \nqualified financial institutions for the investment of certain trust \nfunds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n      amendment to indian trust fund management reform act of 1994\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \nto the Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 to provide \nIndian Tribal Trust fund beneficiaries the option of having their trust \nfunds managed according to their wishes, which could add measurably to \nthe value of their trust funds. For individual Indian trust fund \nbeneficiaries, the legislation would allow them to earn greater returns \nthrough government-regulated trust departments than allowed by current \nlaw.\n  This bill is an outgrowth of a joint hearing held March 3rd of this \nyear by the Senate Committees on Indian Affairs and Energy & Natural \nResources to investigate the Department of Interior's efforts to reform \nthe trust management systems for individual Indians and Indian Tribes.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, on behalf of the U.S. government, acts \nas the trustee for some 1,500 tribal trust funds for 338 Indian tribes \nwith assets of $2.6 billion. He performs a similar service for 300,000 \nindividual Indian accounts totaling some $500 million. For well over \n100 years, these accounts have been in severe disarray, and in my mind, \nrecent reform efforts under the Indian Trust Fund Management Act show \nfew tangible signs of improvement.\n  Funds are unaccounted for, paperwork is missing, and Indians are \nuncertain about the accuracy of the amounts reported in their trust \naccounts. Recent newspaper reports tell of an ongoing inability or \nunwillingness on the part of the Departments of the Interior and \nTreasury to comply with requests from the U.S. District Court to \nproduce documents relating to a small number of trust accounts. The \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, has shown an unflagging commitment to ensure that \nthe Indian trust fund debacle is cleaned up and put upon a sound \nfooting for the Indian beneficiaries whose only sin has been to trust \nthe word of the Federal Government.\n  While I look forward to working with Chairman Campbell on his efforts \nto compel the Department of the Interior to institute the reforms \nnecessary to come to grips with the ongoing problems of the Indian \ntrust fund management, this bill is not designed to tackle that \ndaunting task.\n  This will would grant Indian Tribes the option of having their funds \ntreated the same way trust beneficiaries' funds are treated by prudent \nbank trust departments throughout this nation. Presently, federal law \nprohibits the Office of Trust Management from investing Indian trust \nfunds in anything other than government-guaranteed instruments. This \nseverely limits the rate of return Indians receive, to the point that \nthey receive the lowest rate of return of any trust beneficiaries in \nthe country.\n  Virtually all other trust funds in the country are managed under the \n``prudent investor'' rule, which, when coupled with government \nregulation of trust departments, ensures that trust funds are managed \nconservatively but wisely for the long term best interests of the trust \nbeneficiary.\n  The express prohibition against investment of Indian trust funds in \nall but government-guaranteed instruments has a dual effect on \nAmerica's first--and poorest--residents. First, it restricts the growth \nof their trust funds. Second, it means that Indian trust funds will not \nbe available for investment in Indian Country.\n  Under my proposal, the Secretary of the Interior, working with the \nComptroller of the Currency, would contract with qualified financial \ninstitutions that are regulated by a federal bank regulatory agency for \nthe investment of funds managed for Indian Tribes and individuals. \nTribes would still have the option of keeping their money in \ngovernment-guaranteed low-yield instruments if they so choose.\n  Those funds invested with government-regulated trust institutions \nwould be managed according to the prudent investor rules governing all \nother trusts throughout the country. The U.S. government would still \nact as the guarantor of those funds through its regulatory and \nenforcement mechanisms. Because stated balances of trust funds may not \nbe accurate due to historical mismanagement, the legislation is \nintended to ensure that if Indian trust funds are managed by private \nfinancial institutions, possible claims against the government for \naccurate balances are not extinguished.\n  Moreover, the Secretary would be directed, in the selection of a \nqualified financial institution, to comply with the Buy-Indian Act (25 \nU.S.C. 47). This would mean that if qualified Indian-owned financial \ninstitutions were properly regulated and certified, investment of \nIndian trust funds could act as investment capital for expanding \neconomic opportunities in Indian country.\n  It is my hope that through the successful implementation of this \nlegislation, we will see Indian people finally getting a fair return on \ntheir dollars, which might very well be generated from new enterprises \nvia investments of their own monies. The American dream should not be \nallowed to be continued to be denied to the First Americans.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary of the Interior, is not an investment \nbanker. There are a variety of things that the federal government does \nnot do well, and the management of trust funds is one of them. We have \nfinancial institutions that are regulated and who have the experience \nof managing large trust funds. We have a large body of law governing \nthe fiduciary responsibility of trustees. It is long past time for the \nSecretary to focus on the accounting of receipts and let those who know \nsomething about investments handle the actual management of these trust \nfunds.\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nThe present situation simply perpetuates the cycle of dependence for \ntoo many tribes and denies them the same reasonable expectation of \nreturn that all non-Indian trust beneficiaries have a right to expect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n       That the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act \n     (108 Stat. 4239, 25 U.S.C. 4041), as amended, is further \n     amended by adding a new Title V as follows:\n\n              TITLE V--INVESTMENT OF FUNDS--TRIBAL OPTIONS\n\n     SEC. 501.

Unless a tribe designates a specific \n     institution, the Secretary shall comply with the provisions \n     of the Buy-Indian Act (25 U.S.C. 47) in the selection of a \n     qualified financial institution pursuant to this title.\n       (c) Any contract entered into pursuant to this section \n     shall, at a minimum, include provisions acceptable to the \n     Secretary that will:\n       (1) direct that all funds are invested in a manner \n     consistent with the requirements of the prudent investor rule \n     applicable to the financial institution, the fiduciary \n     responsibility of the institution, and the trust \n     responsibility of the Secretary;\n       (2) within the requirements of paragraph (1), permit tribes \n     to direct the financial institution regarding the kinds of \n     instruments for investment;\n       (3) subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2), \n     encourage the investment of funds in ways that directly \n     benefit the affected tribe and Indian community;\n       (4) require that the financial institution be liable for \n     any financial losses incurred by the trust beneficiary as a \n     result of its failure to comply with the terms of its \n     contract, the investment instructions provided by the tribe, \n     its general fiduciary obligation, or the prudent investor \n     rule;\n       (5) insure that the financial institution carry sufficient \n     insurance or other surety satisfactory to the Secretary to \n     compensate the trust beneficiary in connection with any \n     liability and the Secretary in the event of a subrogation \n     under subsection (d);\n       (6) allow the financial institution to recover its \n     reasonable costs incurred in investing trust funds in \n     investment instruments that are 100% guaranteed by the United \n     States and be compensated for investing trust funds in other \n     investment instruments by charging a commercially reasonable \n     fee, approved by the Secretary, that shall be deducted from \n     the corpus of the trust funds in the same manner as for \n     private investors.\n       (d) No provision of this title, nor any action taken \n     pursuant thereto, shall in any way diminish the trust \n     responsibility of the United States for any funds presently \n     managed in trust status or to the tribes or individual \n     Indians who are the beneficial owners of such funds. The \n     Secretary shall remain responsible for any losses incurred by \n     a trust beneficiary for which a financial institution is \n     liable under paragraph (c)(4) but shall be entitled to \n     subrogation of any claim to the extent the beneficiary \n     receives compensation from the United States.\n       (e) Any amounts transferred shall not result in the closure \n     of the account in question and the Secretary shall be \n     obligated to continue efforts to determine whether the \n     account balance is accurate, including efforts to identify \n     and secure documentation supporting such accounting balance.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Murkowski as an original co-sponsor of legislation to amend the \nAmerican Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994. This is the \nfirst step in reforming the way Indian trust funds are managed and \ninvested for the benefit of the Indian tribes and their citizens.\n  On March 3, 1999, the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources held a joint hearing on trust fund \nmanagement practices in the Department of the Interior.\n  We held the hearing because the Secretary of the Interior issued an \norder in January that I believe undermined the authority of the Special \nTrustee for American Indians and violated the spirit and letter of the \n1994 Act.\n  Nothing at the hearing changed my mind. As a result, I proposed an \namendment to the FY 1999 Supplemental Appropriations bill to suspend \nthe implementation of this order while we sort out the legitimacy and \neffectiveness of ongoing trust management reforms within the \nDepartment. This should be done through legislation and congressional \noversight, not secretarial orders drafted with no tribal input.\n  Today's bill is the next step. It will enable Congress, Indian \ntribes, and the Administration to begin the difficult task of undoing \n100 years of mismanagement and neglect by the United States.\n  Most Americans are unfamiliar with this issue so let me describe what \nwe are talking about. Beginning in 1849, the federal government, as \ntrustee for the tribes, built a system to identify and track Indian \nland holdings, land leases, income from those leases, and other Indian \nassets, and created ``trust funds'' to be managed for the benefit of \ntheir Indian beneficiaries.\n  Over the years, the United States has failed to keep track of the \nfunds and the documents supporting the funds. In addition, the \nDepartment is prevented by law from investing these funds in anything \nother than U.S.-guaranteed investments which bring returns much lower \nthan what is possible in the open market. For these reasons, the \ntrustee has failed to adequately maintain this system and to maximize \nreturns on investment, with Indians as the predictable losers once \nagain. These facts raise the question of whether the federal government \nis the appropriate place for these accounts.\n  The money in these accounts, or that is supposed to be in these trust \nfund accounts, is Indian money that has been entrusted to the United \nStates. It is not federal money. There are billions of dollars at \nstake: in 1997, the Department's Tribal Reconciliation Project stated \nthat it was unable to reconcile some $2.4 billion in tribal funds.\n  For Indians that means they have no access to the money and do not \nreceive the benefit from their own money.\n  There are at least three major aspects to the problem. First, efforts \nby the Department to identify and gather all documentation to determine \naccurate trust fund balances; second, the efforts to put in place new \ncomputers and management systems; and third, the need to provide Indian \ntribes with the flexibility to maximize the return on fund investments \nin the interim as the first two initiatives continue.\n  This legislation is aimed at the third of these problems. As the \nCommittees work to fix the mistakes of the past, we can give tribes the \nflexibility and freedom to invest their money in the financial \ninstruments they choose. This legislation will allow Indian tribes the \noption to leave their funds with the Department for management and \ninvestment or to transfer the funds to qualified financial \ninstitutions, including Indian-owned banks, in order to receive \ncompetitive returns on investment.\n  The bill will direct the Secretary of Interior to consult with the \nnation's top banker, the Comptroller of the Currency, in negotiating \ncontracts with federally-approved financial institutions for \nthe investment of funds now managed by the United States.\n\n  Let me be clear: tribes are not required to move their accounts into \nthe private market. It is an option.\n  This bill does not represent a ``surrender'' in the efforts to find \nthe missing funds and documents. In fact, just the opposite. Under the \nbill, the Secretary is obligated to continue to search for documents \nthat will give a more accurate account balance to the tribes.\n  That brings up another troubling issue--the possibility that some \ndocuments will never be found. It is bad enough that some have been \npermanently lost due to neglect. But a story in today's Washington \nTimes raises the possibility that, even worse, some documents may have \nbeen purposely destroyed. The story says that the plaintiffs suing the \ngovernment over trust funds mismanagement have given the judge \naffidavits accusing Interior Department officials of destroying trust \nfund documents to conceal them from the court.\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\n  If this is true, it would be the worst violation of the trust \nresponsibility in decades.\n  I should point out that this bill is the first, not the last, word on \nour efforts to clean up the trust funds mess and to give Indians the \nchance to take risks, generate higher rates of returns, and bring \neconomic opportunities where none now exist. Also, this bill is subject \nto change. I welcome input from Indian Country as we work to perfect \nit.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am committed to \nworking with and assisting the tribes in the many reforms that are \nnecessary to bring increased hope and opportunities to their \ncommunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Murkowski and me in bringing \nreal reform and real change to Indian trust funds management. After 150 \nyears, it's about time we think and act boldly to bring this sad \nchapter in American history to a close.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 25, 1999]\n\n        Interior Officials Accused of Destroying Indian Records\n\n                            (By Jerry Seper)\n\n       Interior Department officials who told a federal judge they \n     could not find records describing the department's oversight \n     of American Indian trust funds have been accused in sworn \n     affidavits of destroying the documents to conceal then from \n     the court.\n       U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, who held Interior \n     Secretary Bruce Babbitt in contempt last month for not \n     turning over the records in a lawsuit, ordered hearings on \n     the accusations yesterday after being told Tuesday the \n     documents had been deliberately destroyed.\n       The suspected destruction was outlined in the affidavits \n     given to the judge during a status hearing in a lawsuit \n     brought by the Native American Rights Fund. The affidavits, \n     brought by some of the many plaintiffs, were later ordered \n     sealed pending yesterday's hearing, although that hearing--\n     held in the judge's chambers--was scheduled to resume today.\n       The suit by the Rights Fund, which represents several \n     Indian tribes involved in the trust fund, accuses the \n     Interior and Treasury departments of mismanaging trust fund \n     monies.\n       In November, Judge Lamberth ordered the departments to \n     produce canceled checks and other documents showing the \n     status of the trust fund, which involves more than 300,000 \n     individual accounts and 2,000 tribal accounts. The \n     departments oversee the receipt of money from land \n     settlements, royalties and payments by companies that use \n     Indian land.\n       The judge sought the records to allow attorneys for the \n     Rights Fund to prepare for trial. The departments have never \n     complied, giving the judge several reasons for the delay--\n     including an Interior claim that some of the records were \n     so tainted by rodent droppings in a New Mexico warehouse \n     that to disturb them would put department officials at a \n     health risk.\n       Interior officials have been unable to verify how much cash \n     has been collected. An audit by the Arthur Andersen \n     accounting firm said the Bureau of Indian Affairs cannot \n     account for $2.4 billion in trust funds.\n       During a hearing March 3 before the Senate Indian Affairs \n     Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee, Mr. Babbitt promised to correct the situation. \n     ``You'll be the judge. I will do my best,'' Mr. Babbitt said \n     when asked what he intended to do about mismanagement by the \n     BIA.\n       Special trustee Paul Homan, assigned to oversee the fund, \n     resigned in January. He said Mr. Babbitt stripped him of the \n     authority he needed to do the job and that he was blocked by \n     Interior officials who sought to undermine congressionally \n     ordered reforms with continual rejections of his requests for \n     money and manpower.\n       Mr. Homan said the department could ``no longer be trusted \n     to keep and produce trust records.'' He urged the accounts be \n     assigned to an independent agency.\n       Mr. Babbitt ordered a reorganization and requested more \n     funding for next year. He also said a new accounting system \n     was expected to be in place by the end of the year.\n       But acting special trustee Thomas Thompson said in a \n     confidential memo last year that he was ``grateful'' he did \n     not run the program. He outlined many concerns he had about \n     an inability to implement the Trust Fund Management Reform \n     Act of 1994. The act directs the department to oversee the \n     fund and provide the necessary budget to do the job.\n       Mr. Thompson's memo was written before his appointment as \n     Mr. Homan's successor. He has since told the Indian Affairs \n     Committee that trust funds were being properly administered \n     and that the program was sufficiently funded.\n       In a letter to Mr. Babbitt last week, Republication Sens. \n     Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado and Sen. Frank H. \n     Murkowski of Alaska, chairman of the Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee, said they were concerned that Mr. \n     Thompson appeared willing to endorse a process he had \n     criticized.\n       ``Before our committees, you vigorously testified about \n     your commitment to clean up the trust fund fiasco,'' they \n     wrote to Mr. Babbitt. ``We are not encouraged, however, when \n     only hours after the hearing, your hand-picked acting trustee \n     seems to reverse himself on an issue critical to the success \n     of this effort.''\n       They said if the many problems Mr. Thompson's memo \n     described had been corrected, Mr. Babbitt should list the \n     improvements to the committees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Grams): \n        S. 740. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to improve the \n        hydroelectric licensing process by granting the Federal Energy \n        Regulatory Commission statutory authority to better coordinate \n        participation by other agencies and entities, and for other \n        purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        hydroelectric licensing process improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the bill I introduce is the Hydroelectric \nLicensing Process Improvement Act of 1999. As its title suggests, the \npurpose of the bill is to improve the process by which non-federal \nhydroelectric projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission.\n  I introduced a similar bill late in the 105th Congress after hearings \non this issue in both the House and Senate. Hydropower represents ten \npercent of the energy produced in the United States, and approximately \n85% of all renewable energy generation. This, Mr. President, is a \nsignificant portion of our nation's electricity, produced without air \npollution or greenhouse gas emissions, and it is accomplished at \nrelatively low cost.\n  The Commission for many years since its creation in 1920, controlled \nour nation's water power potential with uncompromising authority. \nHowever, since 1972, a number of environmental statutes, amendments to \nthe Federal Power Act, Commission regulations, licensing and policy \ndecisions, and several critical court decisions, has made the \nCommission's licensing process extremely costly, time consuming, and, \nat times, arbitrary. Indeed, the current Commission licensing program \nis burdened with mixed mandates and redundant bureaucracy and prone to \ngridlock and litigation.\n  Under current law, several federal agencies are required to set \nconditions for licenses without regard to the effects those conditions \nhave on project economics, energy benefits, impacts on greenhouse gas \nemissions and values protected by other statutes and regulations. Far \ntoo often we have agencies fighting agencies and issuing inconsistent \ndemands.\n  The consequent delays in processing hydropower applications result in \nsignificant business costs and lost capacity. For example, according to \na September 1997 study of the U.S. Department of Energy, since 1987, of \n52 peaking projects relicensed by the Commission, four projects \nincreased capacity, and 48 decreased capacity. In simple terms, those \n48 projects became less productive as a result of the relicensing \nprocess at the Commission than they were prior to relicensing. Ninety-\ntwo percent of the peaking projects since 1987 lost capacity.\n  In addition, faced with the uncertainties currently plaguing the \nrelicensing process, some existing licensees are contemplating \nabandonment of their projects. This is of concern to the nation because \ntwo-thirds of all non-federal hydropower capacity is up for relicensing \nin the next fifteen years. By the year 2010, 220 projects will be \nsubject to the relicensing process.\n  Publicly owned hydropower projects constitute nearly 50% of the total \ncapacity that will be up for renewal. The problems resulting in lost \ncapacity, coupled with the momentous changes occurring in the \nelectricity industry and the increasing need for emissions free sources \nof power, all underscore the need for Congressional action to reform \nhydroelectric licensing.\n  Moreoever, the loss of a hydropower project means more than the loss \nof clean, efficient, renewable electric power. Hydropower projects \nprovide drinking water, flood control, fish and wildlife habitat, \nirrigation, transportation, environmental enhancement\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\nfunding and recreation benefits. Also, due to its unique load-following \ncapability, peaking capacity and voltage stability attributes, \nhydropower plays a critical role in maintaining our nation's reliable \nelectric service.\n  My bill, which is currently co-sponsored by fellow Idahoan Senator \nMike Crapo, and Senators Conrad Burns and Rod Grams, will remedy the \ninefficient and complex Commission licensing process by ensuring that \nfederal agencies involved in the process act in a timely and \naccountable manner.\n  My bill does not change or modify any existing environmental laws, \nnor remove regulatory authority from various agencies. It does not call \nfor the repeal of mandatory conditioning authority of appropriate \nfederal agencies. Rather, it requires participating agencies to \nconsider, and be accountable for, the full effects of their actions \nbefore imposing mandatory conditions on a Commission issued license.\n  It is clear to me and many of my colleagues here in the Senate that \nhydropower is at risk. Clearly, one of the most important tasks for \nenergy policymakers in the 21st Century is to develop an energy \nstrategy that will ensure an adequate supply of reasonably priced, \nreliable energy to all American consumers in an environmentally \nresponsible manner. The relicensing of non-federal hydropower can and \nshould continue to be an important and viable element in this strategy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hydroelectric Licensing \n     Process Improvement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) hydroelectric power is an irreplaceable source of \n     clean, economic, renewable energy with the unique capability \n     of supporting reliable electric service while maintaining \n     environmental quality;\n       (2) hydroelectric power is the leading renewable energy \n     resource of the United States;\n       (3) hydroelectric power projects provide multiple benefits \n     to the United States, including recreation, irrigation, flood \n     control, water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits;\n       (4) in the next 15 years, the bulk of all non-Federal \n     hydroelectric power capacity in the United States is due to \n     be relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;\n       (5) the process of licensing hydroelectric projects by the \n     Commission--\n       (A) does not produce optimal decisions, because the \n     agencies that participate in the process are not required to \n     consider the full effects of their mandatory and recommended \n     conditions on a license;\n       (B) is inefficient, in part because agencies do not always \n     submit their mandatory and recommended conditions by a time \n     certain;\n       (C) is burdened by uncoordinated environmental reviews and \n     duplicative permitting authority; and\n       (D) is burdensome for all participants and too often \n     results in litigation; and\n       (6) while the alternative licensing procedures available to \n     applicants for hydroelectric project licenses provide \n     important opportunities for the collaborative resolution of \n     many of the issues in hydroelectric project licensing, those \n     procedures are not appropriate in every case and cannot \n     substitute for statutory reforms of the hydroelectric \n     licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to achieve the objective of \n     relicensing hydroelectric power projects to maintain high \n     environmental standards while preserving low cost power by--\n       (1) requiring agencies to consider the full effects of \n     their mandatory and recommended conditions on a hydroelectric \n     power license and to document the consideration of a broad \n     range of factors;\n       (2) requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n     impose deadlines by which Federal agencies must submit \n     proposed mandatory and recommended conditions to a license; \n     and\n       (3) making other improvements in the licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide for pension reform, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  pension coverage and portability act\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators \nGrassley, Baucus, Hatch, Breaux, Jeffords, Kerrey, Mack, Robb, \nMurkowski, Chafee, Thompson, Bond, and Bingaman to introduce the \nPension Coverage and Portability Act. I am honored to be here today, in \na bipartisan group, and especially with my colleague Senator Charles \nGrassley, who has put a tremendous effort into crafting many parts of \nthis bill. He and I recognize that for our nation to solve what will be \none of this generation's greatest challenges, building retirement \nsecurity for today's workers, we need to move in a common sense, \nbipartisan fashion.\n  Many of the original cosponsors of this bill were key in crafting \nsections of this legislation over the last three years. Senator \nGrassley's efforts here have expanded fairness for women and families, \nand focuses on the benefits of retirement education.\n  Senator Baucus has brought the ideas that expand pension coverage and \nease the administrative burdens on America's small businesses.\n  Portability, so important as we become a more mobile society, \nreceived the attention of Senator Jeffords.\n  All businesses will have the hard work of Senator Hatch to thank for \nmany of the regulatory relief, and administrative simplification \nelements of this bill.\n  Senator Breaux focused on the ``big picture'' of retirement security \nby authoring the ESOP provisions.\n  And finally, Senators Kerrey and Robb provided valuable new input \nthat helped shape his legislation.\n  Throughout the process of putting this bill together, our main task \nhas been to listen. We have listened at town hall meetings, at the \nRetirement Security Summit I held last year in Tampa, and a Women's \nSummit I held in Orlando last April. I am also planning another \nRetirement Security Summit in Jacksonville this May to continue the \ndialogue on this important issue.\n  The ideas have come from pension actuaries, tax attorneys, Cabinet \nleaders, and some of the best ideas, from everyday people.\n  With reason, some of the public debate recently has focused on \nPresident Clinton's mantra ``Save Social Security First.'' And we all \nagree, on both sides of the aisle, that we need to ensure that social \nsecurity is as viable for my nine grandchildren as it was for may \nparents and will be for me.\n  However, social security is only one part of the picture. Pensions \nand personal savings will make up an ever increasing part of retirement \nsecurity. So when Congress takes action to ensure the future of social \nsecurity, we are only addressing one-third of the problem.\n  Social Security may play less of a role for each generation. We must \ndevelop personal savings, and we must have years of work pay off in \nworkers vesting in pensions.\n  Our bill will help hard working Americans build personal retirement \nsavings through their employers, through 401(k)s, through payroll \ndeduction IRAs, and through higher limits on savings.\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\n  Employers and workers both win. Employers get simpler pension systems \nwith less administrative burden, and more loyal employees. And workers \nbuild secure retirement and watch savings accumulate over years of \nwork.\n\n  We need to be able to offer business owners and their workers: \nuncumbersome portability, administrative simplicity, and the confidence \nthat their plans are secure and well funded.\n  To achieve this goal, we focused on six areas: simplification, \nportability, expanded coverage for small business, pension security and \nenforcement, women's equity issues, and expanding retirement planning \nand education opportunities.\n  The largest section of this legislation deals with expanded coverage \nfor small business. It's the largest section because small businesses \nhave the greatest difficulty achieving retirement security. 51 million \nAmerican workers have no retirement plan, 21 million of these employees \nwork in small businesses.\n  The problem: statistics indicate that only a small percentage of \nworkers in firms of less than 100 employees have access to a retirement \nplan. We take a step forward in eliminating one of the first hurdles \nthat a small business faces when it establishes a pension plan. On one \nhand, the federal government is encouraging these businesses to start \npension plans, and then we turn around and charge the small business, \nat times, up to one thousand dollars to register their plan with the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  The solution: eliminate this fee for small businesses. We need to \nencourage small businesses to start plans, not discourage them with \nhigh registration fees.\n  Another problem for small businesses and others is people postponing \nretirement decisions until a later date. Many young people in their \n20's and 30's don't think they need to worry about retirement security \n``right now,'' it's a decision that can wait for later.\n  Our solution to this is to encourage businesses to have ``opt out'' \nplans for retirement savings. Instead of the worker having to actively \ndecide to participate and fill out paperwork, he or she is \nautomatically participating unless they actively decide not to.\n  Another problem this legislation addresses: retirement security for \nwomen and families. Historically speaking, women live longer than men, \ntherefore, need greater savings for retirement. Yet our pension and \nretirement laws do not reflect this. Women are more mobile than men, \nmoving in and out of the workforce due to family responsibilities, thus \nthey have less of a chance to vest. Fewer than 32% of all women \nretirees receive a pension. Currently two-thirds of working women are \nemployed in sectors of the economy that are unlikely to have a \nretirement plan: service and retail, and small business.\n  In an effort to address one of the problems--preparing for a longer \nlife expectancy, we realistically adjust upwards the age in which you \nmust start withdrawing funds.\n  Under current law, you must start withdrawing money from retirement \nplans at age seventy-and-a-half. However, a woman at age seventy can \nstill have three decades in retirement. I know, because I represent \nmany of them in Florida. At the Retirement Summit I hosted in Tampa, \nFlorida, several retirees mentioned that they wanted to keep this money \nin retirement savings for as long as possible. We raise the seventy-\nand-a-half age to seventy-five for mandatory minimum distributions.\n  Second, we say that $100,000 of any IRA will be exempt from minimum \ndistribution rules. This accomplishes two important goals: simplifying \nthe bureaucracy for thousands of Americans who have less than this \nbalance, and protecting a vital nest egg for the last years of \nretirement so that long term care and other expenses can be covered.\n  Another problem addressed in this section of the legislation is the \nmobility of our workforce. On average, Americans will have 7 different \nemployers during their career which means they are often not at any job \nlong enough to vest into retirement benefits.\n  Our legislation offers a solution--shrinking the 5 year vesting cycle \nto a three year cycle. We believe this is more reflective of job tenure \nin the 1990's and on into the next century.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the current U.S. worker will have seven \ndifferent employers. We have the possibility of a generation of \nAmerican workers who will retire with many small accounts--creating a \ncomplex maze of statements and features, different for each account. \nThis is a problem--pensions should be portable from job to job.\n  One solution to this problem--allow employees to roll one retirement \naccount into another as they move from job to job so that when they \nretire, they will have one retirement account. It's easier to monitor, \nless complicated to keep track of, and builds a more secure retirement \nfor the worker.\n  Portability is important, but we must also reduce the red tape. The \nmain obstacle that companies face in establishing retirement programs \nis bureaucratic administrative burden. For example: for small plans, it \ncosts $228 per person per year just to comply with all the forms, tests \nand regulations.\n  We have a common sense remedy to one of the most vexing problems in \npension administration: figuring out how much money to contribute to \nthe company's plan. It's a complex formula of facts, statistics and \nassumptions. We want to be able to say to plans that have no problem \nwith underfunding: to help make these calculations, you can use the \nprior year's data to help make the proper contribution. You don't have \nto re-sort through the numbers each and every year. If your plan is \nsound, use reliable data from the previous year, and then verify when \nall the final details are available. Companies will be able to \ncalculate, and then budget accordingly--and not wait until figures and \nrates out of their control are released by outside sources.\n  I have said time and time again today that Americans are not saving, \nbut those who are oftentimes hit limits on the amounts they can save. \nThe problem is that most of these limits were established more than 20 \nyears ago. Currently, for example, in a 401(k) plan the IRS limits the \namount an employee can contribute to $10,000 a year.\n  Our solution is to raise that limit to $12,000, along with raising \nmany other limits that affect savings in order to build a more secure \nretirement for working Americans.\n  The building of retirement security will also take some education. \nOne of the major reasons Americans do not prepare for retirement is \nthat they don't understand what benefits are available and what \nbenefits they are acquiring.\n  Our solution to this dilemma is regular and easy to read benefit \nstatements from employers reminding workers early in their career of \nthe importance of retirement savings. These statements would clarify \nwhat benefits workers are accruing. And from this information each \nAmerican will more easily be able to determine the personal savings \nthey need in order to build a sound retirement.\n  With the introduction of this legislation today it is my goal to \nensure that each American who works hard for thirty or forty years has \ngotten every opportunity for a secure and comfortable retirement.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard with me on this \nmeasure, and ask for the support of those in this Chamber on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nGraham, to introduce bipartisan pension reform legislation. This \nlegislation, the Pension Coverage and Portability Act, will go a long \nway toward improving the pension system in this country.\n  Ideally, pension benefits should compromise about a third of a \nretired worker's income. But pension benefits make up only about one-\nfifth of the income in elderly households. Obviously, workers are \nreaching retirement with too little income from an employer pension. \nWorkers who are planning for their retirement will need more pension \nincome to make up for a lower Social Security benefit and to fit with \nlonger life expectancies. While we have seen a small increase in the \nnumber of workers who are expected to receive a pension in retirement, \nonly one half of our workforce is covered by a pension plan.\n  There is a tremendous gap in pension coverage between small employers \nand\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nlarge employers. Eighty-five percent of the companies with at least 100 \nworkers offer pension coverage. Companies with less than 100 workers \nare much less likely to offer pension coverage. Only about 50 percent \nof the companies with less than 100 workers offer pension coverage. In \norder to close the gap in coverage between small and large employers, \nwe need to understand the reasons small employers do not offer pension \nplans. Last year, the Employee Benefit Institute released to Small \nEmployer Retirement Survey which was very instructive for legislators.\n  The survey identified the three main reasons employers gave for not \noffering a plan. The first reason is that small employer believe that \nemployees prefer increased wages or other types of benefits. The second \nreason employers don't offer plans is the administrative cost. And the \nthird most important reason for not offering a plan: uncertain revenue, \nwhich makes it difficult to commit to a plan.\n  Combine these barriers with the responsibilities of a small employer, \nand we can understand why coverage among small employers has not \nincreased. Small employers who may just be starting out in business are \nalready squeezing every penny. These employers are also people who open \nup to the business in the morning, talk to customers, do the marketing, \npay the bills, and just do not know how they can take on the additional \nduties, responsibilies, and liabilities of sponsoring a pension plan.\n  I firmly believe that an increase in the number of people covered by \npension plans will occur only when small employers have more \nsubstantial incentives to establish pension plans. The Pension Coverage \nand Portability Act contains provisions which will provide more \nflexibility for small employees, relief from burdensome rules and \nregulations, and a tax incentive to start new plans for their \nemployees. One of the new top heavy provisions we have endorsed is an \nexemption from top heavy rules for employers who adopt the 401(k) safe \nharbor. This safe harbor takes effect this year. When the Treasury \nDepartment wrote the regulations and considered whether safe harbor \nplans should also have to satisfy the top heavy rules, they answered in \nthe affirmative. As a result, a small employer would have to make a \ncontribution of 7 percent of pay for each employee, a very costly \nproposition.\n  My colleagues and I also have included a provision which repeals user \nfees for new plan sponsors seeking determination letters from IRS. \nThese fees can run from $100 to more than $1,000 depending on the type \nof plan. Given the need to promote retirement plan formation, we \nbelieve this ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' approach needs to be eliminated.\n  We have also looked at the lack of success of SIMPLE 401(k) plans. A \nsurvey by the Investment Company Institute found that SIMPLE IRAs have \nproven successful, with almost 340,000 workers participating in a plan. \nHowever, SIMPLE 401(k)s haven't enjoyed the same success. One reason \nmay be that the limits on SIMPLE 401(k)s are tighter than for the IRAs. \nOur bill equalizes the compensation limits for these plan; in addition, \nwe have increased the annual limit on SIMPLE to $8,000.\n  One of the more revolutionary proposals is the creation of a Salary \nReduction SIMPLE with a limit of $4,000. Unlike other SIMPLEs, the \nemployer makes no match or automatic contributions. The employer match \nis usually a strong incentive for a low-income employee to participate \nin a savings plan. We hope that small employers will look at this \nSIMPLE as a transition plan, in place for just a couple of year during \nthe initial stage of business operation-- then adopt a more expansive \nplan when the business is profitable.\n\n  A provision that was included in last year's legislation, the \nnegative election trust or ``NET'' has been modified to address some \npractical administrative issues. What is the NET? Basically, it is a \nnew type of safe harbor that would allow employers to automatically \nenroll employees in pension plans. Often, employees do not join the \npension plan as soon as they begin employment with a new employer. If \nemployees are left to their own devices, they may delay participating \nin the pension plan or even worse, never participate. This new safe \nharbor eases the nondiscrimination rules for employers who establish \nthe NET if they achieve a participation rate of 70 percent.\n  The other targeted areas in the legislation include enhancing pension \ncoverage for women. Women are more at risk of living in poverty as they \nage. They need more ways to save because of periodic departures from \nthe workforce. To increase their saving capacity, we have included a \nproposal similar to legislation I sponsored earlier this year, S. 60, \nthe Enhanced Savings Opportunities Act. Like S. 60, the proposal \nrepeals the 25 percent of salary contribution limit on defined \ncontribution plans. This limit has seriously impeded savings by women, \nas well as low- and mid-salary employees. Repealing the 25 percent cap \nin 415(c) is a simplifier, and will allow anyone covered by a defined \ncontribution plan to benefit.\n  The bill also contains proposals which promote new opportunities to \nroll over accounts from an old employer to a new employer. The lack of \nportability among plans is one of the weak links in our current pension \nsystem. This new bill contains technical improvements which will help \nease the implementation of portability among the different types of \ndefined contribution plans.\n  Finally, I would like to point out a couple of other provisions in \nthe bill. The first is the new requirement that plan sponsors \nautomatically provide benefit statements to their participants on a \nperiodic basis. For defined contribution plans, the statement would be \nrequired annually. For defined benefit plans, a statement would be \nrequired every three years. However, employers who provide an annual \nnotice to employees of the availability of a benefit statement would \nnot be required to provide automatic benefit statements to all \nemployees.\n  Providing clear and understandable benefit statements to pension plan \nparticipants would encourage people to think about how much money they \ncan expect to receive in retirement. Further, a benefit statement will \nhelp people ensure that the information their employer maintains about \nthem is accurate.\n  This provision joins other proposals in a section targeted at \nencouraging retirement education. Education can make a difference to \nworkers. In fact, in companies which provide investment education, we \nknow workers benefitted because many of them changed their investment \nallocations to more accurately reflect their investment horizons.\n  The bill also looks to simplify and repeal some of the legal \nrequirements which threaten plan security and increase costs for \nemployers who sponsor pension plans. For example, the legislation seeks \nto repeal the full-funding limit. This limit prevents employers from \npre-funding their defined benefit plans based on projected benefits. \nInstead, employers are limited to an amount that would allow them to \npay the accrued benefits if the plan terminated. This lower funding \nlevel threatens the ability of employers to pay benefits, especially as \nthe Baby Boom begins to retire.\n  To reduce the burdens of plan compliance, the legislation includes a \nnumber of proposals intended to peel away at the layers of laws and \nregulations that add costs to plan administration but don't add many \nbenefits.\n  This legislation joins other strong proposals now pending in the \nHouse and here in the Senate. This legislation includes provisions \nwhich reflect some of those same proposals. I want to commend the \nsponsors of those bills. Our legislation has a lot in common with these \nother pension bills and we need to push for fast and favorable \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  We have a window of opportunity to act. The Baby Boomers are coming. \nThe letters from AARP are starting to arrive in their mailboxes. The \nSocial Security Administration is starting to stagger the delivery of \nbenefit checks in preparation for their retirement. It is likely that \nfuture retirees will not be able to rely on all of the benefits now \nprovided by Social Security. We can look to the pension system to pick \nup where Social Security leaves off, but we need to act.\n  I thank the other co-sponsors of this legislation for all of their \nwork, and I encourage our colleagues to give strong\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\nconsideration to co-sponsoring this bill. We already have a substantial \nnumber of Senate Finance Committee members, including Baucus, Breaux, \nJeffords, Hatch, Kerrey, Thompson, Mack, Chafee, Robb, and Murkowski. I \nam also very pleased to have Senator Bond come aboard as a co-sponsor. \nAs Chairman of the Small Business Committee, he is very aware of the \nproblems we are trying to address in this legislation. We also have \nadded Senator Jeff Bingaman as a co-sponsor.\n  I also want to recognize the groups that have worked with us over the \nlast three years to develop this legislation. These organizations \ninclude: the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council, the Association of Private \nPension & Welfare Plans, the ERISA Industry Council, and the Retirement \nSecurity Network which includes a large number of organizations who \nhave all been important to our work.\n  With concerted, bipartisan action, we can improve the pension system. \nPensions for today's workers will substantially improve the retirement \noutlook for millions of Americans. But we have some work to do if \npensions are going to fulfill their promise.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 742. A bill to clarify the requirements for the accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization of the People's Republic of China; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\nLegislation To Clarify the Requirements for the Accession to the World \n          Trade Organization of the People's Republic of China\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, hearings on agricultural trade issues \nwith the People's Republic of China that I chaired on March 15, 1999 in \nthe International Trade Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Finance \nhighlighted the enormous significance to the United States of China's \npossible accession to the World Trade Organization.\n  As President Gerald Ford stated in a letter that I released during \nthe hearing, ``The terms of any deal that we reach now with China about \naccess to its markets may well determine the course of Sino-American \neconomic relations for decades to come. If economic relations are not \nresolved constructively, there will be adverse developments \ndiplomatically and politically between our two nations.''\n  We have just one opportunity to make sure that any market access \nagreement that we reach with China in the context of WTO accession \ntalks gives the United States unrestricted entry to China's markets. \nThat opportunity is now. And we can do that only if Congress asserts \nits constitutional responsibility to regulate foreign commerce and \nreviews any deal negotiated by the administration before China is \nadmitted to the WTO.\n  It is for this reason that today I introduce legislation to clarify \nthe requirements for the accession to the World Trade Organization of \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  This legislation will do three things.\n  First, it clarifies the requirement in current law that the United \nStates Trade Representative must consult with the Congress prior to \ncasting a vote in favor of China's admission to the WTO. Under current \nlaw, the Administration could conceivably ``consult'' with the Congress \nminutes before casting a vote in the WTO Ministerial Conference or the \nWTO General Council to admit China. This bill says that Congress shall \nhave at least 60 days to review all the relevant documents related to \nChina's possible accession before a vote is taken.\n  Second, this legislation specifies the exact documents that the \nAdministration must give to Congress for its review.\n  Finally, Congress shall have the opportunity to vote on China's \nadmission to the WTO before China can be admitted.\n  This is an issue of historic importance, and enormous consequence. \nBut unless the law is changed, I won't even have the chance to vote on \nwhether the agreement negotiated for China's accession is good for \nIowa, and good for America. My job in Congress is to make these tough \ndecisions, not avoid them.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it would be the right thing for China \nto join the world trade community's official forum, and be subject to \nthe discipline of multilateral trade rules. For fifty years, the WTO, \nand its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has \neliminated literally tens of thousands of tariff and non-tariff trade \nbarriers. The result has been a dramatic increase in our collective \nprosperity, and a strengthening of world peace.\n  But China--or any other nation--should not be admitted to the WTO for \npolitical reasons. If the terms that we negotiate for China's accession \nare good terms, then China's accession will stand on its own merits. If \nthe terms are not acceptable, if they don't guarantee unrestricted \nmarket access, then China should not be admitted. It's that simple.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 743, a bill to require prior congressional approval before the \nUnited States supports the admission of the People's Republic of China \ninto the World Trade Organization, and to provide for the withdrawal of \nthe United States from the World Trade Organization if China is \naccepted into the WTO without the support of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  world trade organization legislation\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, for some time, many aspects of \nthe U.S.-China relationship have concerned me. Since China's entrance \ninto the WTO will be the most significant U.S.-China negotiation in the \nnext several years, the contentious U.S.-China issues should be moving \ntoward resolution before the conclusion of any agreement. \nUnfortunately, that is not currently the case. Most relevant to the WTO \nprocess is the exploding US-China trade deficit. In 1998, it reached a \nrecord $56.9 billion dollars. In fact, U.S. export to both Singapore \n($15.6 billion) and Holland ($19 billion) were greater than exports to \nChina ($14.2 billion). At the beginning of the decade, the deficit was \na problematic but manageable $12.5 billion. Conversely, our large \ntrading partners (the Europeans and Japan) have managed to maintain a \nrelative trade balance with there Chinese counterparts. In fact, all of \nChina's trade surplus is accounted for by the enormous imbalance with \nthe United States.\n  Moreover, the continuing problems with Chinese human rights \nviolations, espionage and possible technology transfers suggest that \nthis is not the appropriate time for China to enter the WTO. Recently, \nthe State Department released its annual human rights report concluding \nthat the situation in China has degraded significantly over the past \nyear. Additionally, we remain troubled by the allegations regarding the \npossible illegal transfer of technology to China, as well as lingering \nquestions over Chinese espionage and involvement in U.S. elections. Any \ntrade agreement with China would be premature before these issues are \nresolved.\n  Although none of these concerns are new, the Administration's efforts \nto resolve these issues have been unfortunately unsuccessful. \nRegretably, in fact, the pace of the China WTO negotiations appears to \nhave increased. As a result, we believe that this legislation is both \nappropriate and timely. Congress must review any agreement, and all of \nthe surrounding negotiations to ensure that it reflects traditional \nAmerican values while protecting American interest.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 744. A bill to provide for the continuation of higher education \nthrough the conveyance of certain public lands in the State of Alaska \nto the University of Alaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA LAND GRANT ACT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the University of Alaska (the \nUniversity) is Alaska's oldest post-secondary school. The University \nwas chartered prior to statehood and has played a vital role in \neducating Alaskans as well as students from around the world in the \nUnited States' only arctic and sub-arctic environment. Additionally, \nthe University has served as an important\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\ncornerstone in Alaska's history. For example, the University housed the \nAlaska Constitutional Convention where the fathers of statehood carved \nout the rights and privileges guaranteed to Alaska's citizens. Further, \nthe University of Alaska is proud of the fact that it began life as the \nAlaska Agricultural and Mining College. However, Mr. President, what \nmakes the University of Alaska truly unique is the fact that it is the \nonly land grant college in the Nation that is virtually landless.\n  As my colleagues know, one of the oldest and most respected ways of \nfinancing America's educational system has been the land grant system. \nEstablished in 1785, this practice gives land to schools and \nuniversities for their use in supporting their educational endeavors. \nIn 1862, Congress passed the Morrill Act which created the land grant \ncolleges and universities as a way to underwrite the cost of higher \neducation to more and more Americans. These colleges and universities \nreceived land from the federal government for facility location and, \nmore importantly, as a way to provide sustaining revenues to these \neducational institutions.\n  The University of Alaska received the smallest amount of land of any \nstate, with the exception of Delaware, that has a land grant college. \nEven the land grant college in Rhode Island received more land from the \nfederal government than has the University of Alaska. In a state the \nsize of Alaska, we should logically have one of the best and most fully \nfunded land grant colleges in the country. Unfortunately, without the \nland promised under the land grant allocation system and earlier \nlegislation, the University is unable to share as one of the premier \nland grant colleges in the country.\n  Previous efforts in Congress were made to fix this problem. These \nefforts date back to 1915, less than 50 years after the passage of the \nMorrill Act, when Alaska's Delegate James Wickersham shepherded a \nmeasure through Congress that set aside potentially more than a quarter \nof a million acres, in the Tanana Valley outside of Fairbanks, for the \nsupport of an agricultural college and school of mines. Following the \npractice established in the lower 48 for other land grant colleges, \nWickersham's bill set aside every Section 33 of the unsurveyed Tanana \nValley for the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines. \nAlaska's educational future looked very bright.\n  Many Alaskans saw the opportunity to set up an endowment system \nsimilar to that established by the University of Washington in the \ndowntown center of Seattle, where valuable University lands are leased \nand provide funding for the University of Washington which uses those \nrevenues in turn to provide for its programs and facilities.\n  Mr. President, before that land could be transferred to the Alaska \nAgricultural College and School of Mines (renamed the University of \nAlaska in 1935), the land had to be surveyed in order to establish the \nexact acreage included in the reserved land. The sections reserved for \neducation could not be transferred to the College until they had been \ndelineated. According to records of the time, it was unlikely, given \nthe incredibly slow speed of surveying, that the land could be \ncompletely surveyed before the 21st century. Surveying was and is an \nextraordinarily slow process in Alaska's remote and unpopulated \nterrain. In all, only 19 section 33's--approximately 11,211 acres--were \never transferred to the University. Of this amount, 2,250 were used for \nthe original campus and the remainder was left to support educational \nopportunities.\n  Recognizing the difficulties of surveying in Alaska, subsequent \nlegislation was passed in 1929 that simply granted land for the benefit \nof the University. This grant totaled approximately 100,000 acres and \nto this day comprises the bulk of the University's roughly 112,000 \nacres of land--less than one third of what it was originally promised. \nIn 1958, the Alaska Statehood Act was passed which extinguished the \noriginal land grants for all lands that remained unsurveyed. Thus, the \nUniversity was left with little land with which to support itself and \nthus is unable to completely fulfill its mission as a land grant \ncollege.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would redeem \nthe promises made to the University in 1915 and put it on an even \nfooting with the other land grant colleges in the United States. The \nbill provides the University with the land needed to support itself \nfinancially and offers it the chance to grow and continue to act as a \nresponsible steward of the land and educator of our young people. The \nlegislation also provides a concrete timetable under which the \nUniversity must select its lands and the Secretary of the Interior must \nact upon those selections.\n  This legislation also contains significant restrictions on the land \nthe University can select. The University cannot select land located \nwithin a Conservation System Unit. The University cannot select old \ngrowth timber lands in the Tongass National Forest. Finally, the \nUniversity cannot select land validly conveyed to the State or an ANCSA \ncorporation, or land used in connection with federal or military \ninstitutions.\n  Additionally, under my bill the University must relinquish extremely \nvaluable inholdings in Alaska once it receives its state/federal \nselection awarded under Section 2, of this bill. Therefore, the result \nof this legislation will mean the relinquishment of prime University \ninholdings in such magnificent areas as the Alaska Peninsula & Maritime \nNational Wildlife Refuge, The Kenai Fjords National Park, Wrangell St. \nElias National Park and Preserve, and Denali Park and Preserve. So, Mr. \nPresident, not only does this bill uphold a decades old promise to the \nUniversity of Alaska, it further protects Alaska's parks and refuges.\n  Specifically, this bill would grant the University 250,000 acres of \nfederal land. Additionally, the University would be eligible to receive \nan additional 250K acres on a matching basis with the state for a total \nof 500K additional acres. This, obviously, would be done through the \nstate legislative process involving the Governor, the Legislature, and \nthe University's Board of Regents.\n  Mr. President, the state matching provision is an important component \nof this legislation. Most agree with the premise that the University \nwas shorted land. However, some believe it is solely the responsibility \nof the federal government to compensate the University with land while \nothers believe it is solely the responsibility of the state to grant \nthe University land. The legislation I am introducing today offers a \ncompromise giving both the state and the federal government the \nopportunity to contribute while at the same time providing the federal \ngovernment with valuable inholdings in parks and refuges.\n  Finally, this bill contains a provision that incorporates a concept \nput forth by the Governor of Alaska. This provision directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to attempt to conclude an agreement with the \nUniversity and the Governor of Alaska providing for sharing NPRA \nleasing revenues in lieu of land selections north of latitude 69 \ndegrees North. The provision restricts any agreement regarding revenue \nsharing to prevent the University from obtaining more than ten percent \nof such annual revenues or more than nine million dollars each fiscal \nyear. If an agreement is reached and provides for disposition of some \nportion of NPRA mineral leasing revenues to the University, the \nSecretary shall submit the proposed agreement to Congress for \nratification. If the Secretary fails to reach an agreement within two \nyears of enactment, or if Congress fails to ratify such agreement \nwithin three years from enactment, the University may select up to \n92,000 of its 250,000 initial land grant from lands within NPRA north \nof latitude 69.\n  Therefore, this bill has been substantially changed from versions \nintroduced in previous Congresses in two dramatic ways. First, in \nresponse to concerns from the Administration and environmental \norganizations the old growth areas of the Tongass National Forest are \noff limits for selection by the University. The only areas of the \nTongass that could be selected by the University are those areas \npreviously harvested. It is important that the University be allowed to \nselect lands in this area as having the ability to study and manage as \nsuch areas are important tools for the University's School of Forestry.\n  The second substantial change to the bill, which was previously \nnoted, is the\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nrevenue sharing component. This aspect provides an alternative means of \nproviding for the needs of the University.\n  With the passage of this bill, the University of Alaska will finally \nbe able to act fully as a land grant college. It will be able to select \nlands that can provide the University with a stable revenue source as \nwell as provide responsible stewardship for the land.\n  This is an exciting time for the University of Alaska. The promise \nthat was made more than 80 years ago could be fulfilled by passage of \nthis legislation and Alaskans could look forward to a very bright \nfuture for the University of Alaska and those who receive an education \nthere.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Grams, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Graham, Mr. Burns, Mr. McCain, Ms. Snowe, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Craig, Mr. Levin, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Mack, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 745. A bill to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 to modify the requirements for \nimplementation of an entry-exit control system; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             BORDER IMPROVEMENT AND IMMIGRATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Border \nImprovement and Immigration Act of 1999. I would like to express my \nthanks to Senators Kennedy, Grams, Leahy, Graham, Burns, McCain, Snowe, \nDeWine, Jeffords, Gorton, Craig, Levin, Schumer, Murray, Murkowski, \nMoynihan, Mack, Smith (OR), Dorgan, Santorum, Cochran, and Inouye for \nbeing original cosponsors of this legislation. The legislation will \ncorrect an unfortunate provision--Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration \nAct. In correcting this provision, this legislation will prevent the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service from effectively shutting down \nour borders to trade and tourism. The legislation has wide support and \nappeal and is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, American Trucking Association, American \nHotel and Motel Association, Travel Industry Association of America, \nBorder Trade Alliance, American Association of Exporters and Importers, \nNational Automobile Transporters Association, Fresh Produce Association \nof the Americas, American Association of Port Authorities, \nInternational Mass Retail Association, American Immigration Lawyers \nAssociation, International Warehouse Logistics Association, National \nTour Association, Passenger Vessel Association and the U.S. Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce.\n  As a number of my colleagues are aware, Mr. President, in 1996 both \nthe House and the Senate versions of the omnibus immigration bill \ncontained differing provisions requiring collection of data on those \nentering and exiting the United States at certain airports. In \nconference, without any debate, a mandatory entry-exit system to \ncapture the records of ``every alien'' was added to that legislation.\n  Representative Smith and Senator Simpson, chairmen of the respective \nHouse and Senate Subcommittees responsible for 1996 legislation, have \nboth agreed in an exchange of letters with the Canadian Ambassador that \nthis provision, ``Section 110'' of the bill, was not intended to cover, \nfor example, Canadians at the northern border. However, because of the \nterm ``every alien,'' the INS has interpreted the law to require this \nprogram be implemented at all land borders, in addition to air and sea \nports of entry. To the credit of the INS, it concedes that it cannot \nimplement such a system.\n  Put simply, Mr. President, Section 110 is a mistake, and we must \ncorrect it. Failure to do so will cost American jobs. It will \neffectively close our borders to honest trade and tourism while harming \nour efforts to fight drugs, terrorism and illegal aliens. It must be \neliminated.\n  We risk a great deal if we fail to act, Mr. President. Last year \nalone, exports to Canada generated more that 72,000 jobs in key \nmanufacturing industries and more than $4.68 billion in value added for \nthe state of Michigan alone. Our trade with Canada is the most \nextensive and profitable in the world. And last year more than 116 \nmillion people entered the United States by land from Canada.\n  The extent of our trade with Canada has caused us to develop an \nintricate web of interdependence that requires a substantially open \nborder. With ``just in time'' delivery becoming the norm in our \nautomobile assembly lines and throughout our manufacturing sector, a \ndelivery of parts delayed by as little as 20 minutes can cause \nexpensive assembly line shutdowns which our economy can ill afford.\n  But delay is exactly what we will see if Section 110 is not \neliminated. Dan Stamper, President of the Detroit International Bridge \nCompany, has testified that even a very efficient system, say one \ntaking 30 seconds for each person to be recorded entering or leaving \nthe country, would mean enormous delays. More than 30,000 crossings per \nday take place at Detroit's Ambassador Bridge. Even if we say that \n7,500 Canadians cross each day, that means 2,250 minutes of additional \nprocessing time. But there are only 1,440 minutes in a day. Traffic \nwould be backed up literally for miles. Significant problems would be \nexperienced on the Southern border as well.\n\n  Assembly lines will shut down. Tourists will stay home. Americans \nwill lose jobs.\n  And for what? Nothing the American people want. The two pilot \nprograms set up by the INS to test implementation of Section 110, one \nin Texas and one in upstate New York, were both shut down due to fierce \ncommunity opposition.\n  Moreover, time and manpower diverted to Section 110's impossible \ndirective will take away from efforts to deal with other problems \nfacing the INS and the Customs service--problems like drug \ninterdiction, the fight against terrorism, and the fight against \nillegal immigration. Drugs, terrorism and illegal immigration are real \nproblems requiring a real investment on our part. We can't afford to \nundermine these programs to pursue a policy we know is nothing more \nthan a mistake.\n  This legislation would eliminate the mandated automated entry-exit \nsystem at land and sea ports of entries and replace it with a \nfeasibility study, required within one year of the passage of the bill, \nto examine whether any system could ever be developed and at an \nacceptable cost to American taxpayers, employers, employees, and the \nnation as a whole.\n  The bill would also authorize significant additional resources at the \nNorthern and Southern borders to fight drugs and terrorism, and to \nfacilitate the entry of legitimate trade and commerce. The legislation \nauthorizes for fiscal year 2000 and 2001 a net increase of 535 INS \ninspectors for the Southwest land border and 375 inspectors for the \nNorthern land border, in order to open all primary lanes on the \nSouthwest and Northern borders during peak hours and enhance \ninvestigative resources. It would add 100 canine enforcement vehicles \nto be used by INS for inspection and enforcement at U.S. land borders. \nAnd it would provide for a net increase of 40 intelligence analysts and \nadditional resources to be distributed among border patrol sectors that \nhave jurisdiction over major metropolitan drug or narcotics \ndistribution and transportation centers to fight against drug smuggling \nand money-laundering.\n  For the U.S. Customs Service, the bill would authorize significant \nadditional resources in technology and manpower for peak hours and \ninvestigations, including new technology and a net increase of 535 \ninspectors and 60 special agents for the Southwest border and 375 \ninspectors for the Northern border. In addition, the bill provides a \nnet increase of 285 inspectors and canine enforcement officers to be \ndistributed at large cargo facilities as needed to process and screen \ncargo and reduce commercial waiting times on U.S. land borders. It \nwould also authorize a net increase of 360 special agents, 40 \nintelligence analysts, and additional resources to be distributed among \noffices that have jurisdiction over major metropolitan drug or \nnarcotics distribution and transportation centers for intensification \nof efforts against drug smuggling and money-laundering organizations. \nThe bill also provides for a net increase of 50 positions and\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nadditional resources to the Office of Internal Affairs to enhance \ninvestigative resources for anticorruption efforts.\n  Mr. President, this bill passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent \nlast year, which helped lead to a significant success--a two and a half \nyear delay in the mandate for implementing this system. The 30 month \ndelay was based on a recognition that this program is unworkable. \nUnfortunately, it provided only a small reprieve that will expire at \nthe beginning of the next Congress. We must build on our success \nachieved last year. It is time to act, to protect American jobs, to \nmaintain our law enforcement priorities and to uphold common sense.\n  I want to thank again the many cosponsors of this legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 745\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Improvement and \n     Immigration Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor \nof the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1999. I co-sponsored \nidentical legislation that passed the Senate during the 105th Congress \nbut did not become law. It is my hope that the Senate will once again \nmove quickly on this legislation so that we may properly address the \nconcerns of the many Americans who would be adversely affected by the \nill-timed implementation of the automated entry-exit border control \nsystem mandated by immigration legislation passed by the 104th \nCongress.\n  Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, codified as Public Law 104-208, required \nthat the Attorney General develop within two years an automated entry-\nexit control system to allow for a better estimate of the number of \nvisa overstayers in the United States. This system would be designed to \ncollect records of arrival and departure for all aliens in the United \nStates, thereby theoretically enabling the Attorney General to identify \nlawfully admitted non-immigrants\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nwho remain in this country beyond an authorized period.\n  I have long been sympathetic to the concern of border communities and \nbusinesses that implementation of Section 110 by the statutory deadline \nof September 30, 1998, would severely disrupt trade and travel across \nAmerica's borders. The governors of Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, the \nBorder Trade Alliance, and numerous businesses operating in the border \nregion have contacted me to express their reservations about the \nconsequences of implementing such a system. Even Section 110's most \nadamant advocates concede that the Administration has neither budgeted \nfor nor begun to put in place the physical and technological \ninfrastructure required to activate a system capable of monitoring the \narrival and departure of every alien entering and departing the United \nStates.\n  It has been estimated that the amount of information to be recorded \nin the database of such an automated entry-exit system would be larger \nthan that held by the Library of Congress, the largest physical \nrepository of information in the world. Clearly, it would be disastrous \nto implement Section 110 before we are capable of making it work.\n  Given these reservations, I wrote Attorney General Janet Reno on \nJanuary 14, 1998, to highlight the potentially harmful impact of the \nstatutory deadline for implementation of Section 110 on Arizona's \nborder communities. I also sponsored S. 1360, the Border Improvement \nand Immigration Act of 1998, to require a feasibility study of Section \n110 before it is implemented. Ultimately, the 105th Congress addressed \nthis issue in the Fiscal Year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  After learning that conferees to the bill were considering delaying \nimplementation of the automated entry-exit system on the southwest \nborder for only one year, while indefinitely delaying or even removing \nits applicability to the northern border, I initiated a letter with \nSenator Kyl to the House and Senate conferees urging them to delay \nimplementation of the program by 30 months for both borders. \nUltimately, the conferees agreed to this 30-month delay. I was \ngratified that the final version of the FY 1999 Omnibus bill reflected \nour request not to discriminate against the southwest border by \nimposing a deadline for installation of an entry-exit system that could \nnot realistically be met.\n  Like other provisions of the FY 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill, \nhowever, this compromise on Section 110 was a quick fix, not a lasting \nsolution. The language in the bill setting a new deadline for \nimplementation of an automated entry-exit system was designed to \nprevent the Immigration and Naturalization Service from being in \ntechnical violation of the law by failing to carry out the mandate of \nSection 110 by the 1998 deadline. The extension of that deadline by 30 \nmonths provides Congress with the opportunity to more thoughtfully \nassess the long-term feasibility of an automated entry-exit system for \nall ports of entry into the United States.\n  The Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1999 would indefinitely \nextend the deadline for implementation of Section 110 and require a \ndetailed feasibility study to determine how and whether the requirement \ncan ultimately be met. The legislation would also authorize substantial \nnew resources for INS and Customs Service border enforcement \nactivities. Specifically, it would authorize the expenditure of $588 \nmillion over the next two years to enhance border enforcement against \nillegal immigration and drug trafficking, as well as investigate \ncorruption and money-laundering along the border; add 1,200 new INS \ninspectors, canine enforcement officers, intelligence analysts, and \ninvestigators to bolster enforcement against illegal aliens and \nnarcotics trafficking; and add 1,700 new Customs inspectors, special \nagents, intelligence analysts, and canine enforcement officers to man \nports of entry and investigate criminal activity along the border.\n  The legislation would also provide the high-technology tools, \nincluding x-ray, ultrasonic, motion-detecting, remote-watch, and \nparticle-detector sensors, that will enable INS and Customs officials \nto more effectively interdict narcotics and illegal immigrants. \nFinally, it would enhance investigative resources for border \nenforcement and anti-corruption efforts, intensify efforts against drug \nsmuggling and money-laundering organizations, allow for more rapid \ncargo processing, and reduce commercial and passenger traffic waiting \ntimes at ports of entry.\n  As a founding member and Co-Chairman of the Senate Border Caucus, \nwhose priorities include improving border enforcement and facilitating \nU.S. trade with Mexico, I believe this bill advances our national \ninterest in better controlling our nation's borders without unduly \nhindering flows of cross-border trade and travel. The Border \nImprovement and Immigration Act of 1999 deserves this Congress' \nsupport.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I join Senator Abraham, Chairman of the \nJudiciary Immigration Subcommittee, Mr. President. Minnesota and \nMichigan are two states which share a common border with Canada, and so \nI am proud to join my colleague, Senator Abraham as co-sponsor of his \nbill to ensure Canada will continue to receive current treatment of its \ntraveling citizens by requiring a feasibility study of Section 110 of \nthe IIRIRA bill. There has been great concern, especially in Minnesota \nas to how the immigration law we passed in 1996 will affect the \nnorthern U.S. border. Right now the fear is the law is being \nmisinterpreted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  Minnesota has about 817 miles of shared border with Canada and we \nshare many interests with our northern neighbor--tourism, trade and \nfamily visits among the most prevalent. In the last few years, passage \nback and forth over the Minnesota/Canadian border has been more open \nand free flowing, especially since the North American Free Trade \nAgreement (NAFTA) went into effect. There were 116 million travelers \nentering the U.S. from Canada in 1996 over the land border. As our \nrelationship with Canada is increasingly interwoven, we have sought a \nless restrictive access to each country.\n  The Immigration Bill of 1996 was intended to focus on illegal aliens \nentering this country from Mexico and living in the United States \nillegally. The new law states that ``every alien'' entering and leaving \nthe United States would have to register at all the borders--land, sea \nand air. The Immigration and Naturalization Service was tasked with the \neffort to set up automated pilot sites along the border to discover the \nmost effective way to implement this law, which was to become effective \non September 30, 1998.\n  The INS was quietly going about establishing a pilot site on the New \nYork State border when the reality sunk in. A flood of calls from \nconstituents came into the offices of all of us serving Canadian border \nstates. Canadian citizens and the Canadian government, also, registered \nopposition to this new restriction. It became quite clear that no one \nhad considered how the new law affected Canada. Current law already \nwaives the document requirement for most Canadian nationals, but still \nrequires certain citizens to register at border crossings. That system \nhas worked. There have been very few problems at the northern border \nwith drug trafficking and illegal aliens.\n  In an effort to resolve this situation, I joined other Senators in a \nletter to INS Commissioner Meissner asking for her interpretation of \nthis law. Other bills were introduced addressing this issue in the last \nCongress and action was taken extending the implementation of this \nSection until March 30, 2001.\n  However, today, we must make it very clear that Congress did not \nintend to impose additional documentary requirements on Canadian \nnationals; Senator Abraham's bill will restore our intent.\n  This legislation will not precipitously open the flood gates for \nillegal aliens to pass through--it will still require those who \ncurrently need documentation to continue to produce it and remain \nregistered in a new INS system. This will allow the INS to keep track \nof that category of non-immigrant entering our country to ensure they \nleave when their visas expire. Senator Abraham's bill will not unfairly \ntreat our friends on the Canadian side that have been deemed not to \nneed documentation--they will still be able to pass freely back and \nforth across the border.\n  But this bill will enable us to avoid the huge traffic jams and \nconfusion\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nwhich would no doubt occur if every alien was to be registered in and \nout of the U.S. Such registration would discourage trade and visits to \nour country. It would delay shipments of important industrial \nequipment, auto parts, services and other shared ventures that have \nlong thrived along the northern border. It will discourage the economic \nrevival that northern Minnesotans are experiencing, helped by Canadian \nshoppers and tourists.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe Congress intended to create this new \nmandate. We sought to keep illegal aliens and illegal drugs out, not \nour trading partners and visiting consumers. Through the Abraham bill, \nwe will still do that while keeping the door opened to our neighbors \nfrom the north. The bill is good foreign policy, good public policy and \ngood economic policy. We all will benefit while retaining our ability \nto keep track of non-immigrants who enter our borders.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Abraham for his leadership on this \nimportant matter. Many Minnesotans, through letters, calls and personal \nappeals, have showed their opposition to a potential crisis. This is, \nalso, an unacceptable burden on our Canadian neighbors and those who \ndepend upon their free access that effects the economics of all border \nstates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Robb, \n        Mr. Abraham, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Roth, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Stevens, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n        Enzi, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 746. A bill to provide for analysis of major rules, to promote the \npublic's right to know the costs and benefits of major rules, and to \nincrease the accountability of quality of Government; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                     THE REGULATORY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator \nThompson, the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1999. This is the same \nlegislation we developed in the last Congress, and it includes the \nchanges we agreed to last year with the Administration. This is the \nlegislation the President has agreed to sign if we present it to him in \nthis form. And I am hopeful we can get it to him this year and get \nthese important processes enacted into law. Senator Thompson and I are \npleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Voinovich, Robb, \nAbraham, Rockefeller, Roth, Daschle, Stevens, Moynihan, Cochran, \nBreaux, Frist, Enzi, Grams, Grassley, and Lincoln.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act would put into law basic requirements \nfor cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment of major rules and \nexecutive oversight of the rulemaking process.\n  Mr. President, I've fought for regulatory reform since 1979, the year \nI came to the Senate. As for an overall regulatory reform bill, I've \nsupported such legislation since 1980, when the Senate first passed S. \n1080, the Laxalt Leahy bill only to have it die later that year in the \nHouse. Those of us who believe in the benefits of regulation to protect \nhealth and safety have a particular responsibility to make sure that \nregulations are sensible and cost-effective. When they aren't, the \nregulatory process--which is so vital to our health and well being--\ncomes under constant attack and the regulations which we count on to \nprotect us fail to achieve the maximum effectiveness. We miss the \nopportunity to do more with the resources we have. By requiring a \nregulatory process that is open and requires agencies to use good \nscience and common sense, we immunize that process from attack and \nimprove the quality of our regulations.\n  Based on the principles of better cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment, more flexibility for the regulated industries to reach \nlegislative goals in a variety of ways, more cooperative efforts \nbetween government and industry and less ``us versus them'' attitudes, \nSenator Thompson and I, in cooperation with the Administration, have \ndeveloped this bill.\n  Let me highlight some important features of this legislation.\n  The bill would put into statute requirements for cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment of major rules and executive oversight of \nthe rulemaking process. It requires agencies to do a cost-benefit \nanalysis when issuing rules that cost $100 million, or are otherwise \ndesignated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs (OIRA) as having other significant impacts. The \nagency must determine whether the benefits of the rule justify its \ncosts; whether the rule is more cost-effective, or provides greater net \nbenefits, than other regulatory options considered by the agency; and \nwhether the rule adopts a flexible regulatory option. If the agency \ndetermines that the rule does not do so, the agency is required to \nexplain the reasons why it selected the rule, including any statutory \nprovision that required the agency to select the rule.\n  We say right from the beginning, in the section on findings, that \ncost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are useful tools to help \nagencies issue reasonable regulations. However, as we explicitly state, \nthey do not replace the need for good judgment and the agencies' \nconsideration of social values in deciding when and how to regulate.\n  The bill requires an agency issuing a major rule to evaluate the \nbenefits and costs of a ``reasonable number of reasonable alternatives \nreflecting the range of regulatory options that would achieve the \nobjective of the statute as addressed by the rulemaking.'' The bill \ndoesn't require an agency to look at all the possible alternatives, \njust a reasonable number; but it does require the agency to pick a \nselection of options that are available to it within the range of the \nrulemaking objective.\n  We define benefits very broadly. Nothing in this bill suggests that \nthe only benefits assessed by an agency should be quantifiable. On the \ncontrary, this bill explicitly recognizes that many important benefits \nmay be nonquantifiable, and that agencies have the right and authority \nto fully consider such benefits when doing the cost-benefit analysis \nand when determining whether the benefits justify the costs.\n\n  If the rule involves a risk to health, safety or the environment, the \nbill requires the agency to do a quality risk assessment to analyze the \nbenefits of the rule. All required risk assessments and cost-benefit \nanalyses for rules costing $500 million would undergo independent peer \nreview. During the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, the \nrulemaking agency is required to consider substitution risks--that is, \nrisks that could be expected to result from the implementation of the \nregulatory option selected by the agency--and to compare the risk being \nregulated with other risks with which the public may be familiar.\n  The risk assessment requirement establishes basic elements for \nperforming risk assessments, many of which will provide transparency \nfor an agency's development of a rule, and it requires guidelines for \nsuch assessments to be issued by OIRA in consultation with the Office \nof Science and Technology Policy.\n  Peer review is required by this bill for both cost-benefit analyses \nand risk assessments, but only once per rule. Peer review is not \nrequired at both the proposed and final rule stages.\n  The cost-benefit analysis, cost-benefit determinations, and risk \nassessment are required to be included in the rulemaking record and to \nbe considered by the court, to the extent relevant, only in determining \nwhether the final rule is arbitrary and capricious. In addition, if the \nagency fails to perform the cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment or \npeer review, the court may remand or invalidate the rule, giving due \nregard to prejudicial error, and in any event shall order the agency to \nperform the missing assessment or analysis.\n  The bill codifies the review procedure now conducted by the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and requires public \ndisclosure of OIRA's review process.\n  Finally, the bill requires the Director of OMB to contract for a \nstudy on the comparison of risks to human health, safety and the \nenvironment and a study to develop a common basis for risk \ncommunication with respect to carcinogens and noncarcinogens and the \nincorporation of risk assessments into cost-benefit analyses.\n  Mr. President, the cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments \nrequired by the bill are intended to be transparent to the public. \nAgencies should not hide the important information that forms the basis \nof their regulatory actions.\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\n  Another important provision of this bill is the one that requires the \nagency to make a reasonable determination whether the benefits of the \nrule justify the costs and whether the regulatory option selected by \nthe agency is substantially likely to achieve the objective of the \nrulemaking in a more cost effective manner or with greater net benefits \nthan the other regulatory options considered by the agency. This is not \nin any way a decisional criteria that the agency must meet. If, as the \nagency is free to do, it chooses a regulatory option where the benefits \ndo not justify the costs or that is not more cost effective or does not \nprovide greater net benefits than the other options, the agency is \nrequired to explain why it did what it did and list the factors that \ncaused it to do so. Those factors could be a statute, a policy \njudgment, uncertainties in the data and the like. There is no added \njudicial scrutiny of a rule provided for or intended by this section. \nThe final rule must still stand or fall based on whether the court \nfinds that the rule is arbitrary or capricious in light of the whole \nrulemaking record. That is the current standard of judicial review.\n  The bill says that if an agency ``cannot'' make the determinations \nrequired by the bill, it has to say why it can't. Use of the word \n``cannot'' does not mean that an agency rule can be overturned by a \ncourt for its failure to pick an option that would permit the agency to \nmake the determinations required by the bill. The agency is free to use \nits discretion to regulate under the substantive statute, and there is \nno implication that such rule must meet the standards described in the \ndeterminations subsection. This legislation requires only that the \nagency be up front with the public as to just how cost-beneficial and \ncost-effective its regulatory proposal is.\n\n  Judicial review has been of great concern to those of us who want \nreal regulatory reform without bottling up important regulations in the \ncourts. There is no judicial review permitted of the cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment required by this bill outside of judicial \nreview of the final rule. The analysis and assessment are included in \nthe rulemaking record, but there is no judicial review of the content \nof those items or the procedural steps followed or not followed by the \nagency in the development the analysis or assessment. Only the total \nfailure to actually do the cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment \nwould allow the court to remand the rule to the agency.\n  Finally, as I noted, the bill reflects agreement with the \nAdministration. Among the key aspects of that agreement are added \nclarification on the avoidance of a so-called ``supermandate;'' \nclarification of the provisions for peer review; and deletion of \nprovisions that would have required periodic reviews of existing rules.\n  So those are some highlights. A hearing on the bill in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is planned for April.\n  We are pleased that we have the support of the state and local \ngovernment organizations, namely the National Governor's Association, \nthe National League of Cities, the Council of State Governments, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, and the National Association of Counties, as well as dozens of \nbusiness organizations, the school boards, state environmental \ndirectors, and leading experts and scholars across the country.\n  I feel strongly that this bill will improve the regulatory process, \nwill build confidence in the regulatory programs that are so important \nto this society's well-being, and will result in better, more \nprotective regulations because we will be directing our resources in \nmore cost-effective ways.\n  I thank Senator Thompson and his staff, Paul Noe, for their \npersistent and hard work in keeping this effort going. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the July 15, 1998, letter to me from Jacob Lew, Director \nof OMB, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter of July 1, \n     1998, in which you respond to the views on S. 981 that we \n     expressed in former OMB Director Frank Raines' letter of \n     March 6, 1998.\n       President Clinton has been a strong supporter of \n     responsible regulatory reform. In addition to signing into a \n     law a number of important pieces of reform legislation, he \n     and Vice President Gore are taking a wide range of \n     administrative steps to improve the regulatory process. For \n     example, under the guidance of Executive Order 12866, \n     agencies are developing flexible performance standards and \n     using market incentives whenever possible; are applying \n     benefit-cost analysis to achieve objectives in the most cost-\n     effective manner; and are reaching out to the affected \n     parties, particularly our State and local partners, to \n     understand better the intended and unintended consequences of \n     a proposed regulatory action. Under the leadership of the \n     Vice President's National Partnership for Reinventing \n     Government, agencies are improving delivery of services, \n     reducing red tape, and reforming practices to focus on \n     customer service. The Administration's goal in these actions \n     is to streamline and reduce the burden of government on its \n     citizens, improve services, and restore the basic trust of \n     public in its government.\n       The debate on comprehensive regulatory reform legislation \n     is one that has sparked great passion and has provoked, as \n     you aptly note in your letter, ``distrust and friction among \n     the interested parties.'' We heartily agree with you that, to \n     say the least, ``[t]he path to this point has not been \n     easy.'' In part, this has been the result of earlier versions \n     of this legislation proposed by others that sought not to \n     improve the nation's regulatory system, but to burden and \n     undermine it. In a variety of ways these bills would have \n     created obstacles and hurdles to the government's ability to \n     function effectively and to protect the health, safety, and \n     environment of its citizens. In particular, these bills would \n     have created a supermandate, undoing the many protections for \n     our citizens that are carefully crafted into specific \n     statutes. In addition, strict judicial review and complex \n     analytic, risk assessment, peer review, and lookback \n     provisions would have hampered rather than helped the \n     government's ability to make reasonable decisions and would \n     have opened the door to new rounds of endless litigation.\n       We appreciate your thoughtful efforts over the past year to \n     respond to issues that we and others have raised. In your \n     latest letter you continue to take seriously our concerns. \n     Indeed, the changes you indicate that you are willing to make \n     would resolve our concerns, and if the bill emerges from the \n     Senate and House as you now propose, with no changes, the \n     President would find it acceptable and sign it.\n       I should note, however, that our experience with past \n     efforts to resolve these differences suggests that good ideas \n     and the resolution of differences can be destroyed during the \n     long process at getting a bill to the President's desk, and \n     the nuances and balance that we have all sought in this \n     legislation could be easily disrupted. Many of the terms used \n     carry great meaning, and further modification is likely to \n     renew the concerns that have animated our past opposition to \n     bills of this type. Accordingly, we look forward to working \n     with you to ensure that any bill the Congress passes on this \n     subject is fully consistent with the one on which we have \n     reached agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr President, I am pleased to join Senator Levin and a \nbipartisan group of our colleagues in introducing legislation to \npromote smarter regulation by the federal government. The Regulatory \nImprovement Act is an effort by many of us who want to improve the \nquality of government to find a common solution. I am pleased that we \nare introducing this bill with Senators Voinovich, Robb Abraham, \nRockefeller, Roth, Daschle, Stevens, Moynihan, Cochran, Breaux, Frist, \nLincoln, Enzi, Grams, and Grassley. The supporters of this bill \nrepresent a real diversity of political viewpoints, but we share the \nsame goals. We want an effective government that protects public \nhealth, well-being and the environment. We want our government to \nachieve those goals in the most sensible and efficient way possible. We \nwant to do the best we can with what we've got, and to do more good at \nless cost if possible. The Regulatory Improvement Act will help us do \nthat.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act is based on a simple premise: people \nhave a right to know how and why government agencies make their most \nimportant and expensive regulatory decisions. This legislation also \nwill improve the quality of government decision making--which will lead \nto a more effective Federal government. And it will make government \nmore accountable to the people it serves.\n  The Regulatory Improvement Act will require the Federal government to \nmake better use of modern decisionmaking tools (such as risk assessment\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nand benefit-cost analysis), which are currently under-used. Right now, \nthese tools are simply options--options that aren't used as much or as \nwell as they should be. Under this legislation, agencies will carefully \nconsider and disclose the benefits and costs of different regulatory \nalternatives and seek out the smartest, most flexible solutions. This \nlegislation also will help the Federal government set smarter \npriorities--to better focus money and other resources on the most \nserious problems.\n  This legislation not only gives people the right to know; it gives \nthem the right to see--to see how the government works, or how it \ndoesn't. And by providing people with information the government uses \nto make decisions, it gives people a real opportunity to influence \nthose decisions. The bill empowers people and their State and local \nofficials to provide input into the Federal rulemaking system. It will \nmake the Federal government more mindful of how unfunded mandates can \nburden communities and interfere with local priorities. That is why our \ngovernors, mayors, state legislators, and county officials support the \nRegulatory Improvement Act.\n  We have worked hard to build a solid foundation for smarter \nregulatory decisionmaking. Last March, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee favorably reported the Regulatory Improvement Act, then S. \n981, by a 10-5 vote. At the time of the markup, the Administration sent \na letter to me and Senator Levin expressing a number of concerns with \nthe bill. We worked to resolve those concerns, which largely involved \nadding clarifying language to the bill. In addition, some sections of \nthe bill were modified, and a couple were dropped. On July 15, Jack \nLew, the Director of OMB, sent us a letter on behalf of the \nAdministration. The letter states that the President supports the \nlegislation. I am pleased that the White House recognizes the \nimportance of the legislation to deliver the effective and efficient \nregulatory system that the American people expect and deserve.\n  This legislation will add transparency to the current rulemaking \nprocess, raise the quality of regulatory analyses so smarter decisions \ncan be made, and help expedite important safeguards--to reduce risks \nand save lives. It will help us get more of the good things sensible \nregulation can deliver. That's why the Regulatory Improvement Act has \nbroad bipartisan support and is endorsed by state and local officials, \ngovernment reformers and scholars, small business owners, farmers, \ncorporate leaders, and school board members. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to pass this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from \nthe National Governors' Association, the National League of Cities, the \nCouncil of State Governments, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National \nAssociation of Counties be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                                   March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Fred D. Thompson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Thompson and Levin: The nation's Governors \n     support the ``Regulatory Improvement Act of 1999.'' The \n     proposed legislation would greatly assist the state and local \n     governments in assessing the costs and benefits of major \n     regulations. This bill would lead to improved quality of \n     federal regulatory programs and rules, increase federal \n     government accountability, and encourage open communication \n     among federal agencies, state and local governments, the \n     public, and Congress regarding federal regulatory priorities.\n       We applaud your efforts to encourage greater accountability \n     with regard to the burden of costly federal regulations on \n     state and local governments. The changes proposed would, we \n     believe, benefit all of our taxpayers and constituents. We \n     look forward to working with you in securing enactment of \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Thomas R. Carper.\n     Governor Michael O. Leavitt\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                                   March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: The National League of Cities (NLC) \n     applauds your efforts in introducing the Regulatory \n     Improvement Act. NLC represents 135,000 mayors and council \n     members from municipalities across the country. Over 75 \n     percent of our members are from small cities and towns with \n     populations of less than 50,000. Costly regulations without \n     and science or significant benefits to health and safety are \n     detrimental and burdensome to cities and towns.\n       Local governments could reap substantial benefits from the \n     improvements in the regulatory process that are included in \n     this legislation. These improvements would help municipal \n     officials avert preemptive and costly regulations that are \n     placed on local governments and gain a more powerful voice in \n     the regulatory rulemaking process. The National League of \n     Cities strongly supports enforceable cost-benefit analysis \n     and relative risk assessment for actions by federal agencies \n     that significantly impact state and local governments.\n       The Regulatory Improvement Act would also clarify the \n     intent of the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) by \n     requiring agencies to develop an effective process for local \n     input into the development of regulatory proposals and \n     prevent regulatory proposals that contain significant \n     unfunded federal mandates. This type of partnership could \n     save cities millions of dollars in burdensome regulation and \n     assist the federal government in gaining community buy-in \n     when regulation is necessary.\n       The Regulatory Improvement Act will provide a means for \n     testing costs of future regulation on local governments with \n     oversight by the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs. While the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act makes \n     great strides towards helping local governments prevent \n     costly regulations, now is the time to clarify the law to \n     provide for cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. If \n     your staff has any questions, please have them contact \n     Kristin Cormier, NLC Legislative Counsel.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Clarence E. Anthony,\n     President, Mayor, South Bay, FL.\n                                  ____\n\n                                 The Council of State Governments,\n\n\n                                            Washington Office,\n\n                                                   March 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The Council of State Governments (CSG) \n     supports your introduction of the Regulatory Improvement Act. \n     This bill would codify requirements that would compel the \n     federal government to consider the impact and costs of new \n     and current regulations on state and territorial governments, \n     as well as gain the input of local, state, and tribal \n     governments in the regulatory process. CSG represents a \n     national constituency composed of state and territorial \n     elected officials from all three branches of government. \n     Costly regulations without sound science or significant \n     benefits to health and safety are detrimental and burdensome \n     to the jurisdictions administered by our members.\n       State governments could reap substantial benefits through \n     improvements in the regulatory process included in this \n     legislation. These improvements would help state officials \n     avert preemptive and costly regulations that are placed on \n     state governments and gain a more powerful voice in the \n     federal regulatory rulemaking process. The Council of State \n     Governments strongly supports enforceable cost-benefit \n     analysis and relative risk assessments for every action by \n     any and every federal agency that significantly impacts state \n     and local governments.\n       The Regulatory Improvement Act could clarify the intent of \n     the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). By expanding on \n     UMRA language to require federal agencies to develop an \n     effective process to permit meaningful and timely input from \n     elected state, local and tribal government into the \n     development of federal regulatory proposals containing \n     significant intergovernmental mandates, state governments \n     will be enabled to make the case that certain costs currently \n     being arbitrarily imposed upon them are truly unnecessary and \n     overly burdensome. This type of partnership between the \n     federal and state governments will benefit both parties by \n     saving the states millions of dollars, while simultaneously \n     ensuring community ``buy-in'' when federal regulations are \n     necessary.\n       The Regulatory Improvement Act will provide a means for \n     testing costs of future regulation on state governments with \n     oversight by the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs. While the 1995 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act makes \n     great strides towards helping local governments prevent \n     costly regulations, now is the time to clarify the law to \n     account for cost benefit analysis and risk assessment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Tommy G. Thompson,\n       State of Wisconsin, President, CSG.\n     Senator Kenneth D. McClintock,\n       Chairman, CSG.\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                        of State Legislatures,\n\n                                                   March 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thompson and Senator Levin: I am writing to \n     offer the strong support of the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures for legislation you will soon introduce that \n     will require cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments for \n     federal regulations that impact state and local governments. \n     This legislation builds on executive order 12866 by codifying \n     many of its provisions. The analyses and assessments included \n     in your legislation are essential for ensuring that \n     government resources are utilized to produce maximum benefits \n     for consumers and those who are regulated.\n       We are pleased that your legislation will institute an \n     early consultation process with state and local government \n     officials and their representatives on proposed regulations \n     that may have significant intergovernmental mandates. We are \n     also reassured that you will include independent agencies in \n     the regulatory consultation and cost-benefits analysis/risk \n     assessment processes. This will widen the potential benefit \n     of your legislation and give state and local governments a \n     consultation opportunity that we have not had under other \n     laws and regulatory processes.\n       Enactment of both the Regulatory Improvement Act as well as \n     Regulatory Right to Know Act will bolster federalism. Both \n     are a part of a larger federalism agenda that the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures and our state and local \n     government assessment partners are supporting this year.\n       I appreciate the leadership you are providing by \n     introducing the Regulatory Improvement Act and look forward \n     to working with you to ensure its enactment during the 106th \n     Congress. NCSL will certainly work to build cosponsorship and \n     support for this legislation so that it can be enacted \n     expeditiously.\n           Sincerely,\n     William T. Pound, Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                The U.S. Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                                   March 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: On behalf of The U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors, I am writing to express our strong support for the \n     Regulatory Improvement Act (RIA). If enacted, we believe this \n     legislation will greatly improve the way federal agencies \n     develop rules and regulations affecting state and local \n     governments. We are once again delighted that you and Senator \n     Carl Levin will cosponsor this legislation, which enjoys \n     broad bipartisan support.\n       Since the passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) of 1995, members of Congress have become more \n     sensitive to the cost and the impact of new unfunded mandates \n     on state and local governments. Unfortunately, UMRA has had \n     very little effect on the federal regulatory process. We \n     believe this will change once the Levin-Thompson bill is \n     approved. Each federal agency will be required to conduct a \n     risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis on all major rules. \n     If they do not, federal courts will have authority to remand \n     or invalidate such rules.\n       In closing, I want to thank you and Senator Levin for \n     cosponsoring this important legislation. By requiring federal \n     agencies to be more sensitive to the cost and benefit of new \n     rules, we believe the number of costly mandates imposed on \n     state and local governments will be reduced in the future. Be \n     assured that the nation's mayors stand ready to work with you \n     in any way we can to ensure the passage of this legislation. \n     Feel free to contact Larry Jones of the Conference staff if \n     you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Deedee Corradini,\n     Mayor of Salt Lake City.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Supporting the Regulatory Improvement Act\n\n       Whereas, in February 1998, the General Accounting Office \n     released a report that concludes that the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act of 1995, which in part was enacted to limit the \n     ability of federal agencies to impose new costly unfunded \n     mandates on state and local governments, has had only limited \n     impact on federal agencies' rulemaking actions; and\n       Whereas, state and local leaders are concerned that federal \n     agencies are continuing to impose new costly rules on state \n     and local governments with very little accountability; and\n       Whereas, in response to the GAO report, Senators Fred \n     Thompson and Carl Levin introduced the Regulatory Improvement \n     Act, a proposal that would require federal agencies to \n     conduct cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment and peer \n     review before issuing any new major rule (costing over $100 \n     million annually or deemed by the Office of Management and \n     Budget to have a significant impact on the economy); and\n       Whereas, under the proposed legislation federal agencies \n     that issue new rules before conducting the required cost-\n     benefit analysis, risk assessment and peer review would be \n     subjected to judicial review and courts would be required to \n     invalidate such rules; and\n       Whereas, the bill would require each federal agency to \n     develop an effective process to allow elected representatives \n     of state and local governments to provide meaningful and \n     timely input into the regulatory process consistent with \n     UMRA; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Conference of Mayors urges all \n     members of the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Regulatory \n     Improvement Act; and be it\n       Further Resolved that The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges \n     that similar legislation be introduced in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives and urges all members to vote in favor of \n     such legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         NACo,\n\n                                                   March 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chair, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Counties (NACo) I am pleased to express our \n     support for your legislation, The Regulatory Improvement Act. \n     NACo applauds your efforts on behalf of the counties \n     throughout the nation that have for decades faced an ever-\n     increasing number of unfunded regulatory mandates from \n     federal departments and agencies.\n       NACo supports legislation that would require federal \n     departments and agencies to conduct a cost benefit analysis \n     to determine that the benefits to be derived from issuing a \n     new regulation outweight the costs to state and local \n     government.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Betty Lou Ward,\n\n                                                  President, NACo,\n                                    Commissioner, Wake County, NC.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues as an original co-sponsor of the Regulatory Improvement Act. \nI commend Senators Thompson and Levin for their bipartisan work to pass \nlegislation to enable federal regulators to do a better job of \nprotecting public health, safety and the environment. This is the same \nbill that the Administration, state and local governments and the \nbusiness community supported last year.\n  I am a public servant who cares deeply about the needs of our \nenvironment and the health and well-being of our citizens. I sponsored \nlegislation to create the Ohio Environmental Agency when I served in \nthe state legislature, and I fought to end oil and gas drilling in the \nLake Erie Bed. As Governor, I increased funding for environmental \nprotection by over 60 percent.\n  However, over the years, I also have become increasingly concerned \nabout the unnecessary and burdensome costs that are imposed on our \ncitizens and state and local governments through federal laws and \nregulations.\n  Efforts to address these cost burdens began back in 1994 when I \nworked with Senators Roth, Glenn and Kempthorne and the state-local \ngovernment coalition to draft an unfunded mandates reform bill. We \nsucceeded in passing the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) in the \n104th Congress.\n  Following this success, I worked closely with the state-local \ngovernment coalition on our next priority--passage of effective safe \ndrinking water reforms--which was enacted with broad bipartisan support \nin 1996.\n  These efforts are notable because they represent common-sense reforms \nthat make government more accountable based on public awareness of \nrisks, costs and benefits. These statutes set key precedents for the \nreforms that are envisioned in the regulatory Improvement Act. In many \nrespects, this bill builds on these achievements. Senator Thompson has \nsaid that this bill represents phase 2 of UMRA and I strongly agree.\n  I specifically mention the drinking water program today because of \nits close similarity to the Regulatory Improvement Act. In both, \nagencies are required to conduct an analysis of incremental costs and \nbenefits of alternative standards, while providing those agencies with \nflexibility in making final regulatory decisions.\n  If we agree that these analytical tools are good enough for the water \nthat we drink, they certainly must be good enough for other \nregulations.\n  However, both UMRA and the drinking water amendments have had limited \napplications. The Regulatory Improvement Act is needed to provide \nacross-the-board cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment procedures \nat all federal agencies. This bill will result in greater protection of \npublic health and the environment while alleviating cost burdens on \nstate and local governments and the private sector.\n  GAO reported last year that UMRA has had little effect on the way \nfederal agencies make rulemaking decisions. The report specifically \npoints out that the Regulatory Improvement Act\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\nwould improve the quality of regulatory analysis. I think it is time \nthat we make federal agencies--not just Congress--accountable for the \ndecisions they make.\n  While many federal regulations have been well intended, not all have \nachieved their purpose and many have unnecessarily passed significant \nburdens onto our citizens and state and local governments.\n  It is crucial that federal, state and local governments work in \npartnership to determine how we can best allocate resources for \nprotection of health and the environment. As a nation, we spend vast \nsums on regulations. A report commissioned by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration estimates that regulations will cost the economy about \n$709 billion 1999--more than $7,000 for the average American household.\n  Unfortunately, this burden on consumers and American businesses has \nnot always resulted in maximum health or environmental protection. At \ntimes, it has diverted scarce resources that could be used for other \npriorities such as education, crime prevention and more effective \nprotection of health and the environment.\n  The challenge facing public officials today is determining how best \nto protect the health of our citizens and our environment with limited \nresources. We need to do a much better job ensuring that regulations' \ncosts bear a reasonable relationship with their benefits, and we need \nto do a better job of setting priorities and spending our resources \nwisely.\n  I believe that the Regulatory Improvement Act will help achieve these \ngoals. First, I believe this bill will increase the public's knowledge \nof how and why agencies make major rules. In essence, this bill asks \nregulatory agencies to answer several simple, but vital questions: What \nis the nature of the risk being considered? What are the benefits of \nthe proposed regulation? How much will it cost? And, are there better, \nless burdensome ways to achieve the same goals?\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill provides opportunities for \nstate and local government officials to consult with agencies as rules \nare being developed so that regulators are more sensitive to state and \nlocal needs and the burden of unfunded mandates. This only makes sense \nsince states and local governments often have the responsibility of \nimplementing and enforcing these regulations.\n  Second, requiring federal agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses, \npublish those results, disclose any estimates of risks and explain \nwhether any of these factors were considered in finalizing rules will \nincrease government accountability to the people it serves.\n  And finally, this bill will improve the quality of government \ndecision-making by allowing the government to set priorities and focus \non the worst risks first. Careful thought, reasonable assumptions, peer \nreview and sound science will help target problems and find better \nsolutions.\n  This bill does not mandate outcomes, but it does impose common-sense \ndiscipline and accountability in the rulemaking process. I think it is \ntime to move forward with this bipartisan measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 747. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to promote rail \ncompetition, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n     Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization and Rail Service \n                            Improvement Act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Surface \nTransportation Board Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 1999.\n  My highest priority as chairman of the Surface Transportation \nSubcommittee of the Commerce Committee this year is to pass a re-\nauthorization bill--one that provides some ability for shippers to \nobtain improved service and rates, while maintaining the ability of \nrailroads to make a return and, indeed, grow.\n  The bill I am introducing seeks to improve competition and the \nprocedures at the Board that shippers and carriers rely upon to \nadjudicate their rate disputes. At the same time, it recognizes the \nneed for the railroad industry to maintain sound financial footing, \ncapable of maintaining the railroad infrastructure.\n  Last year, at the behest of Chairman McCain and me, the Board \ninitiated a hearing process on competition issues and developed an \nextensive record on these issues. Specifically, the Board held two days \nof hearings and received testimony from 60 witnesses. It heard shipper \ncomplaints of inadequate service, higher rates, and concentration in \nthe railroad industry. The Board also listened to carriers who stressed \nthat, especially in a growing economy, capacity and infrastructure \ninvestment is the key to meeting their customers' needs.\n  In addition, the Board held a hearing in December at my request on \nthe proposals offered by Houston shippers, the Greater Houston \nPartnership and the Railroad Commission of Texas.\n  As a result of these hearings, the Board has done what is within its \nauthority to help shippers obtain some relief. It undertook two \nimportant rulemakings. One provides for alternative rail availability \nduring a service failure. The other streamlines rail rate cases by \ndispensing with consideration of ``product and geographic competition'' \nin determining market dominance for rate cases.\n  I commend the Board for making these rules, and --frankly--for going \nno further. It's refreshing to find a regulatory body that does not \nattempt to develop a new policy in the absence of Congressional \nguidance.\n  This bill picks up where the Board's actions left off. First, it \ncodifies the Board's decision to streamline the market dominance test \nand the procedure for providing alternative rail availability during a \nservice failure. Second, it begins the process of reforming the \nprocedure that small shippers use for rate cases. A recent GAO report \nhighlights the cost, in time and money, of the current process.\n  This bill also sets into motion changes in the Board's revenue \nadequacy finding, making it a more helpful and real-world standard. It \nbalances the bottleneck issue, enhances the Board's emergency powers \nand establishes an arbitration system that could lead to better-shipper \ncarrier dialogue. Finally, it clarifies, in a balanced way and without \ndictating specific outcomes, that competition remains part of the rail \nmerger and national rail policy of this country.\n  It is clear that Congress has a job to do in re-authorizing the \nSurface Transportation Board and addressing some of the difficult \nissues associated with it. This bill is a first step. I want to \nstrongly convey that I do not see it as a final product. While I view \nit as fair to all parties, I am ready to consider changes to improve \nthe bill and ensure its enactment. To that end, I encourage my \ncolleagues to work with me toward the common purpose of reauthorizing \nthe Board and making some common sense improvements.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 747\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve Native hiring and contracting by the \nFederal Government within the State of Alaska, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                native hire and contracting legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this legislation requires the Secretary \nof the Interior to issue a report to the Congress that details the \nspecific steps the Department of the Interior will take to contract \nactivities and programs of the Department to Alaska Natives.\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\n  Legislation already exists for contracting with and hiring Alaska \nNatives. Sections 1307 and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act and section 638 of the Indian Self-Determination and \nEducation Assistance Act are clear on these matters. The problem is \nthat the law have been largely ignored.\n  Outside of a few studies that were contracted to Native Associations \nduring the past two years, the record of the Department in contracting \nand local hiring is abysmal.\n  I have been told by representatives of this Administration that there \nare obstacles in both contracting with and hiring local Natives. When \npressed, the obstacles are not well explained, if at all.\n  Mr. President, if there are valid obstacles, we should know \nspecifically what they are so that Congress can address them. If there \nare not obstacles, then the Administration should begin to implement \nthe law. My legislation requires a complete explanation of the \n``Obstacles'' and a plan for implementing the law in accordance with \nthe Alaska National Interest Lands Conversation Act and the Indian \nSelf-Determination and Education Assistance Act.\n  In addition to the report required by this legislation, the Secretary \nis also directed to initiate a pilot program to contract various \nNational Park Service functions, operations and programs in northwest \nAlaska to local Native entities.\n  Mr. President, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the other agencies \nwithin the Department have an opportunity to hire and contract with \nlocal Alaska Natives who were born, raised and live near and in our \nparks, refuges and public lands in Alaska. These individuals are more \nfamiliar with the area than persons hired from outside Alaska. They \nknow the history, they know the hazards, they know about living and \nworking in arctic conditions. Given the levels of unemployment in the \narea, it makes absolutely no sense not to hire these individuals.\n  I do not understand why any of one of these agencies or bureaus keep \nfiling positions with persons from the lower 48--individuals who have \nlittle experience in Alaska--when they have a qualified individuals in \nthe immediate area.\n  If we can just get the Federal agencies in the State of Alaska to \nread sections 1307 and 1308 of ANILCA and section 638 of ISEAA it would \nbe a major step in the right direction. If Alaska Natives are given the \nopportunity to contract with and be employed by the Federal agencies in \nmy State, everyone wins, no one loses, and the American public will be \nbetter served.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Jeffords, \n        and Mr. Kerry:)\n  S. 749. A bill to establish a program to provide financial assistance \nto States and local entities to support early learning programs for \nprekindergarten children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators Stevens, Dodd, Jeffords, \nKerry and I are introducing legislation to create an Early Learning \nTrust Fund. With this legislation, we intend to improve the \navailability and quality of early learning programs so that all \nchildren can begin school ready to learn.\n  This is a truly bipartisan bill, and it is a privilege to be working \nclosely with Senators of both parties on this issue that is so critical \nto the nation's future--the education of our children. Senator Stevens' \nknowledge of childhood development and brain research is outstanding, \nand his commitment to this issue is impressive. He understands the \nimpact that early education can have on a child's development. Senator \nKerry shares this interest as well. His work on the importance of brain \ndevelopment during the early childhood years has helped educate the \nSenate on this issue. Senator Jeffords' long standing interest in \neducation and school readiness is exemplary. I have great respect for \nhis leadership as Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee on education and many other issues to improve the \nwell-being of children. Senator Dodd's leadership on the Subcommittee \nfor Children and Families has been outstanding. He has always been a \nchampion for children's issues and we are proud to have him as a \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  Over 23 million children under 6 live in the United States, and all \nof these children deserve the opportunity to start school ready to \nlearn. In order for them to do so, we must make significant investments \nin children, long before they ever walk through the schoolhouse door.\n  Recent brain research documents the importance of the first few years \nof life for child development. During this time, children develop \nessential learning and social skills that they will need and use \nthroughout their lives.\n  For children to reach their full potential, they must begin school \nready to learn. Ten years ago, the nation's governors developed a set \nof educational goals to improve the quality of education in the United \nStates. The number one goal was that by the year 2000, all children \nshould enter school ``ready to learn.'' While it is no longer possible \nto meet this objective by the year 2000, we must do all we can. We \ncannot afford to let another decade pass without investing more \neffectively in children's educational development.\n  Quality early education programs help children in a number of ways, \nand have a particularly strong impact on low-income children, who are \nat the greatest risk of school failure. Children who attend high \nquality preschool classes have stronger language, math, and social \nskills than children who attended classes of inferior quality.\n  These early skills translate into greater school readiness. First \ngraders who begin school with strong language and learning skills are \nmore motivated to learn to read well, and they benefit more from \nclassroom instruction. Quality early education programs also have \nimportant long range consequences, and are closely associated with \nincreased academic achievement, higher adult earnings, and far less \ninvolvement with the criminal justice system.\n  Research consistently demonstrates that early education programs \nimprove school readiness. But too many children have no access to these \nprograms. Sixty-one percent of children age 3-5 whose parents earn \n$50,000 or more a year are enrolled in pre-kindergarten classes. But, \nonly 36% of children in the same age group in families earning less \nthan $15,000 are enrolled in such classes. Clearly, many children are \nnot receiving the educational boost they need to begin school ``ready \nto read, ready to learn, and ready to succeed.''\n  Our bill provides 10 billion dollars over five years to states to \nstrengthen and expand early education programs for children under 6. By \nincreasing the number of children who have early learning \nopportunities, we will ensure that many more children begin school \nready to learn.\n  The ``Early Learning Trust Fund'' will provide each state with funds \nto strengthen and improve early education. Governors will receive the \ngrants, and communities, along with parents, will decide how these \nfunds can best be used. The aid will be distributed based on a formula \nwhich takes into account the total number of young children in each \nstate, and the Department of Health and Human Services will allocate \nfunds to the states. To assist in this process, governors will appoint \na state council of representatives from the office of the governor, \nrelevant state agencies, Head Start, parental organizations, and \nresource and referral agencies--all experts in the field of early \neducation. The state councils will be responsible for setting \npriorities, approving and implementing state plans to improve early \neducation.\n  States will have the flexibility to invest in an array of strategies \nthat give young children the building blocks to become good readers and \ngood students. States may use their funds to support a wide range of \nactivities including: (1) strengthening pre-kindergarten services and \nhelping communities obtain the resources necessary to offer children a \ngood start; (2) helping communities make the best use of early learning \nprograms to ensure that their resources are used most effectively; (3) \nensuring that special needs children have access to the early learning \nservices they need to reach their full potential; (4) strengthening \nEarly\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\nHead Start to meet the learning needs of very young children; and (5) \nexpanding Head Start to include full-day, year-round services to help \nchildren of working parents begin school ready to learn. The specific \nstrategy that states decide to adopt is not the central issue--\nimproving school readiness is the central issue. And this bill will \ngive states the flexibility and funding they need to achieve this goal.\n  Children and families across the country will benefit from the Early \nLearning Trust Fund. Massachusetts has more than 480,000 children under \nthe age of 6, and a significant number will be helped by this \nlegislation. Far too many children are currently on waiting lists today \nfor assistance like this. We cannot tell these children, ``Wait until \nyou grow up to receive the education you deserve.''\n  Those on the front lines trying to meet these needs in their \ncommunities will receive reinforcements. For example, in Massachusetts, \nthe Community Partnerships for Children provide full-day early care and \neducation to 15,300 three- and four-year-olds from low-income families. \nThe Early Learning Trust Fund will expand and strengthen exemplary \ninitiatives such as this.\n  Investment in early education is strongly supported by organizations \nacross the country, including the Children's Defense Fund, the National \nGovernors' Association, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, the National \nAssociation of Child Care Resource and Referral Services, the National \nAssociation for State Legislatures, and the National Association for \nthe Education of Young Children. These organizations agree that \ninvestments in children in the early years not only make sense, but \nmake an enormous difference.\n  Our nation's greatest resource is its children. We must do all we can \nto ensure that they reach their full potential. Improving school \nreadiness is an essential first step. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important initiative. I look forward to its enactment, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill may be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 749\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) brain development research shows that the first 3 years \n     of a child's life are critical to a child's brain development \n     and the child's future success;\n       (2) high quality early learning programs can increase the \n     literacy rate, the high school graduation rate, the \n     employment rate, and the college enrollment rate for \n     prekindergarten children who participate in the programs;\n       (3) high quality early learning programs can decrease the \n     incidence of teenage pregnancy, welfare dependency, arrest, \n     and juvenile delinquency for children who participate in \n     these programs;\n       (4) high quality early learning programs can provide a \n     strong base for prekindergarten children in language and \n     cognitive skills and can motivate the children to learn to \n     read in order to benefit from classroom instruction;\n       (5) many working families cannot afford early learning \n     programs for their prekindergarten children;\n       (6) only 36 percent of children who are between the ages of \n     3 and 5, not enrolled in kindergarten, and living in families \n     in which the parents earn less than $15,000, are enrolled in \n     prekindergarten, while 61 percent of children of a similar \n     age who live in families in which the parents earn $50,000 or \n     more are enrolled in prekindergarten;\n       (7) because of the growing number of prekindergarten \n     children in single-parent families or families in which both \n     parents work, there is a great need for affordable high \n     quality, full day, full calendar year early learning \n     programs;\n       (8) many children who could benefit from a strong early \n     learning experience are enrolled in child care programs that \n     could use additional resources to prepare the children to \n     enter school ready to succeed; and\n       (9) the low salaries paid to staff in early learning \n     programs, the lack of career progression for such staff, and \n     the lack of child development specialists involved in the \n     early learning programs makes it difficult to attract and \n     retain trained staff to help the children enter school ready \n     to read.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to make widely available to prekindergarten children a \n     high quality, child-centered, developmentally appropriate \n     early learning program;\n       (2) to make widely available to parents of prekindergarten \n     children who desire the services, a full day, full calendar \n     year program in which they can enroll their prekindergarten \n     children;\n       (3) to make efficient use of Federal, State, and local \n     resources for early learning programs by promoting \n     collaboration and coordination of such programs and supports \n     at the Federal, State, and local levels;\n       (4) to assist State and local governments in expanding or \n     improving early learning programs that use existing \n     facilities that meet State and local safety code \n     requirements;\n       (5) to provide resources to ensure that all children enter \n     elementary school ready to learn how to read; and\n       (6) to assist State and local governments in providing \n     training for teachers and staff of early learning programs, \n     and to promote the use of salary scales that take into \n     account training and experience.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to combat nursing home fraud and abuse, increase \nprotections for victims of telemarketing fraud, enhance safeguards for \npension plans and health care benefit programs, and enhance penalties \nfor crimes against seniors, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                     The Seniors Safety Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Seniors Safety \nAct of 1999, a bill to protect older Americans from crime.\n  The Seniors Safety Act contains a comprehensive package of proposals \ndeveloped with the assistance of the Department of Justice that address \nthe most prevalent crimes perpetrated against seniors, including \nproposals to reduce health care fraud and abuse, combat nursing home \nfraud and abuse, prevent telemarketing fraud, safeguard pension and \nemployee benefit plans from fraud, bribery and graft. In addition, this \nlegislation would help seniors whose pension plans are defrauded to \nobtain restitution. Finally, the bill authorizes the collection of \nappropriate data and examination by the Attorney General to develop new \nstrategies to fight crime against seniors.\n  Seniors over the age of 55 make up the most rapidly growing sector of \nour society. In Vermont alone, the number of seniors grew by more than \nnine percent between 1990 and 1997, now comprising almost twelve \npercent of Vermont's total population. According to recent census \nestimates, the number of seniors over 65 will more than double by the \nyear 2050.\n  It is an ugly fact that criminal activity against seniors that causes \nthem physical harm and economic damage is a significant problem. While \nthe violent and property crime rates have been falling generally, \naccording to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, in \n1997 the violent victimization rates for persons over 50 years of age \nwere no lower than they had been in 1993. In 1997, these older \nAmericans experienced approximately 680 thousand incidents of violent \ncrime, including rape, robbery, and general assault.\n  We need to do better job at protecting seniors and ensuring that they \nenjoy the same decreasing violent and property crime rate as other \nsegments of our society. The Seniors Safety Act contains provisions to \nenhance penalties for criminal offenses that target seniors and \nfraudulent acts that result in physical or economic harm to seniors. In \naddition, to assist Congress and law enforcement authorities in \ndeveloping new and effective strategies to deter crimes against \nseniors, the Act authorizes comprehensive examination of the factors \nassociated with crimes against seniors and the inclusion of data on \nseniors in the National Crime Victims Survey.\n  One particular form of criminal activity--telemarketing fraud--\ndisproportionately impacts Americans over the age of 50, who account \nfor over a third of the estimated $40 billion lost to telemarketing \nfraud each year. The Seniors Safety Act continues the progress we made \nlast year on passage of the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act to \naddress the problem of telemarketing fraud schemes that too often \nsucceed in swindling seniors of their life savings. Some of these \nschemes are directed from outside the United States, making criminal \nprosecution more difficult.\n  The Act would provide the Attorney General with a new, significant \ncrime fighting tool to deal with telemarketing fraud. Specifically, the \nAct would authorize the Attorney General to block or terminate \ntelephone service to telephone facilities that are being used to \nconduct such fraudulent activities. This authority may be used to shut-\ndown telemarketing fraud schemes directed from foreign sources by \ncutting off their telephone service and, once discovered, would protect \nvictims from that particular telemarketing scheme. Of course, committed \nswindlers may just get another telephone number, but even relatively \nbrief interruptions in their fraudulent activities may save some \nseniors from falling victim to the scheme.\n  Another crime prevention provision in the Seniors Safety Act is the \nestablishment by the Federal Trade Commission of a ``Better Business \nBureau''-type clearinghouse. This would provide seniors, their \nfamilies, or others who may be concerned about the legitimacy of a \ntelemarketer with information about prior complaints made about the \nparticular company and any prior convictions for telemarketing fraud. \nIn addition, seniors and other consumers who believe they have been \nswindled would be provided with information for referral to the \nappropriate law enforcement authorities.\n  Criminal activity that undermines the safety and integrity of pension \nplans and health benefit programs pose threats to all of us, but the \ndamage is felt most acutely by seniors who have planned their \nretirements in reliance on the benefits promised by those programs. \nSeniors who have worked faithfully and honestly for years should not \nreach their retirement years only to find that the funds which they \nwere relying upon have been stolen. This is a significant problem. \nAccording the Attorney General's 1997 Annual Report, an interagency \nworking group on pension abuse brought 70 criminal cases representing \nmore than $90 million in losses to pension plans in 29 districts around \nthe country in that year alone.\n  The Seniors Safety Act would add to the arsenal of authority that \nfederal prosecutors have to prevent and punish the defrauding of \nretirement arrangements. Specifically, the Act would create new \ncriminal and civil penalties for defrauding pension plans or obtaining \nmoney or property from such plans by means of false or fraudulent \npretenses. In addition, the Act would enhance penalties for bribery and \ngraft in connection with employee benefit plans. The only people \nenjoying the benefits of pension plans should be the people who have \nworked hard to fund those plans, not crooks who get the money by fraud.\n  Spending on health care in this country amounts to roughly 15 percent \nof the gross national product, or more than $1 trillion each year. \nEstimated losses due to fraud and abuse are astronomical. A December \n1998 report by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) states that \nthese losses ``may exceed 10 percent of annual health care spending, or \n$100 billion per year.'' By contrast to health care fraud, which covers \ndeliberate criminal efforts to steal money, the term ``abuse'' \ndescribes billing errors or manipulation of billing codes that can \nresult in billing for a more highly reimbursed service or product than \nthe one provided.\n  As electronic claims processing--with no human involvement --becomes \nmore prevalent to save administrative costs, more sophisticated \ncomputer-generated fraud schemes are surfacing. Some of these schemes \ngenerate thousands of false claims designed to pass through automated \nclaims processing to payment, and result in the theft of millions of \ndollars from federal and private health care programs. Defrauding \nMedicare, Medicaid and private health plans harms taxpayers and \nincreases the financial burden on the beneficiaries. Beneficiaries pay \nthe price for health care fraud in their copayments and contributions. \nIn addition, some forms of fraud may result in inadequate medical care \nand be dangerous for patients. Unfortunately, the NIJ reports that many \nhealth care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, \nsuch as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or \nable to complain or alert law enforcement.''\n  Fighting health care fraud has been a top priority of this \nAdministration and\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nthis Attorney General. The attention our federal law enforcement \nofficials are paying to this problem is paying off: the number of \ncriminal convictions in health care fraud cases grew over 300 percent \nfrom 1992 to 1997. These cases included convictions for submitting \nfalse claims to Medicare and Medicaid, and other insurance plans; fake \nbillings by foreign doctors; and needless prescriptions for durable \nmedical equipment by doctors in exchange for kickbacks from \nmanufacturers. In 1997 alone, $1.2 billion was awarded or negotiated as \na result of criminal fines, civil settlements and judgments in health \ncare fraud matters.\n  We can and must do more, however. The Seniors Safety Act would give \nthe Attorney General authority to get an injunction to stop false \nclaims and illegal kickback schemes involving federal health care \nprograms. This Act would also provide the law enforcement authorities \nwith additional investigatory tools to uncover, investigate and \nprosecute health care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. \nThe use of civil laws is considered by the Justice Department to be a \n``critical component of our enforcement policy.'' In fact, the \nDepartment has recovered $1.8 billion in False Claims Act (FCA) civil \nenforcement actions since 1986, when Congress amended the FCA to \naddress fraud against the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Seniors \nSafety Act will permit criminal prosecutors to share information more \neasily with their civil counterparts.\n  In addition, whistle-blowers, who tip-off law enforcement about false \nclaims, would be authorized under the Seniors Safety Act to seek court \npermission to review information obtained by the government to enhance \ntheir assistance in FCA law suits. Such qui tam, or whistle-blower, \nsuits have, in the Justice Department's estimation, dramatically \nincreased detection of and monetary recoveries for health care fraud. \nMore half of the $1.2 billion the Department was awarded in health care \nfraud cases in FY 1997 were related to allegations in qui tam cases. \nThis is a successful track record. According to the Department in its \nmost recent health care fraud report, ``qui tam plaintiffs often work \nwith DOJ to build a strong chain of evidence that can be used during \nsettlement discussions or at trial.'' The Act would allow whistle-\nblowers and their qui tam suits to become even more effective tools in \nthe fight against health care fraud.\n  Finally, the Act would extend anti-fraud and anti-kickback safeguards \nto the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. These are all \nimportant steps that will help cut down on the enormous health care \nfraud losses.\n  Long-term care planning specialists estimate that over forty percent \nof those turning 65 years of age will need nursing home care, and that \n20 percent of those seniors will spend five years or more in nursing \nhomes. Indeed, many of us already have or will live through the \nexperience of having our parents, family members or other loved ones--\nor even ourselves--spend time in a nursing home. We owe it to them and \nto ourselves to give the residents of nursing homes the best care they \ncan get.\n  The Justice Department's Health Care Fraud Report for Fiscal Year \n1997 cites egregious examples of nursing homes that pocketed Medicare \nfunds instead of providing residents with adequate care. In one case, \nfive patients died as result of the inadequate provision of nutrition, \nwound care and diabetes management by three Pennsylvania nursing homes. \nYet another death occurred when a patient, who was unable to speak, was \nplaced in a scalding tub of 138-degree water.\n  This Act provides additional piece of mind to residents of nursing \nhomes and those of us who may have loved ones there by giving federal \nlaw enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of \nnursing homes for willfully engaging in patterns of health and safety \nviolations in the care of nursing home residents. The Act also protects \nwhistle-blowers from retaliation for reporting such violations.\n  The Seniors Safety Act has six titles, described below.\n  Title I, titled ``Strategies for Preventing Crimes Against Seniors'': \ndirects the Attorney General to study the types of crimes and risk \nfactors associated with crimes against seniors. In addition, authority \nis provided in this title for the Attorney General to include \nstatistics on the incidence of crimes against seniors in the annual \nNational Crime Victims Survey. Collection and analysis of this data is \ncritical to develop effective strategies to protect seniors from crime \nand respond effectively to the justice needs of seniors.\n  Title II, titled ``Combating Crimes Against Seniors'': provides \nenhanced penalties for crimes targeting seniors, for health care fraud \nand other fraud offenses, and the creation of new criminal and civil \npenalties to protect pension and employee benefit plans.\n  Specifically, the U.S. Sentencing Commission is directed to review \nthe sentencing guidelines and enhance penalties, as appropriate, to \nadequately reflect the economic and physical harms associated with \ncrimes targeted at seniors, and with health care fraud offenses. This \nbill would also increase the penalties under the mail fraud statute and \nwire fraud statute for fraudulent schemes that result in serious injury \nor death.\n  In addition, this title of the Seniors Safety Act provides new tools \nin the form of a new criminal provision and civil penalties for law \nenforcement to investigate and prosecute persons who defraud pension \nplans or other retirement arrangements. In addition, the Act increases \nthe penalty for corruptly bribing or receiving graft to influence the \noperation and management of employee benefit plans from three to five \nyears.\n  Title III, titled ``Preventing Telemarketing Fraud'': addresses \ntelemarketing fraud in two ways: by providing a ``Better Business''-\nstyle hotline to provide information and log complaints about \ntelemarketing fraud, and by allowing the Attorney General to block or \nterminate telephone service to numbers being used to perpetrate \ntelemarketing fraud crimes.\n  Title IV, titled ``Combating Health Care Fraud'': provides important \ninvestigative and crime prevention tools to law enforcement authorities \nto uncover and punish health care fraud, including authority to obtain \ninjunctive relief, grand jury disclosure for civil actions, and \nissuance of administrative subpoenas. In addition, the Act would better \nprotect the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program by extending the \nanti-kickback and anti-fraud prohibitions to cover this program.\n  Attorney General's injunction authority: The Act would authorize the \nAttorney General to seek injunctive relief to prevent persons suspected \nof committing or about to commit a health care fraud or illegal \nkickback offense from disposing or dissipating fraudulently obtained \nproceeds.\n  Authorized Investigative Demand Procedures: The Attorney General is \ncurrently authorized to issue administrative subpoenas during \ninvestigations of criminal health care fraud cases, but cannot do the \nsame in related civil cases. The Act would extend that authority to \ncivil cases, subject to stringent privacy safeguards.\n  Grand Jury Disclosure: Currently, grand jury information may not be \ndisclosed in related civil suits, except under limited circumstances, \nresulting in duplicative work on the part of government civil \nattorneys. The Act would allow federal prosecutors to seek a court \norder allowing the sharing of grand jury information regarding health \ncare offenses with government civil attorneys for use in civil or other \nregulatory proceedings.\n  Extension of anti-fraud safeguards: The Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Act is currently exempt from anti-fraud safeguards available \nto both Medicaid and Medicare. The Act would remove the exemption and \nsubject the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program to anti-fraud and \nanti-kickback protections.\n  Title V, titled ``Protecting Residents of Nursing Homes'': contains \nthe ``Nursing Home Resident Protection Act of 1999'' to establish a new \nfederal crime, with substantial criminal and civil penalties, against \noperators of nursing homes who engage, knowingly and willfully, in a \npattern of health and safety violations that results in significant \nphysical or mental harm to persons residing in residential health care \nfacilities. In addition, whistle-blowers, who tip off officials about \npoor nursing home conditions, would be authorized to sue for damages, \nattorney's fees and other relief should there be any retaliation.\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\n  Title VI, titled ``Protecting the Rights of Senior Crime Victims'': \nwould authorize the Attorney General to use forfeited funds to pay \nrestitution to victims of fraudulent activity, and the courts to \nrequire the forfeiture of proceeds from violations of retirement \noffenses. In addition, the Act would exempt false claims law actions \nfrom a stay by bankruptcy proceedings and ensure that debts due to the \nUnited States from false claims law actions are not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy, in order to pay restitution to fraud victims or regulatory \nagencies.\n  The Seniors Safety Act of 1999 provides a new safety net for seniors \nto protect them from the criminal activity that affects them the most. \nI commend the Administration and particularly the Vice President for \nhis attention to this issue, and the Attorney General for her work and \nassistance on this legislation. We should move to consider and pass \nthis legislation before the end of the 106th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Seniors Safety Act and a \nsectional analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 751\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of older Americans is growing both \n     numerically and proportionally in the United States. Since \n     1990, the population of seniors has increased by almost \n     5,000,000, and is now 20.2 percent of the United States \n     population.\n       (2) In 1997, 7 percent of victims of serious violent crime \n     were age 50 or older.\n       (3) In 1997, 17.7 percent of murder victims were age 55 or \n     older.\n       (4) According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, \n     persons aged 50 and older experienced approximately 673,460 \n     incidents of violent crime, including rape and sexual \n     assaults, robberies and general assaults, during 1997.\n       (5) Older victims of violent crime are almost twice as \n     likely as younger victims to be raped, robbed, or assaulted \n     at or in their own homes.\n       (6) Approximately half of Americans who are 50 years old or \n     older feel afraid to walk alone at night in their own \n     neighborhoods.\n       (7) Seniors over the age of 50 reportedly account for 37 \n     percent of the estimated $40,000,000,000 in losses each year \n     due to telemarketing fraud.\n       (8) In 1998, Congress enacted legislation to provide for \n     increased penalties for telemarketing fraud that targets \n     seniors.\n       (9) There has not been a comprehensive study of crimes \n     committed against seniors since 1994.\n       (10) It has been estimated that approximately 43 percent of \n     those turning 65 can expect to spend some time in a long-term \n     care facility, and approximately 20 percent can expect to \n     spend 5 years or longer in a such a facility.\n       (11) In 1997, approximately $82,800,000,000 was spent on \n     nursing home care in the United States and over half of this \n     amount was spent by the medicaid and medicare programs.\n       (12) Losses to fraud and abuse in health care reportedly \n     cost the United States an estimated $100,000,000,000 in 1996.\n       (13) The Inspector General for the Department of Health and \n     Human Services has estimated that about $12,600,000,000 in \n     improper medicare benefit payments, due to inadvertent \n     mistake, fraud and abuse, were made during fiscal year 1998.\n       (14) Incidents of health care fraud and abuse remain high \n     despite awareness of the problem.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) combat nursing home fraud and abuse;\n       (2) enhance safeguards for pension plans and health care \n     programs;\n       (3) develop strategies for preventing and punishing crimes \n     that target or otherwise disproportionately affect seniors by \n     collecting appropriate data to measure the extent of crimes \n     committed against seniors and determine the extent of \n     domestic and elder abuse of seniors; and\n       (4) prevent and deter criminal activity, such as \n     telemarketing fraud, that results in economic and physical \n     harm against seniors and ensure appropriate restitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``crime'' means any criminal offense under \n     Federal or State law;\n       (2) the term ``nursing home'' means any institution or \n     residential care facility defined as such for licensing \n     purposes under State law, or if State law does not employ the \n     term nursing home, the equivalent term or terms as determined \n     by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, pursuant to \n     section 1908(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396g(e)); and\n       (3) the term ``senior'' means an individual who is more \n     than 55 years of age.\n\n       TITLE I--STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTING CRIMES AGAINST SENIORS\n\n     SEC. 101.

ENHANCED SENTENCING PENALTIES BASED ON AGE OF \n     VICTIM.\n       (a) DIRECTIVE TO THE UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION. \n     The U.S. Sentencing Commission is directed to review and, if \n     appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines to include age \n     as one of the criteria for determining whether a sentencing \n     enhancement is appropriate.\n       (b) REQUIREMENTS. During its review, the Sentencing \n     Commission shall: ensure that the guidelines adequately \n     reflect the economic and physical harms associated with \n     criminal activity targeted at seniors; consider providing \n     increased penalties for offenses where the victim was a \n     senior; consult with seniors, victims, judiciary, and law \n     enforcement representatives; assure reasonable consistency \n     with other relevant directives and guidelines; account for \n     circumstances which may justify exceptions, including any \n     circumstances already warranting sentencing enhancements; \n     make any necessary conforming changes; and assure that the \n     guidelines adequately meet the purposes of sentencing.\n       (c) REPORT. The sentencing commission shall report the \n     results of the review required under (a) and include any \n     recommendations for retention or modification of the current \n     penalty levels by December 31, 2000.\n       SEC. 202. STUDY AND REPORT ON HEALTH CARE FRAUD SENTENCES.\n       (a) DIRECTIVE TO THE UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION. \n     The U.S. Sentencing Commission is directed to review and, if \n     appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines applicable to \n     health care fraud offenses.\n       (b) REQUIREMENTS. During its review, the Sentencing \n     Commission shall: ensure that the guidelines reflect the \n     serious harms associated with health care fraud and the need \n     for law enforcement to prevent such fraud; consider enhanced \n     penalties for persons convicted of health care fraud; consult \n     with representatives of industry, judiciary, law enforcement, \n     and victim groups; account for mitigating circumstances; \n     assure reasonable consistency with other relevant directives \n     and guidelines; make any necessary conforming changes; and \n     assure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes of \n     sentencing.\n       (c) REPORT.

INCREASED PENALTIES FOR FRAUD RESULTING IN \n     SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.\n       This section increases the penalties under the mail fraud \n     statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1341, and the wire fraud statute, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec.  1343, for fraudulent schemes that result in \n     serious injury or death. Existing law provides such an \n     enhancement for a narrow class of health care fraud schemes \n     (see 18 U.S.C. 1347). This provision would extend this \n     penalty enhancement to other forms of fraud under the mail \n     and wire fraud statutes that result in death or serious \n     injury. The maximum penalty if serious bodily harm occurred \n     would be up to twenty years; if a death occurred, the maximum \n     penalty would be a life sentence.\n       SEC. 204. SAFEGUARDING PENSION PLANS FROM FRAUD AND THEFT.\n       (a) IN GENERAL. This section would add new section 1348 to \n     title 18, United States Code.\n       Sec. 1348: Fraud in Relation to Retirement Arrangements:\n       (a) This section defines retirement arrangements and \n     provides an exception for plans established by the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\n       (b) This section punishes, with up to ten years' \n     imprisonment, the act of defrauding retirement arrangements, \n     or obtaining by means of false or fraudulent pretenses \n     money or property of any retirement arrangement. \n     Retirement arrangements would include employee pension \n     benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act (ERISA), qualified retirement plans under \n     section 4974(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), \n     medical savings accounts under section 220 of the IRC, and \n     funds established within the Thrift Savings Fund. This \n     provision is modeled on existing statutes punishing bank \n     fraud (see 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1344) and health care fraud \n     (see 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1347). Any government plan defined \n     under section 3(32) of title I of the ERISA, except funds \n     established by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment \n     Board, is exempt from this section.\n       (c) The Attorney General is given authority to investigate \n     offenses under the new section, but this authority expressly \n     does not preclude other appropriate Federal agencies, \n     including the Secretary of Labor, from investigating \n     violations of ERISA.\n       (b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT. The table of sections for chapter \n     63 of title 18 United States Code, is modified to list new \n     section ``1348. Fraud in relation to retirement \n     arrangements.''\n       SEC. 205. ADDITIONAL CIVIL PENALTIES FOR DEFRAUDING PENSION \n     PLANS.\n       (a) IN GENERAL. This section would authorize the Attorney \n     General to bring a civil action for a violation, or \n     conspiracy to violate, new section 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1348, \n     relating to retirement fraud. Proof of such a violation \n     established by a preponderance of the evidence would subject \n     the violator to a civil penalty of the greater of the amount \n     of pecuniary gain to the offender, the pecuniary loss to the \n     victim, or up to $50,000 in the case of an individual, or \n     $100,000 for an organization. Imposition of this civil \n     penalty has no effect on other possible remedies.\n       (b) EXCEPTION. No civil penalties would be imposed for \n     conduct involving an employee pension plan subject to \n     penalties under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. Sec.  1132.\n       (c) DETERMINATION OF PENALTY AMOUNT. In determining the \n     amount of the penalty, the court is authorized to consider \n     the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to \n     restore all losses to the victims and to pay other important \n     tax or criminal penalties.\n       SEC. 206. PUNISHING BRIBERY AND GRAFT IN CONNECTION WITH \n     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.\n       This section would amend section 1954 of title 18, United \n     States Code, by changing the title to ``Bribery and graft in \n     connection with employee benefit plans,'' and increasing the \n     maximum penalty for bribery and graft in regard to the \n     operation of an employee benefit plan from 3 to 5 years \n     imprisonment. This section also broadens existing law under \n     section 1954 to cover corrupt attempts to give or accept \n     bribery or graft payments, and to proscribe bribery or graft \n     payments to persons exercising de facto influence or control \n     over employee benefit plans. Finally, this amendment \n     clarifies that a violation\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\n     under section 1954 requires a showing of corrupt intent to \n     influence the actions of the recipient of the bribe or graft.\n\n\n               TITLE III--PREVENTING TELEMARKETING CRIME.\n\n       SEC. 301. CENTRALIZED COMPLAINT AND CONSUMER EDUCATION \n     SERVICE FOR VICTIMS OF TELEMARKETING FRAUD.\n       (a) CENTRALIZED SERVICE. This section directs the \n     Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission to establish a \n     ``Better Business''-style hotline to serve as a central \n     information clearinghouse for victims of telemarketing fraud \n     within one year. As part of this service, the FTC is required \n     to establish procedures for logging in complaints of \n     telemarketing fraud victims, providing information on \n     telemarketing fraud schemes, referring complaints to \n     appropriate law enforcement officials, and providing \n     complaint or prior conviction information about specific \n     companies.\n       (b) CREATION OF FRAUD CONVICTION DATABASE. The Attorney \n     General is directed to establish a database of telemarketing \n     fraud convictions secured against corporations or companies, \n     for the use as described in (a).\n       (c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization is \n     provided for such sums as are necessary to carry out the \n     section.\n       SEC. 302. BLOCKING OF TELEMARKETING SCAMS.\n       (a) EXPANSION OF SCOPE OF TELEMARKETING FRAUD SUBJECT TO \n     ENHANCED CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Section 2325 of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by replacing the term ``telephone \n     calls'' with ``wire communication utilizing a telephone \n     service'' to clarify that telemarketing fraud schemes \n     executed using cellular telephone services are subject to the \n     enhanced penalties for such fraud under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2326.\n       (b) BLOCKING OR TERMINATION OF TELEPHONE SERVICE ASSOCIATED \n     WITH TELEMARKETING FRAUD. This section adds new section 2328 \n     to title 18, United States Code, to authorize the termination \n     of telephone service used to carry on telemarketing fraud, \n     and is similar to the legal authority provided under 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec.  1084(d), regarding termination of telephone \n     service used to engage in illegal gambling. The new section \n     2328 requires telephone companies, upon notification in \n     writing from the Department of Justice that a particular \n     phone number is being used to engage in fraudulent \n     telemarketing or other fraudulent conduct, and after notice \n     to the customer, to terminate the subscriber's telephone \n     service. The common carrier is exempt from civil and criminal \n     penalties for any actions taken in compliance with any notice \n     received from the Justice Department under this section. \n     Persons affected by termination may seek an appropriate \n     determination in Federal court that the service should not be \n     discontinued or removed, and the court may direct the \n     Department of Justice to present evidence supporting the \n     notification of termination. Definitions are provided for \n     ``wire communication facility'' and ``reasonable notice to \n     the subscriber.''\n\n                TITLE IV--PREVENTING HEALTH CARE FRAUD.\n\n       SEC. 401. INJUNCTIVE AUTHORITY RELATING TO FALSE CLAIMS AND \n     ILLEGAL KICKBACK SCHEMES INVOLVING FEDERAL HEALTH CARE \n     PROGRAMS.\n       (a) IN GENERAL. This section extends the provisions of 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec.  1345, which authorizes injunctions against \n     frauds, to authorize the Attorney General to take immediate \n     action to halt illegal health care fraud kickback schemes \n     under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec.  1320a-7b). \n     Under existing law, (18 U.S.C. Sec.  1345 (a)(1)(C)), Federal \n     prosecutors are able to obtain injunctive relief in \n     connection with a wide variety of Federal health care \n     offenses. This authority has proven to be extremely valuable \n     in putting a halt to fraudulent behavior, but such relief is \n     not available in connection with kickback offenses under \n     section 1128B of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1320a-7b). Because of the large amounts of money \n     involved in these kinds of cases, the Attorney General should \n     have the authority to enjoin kickback schemes while they are \n     in progress.\n       (b) CIVIL ACTIONS. This section would amend 42 U.S.C. Sec.  \n     1320a-7b by adding a new subsection (g) authorizing the \n     Attorney General to seek a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per \n     violation, or three times the remuneration, whichever is \n     greater, for each offense under this section with respect to \n     a Federal health care program. This penalty is in addition to \n     other criminal and civil penalties. The procedures are \n     governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 31 \n     U.S.C. 3731. If one or more of the purposes of the \n     remuneration is unlawful, a violation exists and damages \n     shall be the full amount of the remuneration.\n       SEC. 402. AUTHORIZED INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND PROCEDURES.\n       This section would amend section 3486 of title 18, United \n     States Code, to authorize the Attorney General or her \n     designee to issue administrative subpoenas--called \n     ``authorized investigative demands''--to investigate civil \n     health care fraud cases. Under section 248 of the Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Pub. L. \n     104-191), the Attorney General or her designee is authorized \n     to issue an administrative subpoena in connection with an \n     investigation relating to a Federal health care offense, \n     defined under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  24 to include only criminal \n     offenses. In civil cases, however, the Department's attorneys \n     must rely upon subpoenas issued by the office of the \n     Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services or upon civil investigative demands. To facilitate \n     the Department of Justice's ability to investigate civil \n     health care fraud cases in an effective and efficient manner, \n     this provision allows the Attorney General or her designee to \n     issue an administrative subpoena in connection with any \n     health care fraud case, criminal or civil.\n       This section also provides privacy safeguards for \n     personally identifiable health information that may be \n     obtained in response to an administrative subpoena and \n     divulged in the course of a federal investigation. \n     Information provided in response to a grand jury subpoena is \n     generally required, under Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of \n     Criminal Procedure, to be kept secret. By contrast, this \n     secrecy rule would not apply to information obtained in \n     response to an administrative subpoena. This section \n     therefore protects the privacy and confidentiality of \n     personally identifiable health information by limiting its \n     disclosure to a federal prosecutor in the performance of \n     official duties, to other government personnel where \n     necessary to assist in the enforcement of Federal criminal \n     law, or when directed by a court. The section requires that \n     such information be destroyed within 90 days from production, \n     unless otherwise ordered by a court. ``Personally \n     identifiable health information'' is defined to mean any \n     information relating to the physical or mental condition of \n     an individual, the provision of, or payments for, health \n     care, that either identifies an individual or with respect to \n     which there is a reasonable basis to believe that the \n     information can be used to identify an individual.\n       SEC. 403. EXTENDING ANTI-FRAUD SAFEGUARDS TO THE FEDERAL \n     EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM.\n       This section removes the anti-fraud exemption for the \n     Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) Act currently \n     contained in section 1128B(f)(1) of the Social Security Act, \n     thereby extending anti-fraud and anti-kickback safeguards \n     applicable to the Medicare and Medicaid program to the FEHB. \n     This would allow the Attorney General to use the same civil \n     enforcement tools to fight fraud perpetrated against the FEHB \n     program as are available to other Federal health care \n     programs, and to recover civil penalties against persons or \n     entities engaged in illegal kickback schemes under the anti-\n     kickback provisions of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1320a-7b). Removal of this exemption would allow \n     enhanced penalties for repeat offenders, additional anti-\n     kickback enforcement, enhanced civil monetary penalties, and \n     full participation in the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control \n     Account. Civil penalties are particularly important in health \n     care fraud, since the complex business arrangements often \n     employed in connection with kickback schemes pose \n     difficulties in proving the necessary scienter needed to \n     sustain a criminal prosecution.\n       SEC. 404. GRAND JURY DISCLOSURE.\n       This section would amend section 3322 of title 18, United \n     States Code, to authorize federal prosecutors to seek a court \n     order to share grand jury information regarding health care \n     offenses, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  24, with other \n     federal prosecutors for use in civil proceedings or \n     investigations relating to fraud or false claims in \n     connection with any Federal health care program. Under \n     current law, grand jury information may not be shared for use \n     by government attorneys in civil investigations except ``when \n     so directed by a court preliminarily to or in connection with \n     a judicial proceeding,'' and may require a hearing at which \n     ``other persons as the court may direct'' are given a \n     ``reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard.'' F.R.Cr.P. \n     6(e)(3)(C)( i) & (D). The important policy reasons for \n     protecting the secrecy of grand juries and allowing only \n     narrow access to grand jury proceedings by Federal civil \n     prosecutors are fully set forth in United States v. Sells \n     Engineering, Inc., 463 U.S. 418 (1983).\n       Mindful of the reasons for grand jury secrecy, the proposed \n     amendment would permit grand jury information regarding \n     health care offenses to be shared with Federal civil \n     prosecutors, only after ex parte court review and a finding \n     that the information would assist in enforcement of federal \n     laws or regulations. Simplifying the sharing of grand jury \n     information by avoiding the need for a judicial proceeding or \n     the possibility of a hearing, would avoid subverting the \n     grand jury secrecy rule while enhancing the effectiveness \n     of the Department of Justice's overall health care anti-\n     fraud effort. In particular, by facilitating the sharing \n     of information between criminal investigators and civil \n     prosecutors, this proposal would enable the Justice \n     Department to proceed more quickly and efficiently to \n     recover losses to federal health care programs and to \n     prevent wrongdoers from dissipating illegally obtained \n     assets before the Government can take action to recover \n     the government's losses. Privacy safeguards for personally \n     identifiable health care information proposed in section \n     401 of this Act would also apply to information shared \n     under this new provision.\n       SEC 405. INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CIVIL \n     INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS IN A FALSE CLAIMS INVESTIGATION.\n       This section amends section 3733 of title 31, United States \n     Code, to permit the Attorney General to delegate authority to \n     issue civil\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\n     investigative demands to the Deputy Attorney General or an \n     Assistant Attorney General. The Deputy Attorney General and \n     Assistant Attorneys General already are authorized under \n     current law to cause such discovery demands to be served.\n       In addition, section 3733 is amended to permit a person who \n     initiated an investigation or proceeding under 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  3730, or such person's counsel (i.e., whistle-blowers \n     who have brought a qui tam suit under the False Claims Act) \n     to seek permission from a district court to obtain \n     information disclosed to the Justice Department in response \n     to civil investigative demands. Whistle blowers who relay \n     information for false claims actions to the government are \n     often able to provide valuable assistance to the government \n     in pursuing false claims law investigations and actions. This \n     assistance may be further enhanced if they have an \n     opportunity to review information obtained by the Justice \n     Department in connection with the investigation.\n\n\n             TITLE V--PROTECTING RESIDENTS OF NURSING HOMES\n\n       SEC. 501. NURSING HOME RESIDENT PROTECTION ACT.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Nursing Home Resident \n     Protection Act of 1999.''\n       SEC. 502. NURSING HOME RESIDENT PROTECTION.\n       (a) PROTECTION OF RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOMES AND OTHER \n     RESIDENTIAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. This section would add \n     new section 1349 to title 18, United States Code, to punish \n     persons who engage in a pattern of willful violations of \n     Federal laws, regulations, rules, or State laws governing the \n     health, safety, or care of individuals residing in \n     residential health care facilities, and allows the Attorney \n     General to bring civil penalties against those entities. It \n     also provides additional ``whistle blower'' protection by \n     allowing a person who is retaliated against for reporting \n     nursing home conditions to bring a civil action for damages, \n     attorney's fees, and other costs.\n       (b) AUTHORIZED INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND PROCEDURES. This \n     section would amend section 3486(a)(1) of title 18, United \n     States Code, to authorize the Attorney General or a \n     designated representative to issue administrative subpoenas \n     in cases under new section 1349 of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       (c) CONFORMING AMENDMENT. The table of sections for chapter \n     63 of title 18 United States Code, is modified to list new \n     section ``1349. Pattern of violations resulting in harm to \n     residents of nursing homes and related facilities.''\n\n\n        TITLE VI--PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF ELDERLY CRIME VICTIMS\n\n       SEC. 601. USE OF FORFEITED FUNDS TO PAY RESTITUTION TO \n     CRIME VICTIMS AND REGULATORY AGENCIES. This section would \n     amend section 981(e) of title 18, United States Code, to \n     allow the use of forfeited funds to pay restitution to crime \n     victims and regulatory agencies.\n       SEC. 602. VICTIM RESTITUTION. The section adds a new \n     subsection ``(r) VICTIM RESTITUTION'' to the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 853) to allow the government \n     to move to dismiss forfeiture proceedings to allow the \n     defendant to use the property subject to forfeiture for the \n     payment of restitution to victims. If forfeiture proceedings \n     are complete and there is no other source of restitution \n     available to the victims, the Government may return the \n     forfeited property so it may be used for restitution.\n       SEC. 603. BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS NOT USED TO SHIELD ILLEGAL \n     GAINS FROM FALSE CLAIMS.\n       (a) CERTAIN ACTIONS NOT STAYED BY BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. \n     This section provides that an action under the False Claims \n     Act may be brought and continued despite concurrent \n     bankruptcy proceedings.\n       (b) CERTAIN DEBTS NOT DISCHARGEABLE IN BANKRUPTCY. This \n     section prohibits the discharge in bankruptcy of debts \n     resulting from judgments or settlements in Medicare and \n     Medicaid fraud cases under the False Claims Act. Currently, \n     in some cases, persons who rip off the Medicare or Medicaid \n     system can avoid repaying their ill-gotten gains or penalties \n     by filing for bankruptcy.\n       (c) REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN DEBTS CONSIDERED FINAL. This \n     section adds a new Sec. 111 to chapter I of title II of the \n     United States Code which provides that no debt owed for a \n     violation of the False Claims act or under a compromise order \n     or other agreement resolving such a debt may be avoided under \n     bankruptcy provisions.\n       SEC. 604. FORFEITURE FOR RETIREMENT OFFENSES.\n       (a) CRIMINAL FORFEITURE. This section adds a new subsection \n     to 18 U.S.C. Sec.  982(a) to require the forfeiture of \n     proceeds of a criminal retirement offense, including a \n     violation of new section 1348 of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n       (b) CIVIL FORFEITURE. This section adds a new subsection to \n     18 U.S.C. Sec.  981(a)(1) to permit the civil forfeiture of \n     proceeds from a criminal retirement offense.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Leahy and \nTorricelli in introducing The Seniors Safety Act. All too often, \nseniors are primary targets for financial exploitation and subjected to \nneglect and physical abuse, and as our country's senior population \ncontinues to grow, the plague of crimes against the elderly has the \npotential to spiral out of control. The Seniors Safety Act combats this \nvery serious issue by increasing penalties for crimes against seniors, \nimproving law enforcement tools necessary to prevent telemarketing and \nhealthcare fraud, safeguarding pension and benefit plans from fraud and \nbribery, and preventing nursing home abuse.\n  Seniors are often targeted by criminals because of their lack of \nmobility, isolation, and dependence on others. The criminals targeting \nseniors should be subject to enhanced penalties, and we must develop \nnew strategies to combat their crimes. The Seniors Safety Act requires \nthe sentencing commission to review and consider amending sentencing \nguidelines to include age as one criterion for enhancing a sentence and \nenhances the penalty for fraudulent schemes that result in serious \ninjury or death. In addition, the bill directs the Attorney General to \nconduct a comprehensive review of crimes against seniors in order to \ndevelop new ways to combat criminals who target older Americans.\n  Federal investigators estimate that senior citizens constitute nearly \n80 percent of telemarketing scam victims. In 1996, the AARP estimated \nthat 14,000 companies nationwide were illegally defrauding citizens of \ntheir hard-earned money through telemarketing schemes. The fraud \ncommitted by only 300 telemarketers exposed by the FBI in 1995 resulted \nin an estimated $58 million loss from 52,000 seniors in just two years. \nThe Seniors Safety Act puts in place important law enforcement tools \nneeded to stop telemarketing fraud. The Act gives federal officials the \nability to cut off a fraudulent telemarketer's telephone service. It \nalso creates a hotline for victims of telemarketing fraud. Through the \nhotline, victims can register complaints against companies, can receive \ninformation regarding common fraudulent schemes and be referred to the \nappropriate enforcement agency. A database of complaints will be \nestablished so that victims can check for previous complaints against a \nparticular company.\n  Health care fraud also disproportionately harms older Americans. The \nSeniors Safety Act provides important new tools to law enforcement \nofficials for use in health care fraud investigations. The bill \nauthorizes the Attorney General to get injunctions to stop false claims \nand health care kickbacks and to issue administrative subpoenas for \nhealth care offenses. With court permission, the Attorney General would \nalso be permitted to share grand jury information for use in civil \ninvestigations of health care fraud and abuse. In addition, the bill \nextends existing anti-fraud safeguards applicable to Medicare and \nMedicaid to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act.\n  We must protect the economic security of our country's senior \ncitizens by safeguarding pension and employee benefit plans from fraud \nand misuse. For this reason, an important provision of the Seniors \nSafety Act creates a new ``retirement fraud'' crime modeled on existing \nbank fraud and health care fraud statutes. The bill provides for civil \npenalties for commission of a retirement fraud crime, and increases the \nexisting penalties for theft or embezzlement and bribery and graft with \nrespect to the operation of an employee benefit plan.\n  In 1997, the Department of Health and Human Services reported a 14 \npercent increase in nursing home abuse since 1994. Our society must \nprovide a safe environment for older Americans who move into nursing \nhomes. This bill will combat nursing home fraud and abuse by creating \nnew federal and criminal penalties against persons or companies who \nwillfully engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. The bill \nwill also protect persons who report health and safety violations by \nallowing them to bring a civil cause of action for acts of retaliation \nagainst them.\n  Finally, we must provide greater protections for senior crime \nvictims. The Seniors Safety Act will do just that by requiring \ncriminals to forfeit ill-gotten gains and property acquired by \ndefrauding pension plans to the victims. The bill also prevents \ncriminals from using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying judgments by \nprohibiting judgments or settlements in Medicare or Medicaid fraud \ncases from being discharged in bankruptcy proceedings and\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nallows False Claims Act actions to proceed despite concurrent \nbankruptcy proceedings.\n  These and other provisions in The Seniors Safety Act will make a real \ndifference--a positive difference--in protecting the senior citizens of \nthis country. This comprehensive bill is a vital part of our ongoing \neffort to secure the safety of our families and our communities, and I \nencourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their \nfull support.\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator Leahy, Senator \nDaschle, and I introduced the Seniors Safety Act of 1999. Senator Leahy \nhas referred to this legislation as ``a new safety net for seniors.'' \nIt is that, but it is also much more. Indeed, this bill is a potent \nweapon designed to track down and punish those criminals who would prey \non the trust and good will of America's seniors. This bill puts the \ncrooks on notice that crimes against seniors, from violent assaults in \nthe streets, to abuses in nursing homes, to frauds perpetrated over the \ntelephone lines, will not be tolerated.\n  Seniors represent the most rapidly growing sector of our population--\nin the next 50 years, the number of Americans over the age of 65 will \nmore than double. Unless we take action now, the frequency and \nsophistication of crimes against seniors will likewise skyrocket. The \nSeniors Safety Act of 1999 was developed to address, head-on the crimes \nwhich most directly affect the senior community, including \ntelemarketing fraud, and abuse and fraud in the health care and nursing \nhome industries. It increases penalties and provides enhancements to \nthe sentencing guidelines for criminals who target seniors. It protects \nseniors against the illegal depletion of precious pension and employee \nbenefit plan funds through fraud, graft, bribery, and helps victimized \nseniors obtain restitution. Any finally, this bill authorizes the \nAttorney General to study the problem of crime against senors, and \ndesign new techniques to fight it.\n  Criminal enterprises that engage in telemarketing fraud are some of \nthe most insidious predators out there. Americans are fleeced out of \nover $40 billion dollars every year, and the effect on seniors is \ngrossly disproportionate According to the American Association of \nRetired Persons, ``The repeated victimization of the elderly is the \ncornerstone of illegal telemarketing.'' A study has found that 56 \npercent of the names on the target lists of fraudulent telemarketers \nare the names of Americans aged 50 or older. Of added concern is the \nfact that many of the perpetrators have migrated out of the United \nStates for fear of prosecution, and continue to conduct their illegal \nactivities from abroad.\n  In one heartbreaking story, a recently-widowed New Jersey woman was \nbilked out of $200,000 by a deceitful telemarketing firm from Canada, \nwho claimed that the woman had won a $150,000 sweepsteaks--the price \ncould be hers, for a fee. A series of these calls followed, convincing \nthis poor woman, already in a fragile mind-state after her husband's \ndeath, to send more and more money for what they claimed was an \nincreasingly large prize, which, of course, never materialized.\n  Our bill authorizes the Attorney General to effectively put these \nvultures, even the international criminals, out of business by blocking \nor terminating their U.S. telephone service. In addition, it authorizes \nthe FTC to create a consumer clearinghouse which would provide seniors, \nand others who might have questions about the legitimacy of a telephone \nsales pitch, with information regarding prior complaints about a \nparticular telemarketing company or prior fraud convictions. \nFurthermore, this clearing house would give seniors who may have been \ncheated an open channel to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n\n  In 1997, older Americans were victimized by violent crime over \n680,000 times. The crimes against them range from simple assault, to \narmed robbery, to rape. While national crime rates in general are \nfalling, seniors have not shared in the benefits of that drop.\n  This Act singles out criminals who prey on the senior population and \npenalizes them for the physical and economic harm they cause. In \naddition, we intend to place this growing problem in the spotlight, an \nurge Congress and federal and state law enforcement agencies to \ncontinue to develop solutions. To this end, we have authorized a \ncomprehensive examination of crimes against seniors, and the inclusion \nof data on seniors in the National Crime Victims Survey.\n  Seniors across the country have worked their entire lives, secure in \nthe belief that their pensions and health benefits would be there to \nprovide for them in their retirement years. Far too often, seniors wake \nup one morning to find that their hard-earned benefits have been \nstolen. In 1997 alone, $90 million in losses to pension funds were \nuncovered. Older Americans who depend on that money to live are left \nout in the cold, while criminals enjoy the fruit of a lifetime of our \nseniors' labor. The Seniors Safety Act gives federal prosecutors \nanother powerful weapon to punish pension fund thieves. The Act creates \nnew civil and criminal penalties for defrauding pension of benefit \nplans, or obtaining money from them under false or fraudulent \npretenses.\n  The defrauding of Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers has \nbecome big business for criminals who prey on the elderly. According to \na National Institutes of Health study, losses from fraud and abuse may \nexceed $100 billion per year. Overbilling and false claims filing have \nbecome rampant as automated claims processing is more prevalent. \nSimilarly, the Department of Justice has noted numerous cases where \nunscrupulous nursing home operators have simply pocketed Medicare \nfunds, rather than providing adequate care for their residents. In one \nhorrendous case, five diabetic patients died from malnutrition and lack \nof medical care. In another, a patient was burned to death when a mute \npatient was placed by untrained staff in a tub of scalding water. These \nterrible abuses would never have occurred had the facilities spent the \nfederal funds they received to implement proper health and safety \nprocedures. This bill goes after fraud and abuse by providing resources \nand tools for authorities to investigate and prosecute offenses in \ncivil and criminal courts, and enhances the ability of the Justice \nDepartment to use evidence brought in by qui tam (whistleblower) \nplaintiffs.\n  This Act delivers needed protections to our seniors. It sends a \nmessage to the cowardly perpetrators of fraud and other crimes against \nolder Americans, that their actions will be fiercely prosecuted, \nwhether they be here or abroad. And it clearly states that we refuse to \nallow seniors to be victimized by this most heinous form of predation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 752. a bill to facilitate the recruitment of temporary employees \nto assist in the conduct of the 2000 decennial census of population, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n\n\n  Legislation to Increase the Number of Low Income Census Enumerators\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with \nmy colleague, Senator Bingaman, a bill that will encourage people \nreceiving public assistance to seek work next year as enumerators for \nthe 2000 census. In the previous census over 350,000 people went from \ndoor to door seeking information about those who did not return the \ncensus forms they received in the mail. In spite of the best efforts of \nthis army of enumerators, some eight million people were not counted, \nand a disproportionate number of them were minorities.\n  The Bureau of the Census is going to great lengths to improve on the \n1990 count, but finding the tens of millions of people who do not \nreturn their forms is an enormous undertaking. We know that many of \nthose who must be sought out live in the low income areas of our \ncities, and many others are among the rural poor. This bill would allow \nthose receiving financial assistance under any federal program, TANF \nand others, to be employed as enumerators during calendar year 2000 \nwithout having their income count against their eligibility for \nbenefits from those programs. The bill further allows these enumerators \nto have their employment count towards eligibility for Social Security, \nMedicare, and other benefit programs.\n  Mr. President, encouraging those who live in the low income areas of \nour population to serve as enumerators will help to open the doors of \ntheir neighbors and those who live nearby. It\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\nwill help count more of those most difficult to count. And it will \nprovide employment to those who may not be able to find it for various \nreasons that include lack of transportation to far-off jobs.\n  This bill will help produce a more accurate census and provide \nemployment to those most in need of it. It is a most worthwhile piece \nof legislation and I encourage my colleagues to support it. I also ask \nthat the text of the bill be included in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 752\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Decennial Census Improvement \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution of the United States requires that the \n     number of persons in the United States be enumerated every 10 \n     years in order to permit the apportionment of representatives \n     among the several States;\n       (2) information collected through a decennial census of the \n     population conducted under section 141 of title 13, United \n     States Code, is also used to determine--\n       (A) the boundaries of--\n       (i) congressional districts within States;\n       (ii)(I) the districts for the legislature of each State; \n     and\n       (II) other political subdivisions within the States; and\n       (B) the allocation of billions of dollars of Federal and \n     State funds;\n       (3) the Constitution of the United States requires that the \n     enumerations referred to in paragraph (2) be made in such \n     manner as the Congress ``shall by law direct'';\n       (4) in the 1990 decennial census, the Bureau of the Census \n     used a combination of mail questionnaires and personal \n     interviews, involving more than 350,000 enumerators, to \n     collect the census data; and\n       (5) in 1993, the Bureau of the Census concluded that \n     legislation ensuring that pay for temporary census \n     enumerators in the 2000 decennial census would not be used to \n     reduce benefits under Federal assistance programs would make \n     it easier for the Bureau to hire individuals in low-income \n     neighborhoods as temporary census enumerators in those \n     neighborhoods.\n\n     SEC. 3. MEASURES TO FACILITATE THE RECRUITMENT OF TEMPORARY \n                   EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) Purposes for Which Compensation Shall Not Be Taken Into \n     Account.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 23 of title 13, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d)(1) As used in this subsection, the term `temporary \n     census position' means a temporary position within the Bureau \n     of the Census established for purposes relating to the 2000 \n     decennial census of population conducted under section 141 \n     (as determined under regulations that the Secretary shall \n     prescribe).\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     compensation for service performed by an individual in a \n     temporary census position shall not cause--\n       ``(A) that individual or any other individual to become \n     ineligible for any benefits described in paragraph (3)(A); or\n       ``(B) a reduction in the amount of any benefits described \n     in paragraph (3)(A) for which that individual or any other \n     individual would otherwise be eligible.\n       ``(3) This subsection shall--\n       ``(A) apply with respect to benefits provided under any \n     Federal program or any State or local program financed in \n     whole or in part with Federal funds (including the Social \n     Security program under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 \n     et seq.) and the Medicare program under title XVIII of that \n     Act);\n       ``(B) apply only with respect to compensation for service \n     performed during calendar year 2000; and\n       ``(C) not apply if the individual performing the service \n     involved is appointed (or first appointed to any other \n     temporary census position) before January 1, 2000.''.\n       (2) Rule of Construction.--The amendment made by paragraph \n     (1) shall not affect the application of Public Law 101-86 (13 \n     U.S.C. 23 note), as amended by subsection (b).\n       (b) Exemption From Provisions Relating to Reemployed \n     Annuitants and Former Members of the Uniformed Services.--\n     Public Law 101-86 (13 U.S.C. 23 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking the title and inserting the following: ``An \n     Act to provide that a Federal annuitant or former member of a \n     uniformed service who returns to Government service, under a \n     temporary appointment, to assist in carrying out the 2000 \n     decennial census of population shall be exempt from certain \n     provisions of title 5, United States Code, relating to \n     offsets from pay and other benefits.'';\n       (2) in section 1(b), by striking ``the 1990 decennial \n     census'' and inserting ``the 2000 decennial census''; and\n       (3) in section 4, by striking ``December 31, 1990.'' and \n     inserting ``December 31, 2000.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Bryan, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reed, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Bayh, and \n        Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 753. A bill to enhance competition in the financial services \nindustry by providing a prudential framework for the affiliation of \nbanks, securities firms, and other financial service providers; and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                   The Financial Services Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, with the distinguished Ranking \nMember of the Banking Committee, the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nSarbanes, we are introducing the ``Financial Services Act of 1999.'' We \nare joined by all Democratic members of the Banking Committee.\n  The President has indicated through his Secretary of the Treasury, \nRobert Rubin, that he can support our approach and sign it into law.\n  This bill makes a clear and unambiguous statement: we want financial \nservices modernization enacted this year.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. Our bill is based on last year's \nH.R. 10, which enjoyed wide bipartisan support. It was approved last \nyear by the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. Most \nRepublicans supported it. It was supported by virtually every major \nfinancial services industry group.\n  A similar bill was adopted by a bipartisan 51 to 8 vote this year in \nthe House Banking Committee.\n  Sadly, reform efforts suffered a major setback this year in the \nSenate Banking Committee when the majority forced through a bill on a \nparty line vote of 11 to 9.\n  Mr. President, financial services reform is now on two tracks toward \nreform. There is the veto track, and the Banking Committee bill is on \nit over the Community Reinvestment Act and other concerns.\n  There is also the track toward enactment, which this bill and the \nHouse Banking bill are on.\n  But it can't be ``take it or leave it'' on either side. We have \nagreed with the distinguished Majority Leader [Mr. Lott] to discuss \nthis issue immediately after recess in an effort to find common ground.\n  The choice is clear: it's either partisan brinksmanship--or \nbipartisan accomplishment. We reject the former and stand ready to \ndeliver on the latter.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today the Democratic members of the \nSenate Banking Committee--myself, Senators Dodd, Kerry, Bryan, Johnson, \nReed, Schumer, Bayh, and Edward--are joining with the Democratic \nLeader, Senator Daschle, in introducing the Financial Services Act of \n1999.\n  Senator Daschle and the Democratic members of the Senate Banking \nCommittee strongly support financial services modernization \nlegislation. Last year, every Democratic member of the Committee voted \nfor financial services modernization in the form of H.R. 10, the \nFinancial Services Act of 1998. That bill was reported by the Committee \non a bipartisan vote of 16 to 2. In a Committee markup of financial \nservices legislation on March 4 of this year, every Democratic member \nof the Committee voted for financial services modernization in the form \nof a substitute amendment that I offered. The substitute amendment \ncontained the text of last year's bill with the addition of a provision \nthat would permit banks to conduct expanded financial service \nactivities through operating subsidiaries. The substitute amendment was \ndefeated on a party line vote of 11 to 9.\n  The bill being introduced today consists of the substitute amendment \nthat was offered in the Banking Committee markup. We introduce this \nlegislation because it meets certain basic goals. These include \npermitting affiliations among firms within the financial services \nindustry, preserving the safety and soundness of the financial system, \nprotecting consumers, maintaining the separation of banking and \ncommerce, and expanding access to credit for all communities in our \ncountry. Unfortunately, the bill reported out of the Senate Banking \nCommittee does not meet these goals and was opposed by every Democratic \nmember of the Committee.\n  We are disappointed that the Committee Majority has abandoned the \nconsensus so carefully developed last year. The broad, bipartisan \nmargin of support enjoyed by last year's bill reflected the compromises \nstruck during\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nthe course of its consideration. It was not opposed by a single major \nfinancial services industry association.\n  The legislation being introduced today reflects compromises among \nCommittee Members and among industry groups on a wide range of issues, \nincluding the Community Reinvestment Act, consumer protections, and the \nseparation of banking and commerce. The decision by the Committee \nMajority to abandon these compromises has resulted in less than \nunanimous industry support for the Committee-passed bill. In addition, \ncivil rights groups, community groups, consumer organizations, and \nlocal government officials strongly oppose the Committee-passed bill.\n  We are disappointed as well that the Committee Majority has refused \nto recognize that enactment of financial services legislation entails \naccommodation of views not only of members of the Congress, but in \nparticular the view of the White House and the Treasury Department. On \nMarch 2, before the Committee's markup, President Clinton wrote:\n\n       This Administration has been a strong proponent of \n     financial legislation that would reduce costs and increase \n     access to financial services for consumers, businesses, and \n     communities . . . I agree that reform of the laws governing \n     our nation's financial services industry would promote the \n     public interest. However, I will veto the Financial Services \n     Modernization Act if it is presented to me in its current \n     form.\n\n  The President warned that the bill ``would undermine the \neffectiveness of the Community Reinvestment Act,'' ``would deny \nfinancial services firms the freedom to organize themselves in the way \nthat best serve their customers,'' ``would . . . provide inadequate \nconsumer protections,'' and ``could expand the ability of depository \ninstitutions and nonfinancial firms to affiliate . . .'' None of these \nconcerns was fully addressed by the Committee Majority at markup. \nUnless the concerns of the Administration are addressed, it is clear \nthe Committee-passed bill will not be enacted into law.\n  We believe the bill we are introducing today is a balanced, prudent \napproach to financial services modernization legislation. It could not \nonly be passed by the Congress, but signed into law by the President. \nIt is clearly the approach most likely to lead to the enactment of \nfinancial services modernization legislation in this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 754. A bill to designate the Federal building located at 310 New \nBern Avenue in Raleigh, North Carolina, as the ``Terry Sanford Federal \nBuilding''; read the first time.\n\n\n                THE ``TERRY SANFORD COMMEMORATION ACT''\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Terry \nSanford Commemoration Act of 1999.'' This measure would name the \nfederal building in Raleigh, North Carolina after a great man, Terry \nSanford.\n  We lost Terry Sanford almost a year ago. The loss was great. He \nserved North Carolina throughout his entire life. He was a Governor, a \nstate Senator, a U.S. Senator, and a university president . He was \ntrained as a lawyer. He wrote books, served as a paratrooper during \nWorld Was II, worked as an FBI agent and ran for President of the \nUnited States--twice.\n  Senator Sanford died on April 18, 1998 after a long fight with \nesophageal cancer.\n  He was a towering figure, a hero, to many North Carolinians. And we \nmiss him.\n  There is no doubt that when the history of North Carolina in the 20th \nCentury is written, Terry Sanford will occupy many pages. And he will \nbe given a great deal of credit for the great strides taken by North \nCarolina. Whatever Terry Sanford touched he made better.\n  Senator Sanford's mother was a school teacher. His love of education \nmust have started there. When he was governor he did whatever it took \nto increase funding for education. He even talked state legislators \ninto voting for a food tax in order to fund education--that was not \neasy. Among other things, he helped found the North Carolina School for \nthe Arts which was a pioneer, and to this day remains a leader in arts \neducation. After he finished his term as governor, he became President \nof Duke University. And he brought unparalleled ambition, vision and \nenergy to making Duke University great.\n  But the list of Senator Sanford's accomplishments does not stop with \neducation. He launched innovative anti-poverty programs. He helped \nstart the North Carolina State Board of Science and Technology. He was \nlargely responsible for the creation of an environmental health \nsciences facility in Research Triangle Park. He helped calm the student \nprotests over the Vietnam War.\n  And finally, in the midst of a turbulent and difficult time, Terry \nhelped us find a path across the racial divide. In his 1961 inaugural \naddress, he let us know and understand that ``no group of our citizens \ncan be denied the right to participate in the opportunities of first-\nclass citizenship.''\n  He later said: ``The most difficult thing I did was the most \ninvisible thing. That was to turn the attitude on the race.'' He turned \nthe attitude in small and large ways. He invited prominent leaders in \nthe African-American community to the Governor's Mansion for breakfast \nto talk about how to solve the race problem. Many of them later said \nthat they never dreamed a day would come when their state's governor \nwould invite them to breakfast. He started the Good Neighbor Council, \nwhich is now the North Carolina Human Relations Commission, to give \nstructure and authority to his commitment to creating jobs for people \nregardless of race.\n  And the thing about Senator Sanford is that he never stopped. Late in \nlife, when he was no longer a Senator, University President or \nGovernor, he kept coming up with great ideas and kept working to see \nthem through to completion. He was a friend to me. And I valued his \nadvice and counsel.\n  Naming a building can never capture the spirit and heart of a man \nlike Terry Sanford. But it is a fitting tribute.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 754\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the `Terry Sanford Commemoration \n     Act of 1999'.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Terry Sanford served the State of North Carolina and \n     the Nation with enthusiasm, bravery, and distinction in many \n     important ways, including--\n       (A) as a paratrooper in World War II;\n       (B) as an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n       (C) as a North Carolina State senator;\n       (D) as Governor of North Carolina;\n       (E) as a professor of public policy at Duke University;\n       (F) as President of Duke University;\n       (G) as a United States Senator from North Carolina;\n       (H) as a patron of the arts; and\n       (I) as a loving and committed husband and father.\n       (2) Terry Sanford fought tirelessly and selflessly \n     throughout his life to improve the lives of his fellow \n     citizens through public education, racial healing, economic \n     development, eradication of poverty, and promotion of the \n     arts.\n       (3) Terry Sanford exemplified the best qualities mankind \n     has to offer.\n       (4) Terry Sanford lived an exemplary life and is owed a \n     debt of gratitude for his untiring service to the State of \n     North Carolina and his fellow Americans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to extend the period for compliance with certain \nethical standards for Federal prosecutors; read the first time.\n\n\n Legislation to Extend the Period for Compliance with Certain Ethical \n                   Standards for Federal Prosecutors\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by a diverse, \nbipartisan group of Senators in introducing\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\nthis simple, technical bill to extend the effective date of a provision \nincluded in last year's omnibus appropriations bill. My cosponsors \ninclude Senators Nickles, Biden, Thurmond, Kennedy, Sessions, Abraham, \nKohl, Schumer, Lieberman, DeWine, and Helms. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support our bill.\n  My colleagues will recall that last year's omnibus appropriations \nbill included a provision originating in the House, relating to the \napplication of state bar rules to federal prosecutors. The so-called \nMcDade amendment proposed the addition of a new section, Section 530B, \nto title 28 of the United States Code, which would effect the ethical \nstandards required of federal prosecutors.\n  Although I am prepared to, I do not want to address the merits of \nthis issue today, and our bill does not do so. Suffice it to say, \nhowever, that including this provision was so controversial that a \nbipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee opposed its inclusion in \nthe omnibus bill. In fact, our strong opposition resulted in a six \nmonth delay in the provision's effective date being included as well.\n  When we included this six month grace period, the Senate anticipated \nthat the time might be used to address the serious concerns with the \nunderlying measure. Due to arguably unanticipated events, we have not \nbeen able to do so. Our amendment simply maintains the status quo, \nextending the grace period an additional six months. A bipartisan group \nof 12 Senators, including myself and 3 former chairmen of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee signed a letter, urging the distinguished Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee to include this \namendment in this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  This letter was signed by Senators Thurmond, Kennedy, Biden, DeWine, \nSessions, Abraham, Kyl, Feinstein, Kohl, Nickles, Warner, and myself. I \nask unanimous consent that the letter appear in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, our bill will not, as some might \nsuggest, result in looser ethical standards for federal prosecutors. \nThe same high standards that have always applied will continue in \nforce. Indeed, I have considerable sympathy for the values Section 530B \nseeks to protect. Anyone who at one time or another has been the \nsubject of unfounded ethical or legal charges knows the frustration of \nclearing one's name. And no one wants more than I to ensure that all \nfederal prosecutors are held to the highest ethical standards. As \nJustice Sutherland put it in 1935, the prosecutor's job is not just to \nwin a case, but to see ``that justice shall be done. . . . It is as \nmuch his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a \nwrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring \nabout a just one.'' But Section 530B, as it was enacted last year, is \nnot in my view the way to ensure these standards are met.\n  Although well-intentioned, section 530B is not the measured and well \ntailored law needed to address the legitimate concerns contemplated by \nCongress, and will have serious unintended consequences. Indeed, if \nallowed to take effect in its present form, section 530B could cripple \nthe ability of the Department of Justice to enforce federal law.\n  The federal government has a legitimate and important role in the \ninvestigation and prosecution of complex multi-state terrorism, drug, \nfraud or organized crime conspiracies, in rooting out and punishing \nfraud against federally funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security, in appropriate enforcement of the federal civil rights \nlaws, in investigating and prosecuting complex corporate crime, and in \npunishing environmental crime.\n  It is in these very cases that current Section 530B, if unchanged, \nwill have its most serious adverse effects. Federal prosecutors in \nthese cases, which frequently encompass several states, will be subject \nto the differing state and local rules of each of those states. Their \ndecisions will be subject to review by the ethics review boards in each \nof these states at the whim of defense counsel, even if the federal \nprosecutor is not licensed in that state.\n  At a minimum, the law will discourage the close prosecutorial \nsupervision of investigations that ensure that suspect's rights are not \nabridged. More likely, however, in its current form, section 530B will \nhinder the effective investigation and prosecution of violations of \nfederal law.\n  Several important investigative and prosecutorial practices, \nperfectly legal and acceptable under federal law and in federal court, \nunder current section 530B will be subject to state bar rules. For \ninstance, in many states, federal attorneys will not be permitted to \nspeak with witnesses alleged to be represented, especially witnesses to \ncorporate misconduct. The use of undercover investigations or federal-\ncourt authorized wiretaps may be challenged as illegal in those states \nwhere these practices are barred or curtailed by state law or rule, \nhindering federal criminal investigations. In other states, current \nsection 530B might be construed to require--contrary to long-\nestablished federal grand jury practice--that prosecutors present \nexculpatory evidence to the grand jury.\n  In short, current section 530B will likely affect adversely \nenforcement of our antitrust laws, our environmental laws prohibiting \nthe dumping of hazardous waste, our labor laws, our civil rights laws, \nand the integrity of every federal benefits program.\n  Despite these potentially severe consequences, this legislation \nreceived no meaningful consideration in the Senate last Congress. \nRather, it was included without an opportunity for Senate debate in an \nunamendable omnibus appropriations bill conference report. The first \nSenate consideration of this matter occurred just this week, with a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee's Criminal Justice Oversight \nSubcommittee. The testimony at that hearing shed important light on \nmany of the concerns about section 530B that I have described.\n  Yet, our bill does not repeal section 530B, or change one letter of \nit. Our bill simply delays its effective date for six additional \nmonths, to provide the Senate an appropriate time in which to address \nthese matters with our colleagues in the House. We believe that it is \nin the best interest of the Congress, the Department of Justice, and \nour state and federal courts, to resolve concerns over this issue under \ncurrent law, as anticipated by the Congress when it enacted the grace \nperiod.\n  The provisions of the McDade amendment are slated to go into effect \non April 19, 1999, if no further action is taken. I urge my colleagues \nto support the swift enactment of our legislation, to provide the time \nneeded to reach a reasonable resolution to this complex issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Smith of Oregon, Mr. Grams, Mr. Robb, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Lott, \n        Mr. Santorum, Mr. Burns, Mr. Allard, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Bond, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 757.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Sanctions \nPolicy Reform Act of 1999,'' a bill that would establish a more \ndeliberative, commonsense approach to U.S. sanctions policy. I am \njoined by nearly thirty colleagues from both sides of the aisle. A \ncompanion bipartisan bill was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives on March 24, 1999. We introduced a similar sanctions \nreform bill in the 105th Congress and gained thirty-nine co-sponsors in \nthe Senate.\n  Our interest in reforming U.S. economic sanctions policy stems from a \nnumber of compelling and disturbing findings. The net effect of our \nself-imposed economic sanctions is that they deny access to U.S. \nmarkets abroad, reduce our trade balance, contribute to job loss, \ncomplicate our foreign policy and antagonize friends and allies. \nUnilateral economic sanctions are truly a blunt instrument of foreign \npolicy.\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\n  Unilateral economic sanctions have become a policy of first use, \nrather than last resort, when pursuing a foreign policy objective. \nSanctions are tempting alternatives to careful diplomatic negotiations \nand to the use of force to accomplish foreign policy goals. Unilateral \neconomic sanctions have become more frequent in recent years and have \nbeen used against more countries, both friends and adversaries, for an \nincreasing variety of actions which we find offensive.\n  Unilateral economic sanctions can give a competitive edge to foreign \ncompanies by precluding U.S. companies from exporting. Over time, \nforeign competitors will establish trade connections with a U.S. \nsanctioned country, solidify their trade ties and make it difficult for \nU.S. companies to re-enter those markets. This is costly to the U.S. \neconomy, to American exports, to American jobs and to our overall \nforeign policy.\n  There have been a large number of studies on unilateral economic \nsanctions and they provide startling estimates of the sanctions' costs. \nThe report of the President's Export Council, for example, cited 75 \ncountries representing more than half of the world's population that \nhave been subject to or threatened by U.S. unilateral economic \nsanctions. In another study, the Institute for International Economics \nconcluded that, in 1995, alone, economic sanctions cost U.S. exports \nbetween $15-19 billion, and eliminated upwards to 200,000 U.S. jobs, \nmany in high wage export sector. More recently, the administration \nrevealed the results of its internal inventory of U.S. sanctions and \nfound that there are now more than 280 identifiable sanctions \nprovisions that are either in force or in law.\n  Unilateral economic sanctions rarely succeed in accomplishing their \nstated foreign policy objectives. Unilateral economic sanctions \nsometimes do more damage to our interests than to those against whom \nthey are aimed. For this reason alone, we should re-think the way in \nwhich we manage our sanctions policy.\n  Mr. President, a cardinal principle of foreign policy is that when we \nact internationally, our actions should do less harm to ourselves than \nto others. Unilateral economic sanctions, unfortunately, often fail \nthis crucial test of public policy.\n  In fact, Mr President, unilateral economic sanctions often impose \nlong-term adverse effects on the U.S. economy. Once foreign competitors \nestablish a presence in international markets that are abandoned by the \nUnited States, the potential losses can magnify. Over time, the \ncumulative effect of sanctions will not only include the loss of \ncommercial contracts, but also the loss of confidence in American \nsuppliers and in the United States as a reliable business partner. The \nfrequent resort to unilateral economic sanctions to achieve foreign \npolicy goals, however meritorious these goals may be, runs the risk of \nweakening our export performance which has contributed so greatly to \nour economic prosperity.\n  Mr. President, unilateral economic sanctions give the illusion of \naction by substituting for more decisive action or by serving as a \npalliative for those who demand that some action be taken--any action--\nby the United States against a country with whom we have a \ndisagreement. Yet, the evidence is powerful that they rarely attain the \nforeign policy goals they are intended to achieve.\n  The bill we are introducing today includes a number of changes from \nlast year's bill which we believe will strengthen the cause of \nsanctions reform. These new provisions include language that would \nprovide the President more flexibility in meeting procedural \nrequirements he would otherwise have to meet when considering new \nunilateral economic sanctions. The bill includes a permanent waiver \nauthority on the Nuclear Prevention Proliferation Act of 1994, the so-\ncalled Glenn Amendment, which mandates the automatic imposition of \nsanctions on countries which detonate a nuclear device for weapons \ndevelopment. We also included an additional procedural ``speed bump'' \nto improve the deliberative process in the Congress.\n  Mr. President, our legislation is prospective. With only one \nexception, our bill does not affect existing U.S. sanctions. The only \nprovision in our bill which reaches back to current unilateral economic \nsanctions gives the President permanent authority to waive the \nsanctions in the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, the Glenn \nAmendment. Our bill applies only to unilateral sanctions and to those \nsanctions intended to achieve foreign policy or national security \nobjectives. It would exclude, by definition, U.S. trade laws that have \nwell-established procedures and precedents. The bill does not address \nthe complex issue of state and local sanctions designed to achieve \nforeign policy goals.\n  Our proposed legislation does not prohibit unilateral economic \nsanctions or prevent a vote in the Congress on any proposed new \nsanction. There are situations where other foreign policy options have \nbeen exhausted and where the actions of other countries are so \noutrageous or so threatending to the United States and national \ninterests that our response, short of the use of force, must be firm \nand unambiguous. In such instances, economic sanctions may be an \nappropriate instrument of American foreign policy.\n  Our legislation seeks to establish clear guidelines and informational \nrequirements to help us improve our deliberations and to understand \nbetter the consequences of our actions before we implement new economic \nsanctions. We should know before voting or imposing any new sanctions \nwhat the costs and gains to the United States and our friends and \nallies are likely to be. There should be an analysis of the impact of \nany new sanctions on our reputation as a reliable supplier, the other \npolicy options that have been explored, and whether the proposed \nsanctions are likely to contribute to the foreign policy objectives \nsought in the legislation. Comparable requirements are also mandated in \nthe bill for those new sanctions contemplated by the President under \nhis authorities.\n  If the Congress and the President decide to implement new sanctions, \nour bill requires periodic evaluations from the President detailing the \ndegree to which the sanctions have accomplished U.S. goals, the impact \nthey are having on our economic, political and humanitarian interests, \nand their effects on other foreign policy goals and interests.\n  The bill provides for more active and timely consultations between \nCongress and the President. It provides Presidential authority to \npermit the President to waive the procedural requirements he must \notherwise meet if he exercises his current authorities to impose a new \nsanction. The waiver authority can be exercised if the President \ndetermines that it is in the national interests to do so.\n  Our bill includes a sunset provision which means that any new \nunilateral economic sanction must expire after 2 years duration unless \nthe Congress or the President acts to re-authorize them. Too often \nsanctions have lingered on the books long after anyone remembers and \nlong after they are having any effect.\n  It includes language on contract sanctity to help ensure that the \nUnited States is a reliable supplier, but it also includes appropriate \nexceptions to protect against contracts that might otherwise be illegal \nor contrary to U.S. interests.\n  Our bill gives special attention to American agriculture because \nAmerican farmers and ranchers face a disproportionate burden from U.S. \neconomic sanctions. Agricultural commodities are our most vulnerable \nexports because they are the most easily replaced by other exporters. \nAmerican exporters lose access to some fourteen percent of the world \nrice market, some ten percent of the world wheat market and some five \npercent of the world corn market due to our sanctions.\n\n  Because of this, we included discretionary authority in the bill to \nprovide for compensatory agricultural assistance if agricultural \nmarkets are severely disrupted by the imposition of unilateral economic \nsanctions. No new appropriations would be required for this authority. \nThe bill opposes the use of food and medicines as a tool of foreign \npolicy, except in the most severe circumstances, and urges that \neconomic sanctions be targeted as narrowly as possible on the targeted \ncountry in order to minimize harm to innocent people and humanitarian \nactivities.\n  Let me reiterate that nothing in this bill prohibits new unilateral \neconomic\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nsanctions or prevents a vote in the Congress on proposed new sanctions. \nThe steps detailed in this bill provide for better policy procedures \nand more informed analysis so that proposed new sanctions are preceded \nby a more deliberative process by which the President and the Congress \ncan make reasoned and balanced choices affecting the totality of \nAmerican values and interests.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly about this bill and this issue. It \ngoes to the heart of the manner by which we conduct our commercial \nrelations abroad and the way we manage our overall foreign policy. We \nneed to do a better job on both. This legislation is designed to do \njust that.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and the other original co-sponsors \nby taking a close look at this legislation and the reforms that we are \nattempting to accomplish. I welcome their support and believe that if \nwe deal with the unilateral economic sanctions issue in a careful and \nsystematic manner, we can make a significant positive contribution to \nthe conduct of American foreign policy and to our national interest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be included in \nthe Record, along with a section-by-section description of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 757\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sanctions Policy Reform \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to establish an effective \n     framework for consideration by the legislative and executive \n     branches of unilateral economic sanctions in order to ensure \n     coordination of United States policy with respect to trade, \n     security, and human rights.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (ii) the achievement of the objectives of the sanction \n     outweighs any costs to United States national interests;\n       (B) provide contract sanctity, except that contract \n     sanctity shall not be required in any case--\n       (i) in which execution of the contract is contrary to law;\n       (ii) in which the contract involves assets that will be \n     frozen as a consequence of the proposed sanction;

\n     and\n       (B) the sanction is proposed to be imposed, or is likely to \n     be imposed, on a country or countries that constituted, in \n     the preceding calendar year, the market for more than 3 \n     percent of all export sales from the United States of an \n     agricultural commodity; and\n       (3) should provide that the Secretary of Agriculture expand \n     agricultural export assistance under United States market \n     development, food assistance, and export promotion programs \n     to offset the likely damage to incomes of producers of the \n     affected agricultural commodity, to the maximum extent \n     permitted by law and by the obligations of the United States \n     under the Agreement on Agriculture referred to in section \n     101(d)(2) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. \n     3511(d)(2)).\n       (e) Report by the President.--\n       (1) In general.--Prior to imposing any new unilateral \n     economic sanction, the President shall provide a report to \n     the appropriate congressional committees on the proposed \n     sanction.

The \n     report may be provided on a classified basis if disclosure \n     would threaten the national security of the United States. \n     The President's report shall contain the following:\n       (A) An explanation of the foreign policy or national \n     security objective or objectives intended to be achieved \n     through the proposed sanction.\n       (B) An assessment of--\n       (i) the likelihood that the proposed new unilateral \n     economic sanction will achieve its stated objectives within \n     the stated period of time; and\n       (ii) the impact of the proposed new unilateral economic \n     sanction on--\n\n       (I) humanitarian conditions, including the impact on \n     conditions in any specific countries on which the sanction is \n     proposed to be imposed;\n       (II) humanitarian activities of United States and foreign \n     nongovernmental organizations;\n       (III) relations with United States allies; and\n       (IV) other United States national security and foreign \n     policy interests, including countries and entities other than \n     those on which the sanction is proposed to be imposed.\n\n       (C) A description and assessment of--\n       (i) diplomatic and other steps the United States has taken \n     to accomplish the intended objectives of the proposed \n     sanction;\n       (ii) the likelihood of multilateral adoption of comparable \n     measures;\n       (iii) comparable measures undertaken by other countries;\n       (iv) alternative measures to promote the same objectives, \n     and an assessment of their potential effectiveness;\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\n       (v) any obligations of the United States under \n     international treaties or trade agreements with which the \n     proposed sanction may conflict;\n       (vi) the likelihood that the proposed sanction will lead to \n     retaliation against United States interests, including \n     agricultural interests; and\n       (vii) whether the achievement of the objectives of the \n     proposed sanction outweighs any likely costs to United States \n     foreign policy, national security, economic, and humanitarian \n     interests, including any potential harm to United States \n     business, agriculture, and consumers, and any potential harm \n     to the international reputation of the United States as a \n     reliable supplier of products, technology, agricultural \n     commodities, and services.\n       (2) Report on other sanctions.--In the case of any \n     unilateral economic sanction that is imposed after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, other than a new unilateral \n     economic sanction described in subsection (a)(2) or a \n     sanction that is a continuation of a sanction in effect on \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall not \n     later than 30 days after imposing such sanction submit to \n     Congress a report described in paragraph (1) relating to such \n     sanction. The report may be provided on a classified basis if \n     disclosure would threaten the national security of the United \n     States.\n       (f) Report by the Secretary of Agriculture.--Prior to the \n     imposition of a new unilateral economic sanction by the \n     President, the Secretary of Agriculture shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report that shall \n     contain an assessment of--\n       (1) the extent to which any country or countries proposed \n     to be sanctioned are markets that accounted for, in the \n     preceding calendar year, more than 3 percent of all export \n     sales from the United States of any agricultural commodity;\n       (2) the likelihood that exports of agricultural commodities \n     from the United States will be affected by the proposed \n     sanction or by retaliation by any country proposed to be \n     sanctioned, including specific commodities which are most \n     likely to be affected;\n       (3) the likely effect on incomes of producers of the \n     specific commodities identified by the Secretary;\n       (4) the extent to which the proposed sanction would permit \n     foreign suppliers to replace United States suppliers; and\n       (5) the likely effect of the proposed sanction on the \n     reputation of United States farmers as reliable suppliers of \n     agricultural commodities in general, and of the specific \n     commodities identified by the Secretary.\n       (g) Report by the United States International Trade \n     Commission.--Before imposing a new unilateral economic \n     sanction, the President shall make a timely request to the \n     United States International Trade Commission for a report on \n     the likely short-term and long-term costs of the proposed \n     sanction to the United States economy, including the \n     potential impact on United States trade performance, \n     employment, and growth, the international reputation of the \n     United States as a reliable supplier of products, \n     agricultural commodities, technology, and services, and the \n     economic well-being and international competitive position of \n     United States industries, firms, workers, farmers, and \n     communities.\n       (h) Waiver Authority.--The President may waive any of the \n     requirements of subsections (a), (b), (c), (e)(1), (f), and \n     (g), in the event that the President determines that such a \n     waiver is in the national interest of the United States. In \n     the event of such a waiver, the requirements waived shall be \n     met during the 60-day period immediately following the \n     imposition of the new unilateral economic sanction, and the \n     sanction shall terminate 90 days after being imposed unless \n     such requirements are met. The President may waive any of the \n     requirements of paragraphs (1)(B), (1)(D), (1)(E), and (2) of \n     subsection (d) in the event that the President determines \n     that the new unilateral economic sanction is related to \n     actual or imminent armed conflict involving the United \n     States.\n       (i) Sanctions Review Committee.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There is established within the \n     executive branch of Government an interagency committee, \n     which shall be known as the Sanctions Review Committee, which \n     shall have the responsibility of coordinating United States \n     policy regarding unilateral economic sanctions and of \n     providing appropriate recommendations to the President prior \n     to any decision regarding the implementation of any \n     unilateral economic sanction.

ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Annual Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, unless \n     otherwise required under existing law, the President shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     detailing with respect to each country or entity against \n     which a unilateral economic sanction has been imposed--\n       (1) the extent to which the sanction has achieved foreign \n     policy or national security objectives of the United States \n     with respect to that country or entity;\n       (2) the extent to which the sanction has harmed \n     humanitarian interests in that country, the country in which \n     that entity is located, or in other countries; and\n       (3) the impact of the sanction on other national security \n     and foreign policy interests of the United States, including \n     relations with countries friendly to the United States, and \n     on the United States economy.\n       (b) Report by the United States International Trade \n     Commission.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the United \n     States International Trade Commission shall report to the \n     appropriate congressional committees on the costs, \n     individually and in the aggregate, of all unilateral economic \n     sanctions in effect under United States law, regulation, or \n     Executive order.

PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Waiver Authority.--The President may waive the \n     application of any sanction or prohibition (or portion \n     thereof) contained in section 101 or 102 of the Arms Export \n     Control Act, section 620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961, or section 2(b)(4) of the Export Import Bank Act of \n     1945 if the President determines that such a waiver would \n     advance the purposes of such Acts or the national security \n     interests of the United States.\n       (b) Consultation.--Prior to exercising the waiver authority \n     provided in subsection (a), the President shall consult with \n     the appropriate congressional committees. Such consultations \n     may be conducted on a classified basis if disclosure would \n     threaten the national security of the United States.\n       (c) Reports.--At least once every 6 months after exercising \n     the waiver authority in subsection (a), the President shall \n     report to Congress with respect to the actions taken since \n     the submission of the preceding report, and the reasons that \n     continuation of any waiver under subsection (a) remains in \n     the national security interest of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date that is 20 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Sanctions Policy Reform Act of 1999--Section-by-Section\n\n       Section 1: Short title. The act may be cited as the \n     ``Enhancement of Trade, Security and Human Rights through \n     Sanctions Reform Act''\n       Section 2: Purpose. The purpose of the Act is to establish \n     an effective framework for consideration of unilateral \n     economic sanctions and to make unilateral economic sanctions, \n     when imposed, more effective.\n       Section 3: Statement of Policy. This section sets forth \n     U.S. policy to pursue American security, trade and \n     humanitarian interest through broad-ranging engagement with \n     other countries, while recognizing the need at times to \n     impose sanctions as a last resort. It supports multilateral \n     cooperation as an alternative to unilateral U.S. sanctions. \n     It seeks to promote U.S. economic growth through trade and to \n     maintain America's reputation as a reliable supplier. It \n     opposes boycotts and use of agricultural embargoes as a \n     foreign policy weapon. It urges that economic sanctions be \n     targeted as narrowly as possible, to minimize harm to \n     innocent people or to humanitarian activities.\n       Section 4: Definitions. This section defines ``unilateral \n     economic sanction'' as any restriction or condition on \n     economic activity with respect to a foreign country or entity \n     imposed for reasons of foreign policy or national security. \n     This definition excludes multilateral sanctions, where other \n     countries have agreed to adopt ``substantially equivalent'' \n     measures. The definition also excludes U.S. trade laws, \n     Jackson-Vanik, and munitions list controls. This section also \n     defines ``appropriate committees,'' and ``contract \n     sanctity.''\n       Section 5: Guidelines for Unilateral Economic Sanctions \n     Legislation. This section provides that any bill or joint \n     resolution imposing or authorizing a unilateral economic \n     sanction should state the U.S. foreign policy or national \n     security objective, terminate after two years unless \n     specifically reauthorized, protect contract sanctity, provide \n     Presidential authority to adjust or waive the sanction in the \n     national interest, target the sanction as narrowly as \n     possible against the parties responsible for the offending \n     conduct, and provide for expanded export promotion if \n     sanctions target a major export market for American farmers.\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\n       Section 6: Requirements for report Accompanying the Bill. \n     The committee reporting sanctions legislation shall request \n     reports from the President and Secretary of Agriculture. \n     These reports shall be included in the committee report. If \n     the legislation does not meet any Section guideline, the \n     committee report shall explain why not. The President's \n     report shall contain an assessment of the likelihood that the \n     proposed sanction will achieve its stated objective within a \n     reasonable time. It must weight the likely foreign policy, \n     national security, economic, and humanitarian benefits \n     against the costs of acting unilaterally. The report will \n     also assess alternatives, such as prior diplomatic and other \n     U.S. steps and comparable multilateral measures.\n       The Secretary of Agriculture's report shall assess the \n     likely extent of the proposed legislation in terms of market \n     share in affected countries, the likelihood that U.S. \n     agricultural exports will be affected, and the impact on the \n     reputation of U.S. farmers as reliable suppliers.\n       Section 6 also considers unilateral sanctions as unfunded \n     federal mandates for purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Act. \n     The Congressional Budget Office shall assess the likely \n     short- and long-term cost of the proposed sanctions to the \n     U.S. economy.\n       Section 7: Requirements for Executive Action. The President \n     may impose a unilateral sanction no less than 45 days after \n     announcing his intention to do so, during which time he shall \n     consult with Congressional committees and publish a notice in \n     the Federal Register seeking public comment. Any Executive \n     sanction must meet the same guidelines that Section 5 applies \n     to the Congress and must, in addition, include a clear \n     finding that the sanction is likely to achieve a specific \n     U.S. foreign policy or national security objective within a \n     reasonable period of time.\n       Sanction 7 also requires--prior to the imposition of a \n     unilateral sanction--the President and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to provide to the appropriate Congressional \n     committees reports that contain the same assessment as \n     required in the reports described in Section 6. The President \n     shall also request a report by the U.S. International Trade \n     Commission on the likely short- and long-term costs of the \n     proposed sanctions to the U.S. economy, including the \n     potential impact on U.S. competitiveness.\n       In case of national emergency, the bill allows the \n     President temporarily to waive most Section 7 requirements in \n     order to act immediately. If the President acts on an \n     emergency basis, the waived requirements must be met within \n     sixty days. Finally, the President shall establish an \n     interagency Sanctions Review Committee to improve \n     coordination of U.S. policy regarding unilateral sanctions.\n       Section 8: Annual Reports. The President must submit to the \n     appropriate committees a report each year detailing the \n     extent to which sanctions have achieved U.S. objectives, as \n     well as their impact on humanitarian and other U.S. \n     interests, including relations with friendly countries. The \n     U.S. International Trade Commission shall report to the \n     Congress on the costs, individually and in the aggregate, of \n     all unilateral economic sanctions in effect under U.S. law, \n     regulation, or Executive order, including the impact on U.S. \n     competitiveness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Sessions, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 758. A bill to establish legal standards and procedures for the \nfair, prompt, inexpensive, and efficient resolution of personal injury \nclaims arising out of asbestos exposure, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             fairness in asbestos compensation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fairness \nin Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999. I want to thank all of the \nSenators who have cosponsored this bill. This bill is a bipartisan \neffort and the diverse group of Senators who support the bill reflects \na serious effort to solve a serious problem, not an effort to gain \npartisan advantage. I particularly want to thank Senator Dodd for his \nassistance on this bill and Senator Hatch for his leadership in \nintroducing similar legislation in the last Congress.\n  I am introducing this bill and I support this bill for a simple \nreason--it makes sense. The problems caused by the manufacture and use \nof asbestos are well-documented. Although some companies initially \ndenied responsibility and resisted suits to recover for asbestos-\nrelated injuries in court, the injuries associated with asbestos and \nthe liability of manufacturers for those injuries are now well-\nestablished.\n  The courts--both state and federal--have done an admirable job of \nestablishing the facts and legal rules concerning asbestos. That is a \njob the courts do well. However, now that the basic facts and liability \nrules have been established, the courts are being asked simply to \nprocess claims. That is not a job the courts do particularly well. The \nrules governing court actions give parties rights to dispute facts that \nhave been conclusively established in other proceedings. All the while \nthe meter is running for the lawyers on both sides. Dollars that could \ngo to compensate deserving victims, instead go to lawyers and court \ncosts.\n  In the asbestos context, these problems are exacerbated by the finite \nresources available to compensate victims. What is more, the legal \nrules concerning both punitive damages and what constitutes a \nsufficient injury to bring suit make for jury awards that do not \ncorrespond to the seriousness of the injury. Someone filing suit \nbecause of a preliminary manifestation of a minor injury, such as \npleural thickening, that may never lead to more severe symptoms may \nreceive more compensation than another person with more serious \nasbestos-related injuries. None of this is to suggest that it is \nsomehow wrong for plaintiffs with a minor injury to file suit. To the \ncontrary, some state rules concerning when injury occurs obligate \nplaintiffs to file suits or risk having their suit dismissed as time-\nbarred. What is more, in light of the finite number of remaining \nsolvent asbestos defendants, potential plaintiffs have every incentive \nto file suit as soon as legally permissible.\n  The Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999 attempts to address \nthese problems by establishing an administrative claims systems that \naims to compensate victims of asbestos rationally and efficiently. The \nAct accomplishes this goal by classifying claimants according to the \nseverity of their injuries, ensuring that those with more serious \ninjuries receive greater awards, securing a compensation fund so that \nvictims whose conditions are not yet manifest can recover in the \nfuture, and eliminating the statute of limitations and injury rules \nthat force plaintiffs into court prematurely. Although I wish I could \nclaim some pride of authorship in these mechanisms, these basic \nfeatures were all part of a proposed global asbestos settlement \nagreement worked out by representatives of both plaintiffs and \ndefendants.\n  The Supreme Court rejected the proposed global asbestos settlement in \nAmchem Products versus Windsor. The District Court had certified a \nsettlement class under Rule 23 that included extensive medical and \ncompensation criteria that both plaintiffs and defendants had accepted. \nThe Supreme Court ruled that this type of global, nationwide settlement \nof tort claims brought under fifty different state laws could not be \nsustained under Rule 23. The Court recognized that such a global \nsettlement would conserve judicial resources and likely would promote \nthe public interest. Nonetheless, the Court concluded that Rule 23 was \ntoo thin a reed to support this massive settlement, and that if the \nparties desired a nationwide settlement they needed to direct their \nattention to the Congress, rather than the Courts.\n  I believe the Supreme Court was right on both counts--the proposed \nsettlement criteria were in the public interest, but the proposed class \nsimply could not be sustained under Rule 23. The Rules Enabling Act and \nthe inherent limits on the power of federal courts preclude an \ninterpretation of Rule 23 that would result in a federal court \noverriding or homogenizing varying state laws. However, as the Supreme \nCourt pointed out, Congress has the power to do directly what the \ncourts lack the power to do through a strained interpretation of Rule \n23.\n  This bill takes up the challenge of the Supreme Court and addresses \nthe tragic problem of asbestos. The bill incorporates the medical and \ncompensation criteria agreed to by the parties in the Amchem settlement \nand employs them as the basis for a legislative settlement. In the \nsimplest terms, the legislation proposes an administrative claims \nprocess to compensate individuals injured by asbestos as a substitute \nfor the tort system (although individuals retain an ability to opt-in \nto the tort system after using the administrative claims system to \nnarrow the issues in dispute). The net effect of this legislation \nshould be to funnel a greater percentage of the pool of limited \nresources to injured plaintiffs, rather than to lawyers for plaintiffs \nand defendants.\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\n  I want to be clear, however, that I am not here to suggest that this \nis a perfect bill. This bill represents a complex solution to a complex \nproblem. A number of groups will be affected by this legislation, and \nit may be necessary to make changes to ensure that no one is unfairly \ndisadvantaged by this legislation. But that said, I am confident that \nwe can make the needed changes. We have a bipartisan group of Senators \nwho have agreed to cosponsor this legislation, and the bill represents \na sufficient improvement in efficiency over the existing litigation \nquagmire that there should be ample room to work out any differences.\n  Finally, let me also note that this bill also plays a minor but \nimportant role in preserving a proper balance in the separation of \npowers. I have been a strong and consistent critic of judicial \nactivism. Judges who make legal rules out of whole cloth in the absence \nof constitutional or statutory text damage the standing of the \njudiciary and our constitutional structure. On the other hand, when \njudges issue opinions in which they recognize that a particular outcome \nmight well be in the public interest, but nonetheless is not supported \nby the existing law, they reinforce the proper, limited role of the \njudiciary. Too often, federal judges are tempted to reach the result \nthey favor as a policy matter without regard to the law. When judges \nsuccumb to that temptation, they are justly criticized. But when they \nresist that temptation, their self-restraint should be recognized and \napplauded. The Court in Amchem rightly recognized a problem that the \njudiciary acting alone could not solve. By offering a legislative \nsolution to that problem the bill provides the proper incentives for \ncourts to be restrained and reinforces the proper roles of Congress and \nthe Judiciary.\n  In short, this bill provides a proper legislative solution to the \nasbestos litigation problem. It ensures that, in an area in which \nextensive litigation has already established facts and assigned \nresponsibility, scarce dollars compensate victims, not lawyers. I want \nto thank my co-sponsors for their work on the bill. I look forward to \nworking with them to ensure final passage of this legislation. The \ncourts have completed their proper role in ascertaining facts and \nliability. It is time for Congress to step in to provide a better \nmechanism to direct scarce resources to deserving victims.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Ashcroft, to introduce the ``Fairness in Asbestos \nCompensation Act of 1999''. This legislation would expedite the \nprovision of financial compensation to the victims of asbestos exposure \nby establishing a nationwide administrative system to hear and \nadjudicate their claims.\n  Mr. President, millions of American workers have been exposed to \nasbestos on the job. Tragically, many have contracted asbestos-related \nillnesses, which can be devastating and deadly. Others will surely \nbecome similarly afflicted. These individuals--who have or will become \nterribly ill due to no fault of their own--deserve swift and fair \ncompensation to help meet the costs of health care, lost income, and \nother economic and non-economic losses.\n  Unfortunately, many victims of asbestos exposure are not receiving \nthe efficient and just treatment they deserve from our legal system. \nIndeed, it can be said that the current asbestos litigation system is \nin a state of crisis. Today, more than 150,000 lawsuits clog the state \nand federal courts. In 1996 along, more than 36,000 new suits were \nfiled. Those who have been injured by asbestos exposure must often wait \nyears for compensation. And when that compensation finally arrives, it \nis often eaten up by attorneys' fees and other transaction costs.\n  In the early 1990's, an effort was made to improve the management of \nfederal asbestos litigation. Cases were consolidated, and a settlement \nto resolve them administratively was agreed to between defendant \ncompanies and plaintiffs' attorneys. This settlement also obtained the \nbacking of the Building and Construction Trades Union of the AFL-CIO. \nRegrettably, the settlement was overturned by the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals in 1996. Though the Court termed the settlement ``arguably a \nbrilliant partial solution'', it found that the class of people created \nby the settlement--namely, those exposed to asbestos--was too large and \nvaried to be certified pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. The Supreme Court affirmed that decision. In its \ndecision, the Court effectively invited the Congress to provide for the \nexistence of such a settlement as a fair and efficient way to resolve \nasbestos litigation claims.\n  Hence this bill. In simple terms, it codifies the settlement reached \nbetween companies and the representatives of workers who were exposed \nto asbestos on the job. It would establish a body to review claims by \nthose who believe that they have become ill due to exposure to \nasbestos. It would provide workers with mediation and binding \narbitration to promote the fair and swift settlement of their claims. \nIt would allow plaintiffs to seek additional compensation if their non-\nmalignant disease later developed into cancer. And it would limit \nattorneys' fees so as to ensure that a claimant receives a just portion \nof any settlement amount.\n  All in all, Mr. President, this is a good bill. However, it is not a \nperfect bill. My office has received comments on the bill from \nrepresentatives of a number of parties affected by asbestos litigation. \nI hope and expect that those comments will be given the consideration \nthat they deserve by the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate as \nthis legislation moves forward.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor \nof the legislation, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of \n1999,'' which Senator Ashcroft is introducing today. This legislation's \nother sponsors include: Senator Dodd, Senator Sessions, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Grassley, Senator Torricelli, Senator Smith, and \nSenator Schumer.\n  State and federal courts are overwhelmed by up to 150,000 asbestos \nlawsuits today, and there are new suits being filed. Unfortunately, \nthose who are truly sick with asbestos and various asbestos-related \ncancers and illnesses spend years in court before receiving any \ncompensation, and then usually lose more than half of that compensation \nto attorneys' fees and other costs. One cause of this extraordinary \ndelay in compensation is the large number of lawsuits filed by those \nwho, without any symptoms or signs of asbestos-related illness, bring \nsuits for future medical monitoring and fear of cancer.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that as juries award enormous \ncompensation and outrageous punitive damages to non-impaired \nplaintiffs, others with actual illnesses receive little or no \ncompensation. As legal and financial resources are tied up and \nexhausted, it is increasingly unclear whether those who are truly \ninflicted with asbestos-caused diseases will be able to recover \nanything at all in the years ahead.\n  Courts have tried unsuccessfully to cope with this problem. The major \nparties involved attempted to compromise on a solution that included \nprompt compensation. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned one \nsuch compromise, known as the Amchem or Georgine agreement, on civil \nprocedural rule grounds, but found the settlement to be ``arguably a \nbrilliant partial solution.'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for \nthe Supreme Court, upheld the Appellate decision and stated, ``[t]he \nargument is sensibly made that a nationwide administrative claims \nprocessing regime would provide the most secure, fair and efficient \nmeans of compensating victims of asbestos exposure. Congress, however, \nhas not adopted such a solution.'' The Court accurately recognized that \nCongress is the most appropriate body to resolve the asbestos crisis. \nThat is what this legislation is aimed to do.\n  Mr. President, through the hundreds of thousands of cases that \nalready have been litigated in the court system, the legal and \nscientific issues relating to asbestos litigation have been thoroughly \nexplored. This, along with the recent court decisions demonstrate that \nthe asbestos litigation issue is now ripe for a legislative solution.\n  This bill we introduce today will correct the asbestos litigation \ncrisis problems. It is crafted to reflect as closely as possible the \noriginal settlement agreed to by the involved parties in the Amchem \nsettlement. This bill will eliminate the asbestos litigation burden in \nthe courts, get fair compensation for those who currently are sick,\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\nand enable the businesses to manage their liabilities in order to \nensure that compensation will be available for future claimants. It is \nimportant to note that no tax-payer money will fund this bill.\n  We have carefully crafted this legislation so that it is at least as \nfavorable--and, in many cases, more favorable--to claimants as the \noriginal Amchem settlement. As this bill makes its way through the \nlegislative process, I look forward to working with Senator Ashcroft \nand my colleagues to further refine the language in order to achieve \nthe maximum public benefit from this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Burns, and Mr. \n        Reid):\n  S. 759. A bill to regulate the transmission of unsolicited commercial \nelectronic mail on the Internet, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                       Inbox Privacy Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Inbox \nPrivacy Act of 1999 on behalf of myself, Senators Torricelli, Burns and \nReid. Our legislation provides a solution to the burden of junk e-mail, \nalso known as spam, that now plagues the Internet. There are five main \ncomponents to this legislation:\n  Online marketers must honestly identify themselves\n  Consumers have the ultimate decision as to what comes into their \ninbox\n  Consumers and domain owners can stop further transmissions of spam to \nthose who do not want to receive it\n  Internet Service Providers are relieved from the burdens associated \nwith spam\n  A federal solution is provided to a nationwide problem while giving \nstates, ISP's, and the Federal Trade Commission authority to go after \nthose who flood the Internet with fraudulent emails.\n  The burden of spam is evident in my home state of Alaska. Unlike \nurban and suburban areas of the nation where a local telephone call is \nall it takes to log onto the Internet, rural areas of Alaska and many \nother states have no such local access.\n  Every minute connected to the Internet, whether it is for researching \na school project, checking a bank balance, searching for the latest \ninformation on the weather at the local airport, or even shopping \nonline incurs a per minute long distance charge. The extra financial \ncost of the longer call to download spam may only be a small amount on \na day to day basis, but over the long term this cost is a very real \nfinancial disincentive to using the Internet. Some estimates place the \ncost at over $200 per year for rural Americans.\n  If Internet commerce is to continue to expand, all Internet consumers \nmust be able to avoid costs for the receipt of advertising material \nsuch as spam that they do not want to receive. As I've said before, the \nInternet is not a tool for every huckster to sell the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  Last Congress I was the author of Title III of S. 1618 which \nunanimously passed the Senate and was supported by a variety of \ninterested Internet groups. Some wanted an outright ban on such \nsolicitations, but banning non-fraudulent Internet commerce is a \ndangerous precedent to set, particularly where the problem today is \ncaused by fraudulent marketers. I also recognize that there are First \nAmendment concerns raised by any Internet content legislation and am \npleased that our approach has the support of civil liberties \norganizations.\n  The most significant difference between this legislation and Title \nIII of S. 1618 is the addition of a domain-wide opt-out system that \nallows Internet domain owners to put up an electronic stop sign to \nsignify their desire to not receive unsolicited commercial email to \naddresses served by their domain. However, to ensure that the Internet \nconsumer has the ultimate choice, consumers would be able to inform \ntheir ISP of their continuing desire to receive junk e-mail. While I \ndoubt that there will be too many Internet consumers who want to \nreceive junk e-mail, Congress should not make the decision for them by \nbanning junk e-mail outright, no matter how annoying it may be. Not \nonly should consumers have the ultimate choice, but if Congress bans \njunk e-mail, what else on the Internet will we ban next?\n  Finally, I have included a state enforcement provision that allows \nall states to enforce a national standard on junk e-mail. As Congress \nhas seen before in the Internet Tax Freedom debate, a unified approach \nto any Internet legislation is key to promoting the development of the \nInternet. Just as having 50 state tax policies on Internet transactions \nrepresents a poor policy decision, so would having 50 state policies on \nspam legislation. My approach solves this dilemma by setting such a \nnational standard that provides for even greater protection that what a \nfew states have already enacted. By setting a national standard, it \nalso solves the constitutional dilemma that many states face regarding \nlong-arm jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, the Inbox Privacy Act represents a significant step \nforward for Internet consumers and domain owners and I urge its \nadoption by my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, thank Senator Murkowski, my \ndistinguished colleague from Alaska, with whom I have worked many \nmonths in this effort. I also thank Senator Burns, Chairman of the \nCommunications subcommittee, who has greatly assisted us with this \nlegislation and Senator Reid for joining with us on this important \nlegislation.\n  Last year, I recognized the growing threat to Internet commerce and \ncommunication posed by the proliferation of unsolicited junk e-mail, or \nso-called ``Spam.'' Junk e-mail is an unfortunate side effect of the \nburgeoning world of Internet communication and commerce. While Internet \ntraffic doubles every 100 days, as much as 30 percent of that traffic \nis junk e-mail.\n  Like many other Americans, I have an America Online account and am \ninundated with unsolicited messages, peddling every item imaginable. \nSimilarly, I receive junk e-mail daily at my official senate e-mail \naddress, along with the complaints of dozens of constituents who \nforward me the Spam that they receive.\n  The incentive to abuse the Internet is obvious. Sending an e-mail to \nas many as 10 million people can cost as little as a couple of hundred \ndollars. Today, unsolicited commercial e-mailers are hiding their \nidentities, falsifying their return addresses and refusing to respond \nto complaints or removal requests. Because the senders of these e-mails \nare generally unknown, they avoid any possible retribution from \nconsumers. Their actions approach fraud, but our current law are not \nstrong enough to stop them.\n  I have long been concerned about executive--indeed any--government \nregulation of the Internet. Many of the best qualities of American life \nare represented and enhanced by the Internet, and I fear government \nregulation has the possibility to stifle the creativity and development \nof cyberspace.\n  However, a failure to address the problem of junk e-mail now poses a \ngreater threat to the Internet than do minimal regulations. The massive \namount of junk e-mail in an already strained system is increasingly \nresponsible for slowdowns, and even breakdowns, of Internet services. \nFor example, just last March spammers crashed Pacific Bell's Network, \nleaving customers without service for 24 hours.\n  Let me be clear, this legislation is not a de facto regulation of the \nInternet. In fact, it does not go as a complete ban on junk e-mail as \nsome have suggested. While I understand the concerns of those who seek \na complete ban, I believe that the government should not hastily pass \nbroad legislation to regulate the Internet. The Inbox Privacy Act will \naddress the spam problem by giving citizens and Internet service \nproviders the power to stop unwanted e-mail. But Congress must move \nquickly to address this situation before junk e-mail becomes a serious \nimpediment to the flow of ideas and commerce on the Internet.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 760. A bill to include the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \nof Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, \nand the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in the 50 States \nCommemorative Coin Program; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\n               Commemorative Coin Amendments Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Jeff \nBingaman in introducing the Commemorative Coin Amendments Act of 1999. \nOur legislation would extend the new commemorative quarter program to \ninclude the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. As one of \nthe few Members of Congress who can remember when my home state was a \nterritory and as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nwith jurisdiction over the territories of the United States, I feel \nthat it is more than appropriate for the U.S. Mint to recognize the \ncontributions of these six entities.\n  However, Mr. President, the reason for minting these six coins goes \nbeyond historical significance. Americans who work in the mining and \ntransportation industries will benefit from my legislation. The U.S. \nTreasury will benefit as collectors remove quarters from circulation. \nThe government spends 5 cents to mint each quarter. Any quarter removed \nfrom circulation by collectors earns the U.S. Treasury a profit of 20 \ncents. A study by Coopers and Lybrand found that the the federal \nTreasury could take in more than $2 billion dollars for the first fifty \nquarter designs. Six more coins will certainly add to that revenue \nwindfall.\n  Mr. President, let me turn to the historical reasons for this bill. \nThe District of Columbia was the only land designated by the U.S. \nConstitution. It has served as the home of Congress and the White House \nfor all but brief periods of time. Within its boundaries reside the \nArchives of the United States, home of the original Constitution and \nDeclaration of Independence. The District of Columbia is home to \nnumerous monuments honoring important Americans who have changed the \ncourse of history as well as events that have changed the course of our \nnation. The District of Columbia was where Martin Luther King spoke his \nmoving ``I have a dream'' address. And finally, it is the place that \nthe world looks to for political and economic leadership.\n  The inclusion of the territories of the United States in this \nlegislation serves as an important reminder of our history. With very \nfew exceptions, such as Texas and those States that formed the original \nthirteen Colonies, all of my colleagues come from States that at one \ntime were territories. Four of us actually remember the days when our \nconstituents were not represented in the Senate and were afforded only \na non-voting delegate in the House. The history of our Nation is \nwritten in the development of the territories--the social and economic \nforces that forged our Nation.\n  Our current inhabited territories are an integral part of that \nheritage and are also a part of our future. Guam, the southernmost of \nthe Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico were acquired \nat the conclusion of the Spanish- American war, as was the Philippines. \nTheir acquisition and subsequent development was the focus of a \nspirited debate in Congress, the Administration, and eventually in the \nSupreme Court over the nature and applicability of provisions of the \nConstitution. Not since the Louisiana Purchase a century earlier had \nthere been such a debate over the boundaries of the United States. \nGuam, acquired in one war, was occupied by Japan in another. The \nsacrifices of the residents of Guam prior to liberation led to the \ngranting of citizenship and the establishment of full local self-\ngovernment. Former President Bush was forced to ditch his plane during \nthe conflict in the Marianas and our former colleague, Senator Heflin, \nwas wounded in the liberation of Guam.\n\n  Puerto Rico, with a population approaching 4 million and an economy \nlarger than many States, has set the mark in political self-government \nfor those territories that are not fully under the Constitution. Puerto \nRico was the first territory to achieve local self-government pursuant \nto a locally\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\ndrafted Constitution other than as part of either Statehood or \nIndependence. Since that time, however, both American Samoa and the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Marianas have adopted local constitutions \nand both Guam and the Virgin Islands exercise similar authorities under \ntheir Organic legislation. Puerto Rico has the longest continually \noccupied capital in the United States, San Juan, and was the site where \none of its Governors, Ponce de Leon, sailed for Florida.\n  American Samoa was acquired under Treaties of Cession in 1900 and \n1904 following the Tripartite Agreement between Great Britain, Germany, \nand the United States. The history of the Samoas demonstrates both the \nEuropean conflicts in the Pacific as well as the emergence of the \nUnited States as a Pacific power. American Samoa, the only territory \nsouth of the Equator, demonstrates the diversity that marks this \nNation. American Samoa is the only territory where the residents are \nnationals rather than citizens of the United States. Past Governors, \nsuch as Peter Coleman, have been important representatives of the \nUnited States in the Pacific community and respected leaders.\n  The United States Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1916 \nfor $25 million. The purchase did not provoke the divisive debates that \nsurrounded the Louisiana Purchase nor some of the merriment that \naccompanied the purchase of Alaska. The Danish heritage continues to be \nevident in the capitol at Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas as well as at \nChristiansted National Historic Site on St. Croix, the heart of the \nformer Danish West Indies. Salt River Bay, on St. Croix, is the only \nknown site where members of the Columbus expedition actually set foot \non what is now United States soil.\n  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is the newest \nterritory of the United States. The area had been part of a League of \nNations Mandate to Japan prior to World War II and saw some of the \nfiercest fighting of the Pacific theater, especially on Saipan. The \nattacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which brought the war to an end were \nlaunched from Tinian. After the war, the area became part of a United \nNation's Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In 1976 the United \nStates approved a Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands, a document that had been negotiated with \nrepresentatives of the Marianas government and approved in a local U.N. \nobserved plebescite. Formal extension of United States sovereignty came \nwith the termination of the Trusteeship by the Security Council a \ndecade later. As an interesting historical note, the acquisition of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands ends the artificial division created in 1898 \nwhen the United States acquired Guam and Spain sold the remainder of \nits possessions in the Marianas to Germany.\n  Mr. President, the District of Columbia and the territories are an \nimportant part of our heritage and our future. They encompass territory \nwhere our nation's government resides, where Columbus landed in the \nVirgin Islands, and where ``America's Day Begins'' in the Pacific. It \nis altogether fitting that their unique character and contributions be \nrecognized by the issuance of appropriate coins.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 760\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commemorative Coin \n     Amendments Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO COIN PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 5112(l) of title 31, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) Inclusion of non-states.--\n       ``(A) In general.--During the 1-year period beginning at \n     the end of the period described in paragraph (1)(A), quarter \n     dollar coins shall be minted and issued having designs on the \n     reverse side that are emblematic of each of the 6 non-States.\n       ``(B) Applicability.--The requirements of paragraphs (2) \n     through (6) shall apply to coins issued in commemoration of \n     the non-States, except that, for purposes of this paragraph--\n       ``(i) references in those paragraphs to `States' and `the \n     50 States' shall be construed to be references to the 6 non-\n     States;\n       ``(ii) references in these paragraphs to the `10-year \n     period' shall be construed to be references to the 1-year \n     period described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; and\n       ``(iii) references in those paragraphs to the `50 designs' \n     shall be construed to be references to the 6 designs relating \n     to the non-States.\n       ``(C) Order.--Coins shall be minted and issued for non-\n     States in the order in which they appear in subparagraph (D).\n       ``(D) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term `non-States' \n     means--\n       ``(i) the District of Columbia;\n       ``(ii) the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n       ``(iii) Guam;\n       ``(iv) American Samoa;\n       ``(v) the United States Virgin Islands; and\n       ``(vi) the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 762. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nfeasibility study on the inclusion of the Miami Circle in Biscayne \nNational Park; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     Miami Circle Feasibility Study\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, several months ago, workers \npreparing land for development at the mouth of the Miami River began to \nnotice a mysterious circular formation in the limestone bedrock that \nforms the foundation of the City of Miami. Further examination revealed \nthat this site, where the river meets the bay, was utilized by the \nprehistoric Tequesta civilization for over 2,000 years, perhaps serving \nas an astronomical tool or as a cultural center for their complex \nmaritime society. Floridians marveled at this clue to our past, and \nMiami is rediscovering and rejoicing in the Ancient Tequesta culture \nwhich, so many centuries before us, survived and flourished in an \nenvironment once dominated by sawgrass and gators, not condos and \ncruise ships.\n  I strongly believe that we have a responsibility to save and study \nreminders of our heritage. So in order to save this particular \nlandmark, I urge you to join me in asking the National Park Service to \nexamine the feasibility of including the Miami Circle as a component of \nBiscayne National Park. This is an appropriate way of fulfilling our \nresponsibility to preserve this historically significant Tequesta site. \nSince 1980, Biscayne National Park has stretched from Biscayne Bay near \nMiami to the northernmost Florida Keys, covering 180,000 acres, 95 \npercent of which is water. The Park is already home to over one hundred \nknown archaeological sites, the majority of which are submerged, as \nwell as ten historic structures. Among those archaeological sites are \nseveral smaller, ``satellite'' Tequesta camps. Protection of the Miami \nCircle within the boundaries of the Park, in conjunction with these \nother camps, would allow for comprehensive site comparison, \ninvestigation and study. We must take seriously our responsibility as \nguardians of this cultural landmark and recognize that only through \nconservation and analysis will we be able to fully grasp the magnitude \nof this discovery.\n  Discussions with experts in the field of historic preservation have \nmade me aware that the challenges faced by the people of the State of \nFlorida in their efforts to save the Circle are not unlike those \nencountered during other attempts to save threatened monuments to their \nheritage--be they tornado-damaged barns that housed soldiers during the \nCivil War or missing links in the Underground Railroad discovered in \nthe course of site preparation for development. I'm working with \nexperts in this field to identify ways that the federal government \nmight become a partner in these types of emergency situations so that \nsites of cultural significance will not fall victim to natural \noccurrences or development. I hope to introduce legislation soon that \nwill give Americans the opportunity to save historic landmarks that \nthey have identified in their own communities.\n  There is no Federal emergency fund or program to save the Miami \nCircle. However, the annexation of the 2.2 acre Miami Circle property \ninto Biscayne National Park, if found to be appropriate in a \nfeasibility study, will save the Miami Circle from bulldozers and \ncement pourers, will allow us to gain a greater understanding of the \nTequesta culture, and will be a valuable asset to our National Parks \nSystem. We will not only be preserving a valuable piece\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nof history, but will also provide a fitting gateway to one of our \nNation's newest National Parks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. \n        Helms):\n  S.J. Res. 16. A joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment \nto establish limited judicial terms of office; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ESTABLISH LIMITED JUDICIAL TERMS OF OFFICE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the \nTerm Limits for Judges Amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates. I first introduced this proposal in the 105th Congress, with \nSenators Shelby and Helms as co-sponsors. I am pleased that both of \nthose distinguished colleagues are joining me again as original co-\nsponsors.\n  Mr. President, the Framers of our Constitution intended that the \njudicial branch created by Article III would have a limited role. In \nFederalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton argued that the judicial branch \n``will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the \nConstitution.'' Courts, wrote Hamilton, ``have neither force nor will \nbut merely judgment'' and ``can take no active resolution whatever.'' \nEven as he advocated the ratification of the Constitution, however, \nHamilton also issued a warning. ``The courts,'' he said, ``must declare \nthe sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise will \ninstead of judgment the consequence would equally be the substitution \nof their pleasure to that of the legislative body.''\n  More than two hundred years after Alexander Hamilton issued his \nwarning, it is abundantly clear that the abuse of judicial power that \nhe feared has become a reality. In recent years, for example, activist \njudges have repeatedly abused their authority by blocking the \nimplementation of entirely constitutional measures enacted through \nstate ballot referenda simply because they disagree with the policy \njudgments of the voters. Activist judges have taken control or prisons \nand school districts. Activist judges have even ordered tax increases. \nWorst of all, activist judges have created new rules to protect \ncriminal defendants that result in killers, rapists and other violent \nindividuals being turned loose to continue preying on society. Former \nU.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese estimates that over 100,000 criminal \ncases each year cannot be successfully prosecuted because of these \ncourt-created rules.\n  Mr. President, judicial activism has become such a severe problem \nthat former U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert Bork has proposed that the \nConstitution should be amended to give the Congress the power to \noverturn Supreme Court decisions. I believe, however, that a better \nsolution is a constitutional amendment providing term limits for \njudges.\n  The Term Limits for Judges Amendment would put an end to life tenure \nfor judges. Judges at all three levels of the Article III judiciary--\nSupreme Court, Appeals Courts, and District Courts--would be nominated \nby the President and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, \nappointed for 10-year terms. After completing such a term, a judge \nwould be eligible for reappointment, subject to Senate confirmation. \nSince under the Twenty-Second Amendment no person can be President for \nmore than 10 consecutive years, no judge could be appointed twice by \nthe same President. Finally, judges appointed before the Amendment \ntakes effect would be protected by a ``grandfather'' clause.\n  Mr. President, activist judges are routinely violating the separation \nof powers by usurping legislative and executive powers. This widespread \nabuse of judicial authority is constitutional in dimension and it is \nserious enough to warrant a constitutional response. Term limits for \njudges would establish a check on the power of activists judges. No \nlonger could they abuse their authority with impunity. Under the Term \nLimits for Judges Amendment, judges who abuse their offices by imposing \ntheir own policy views instead of interpreting the laws in good faith \ncould be passed over for new terms by the President or rejected for \nreappointment by the Senate. Moreover, the Term Limits for Judges \nAmendment would make the President and the Senate more accountable to \nthe people for their judicial selections.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the Term \nLimits for Judges Amendment printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 16\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``The Chief Justice and the judges of both the Supreme \n     Court and the inferior courts shall hold their offices for \n     the term of ten years. They shall be eligible for nomination \n     and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for \n     appointment by the President to additional terms. This \n     article shall not apply to any Chief Justice or judge who was \n     appointed before it becomes operative.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S.J. Res. 17. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States which requires (except during time of \nwar and subject to suspension by the Congress) that the total amount of \nmoney expended by the United States during any fiscal year not exceed \nthe amount of certain revenue received by the United States during such \nfiscal year and not exceed 20 per centum of the gross national product \nof the United States during the previous calendar year; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. This is the same \namendment which I have introduced in every Congress since the 97th \nCongress. Throughout my entire tenure in Congress, during the good \neconomic times and the bad, I have devoted much time and attention to \nthis idea because I believe that the most significant thing that the \nfederal government can do to enhance the lives of all Americans and \nfuture generations is to ensure that we have a balanced federal budget.\n  Mr. President, our Founding Fathers, wise men indeed, had great \nconcerns regarding the capability of those in government to operate \nwithin budgetary constraints. Alexander Hamilton once wrote that ``. . \n. there is a general propensity in those who govern, founded in the \nconstitution of man, to shift the burden from the present to a future \nday.'' Thomas Jefferson commented on the moral significance of this \n``shifting of the burden from the present to the future.'' He said: \n``the question whether one generation has the right to bind another by \nthe deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it \namong the fundamental principles of government. We should consider \nourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally \nbound to pay them ourselves.''\n  Mr. President, I completely agree with these sentiments. History has \nshown that Hamilton was correct. Those who govern have in fact saddled \nfuture generations with the responsibility of paying for their debts. \nOver the past 30 years, annual deficits became routine and the federal \ngovernment built up massive debt. Furthermore, Jefferson's assessment \nof the significance of this is also correct: intergenerational debt \nshifting is morally wrong.\n  Mr. President, some may find it strange that I am talking about the \nproblems of budget deficits and the need for a balanced budget \namendment at a time when the budget is actually in balance. However, I \nraise this issue now, as I have time and time again in the past, \nbecause of the seminal importance involved in establishing a permanent \nmechanism to ensure that our annual federal budget is always balanced.\n  Mr. President, a permanently balanced budget would have a \nconsiderable impact in the everyday lives of the American people. A \nbalanced budget would dramatically lower interest rates thereby saving \nmoney for anyone with a home mortgage, a student loan, a car loan, \ncredit card debt, or any other interest rate sensitive payment \nresponsibility. Simply by balancing its books, the federal government \nwould put real money into the hands of hard working people. In all \npractical sense,\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nthe effect of such fiscal responsibility on the part of the government \nwould be the same as a significant tax cut for the American people. \nMoreover, if the government demand for capital is reduced, more money \nwould be available for private sector use, which in turn, would \ngenerate substantial economic growth and create thousands of new jobs.\n  More money in the pockets of Americans, more job creation by the \neconomy, a simple step could make this reality--a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Furthermore, a balanced budget amendment would also provide the \ndiscipline to keep us on the course towards reducing our massive \nnational debt. Currently, the federal government pays hundreds of \nbillion of dollars in interest payments on the debt each year. This \nmeans we spend billions of dollars each year on exactly, nothing. At \nthe end of the year we have nothing of substance to show for these \nexpenditures. These expenditures do not provide better educations for \nour children, they do not make our nation safer, they do not further \nimportant medical research, they do not build new roads. They do \nnothing but pay the obligations created by the fiscal irresponsibility \nof those whose came earlier. In the end, we need to ensure that we \ncontinue on the road to a balanced budget so that we can end the \nwasteful practice of making interest payments on the deficit.\n  However, Mr. President, opponents of a balanced budget amendment act \nlike it is something extraordinary. In reality, a balanced budget \namendment will only require the government to do what every American \nalready has to do: balance their checkbook. It is simply a promise to \nthe American people, and more importantly, to future generations of \nAmericans, that the government will act responsibility.\n  Mr. President, thankfully the budget is currently balanced. However, \nthere are no guarantees that it will stay as such. We could see \ndramatic changes in economic conditions. The drain on the government \ncaused by the retirement of the Baby Boomers may exceed expectations. \nFuture leaders may fall pray to the ``general propensity . . . to shift \nthe burden'' that Alexander Hamilton wrote about so long ago. We need \nto establish guarantees for future generations. The balanced budget \namendment is the best such mechanism available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 20) \nsetting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government \nfor fiscal years 2000 through 2009; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE MODERNIZATION AND \n                   IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The health insurance coverage provided under the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is an integral part of the financial \n     security for retired and disabled individuals, as such \n     coverage protects those individuals against the financially \n     ruinous costs of a major illness.\n       (2) Expenditures under the medicare program for hospital, \n     physician, and other essential health care services that are \n     provided to nearly 39,000,000 retired and disabled \n     individuals will be $232,000,000,000 in fiscal year 2000.\n       (3) During the nearly 35 years since the medicare program \n     was established, the Nation's health care delivery and \n     financing system has undergone major transformations. \n     However, the medicare program has not kept pace with such \n     transformations.\n       (4) Former Congressional Budget Office Director Robert \n     Reischauer has described the medicare program as it exists \n     today as failing on the following 4 key dimensions (known as \n     the ``Four I's''):\n       (A) The program is inefficient.\n       (B) The program is inequitable.\n       (C) The program is inadequate.\n       (D) The program is insolvent.\n       (5) The President's budget framework does not devote 15 \n     percent of the budget surpluses to the medicare program. The \n     federal budget process does not provide a mechanism for \n     setting aside current surpluses for future obligations. As a \n     result, the notion of saving 15 percent of the surplus for \n     the medicare program cannot practically be carried out.\n       (6) The President's budget framework would transfer to the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund more than \n     $900,000,000,000 over 15 years in new IOUs that must be \n     redeemed later by raising taxes on American workers, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public, and these new \n     IOUs would increase the gross debt of the Federal Government \n     by the amounts transferred.\n       (7) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that the \n     transfers described in paragraph (6), which are strictly \n     intragovernmental, have no effect on the unified budget \n     surpluses or the on-budget surpluses and therefore have no \n     effect on the debt held by the public.\n       (8) The President's budget framework does not provide \n     access to, or financing for, prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\n       (9) The Comptroller General of the United States has stated \n     that the President's medicare proposal does not constitute \n     reform of the program and ``is likely to create a public \n     misperception that something meaningful is being done to \n     reform the Medicare program''.\n       (10) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted changes to the \n     medicare program which strengthen and extend the solvency of \n     that program.\n       (11) The Congressional Budget Office has stated that \n     without the changes made to the medicare program by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the depletion of the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would now be imminent.\n       (12) The President's budget proposes to cut medicare \n     program spending by $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, primarily \n     through reductions in payments to providers under that \n     program.\n       (13) While the recommendations by Senator John Breaux and \n     Representative William Thomas received the bipartisan support \n     of a majority of members on the National Bipartisan \n     Commission on the Future of Medicare, all of the President's \n     appointees to that commission opposed the bipartisan reform \n     plan.\n       (14) The Breaux-Thomas recommendations provide for new \n     prescription drug coverage for the neediest beneficiaries \n     within a plan that substantially improves the solvency of the \n     medicare program without transferring new IOUs to the Federal \n     Hospital Insurance Trust Fund that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes, cutting benefits, or borrowing more from the \n     public.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions contained in this budget resolution \n     assume the following:\n       (1) This resolution does not adopt the President's \n     proposals to reduce medicare program spending by \n     $19,400,000,000 over 10 years, nor does this resolution adopt \n     the President's proposal to spend $10,000,000,000 of medicare \n     program funds on unrelated programs.\n       (2) Congress will not transfer to the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund new IOUs that must be redeemed later by \n     raising taxes on American workers, cutting benefits, or \n     borrowing more from the public.\n       (3) Congress should work in a bipartisan fashion to extend \n     the solvency of the medicare program and to ensure that \n     benefits under that program will be available to \n     beneficiaries in the future.\n       (4) The American public will be well and fairly served in \n     this undertaking if the medicare program reform proposals are \n     considered within a framework that is based on the following \n     5 key principles offered in testimony to the Senate Committee \n     on Finance by the Comptroller General of the United States:\n       (A) Affordability.\n       (B) Equity.\n       (C) Adequacy.\n       (D) Feasibility.\n       (E) Public acceptance.\n       (5) The recommendations by Senator Breaux and Congressman \n     Thomas provide for new prescription drug coverage for the \n     neediest beneficiaries within a plan that substantially \n     improves the solvency of the medicare program without \n     transferring to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund new \n     IOUs that must be redeemed later by raising taxes, cutting \n     benefits, or borrowing more from the public.\n       (6) Congress should move expeditiously to consider the \n     bipartisan recommendations of the Chairmen of the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n       (7) Congress should continue to work with the President as \n     he develops and presents his plan to fix the problems of the \n     medicare program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO.

Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to \nthe Budget Resolution which would help our nation's senior citizens by \nrequiring the repeal of the Social Security earnings test.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Social Security earnings test \npenalizes Americans between the ages of 65 and 70 for working and \nremaining productive after retirement. Under this unfair law, a senior \ncitizen loses $1 of Social Security benefits for every $3 earned over \nthe established limit, which is $15,500 in 1999.\n  Due to this cap on earnings, our senior citizens are burdened with a \n33.3 percent tax on their earned income. Combined with Federal, State, \nlocal and other Social Security taxes, this amounts to an outrageous 55 \nto 65 percent tax bite, and sometimes it can be even higher.\n  What is most disturbing about the earnings test is the tremendous \nburden it places upon our low-income senior citizens. Most of the older \nAmericans penalized by the earnings test need to work in order to cover \nbasic expenses: food, housing and health care. Our nation's low-income \nseniors are hit hardest by the earnings test, while most wealthy \nseniors escape unscathed. This is because supplemental ``unearned'' \nincome from stocks, investments and savings is not affected by the \nearnings test.\n  This is simply wrong and must be stopped.\n  In 1996, Congress took a step in the right direction when we passed \nthe ``Senior Citizens Right to Work Act'' increasing the earnings \nthreshold for senior citizens from $11,520 to $30,000 by the year 2002. \nI was proud to be the sponsor of this legislation which helped \nalleviate the unfair economic penalties placed on hard working senior \ncitizens.\n  While raising the limit was important it is time that we finally \neliminate the Social Security earnings test and permit our nation's \nelderly to work and improve their standard of living while increasing \nour national prosperity.\n\n                           Amendment No. 180\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS \n                   TEST.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security Earnings Test is unfair and \n     discriminates against America's senior citizens;\n       (2) low-income senior citizens who do not have significant \n     savings or a private pension plan are hit hardest by the \n     Social Security earnings test while wealthier senior citizens \n     are not affected by this unfair penalty;\n       (3) according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``retaining \n     older workers is a priority in labor intensive industries, \n     and will become even more critical as we approach the year \n     2000'' and yet our Nation foolishly prevents diligent, \n     knowledgeable and experienced workers out of the American \n     work force just because they are 65 years old;\n       (4) our laws should encourage work, not discourage \n     individual productivity; and\n       (5) eliminating the earnings test and permitting our \n     Nation's elderly to work and improve their standard of living \n     will also help increase our national prosperity.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Social Security earnings test should be repealed \n     immediately; and\n       (2) the Senate Finance Committee should include a full \n     repeal of the Social Security Earnings Test in any Social \n     Security reform legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 181\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. BUDGET FOR EMBASSY SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) terrorism, both foreign and domestic, poses a grave \n     threat to United States interests abroad and to the well-\n     being of United States citizens at home;\n       (2) since the bombing of United States Embassies in Lebanon \n     and Kuwait in 1983 and the truck bomb destruction of the \n     United States facility in Saudi Arabia in 1996, the issue of \n     physical security of United States diplomatic missions and \n     military facilities abroad has been a growing concern to the \n     United States Government and to the public it represents;\n       (3) the August 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies \n     in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, further \n     illuminated the vulnerability of United States diplomatic \n     missions to acts of terrorism directed against the United \n     States;\n       (4) the report of the Secretary of State's Advisory Panel \n     on Overseas Security of June 1985 specified certain measures \n     that the United States should take to reduce the prospects of \n     repeated bombings of United States Embassies abroad such as \n     occurred in Lebanon and Kuwait in 1983;\n       (5) the Accountability Review Boards chaired by Admiral \n     William J. Crowe, Jr. warned of continuing vulnerabilities to \n     United States diplomatic missions cause by the failure of the \n     United States Government to take necessary actions to reduce \n     that vulnerability;\n       (6) the Accountability Review Boards recommended that the \n     United States Government allocate the sum of $15,000,000,000 \n     be spent over 10 years to address the vulnerabilities of \n     United States diplomatic missions abroad; and\n       (7) the Administration has budgeted less than half the \n     amount recommended by the Accountability Review Boards for \n     improving the security of United States diplomatic missions \n     abroad.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     budget levels in this concurrent resolution assume that--\n       (1) the President should propose a budget for embassy \n     security consistent with the recommendations set forth by the \n     Accountability Review Boards and including measures \n     recommended by the 1985 Advisory Panel on Overseas Security; \n     and\n       (2) the Secretary of State should provide Congress within \n     60 days of adoption of this concurrent resolution a \n     comprehensive report on the Secretary's plans for \n     implementing the recommendations of the Accountability Review \n     Boards and the 1985 Advisory Panel on Overseas Security.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nto the Budget Resolution that expresses the sense of Congress that the \nPresident should propose a budget for embassy security consistent with \nthe recommendations set forth by the Accountability Review Boards, \notherwise known as the Crowe Commission, and include measures \nrecommended by the 1985 Advisory Panel on Overseas Security, also known \nas the Inman Commission. It further directs the Secretary of State to \nprovide to Congress within 60 days of passage of the resolution a \ncomprehensive report on its plans for implementing the recommendations \nof these two commissions.\n  Our embassies and consulates abroad are sovereign United States \nterritory, representing our country's presence around the world, \nadvancing our foreign policy interests, and protecting American \ncitizens traveling overseas on business and pleasure. The people who \nwork in and visit our embassies\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\ndeserve a level of physical security commensurate with the threat they \nface from terrorist organizations and individuals seeking to express \ntheir hostility to the United States through destruction of the most \nvisible symbol of U.S. global presence. Their destruction, as occurred \nin Beirut and Kuwait City in 1983 and in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in \n1998, as well as the targeting of other U.S. military and diplomatic \nfacilities overseas, is a direct attack on the United States.\n  It is for this reason that the Administration's five-year budget \nproposal for embassy security is so disappointing and irresponsible. \nRepresenting less than one-half the amount recommended by the Crowe \nCommission, it sends a worrisome signal to our representatives around \nthe world about how we view their physical well-being, and invites \nfurther attacks on soft targets. The threat of terrorist attack on our \nembassies is very real. Such attacks not only result in the death of \nU.S. and host country citizens, but also carry with them the potential \nfor destabilization of countries in which the attack occurs. My \namendment seeks to address the large disparity between what is required \nand what is provided. I urge my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  ROBB (AND GRAHAM) AMENDMENT NO. 182\n\n  Mr. ROBB (for himself and Mr. Graham) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MODERNIZING AMERICA'S \n                   SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The General Accounting Office has performed a \n     comprehensive survey of the Nation's public elementary and \n     secondary school facilities and has found severe levels of \n     disrepair in all areas of the United States.\n       (2) The General Accounting Office has concluded that more \n     than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of extensive \n     repair or replacement; 7,000,000 children attend schools with \n     life safety code violations; and 12,000,000 children attend \n     schools with leaky roofs.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office has found that the \n     problem of crumbling schools transcends demographic and \n     geographic boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 \n     percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, \n     at least 1 building is in need of extensive repair or should \n     be completely replaced.\n       (4) The condition of school facilities has a direct effect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility.\n       (5) The General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. 46 percent of schools lack adequate electrical \n     wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. More than \n     a third of schools lack the requisite electrical power. 56 \n     percent of schools have insufficient phone lines for modems.\n       (6) The Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 6,000 schools.\n       (7) The General Accounting Office has determined that the \n     cost of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       (8) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for \n     Native American children are also in dire need of repair and \n     renovation. The General Accounting Office has reported that \n     the cost of total inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities \n     is $754,000,000. The December 1997 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States states that, ``Compared with \n     other schools nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer \n     physical condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental \n     factors, more often lack key facilities requirements for \n     education reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology.\n       (9) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (10) The Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction.\n       (11) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this budget resolution assume \n     that Congress will enact measures to assist school districts \n     in modernizing their facilities, including--\n       (1) legislation to allow States and school districts to \n     issue at least $24,800,000,000 worth of zero-interest bonds \n     to rebuild and modernize our Nation's schools, and to provide \n     Federal income tax credits to the purchasers of those bonds \n     in lieu of interest payments; and\n       (2) appropriate funding for the Education Infrastructure \n     Act of 1994 during the period 2000 through 2004, which would \n     provide grants to local school districts for the repair, \n     renovation and construction of public school facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT NO. 184\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S. \nCon.

EMERGENCY DESIGNATION POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) Designations.--\n       (1) Guidance.--In making a designation of a provision of \n     legislation as an emergency requirement under section \n     251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985, the committee report and any \n     statement of managers accompanying that legislation shall \n     analyze whether a proposed emergency requirement meets all \n     the criteria in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Criteria.--\n       (A) In general.--The criteria to be considered in \n     determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is \n     an emergency requirement are whether it is--\n       (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or \n     beneficial);\n       (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up \n     over time;\n       (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring \n     immediate action;\n       (iv) subject to subparagraph (B), unforeseen, \n     unpredictable, and unanticipated; and\n       (v) not permanent, temporary in nature.\n       (B) Unforeseen.--An emergency that is part of an aggregate \n     level of anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally \n     estimated in advance, is not unforeseen.\n       (3) Justification for failure to meet criteria.--If the \n     proposed emergency requirement does not meet all the criteria \n     set forth in paragraph (2), the committee report or the \n     statement of managers, as the case may be, shall provide a \n     written justification of why the requirement should be \n     accorded emergency status.\n       (b) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--When the Senate is considering a bill, \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, upon a \n     point of order being made by a Senator against any provision \n     in that measure designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) or 252(e) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the \n     Presiding Officer sustains that point of order, that \n     provision along with the language making the designation \n     shall be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as \n     an amendment from the floor.\n       (2) General point of order.--A point of order under this \n     subsection may be raised by a Senator as provided in section \n     313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (3) Conference reports.--If a point of order is sustained \n     under this subsection against a conference report the report \n     shall be disposed of as provided in section 313(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     DURBIN AMENDMENTS NOS. 186-187\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Durbin) proposed two amendments to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS \n                   RESOLUTION ASSUME THAT IT IS THE POLICY OF THE \n                   UNITED STATES TO PROVIDE AS SOON AS IS \n                   TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE AN EDUCATION FOR EVERY \n                   AMERICAN CHILD THAT WILL ENABLE EACH CHILD TO \n                   EFFECTIVELY MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST \n                   CENTURY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Pell Grants require an increase of $5 billion per year \n     to fund the maximum award established in the Higher Education \n     Act Amendments of 1998;\n       (2) IDEA needs at least $13 billion more per year to fund \n     the federal commitment to fund 40% of the excess costs for \n     special education services;\n       (3) Title I needs at least $4 billion more per year to \n     serve all eligible children;\n       (4) over $11 billion over the next six years will be \n     required to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size to an \n     average of 18 in grades 1-3;\n       (5) according to the General Accounting Office, it will \n     cost $112 billion just to bring existing school buildings up \n     to good overall condition. According to GAO, one-third of \n     schools serving 14 million children require extensive repair \n     or replacement of one or more of their buildings. GAO also \n     found that almost half of all schools lack even the basic \n     electrical wiring needed to support full-scale use of \n     computers;\n       (6) the federal share of education spending has declined \n     from 11.9% in 1980 to 7.6% in 1998;\n       (7) federal spending for education has declined from 2.5% \n     of all federal spending in FY 1980 to 2.0% in FY 1999;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that it is the \n     policy of the United States to provide as soon as is \n     technologically possible an education for every American \n     child that will enable each child to effectively meet the \n     challenges of the 21st century.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 187\n\n       At the end of Title II, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CAPITAL GAINS TAX \n                   FAIRNESS FOR FAMILY FARMERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) one of the most popular provisions included in the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 permits many families to exclude \n     from Federal income taxes up to $500,000 of gain from the \n     sale of their principal residences;\n       (2) under current law, family farmers are not able to take \n     full advantage of this $500,000 capital gains exclusion that \n     families living in urban or suburban areas enjoy on the sale \n     of their homes;\n       (3) for most urban and suburban residents, their homes are \n     their major financial asset and as a result such families, \n     who have owned their homes through many years of\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n     appreciation, can often benefit from a large portion of this \n     new $500,000 capital gains exclusion;\n       (4) most family farmers plow any profits they make back \n     into the whole farm rather than into the house which holds \n     little or no value;\n       (5) unfortunately, farm families receive little benefit \n     from this capital gains exclusion because the Internal \n     Revenue Service separates the value of their homes from the \n     value of the land the homes sit on;\n       (6) we should recognize in our tax laws the unique \n     character and role of our farm families and their important \n     contributions to our economy, and allow them to benefit more \n     fully from the capital gains tax exclusion that urban and \n     suburban homeowners already enjoy; and\n       (7) we should expand the $500,000 capital gains tax \n     exclusion to cover sales of the farmhouse and the surrounding \n     farmland over their lifetimes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that if we pass tax \n     relief measures in accordance with the assumptions in the \n     budget resolution, we should ensure that such legislation \n     removes the disparity between farm families and their urban \n     and suburban counterparts with respect to the new $500,000 \n     capital gains tax exclusion for principal residence sales by \n     expanding it to cover gains from the sale of farmland along \n     with the sale of the farmhouse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  KERRY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 190\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Kerry for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Johnson, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Conrad) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SCAAP FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\n       (1) The Federal Government has the responsibility for \n     ensuring that our Nation's borders are safe and secure.\n       (2) States and localities, particularly in high immigrant \n     States, face disproportionate costs in implementing our \n     Nation's immigration policies, particularly in the case of \n     incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.\n       (3) Federal reimbursements have continually failed to cover \n     the actual costs borne by States and localities in \n     incarcerating criminal illegal aliens. In fiscal year 1999, \n     the costs to States and localities for incarcerating criminal \n     aliens reached over $1,700,000,000, but the Federal \n     Government reimbursed States only $585,000,000.\n       (4) In fiscal year 1998, the State of California spent \n     approximately $577,000,000 for the incarceration and parole \n     supervision of criminal alien felons, but received just \n     $244,000,000 in reimbursements. The State of Texas spent \n     $133,000,000, but the Federal Government provided only a \n     $53,000,000 reimbursement. The State of Arizona incurred \n     $38,000,000 in costs, but only received $15,000,000 in \n     reimbursements. The State of New Mexico incurred $3,000,000 \n     in cost, but only received $1,000,000 in reimbursements.\n       (5) The current Administration request of $500,000,000 is \n     significantly below last year's Federal appropriation, \n     despite the fact that more aliens are now being detained in \n     State and local jails.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance program budget proposal should \n     increase to $970,000,000 and that the budget resolution \n     appropriately reflects sufficient funds to achieve this \n     objective.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                BINGAMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 199\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Bingaman for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nKennedy, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Graham, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Lieberman) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR STATE AND \n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the President's budget request for fiscal year 2000 \n     proposes significant reductions in Federal support for State \n     and local law enforcement efforts to combat crime by \n     eliminating more than $1,000,000,000 from State and local law \n     enforcement programs that directly support the Nation's \n     communities, including--\n       (A) zero funding for Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, \n     for which $523,000,000 was made available for fiscal year \n     1999;\n       (B) a reduction from the amount made available for fiscal \n     year 1999 of $645,000,000 for State prison grants (including \n     Violent Offender Incarceration Grants and Truth-in-Sentencing \n     Incentive Grants);\n       (C) a reduction from the amount made available for fiscal \n     year 1999 of more than $85,000,000 from the State Criminal \n     Alien Incarceration Program, which reimburses States for the \n     incarceration of illegal aliens;\n       (D) a reduction in funding for the popular Byrne grant \n     program under part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968; and\n       (E) elimination of funding for Juvenile Accountability \n     Block Grants, which have provided $500,000,000 over the last \n     2 years to communities attempting to control the plague of \n     youth violence;\n       (2) as national crime rates are beginning to fall as a \n     result of State and local efforts, with Federal support, it \n     is unwise to ignore the responsibility of the Federal \n     Government to communities still overwhelmed by crime;\n       (3) Federal support is crucial to the provision of critical \n     crime fighting services and the effective administration of \n     justice in the States, such as the approximately 600 \n     qualified State and local crime laboratories and medical \n     examiners' offices, which deliver over 90 percent of the \n     forensic services in the United States;\n       (4) dramatic increases in crime rates over the last decade \n     have generally exceeded the capacity of State and local crime \n     laboratories to process their forensic examinations, \n     resulting in tremendous backlogs that prevent the swift \n     administration of justice and impede fundamental individual \n     rights, such as the right to a speedy trial and to \n     exculpatory evidence;\n       (5) last year, Congress passed the Crime Identification \n     Technology Act of 1998, which authorizes $250,000,000 each \n     year for 5 years to assist State and local law enforcement \n     agencies in integrating their anticrime technology systems \n     into national databases, and in upgrading their forensic \n     laboratories and information and communications \n     infrastructures upon which these crime fighting systems rely; \n     and\n       (6) the Federal Government must continue efforts to \n     significantly reduce crime by at least maintaining Federal \n     funding for State and local law enforcement, and wisely \n     targeting these resources.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 to \n     assist State and local law enforcement efforts will be--\n       (A) greater than the amounts proposed in the President's \n     budget request for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (B) comparable to amounts made available for that purpose \n     for fiscal year 1999;\n       (2) the amounts made available for fiscal year 2000 for \n     crime technology programs should be used to further the \n     purposes of the program under section 102 of the Crime \n     Identification Technology Act of 1998 (42 U.S.C. 14601); and\n       (3) Congress should consider legislation that specifically \n     addresses the backlogs in State and local crime laboratories \n     and medical examiners' offices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DeWINE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 214\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. DeWine for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Coverdell, \nMr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Grams, Mr. Burns, and Mr. \nHutchinson) proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR COUNTER-\n                   NARCOTICS INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) from 1985-1992, the Federal Government's drug control \n     budget was balanced among education, treatment, law \n     enforcement, and international supply reduction activities \n     and this resulted in a 13-percent reduction in total drug use \n     from 1988 to 1991;\n       (2) since 1992, overall drug use among teens aged 12 to 17 \n     rose by 70 percent, cocaine and marijuana use by high school \n     seniors rose 80 percent, and heroin use by high school \n     seniors rose 100 percent;\n       (3) during this same period, the Federal investment in \n     reducing the flow of drugs outside our borders declined both \n     in real dollars and as a proportion of the Federal drug \n     control budget;\n       (4) while the Federal Government works with State and local \n     governments and numerous private organizations to reduce the \n     demand for illegal drugs, seize drugs, and break down drug \n     trafficking organizations within our borders, only the \n     Federal Government can seize and destroy drugs outside of our \n     borders;\n       (5) in an effort to restore Federal international \n     eradication and interdiction efforts, in 1998, Congress \n     passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act which \n     authorized an additional $2,600,000,000 over 3 years for \n     international interdiction, eradication, and alternative \n     development activities;\n       (6) Congress appropriated over $800,000,000 in fiscal year \n     1999 for anti-drug activities authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act;\n       (7) the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2000 \n     would invest $100,000,000 less than what Congress \n     appropriated in fiscal year 1999;\n       (8) the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2000 \n     contains no funding for the Western Hemisphere Drug \n     Elimination Act's top 5 priorities, namely, including funds \n     for an enhanced United States Customs Service air \n     interdiction program, counter-drug intelligence programs, \n     security enhancements for our United States-Mexico border, \n     and a promising eradication program against coca, opium, \n     poppy, and marijuana; and\n       (9) the proposed Drug Free Century Act would build upon \n     many of the initiatives authorized in the Western Hemisphere \n     Drug Elimination Act, including additional funding for the \n     Department of Defense for counter-drug intelligence and \n     related activities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) funding for Federal drug control activities should be \n     at a level higher than that proposed in the President's \n     budget request for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (2) funding for Federal drug control activities should \n     allow for investments in programs authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and in the proposed Drug Free \n     Century Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        GORTON AMENDMENT NO. 215\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Gorton ) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nresolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AUTISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are \n     biologically-based neurodevelopmental diseases that cause \n     severe impairments in language and communication and \n     generally manifest in young children sometime during the \n     first two years of life.\n       (2) Best estimates indicate that 1 in 500 children born \n     today will be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and \n     that 400,000 Americans have autism or an autism spectrum \n     disorder.\n       (3) There is little information on the prevalence of autism \n     and other pervasive developmental disabilities in the United \n     States. There have never been any national prevalence studies \n     in the United States, and the two studies that were conducted \n     in the 1980s examined only selected areas of the country. \n     Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan suggest that the \n     prevalence of classic autism alone may be 300 percent to 400 \n     percent higher than previously estimated.\n       (4) Three quarters of those with infantile autism spend \n     their adult lives in institutions or group homes, and usually \n     enter institutions by the age of 13.\n       (5) The cost of caring for individuals with autism and \n     autism spectrum disorder is great, and is estimated to be \n     $13.3 billion per year solely for direct costs.\n       (6) The rapid advancements in biomedical science suggest \n     that effective treatments and a cure for autism are \n     attainable if--\n       (A) there is appropriate coordination of the efforts of the \n     various agencies of the Federal Government involved in \n     biomedical research on autism and autism spectrum disorders;\n       (B) there is an increased understanding of autism and \n     autism spectrum disorders by the scientific and medical \n     communities involved in autism research and treatment; and\n       (C) sufficient funds are allocated to research.\n       (7) The discovery of effective treatments and a cure for \n     autism will be greatly enhanced when scientists and \n     epidemiologists have an accurate understanding of the \n     prevalence and incidence of autism.\n       (8) Recent research suggests that environmental factors may \n     contribute to autism. As a result, contributing causes of \n     autism, if identified, may be preventable.\n       (9) Finding the answers to the causes of autism and related \n     developmental disabilities may help researchers to understand \n     other disorders, ranging from learning problems, to \n     hyperactivity, to communications deficits that affect \n     millions of Americans.\n       (10) Specifically, more knowledge is needed concerning--\n       (A) the underlying causes of autism and autism spectrum \n     disorders, how to treat the underlying abnormality or \n     abnormalities causing the severe symptoms of autism, and how \n     to prevent these abnormalities from occurring in the future;\n       (B) the epidemiology of, and the identification of risk \n     factors for, infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders;\n       (C) the development of methods for early medical diagnosis \n     and functional assessment of individuals with autism and \n     autism spectrum disorders, including identification and \n     assessment of the subtypes within the autism spectrum \n     disorders, for the purpose of monitoring the course of the \n     disease and developing medically sound strategies for \n     improving the outcomes of such individuals;\n       (D) existing biomedical and diagnostic data that are \n     relevant to autism and autism spectrum disorders for \n     dissemination to medical personnel, particularly \n     pediatricians, to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of \n     this disease; and\n       (E) the costs incurred in educating and caring for \n     individuals with autism and autism spectrum disorders.\n       (11) In 1998, the National Institutes of Health announced a \n     program of research on autism and autism spectrum disorders. \n     A sufficient level of funding should be made available for \n     carrying out the program.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     additional resources will be targeted towards autism research \n     through the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 ROBERTS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 216\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Roberts for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and \nMr. Santorum) proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S. \nCon.

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Administration has attacked the Senate budget \n     resolution which stays within the caps set in the Balanced \n     Budget Agreement reached with the President in 1997. The \n     Administration accuses the Senate of taking a ``meat axe'' to \n     American leadership, and placing a ``foreign policy \n     straitjacket'' on the United States. In fact, the fiscal year \n     2000 budget continues to fund programs and projects that \n     advance United States interests, while eliminating funding \n     for wasteful or duplicative programs and activities.\n       (2) The Administration claims that the Senate resolution \n     would cut funds for international affairs in fiscal year 2000 \n     by 15.3 percent. The reality is that the reduction is a five \n     percent decrease from spending in fiscal year 1999. Much of \n     the decrease is a result of savings from reductions assumed \n     by the President in his budget: the President assumes savings \n     from ``one time costs'' in the fiscal year 1999 budget, as \n     well as fiscal year 2000 budget reductions for OPIC, P.L. 480 \n     Programs, and historic levels of foreign assistance to Israel \n     and Egypt . When adjusted for arrearages, the Senate \n     Resolution is only a decrease of $.9 billion in budget \n     authority and $.02 billion in outlays from the fiscal year \n     1999 levels.\n       (3) The Administration threatens the budget will hinder \n     consular services and abandon our citizens who travel abroad \n     and leave them to fend for themselves. The reality is that \n     most consular services today are supplemented heavily by \n     machine readable visa, expedited passport, and other fees. \n     The State Department is able to retain these fees due to \n     congressional authorization for the retention of these fees \n     rather then returning them to the general fund of the \n     Treasury. Due to this authority, in fiscal year 2000, the \n     State Department expects to have at least $374,000,000 to \n     expend from fee collections. These funds are in addition to \n     the budget authority provided by the Senate budget \n     resolution.\n       (4) The Administration argues that this budget will pull \n     the plug on U.S. contributions to UNICEF and Child Survival. \n     In fact, the United States provided more than $122,000,000 or \n     27 percent of all UNICEF funding in 1997, according to the \n     State Department's most recent statistics (of course, this \n     does not include private donations of United States \n     citizens). At the same time, the United States Agency for \n     International Development is requesting a funding increase\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\n     of $119,000,000 for development assistance and $15,000,000 \n     for operating expenses even as the General Accounting Office \n     reports that the Agency for International Development cannot \n     explain how its programs are performing or whether they are \n     achieving their intended goals.\n       (5) The Administration argues that this budget will reduce \n     the United States commitment to the war on drugs. In fiscal \n     year 1999, Congress appropriated funds for drug interdiction \n     programs far exceeding the Administration's request; \n     moreover, the comprehensive Western Hemisphere Drug \n     Elimination Act enacted in October 1998 authorizes nearly \n     $1,000,000,000 in new funds, equipment, and technology to \n     correct the dangerous imbalance in the Administration's anti-\n     drug strategy that has underfunded and continues to underfund \n     interdiction programs. (The President's fiscal year 2000 \n     budget continues to short-change anti-drug activities by the \n     Customs Service and the Coast Guard.)\n       (6) The Administration argues that this budget will erode \n     support for peace in the Middle East, Bosnia, and Northern \n     Ireland. However, funding for peacekeeping continues to \n     skyrocket. However, the cost of peacekeeping has become a \n     burden on the 050 defense budget rather than the 150 foreign \n     affairs budget since the failure of the United Nations \n     mission in Bosnia. Last year, the United States expended \n     $4,277,500,000 on peacekeeping and related activities in \n     Bosnia, Iraq, other Middle East peacekeeping, and in Africa. \n     This amount does not include funds for humanitarian and \n     development activities.\n       (7) The Administration argues that this budget will force \n     the United States to close its embassies and turn its back on \n     American interests. The budget will instead force the \n     Executive branch to take on greater cost-based \n     decisionmaking. According to the General Accounting Office, \n     ``more needs to be done to create a well-tuned platform for \n     conducting foreign affairs. Achieving this goal will require \n     the State Department to make a strong commitment to \n     management improvement, modernization, and `cost-based' \n     decisionmaking.'' The General Accounting Office reports that \n     ``one of State's long-standing shortcomings has been the \n     absence of an effective financial management system that can \n     assist managers in making `cost-based' decisions.''\n       (8) Prior to the start of fiscal year 2000, the United \n     States Information Agency and the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency will be integrated into the State \n     Department. In addition the Secretary of State will have more \n     direct oversight over the Agency for International \n     Development, and certain functions of that agency will be \n     merged into the State Department. To date, no savings have \n     been identified as a result of this merger. The General \n     Accounting Office identifies potential areas for reduction of \n     duplication as a result of integration in the areas of legal \n     affairs, congressional liaison, press and public affairs, and \n     management. In addition the General Accounting Office notes \n     that in the State Department strategic plan, it has not \n     adequately reviewed overlapping issues performed by State \n     Department functional bureaus and other United States \n     agencies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the budget levels of this resolution assume that enactment of \n     the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n     provides a unique opportunity for the State Department to \n     achieve management improvements and cost reductions, and \n     that:\n       (1) The Senate believes that savings can be achieved by \n     simply eliminating wasteful and duplicative programs, not the \n     programs cited by the Administration, which generally receive \n     broad bipartisan support. Just a few abuses that could be \n     eliminated to achieve reductions include the following:\n       (A) $25,000,000 for UNFPA while UNFPA works hand-in-glove \n     with the brutal Communist Chinese dictators to abuse women \n     and children under the coercive one-child-per-family \n     population control policy.\n       (B) $35,000,000 for the Inter-American Foundation, which \n     funded groups in Ecuador clearly identified by the State \n     Department as terrorist organizations that kidnaped Americans \n     and threatened their lives, as well as the lives and safety \n     of other United States citizens, while extorting money from \n     them.\n       (C) $105,000,000 proposed for Haiti, which has abandoned \n     democracy in favor of dictatorship and where United States \n     taxpayer funds have been used, according to the International \n     Planned Parenthood Federation's annual report, for ``a \n     campaign to reach voodoo followers with sexual and \n     reproductive health information..by performing short song-\n     prayers about STDs [sexually transmitted diseases] and the \n     benefits of family planning during voodoo ceremonies''.\n       (D) $60,000,000 over ten years to the American Center for \n     International Labor Solidarity (ACILS), which is AFL-CIOs \n     international nongovernment division. 100% of ACILS's funding \n     is from taxpayers while AFL-CIO contributed $40,956,828 \n     exclusively to Democratic candidates in the 1998 Federal \n     election cycle.\n       (E) In fiscal year 1999, $200,000 in foreign aid to Canada \n     to underwrite seminars on gender sensitivity for \n     peacekeepers.\n       (F) In fiscal year 1999, the United States provided the \n     International Labor Organization with $54,774,408. Work \n     produced by that organization included a report advocating \n     recognition of the sex trade as a flourishing economic \n     enterprise and called for recognition of the trade in \n     official statistics.\n       (G) According to the General Accounting Office, ``USAID has \n     spent, by its own account, $92,000,000 to develop and \n     maintain the NMS [new management system], the system does not \n     work as intended and has created problems in mission \n     operations and morale.''\n       (H) In fiscal year 1999, the State Department is attempting \n     to send $28,000,000 to fund the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     Organization, which is an organization established by a \n     treaty the United States has not ratified.\n       (I) Despite sensitive deadlines in the Middle East Peace \n     Process looming, the United Nations is calling for a \n     conference under the auspices of the Fourth Geneva \n     Convention. No conference has been held under that Convention \n     since its inception in 1947. The topic for discussion is \n     Israeli Settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The United \n     States opposes this conference yet contributes 25 percent of \n     the United Nations budget.\n       (J) The United States has spent more than $3,000,000,000 to \n     ``restore democracy in Haiti.'' The reality is that there has \n     been no Prime Minister or Cabinet in Haiti for 19 months; the \n     Parliament has been effectively dissolved; local officials \n     serve at the whim of President Preval; the privatization \n     process is stalled; political murders remain unsolved; drug \n     trafficking is rampant. In short, billions of dollars in \n     foreign aid have bought us no leverage with the Haitians.\n       (K) As a result of consolidation of United States foreign \n     affairs agencies, 1,943 personnel will be transferred into \n     the State Department prior to the start of fiscal year 2000. \n     The fiscal year 2000 budget does not identify a reduction in \n     a single staff position.\n       (2) Additional funds that may become available from \n     elimination of some foreign assistance programs, management \n     efficiencies as a result of reorganization of the foreign \n     affairs agencies, and new estimates on the size of the budget \n     surplus should be designated for United States embassy \n     upgrades.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 SPECTER (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 219\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Specter for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Sessions, and Mr. Ashcroft) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, S. Con. Res. 20, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR INTENSIVE \n                   FIREARMS PROSECUTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) gun violence in America, while declining somewhat in \n     recent years, is still unacceptably high;\n       (2) keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals can \n     dramatically reduce gun violence in America;\n       (3) States and localities often do not have the \n     investigative or prosecutorial resources to locate and \n     convict individuals who violate their firearms laws. Even \n     when they do win convictions, states and localities often \n     lack the jail space to hold such convicts for their full \n     prison terms;\n       (4) there are a number of federal laws on the books which \n     are designed to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. \n     These laws impose mandatory minimum sentences upon \n     individuals who use firearms to commit crimes of violence and \n     convicted felons caught in possession of a firearm;\n       (5) the federal government does have the resources to \n     investigate and prosecute violations of these federal \n     firearms laws. The federal government also has enough jail \n     space to hold individuals for the length of their mandatory \n     minimum sentences;\n       (6) an effort to aggressively and consistently apply these \n     federal firearms laws in Richmond, Virginia, has cut violent \n     crime in that city. This program, called Project Exile, has \n     produced 288 indictments during its first two years of \n     operation and has been credited with contributing to a 15% \n     decrease in violent crimes in Richmond during the same \n     period. In the first three-quarters of 1998, homicides with a \n     firearm in Richmond were down 55% compared to 1997;\n       (7) the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce-State-Justice \n     Appropriations Act provided $1.5 million to hire additional \n     federal prosecutors and investigators to enforce federal \n     firearms laws in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia project--\n     called Operation Cease Fire--started on January 1, 1999. \n     Since it began, the project has resulted in 31 indictments of \n     52 defendants on firearms violations. The project has \n     benefited from help from the Philadelphia Police Department \n     and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms which was not \n     paid for out of the $1.5 million grant;\n       (8) Senator Hatch has introduced legislation to authorize \n     Project CUFF, a federal firearms prosecution program;\n       (9) the Administration has requested $5 million to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects on a national level;\n       (10) given that at least $1.5 million is needed to run an \n     effective program in one American city--Philadelphia--$5 \n     million is far from enough funding to conduct such programs \n     nationally.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Function 750 in the budget resolution assumes that \n     $50,000,000 will be provided in fiscal year 2000 to conduct \n     intensive firearms prosecution projects to combat\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\n     violence in the twenty-five American cities with the highest \n     crime rates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 SPECTER (AND GRAHAM) AMENDMENT NO. 220\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Specter for himself and Mr. Graham) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON WOMEN'S ACCESS TO OBSTETRIC \n                   AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES.\n\n       (A) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       In the 105th Congress, the House of Representatives acted \n     favorably on The Patient Protection Act (H.R. 4250), which \n     included provisions which required health plans to allow \n     women direct access to a participating physician who \n     specializes in obstetrics and gynecological services.\n       Women's health historically has received little attention.\n       Access to an obstetrician-gynecologist improves the health \n     care of a woman by providing routine and preventive health \n     care throughout the women's lifetime, encompassing care of \n     the whole patient, while also focusing on the female \n     reproductive system.\n       60 percent of all office visits to obstetrician-\n     gynecologists are for preventive care.\n       Obstetrician-gynecologists are uniquely qualified on the \n     basis of education and experience to provide basic women's \n     health care services.\n       While more than 36 States have acted to promote residents' \n     access to obstetrician-gynecologists, patients in other \n     States or in Federally-governed health plans are not \n     protected from access restrictions or limitations.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions in this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget assume that the Congress shall enact legislation that \n     requires health plans to provide women with direct access to \n     a participating provider who specializes in obstetrics and \n     gynecological services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                JEFFORDS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 221\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Jeffords for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Roth, \nMr. Moynihan, and Mr. Grams) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FOSTERING THE \n                   EMPLOYMENT AND INDEPENDENCE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH \n                   DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care is important to all Americans.\n       (2) Health care is particularly important to individuals \n     with disabilities and special health care needs who often \n     cannot afford the insurance available to them through the \n     private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the \n     private sector, or are at great risk of incurring very high \n     and economically devastating health care costs.\n       (3) Americans with significant disabilities often are \n     unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage \n     of the services and supports that enable them to live \n     independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Coverage for \n     personal assistance services, prescription drugs, durable \n     medical equipment, and basic health care are powerful and \n     proven tools for individuals with significant disabilities to \n     obtain and retain employment.\n       (4) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing \n     health care and related services is one of the greatest \n     barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their \n     employment, earning potential, and independence.\n       (5) Individuals with disabilities who are beneficiaries \n     under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     401 et seq., 1381 et seq.) risk losing medicare or medicaid \n     coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that \n     is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of \n     cash benefits associated with working.\n       (6) Currently, less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of social \n     security disability insurance (SSDI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) beneficiaries cease to receive benefits \n     as a result of employment.\n       (7) Beneficiaries have cited the lack of adequate \n     employment training and placement services as an additional \n     barrier to employment.\n       (8) If an additional \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the current \n     social security disability insurance (SSDI) and supplemental \n     security income (SSI) recipients were to cease receiving \n     benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social \n     Security Trust Funds in cash assistance would total \n     $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of the individuals.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that the Work \n     Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (S. 331, 106th Congress) \n     will be passed by the Senate and enacted early this year, and \n     thereby provide individuals with disabilities with the health \n     care and employment preparation and placement services that \n     will enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on \n     cash benefit programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 JEFFORDS (AND OTHER) AMENDMENT NO. 222\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Jeffords for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Chafee, \nMs. Collins, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Reid, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Bingaman) proposed \nan amendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LIHEAP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Home energy assistance for working and low-income \n     families with children, the elderly on fixed incomes, the \n     disabled, and others who need such aid is a critical part of \n     the social safety net in cold-weather areas during the \n     winter, and a source of necessary cooling aid during the \n     summer.\n       (2) LIHEAP is a highly targeted, cost-effective way to help \n     millions of low-income Americans pay their home energy bills. \n     More than two-thirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have \n     annual incomes of less than $8,000, approximately one-half \n     have annual incomes below $6,000; and\n       (3) LIHEAP funding has been substantially reduced in recent \n     years, and cannot sustain further spending cuts if the \n     program is to remain a viable means of meeting the home \n     heating and other energy-related needs of low-income \n     families, especially those in cold-weather states.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The assumptions underlying this \n     budget resolution assume that it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the funds made available for LIHEAP for Fiscal Year 2000 \n     will not be less than the current services for LIHEAP in \n     Fiscal Year 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                HUTCHISON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 223\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mrs. Hutchison for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Gramm) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOUTHWEST BORDER LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT FUNDING.\n\n       (A) Findings.--\n       (1) The Federal Government has not effectively secured the \n     Southwest Border of the United States. According to the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration, 50 to 70 percent of illegal drugs \n     enter the United States through Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, \n     and California. According to the State Department's 1999 \n     International Narcotics Strategy Report, 60 percent of the \n     Columbian cocaine sold in the United States passes through \n     Mexico before entering the United States.\n       (2) General Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy, has stated that 20,000 Border \n     Patrol agents are needed to secure the United States' \n     southern and northern borders. Currently, the Border Patrol \n     has approximately 8,000 agents.\n       (3) The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996, requires the Attorney General to \n     increase by not less than 1,000 the number of positions for \n     full-time, active duty Border Patrol agents in fiscal years \n     1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. The Administration's fiscal \n     year 2000 budget provides no funding to hire additional full-\n     time Border Patrol agents.\n       (4) The U.S. Customs Service plays an integral role in the \n     detection, deterrence, disruption and seizure of illegal \n     drugs as well as the facilitation of trade across the \n     Southwest Border of the United States. Customs requested 506 \n     additional inspectors in its fiscal year 2000 budget \n     submission to the Office of Management and Budget. In their \n     fiscal year 2000 budget request to Congress, however, the \n     Administration provides no funding to hire additional, full-\n     time Customs Service inspectors.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this budget resolution assume \n     full funding for the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     to hire 1,000 full-time, active-duty Border Patrol agents in \n     fiscal year 2000, as authorized by the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING SOUTH KOREA'S \n                   INTERNATIONAL TRADE PRACTICES ON PORK AND BEEF.\n\n       Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\n       Asia is the largest regional export market for America's \n     farmers and ranchers, traditionally purchasing approximately \n     40 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports;\n       The Department of Agriculture forecasts that over the next \n     year American agricultural exports to Asian countries will \n     decline by several billion dollars due to the Asian financial \n     crisis;\n       The United States is the producer of the safest \n     agricultural products from farm to table, customizing goods \n     to meet the needs of customers worldwide, and has established \n     the image and reputation as the world's best provider of \n     agricultural products;\n       American farmers and ranchers, and more specifically, \n     American pork and beef producers, are dependent on secure, \n     open, and competitive Asian export markets for their \n     products;\n       United States pork and beef producers not only have faced \n     the adverse effects of depreciated and unstable currencies \n     and lowered demand due to the Asian financial crisis, but \n     also have been confronted with South Korea's pork subsidies \n     and its failures to keep commitments on market access for \n     beef;\n       It is the policy of the United States to prohibit South \n     Korea from using United States and International Monetary \n     Fund assistance to subsidize targeted industries and compete \n     unfairly for market share against U.S. products;\n       The South Korean Government has been subsidizing its pork \n     exports to Japan, resulting in a 973 percent increase in its \n     exports to Japan since 1992, and a 71 percent increase in the \n     last year;\n       Pork already comprises 70 percent of South Korea's \n     agriculture exports to Japan, yet the South Korean Government \n     has announced plans to invest 100,000,000,000 won in its \n     agricultural sector in order to flood the Japanese market \n     with even more South Korean pork;\n       The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries \n     reportedly has earmarked 25,000,000,000 won for loans to \n     Korea's pork processors in order for them to purchase more \n     Korean pork and to increase exports to Japan;\n       Any export subsidies on pork, including those on exports \n     from South Korea to Japan, would violate South Korea's \n     international trade agreements and may be actionable under \n     the World Trade Organization;\n       South Korea's subsidiaries are hindering U.S. pork and beef \n     producers from capturing their full potential in the Japanese \n     market, which is the largest export market for U.S. pork and \n     beef, importing nearly $700,000,000 of U.S. pork and over \n     $1,500,000,000 of U.S. beef last year alone;\n       Under the United States-Korea 1993 Record of Understanding \n     on Market Access for Beef, which was negotiated pursuant to a \n     1989 GATT Panel decision against Korea, South Korea was \n     allowed to delay full liberalization of its beef market (in \n     an exception to WTO rules) if it would agree to import \n     increasing minimum quantities of beef each year until the \n     year 2001;\n       South Korea fell woefully short of its beef market access \n     commitment for 1998; and,\n       United States pork and beef producers are not able to \n     compete fairly with Korean livestock producers, who have a \n     high cost of production, because South Korea has violated \n     trade agreements and implemented protectionist policies: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       It is the sense of the Congress that Congress:\n       (1) Believes strongly that while a stable global \n     marketplace is in the best interest of America's farmers and \n     ranchers, the United States should seek a mutually beneficial \n     relationship without hindering the competitiveness of \n     American agriculture;\n       (2) Calls on South Korea to abide by its trade commitments;\n       (3) Calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the \n     United States Executive Director of the International \n     Monetary Fund to promote vigorously policies that encourage \n     the opening of markets for beef and pork products by \n     requiring South Korea to abide by its existing international \n     trade commitments and to reduce trade barriers, tariffs, and \n     export subsidies;\n       (4) Calls on the President and the Secretaries of Treasury \n     and Agriculture to monitor and report to Congress that \n     resources will not be used to stabilize the South Korean \n     market at the expense of U.S. agricultural goods or services; \n     and\n       (5) Requests the United States Trade Representative and the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture to pursue the settlement of \n     disputes with the Government of South Korea on its failure to \n     abide by its international trade commitments on beef market \n     access, to consider whether Korea's reported plans for \n     subsidizing its pork industry would violate any of its \n     international trade commitments, and to determine what impact \n     Korea's subsidy plans would have on U.S. agricultural \n     interests, especially in Japan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SHELBY (AND DOMENICI) AMENDMENT NO. 225\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Shelby for himself and Mr. Domenici) proposed \nan amendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR SPECIAL \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) (referred to in this resolution as the \n     ``Act''), Congress found that improving educational results \n     for children with disabilities is an essential element of our \n     national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full \n     participation, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) In the Act, the Secretary of Education is instructed to \n     make grants to States to assist them in providing special \n     education and related services to children with disabilities.\n       (3) The Act represents a commitment by the Federal \n     Government to fund 40 percent of the average per-pupil \n     expenditure in public elementary and secondary schools in the \n     United States.\n       (4) The budget submitted by the President for fiscal year \n     2000 ignores the commitment by the Federal Government under \n     the Act to fund special education and instead proposes the \n     creation of new programs that limit the manner in which \n     States may spend the limited Federal education dollars \n     received.\n       (5) The budget submitted by the President for fiscal year \n     2000 fails to increase funding for special education, and \n     leaves States and localities with an enormous unfunded \n     mandate to pay for growing special education costs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that part \n     B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et \n     seq.) should be fully funded at the originally promised level \n     before any funds are appropriated for new education programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       STEVENS AMENDMENT NO. 230\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Stevens) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF SENATE ON PROVIDING TAX RELIEF TO ALL \n                   AMERICANS BY RETURNING NON-SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   SURPLUS TO TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Every cent of Social Security surplus should be \n     reserved to pay Social Security benefits, for Social Security \n     reform, or to pay down the debt held by the public and not be \n     used for other purposes.\n       (2) Medicare should be fully funded.\n       (3) Even after safeguarding Social Security and Medicare, a \n     recent Congressional Research Service study found that an \n     average American family will pay $5,307 more in taxes over \n     the next 10 years than the government needs to operate.\n       (4) The Administration's budget returns none of the excess \n     surplus back to the taxpayers and instead increases net taxes \n     and fees by $96,000,000,000 over 10 years.\n       (5) The burden of the Administration's tax increases falls \n     disproportionately on low- and middle-income taxpayers. A \n     recent Tax Foundation study found that individuals with \n     incomes of less than $25,000 would bear 38.5 percent of the \n     increased tax burden, while taxpayers with incomes between \n     $25,000 and $50,000 would pay 22.4 percent of the new taxes.\n       (6) The budget resolution returns most of the non-Social \n     Security surplus to those who worked so hard to produce it by \n     providing $142,000,000,000 in real tax relief over 5 years \n     and almost $800,000,000,000 in tax relief over 10 years.\n       (7) The budget resolution builds on the following tax \n     relief that Republicans have provided since 1995:\n       (A) In 1995, Republicans proposed the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1995 which included tax relief for families, savings and \n     investment incentives, health care-related tax relief, and \n     relief for small business--tax relief that was vetoed by \n     President Clinton.\n       (B) In 1996, Republicans provided, and the President \n     signed, tax relief for small business and health care-related \n     tax relief.\n       (C) In 1997, Republicans once again pushed for tax relief \n     in the context of a balanced budget, and this time President \n     Clinton signed into law a $500 per child tax credit, expanded \n     individual retirement accounts and the new Roth IRA, a cut in \n     the capital gains tax rate, education tax relief, and estate \n     tax relief.\n       (D) In 1998, Republicans (initially opposed by the \n     Administration) pushed for reform of the Internal Revenue \n     Service, and provided tax relief for America's farmers.\n       (8) Americans deserve further tax relief because they are \n     still overpaying. They deserve a refund. Federal taxes \n     currently consume nearly 21 percent of national income, the \n     highest percentage since World War II. Families are paying \n     more in Federal, State, and local taxes than for food, \n     clothing, and shelter combined.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the levels in this resolution assume that the Senate \n     not only puts a priority on protecting Social Security and \n     Medicare and reducing the Federal debt, but also on middle-\n     class tax relief by returning some of the non-Social Security \n     surplus to those from whom it was taken; and\n       (2) such middle-class tax relief could include broad-based \n     tax relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings \n     incentives, death tax relief, savings and investment \n     incentives, health care-related tax relief, education-related \n     tax relief, and tax simplification proposals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  SNOWE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 232\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Ms. Snowe for herself, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Smith of \nOregon) proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCENTIVES FOR SMALL \n                   SAVERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in general, the Federal budget will accumulate nearly \n     $800,000,000,000 in non-Social Security surpluses through \n     2009;\n       (2) such a level of surplus affords Congress the \n     opportunity to return a portion to the taxpayers in the form \n     of tax relief;\n       (3) the Federal tax burden is at its highest level in over \n     50 years;\n       (4) personal bankruptcy filings reached a record high in \n     1998 with $40,000,000,000 in debts discharged;\n       (5) the personal savings rate is at record lows not seen \n     since the Great Depression;\n       (6) the personal savings rate was 9 percent of income in \n     1982;\n       (7) the personal savings rate was 5.7 percent of income in \n     1992;\n       (8) the personal savings rate plummeted to 0.5 percent in \n     1998;\n       (9) the personal savings rate could plummet to as low as \n     negative 4.5 percent if current trends do not change;\n       (10) personal saving is important as a means for the \n     American people to prepare for crisis, such as a job loss, \n     health emergency, or some other personal tragedy, or to \n     prepare for retirement;\n       (11) President Clinton recently acknowledged the low rate \n     of personal savings as a concern;\n       (12) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years would move \n     7,000,000 middle-income taxpayers into the lowest income tax \n     bracket;\n       (13) excluding the first $500 from interest and dividends \n     income, or $250 for singles, would enable 30,000,000 low- and \n     middle-income taxpayers to save tax-free and would translate \n     into approximately $1,000,000,000,000 in savings;\n       (14) exempting the first $5,000 in capital gains income \n     from capital gains taxation would mean 10,000,000 low- and \n     middle-income taxpayers would no longer pay capital gains \n     tax;\n       (15) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000, would mean over \n     5,000,000 taxpayers will be better equipped for retirement; \n     and\n       (16) tax relief measures to encourage savings and \n     investments for low- and middle-income savers would mean tax \n     relief for nearly 112,000,000 individual taxpayers by--\n       (A) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years;\n       (B) excluding from income the first $500 in interest and \n     dividend income ($250 for singles);\n       (C) exempting from capital gains taxation the first $5,000 \n     in capital gains taxes; and\n       (D) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this budget resolution and legislation \n     enacted pursuant to this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress will adopt tax relief that provides incentives \n     for savings and investment for low- and middle-income working \n     families that assist in preparing for unexpected emergencies \n     and retirement, such as--\n       (A) raising the starting point for the 28 percent personal \n     income tax bracket by $10,000 over 5 years;\n       (B) excluding from income the first $500 in interest and \n     dividend income ($250 for singles);\n       (C) exempting from capital gains taxation the first $5,000 \n     in capital gains taxes; and\n       (D) raising the deductible limit for Individual Retirement \n     Account contributions from $2,000 to $3,000; and\n       (2) tax relief as described in this subsection is fully \n     achievable within the parameters set forth under this budget \n     resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     CHAFEE AMENDMENTS NOS. 235-237\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Chafee) proposed three amendments to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FEDERAL TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Congressional Budget Office has reported that \n     payroll taxes will exceed income taxes for 74 percent of all \n     taxpayers in 1999.\n       (2) The federal government will collect nearly $50 billion \n     in income taxes this year through its practice of taxing the \n     income Americans sacrifice to the government in the form of \n     social security payroll taxes.\n       (3) American taxpayers are currently shouldering the \n     heaviest tax burden since 1944.\n       (4) According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the \n     median dual-income family sacrificed a record 37.6 percent of \n     its income to the government in 1997.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that a significant portion of the tax \n     relief will be devoted to working families who are double-\n     taxed by--\n       (1) providing taxpayers with an above-the-line income tax \n     deduction for the social security payroll taxes they pay so \n     that they no longer pay income taxes on such payroll taxes, \n     and/or\n       (2) gradually reducing the lowest marginal income tax rate \n     from 15 percent to 10 percent, and/or\n       (3) other tax reductions that do not reduce the tax revenue \n     devoted to the social security trust fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 241\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Grassley) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 20, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE CLOSURE OF HOWARD AIR FORCE \n                   BASE AND REPOSITIONING OF ASSETS AND \n                   OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES IN FORWARD OPERATING \n                   LOCATIONS.\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds the following--\n       (1) at noon on the last day of 1999, the Panama Canal and \n     its adjacent lands will revert from U.S. control to that of \n     the government of Panama, as prescribed by the Cater-Torrijos \n     treaties concluded in 1978.\n       (2) with this act, nearly ninety years of American presence \n     in the Central American isthmus will come to an end.\n       (3) on September 25, 1998, the United States and Panama \n     announced that talks aimed at establishing a Multinational \n     Counter-narcotics Center (MCC) were ended through mutual \n     agreement. The two countries had been engaged in discussions \n     for two years.\n       (4) plans to meet the deadline are going forward and the \n     U.S. is withdrawing all forces and proceeding with the return \n     of all military installations to Panamanian control.\n       (5) Howard Air Force Base is scheduled to return to \n     Panamanian control by May 1, 1999. Howard AFB provides a \n     secure staging for detection, monitoring and intelligence \n     collecting assets on counter-narcotics drug trafficking. \n     Howard Air Force Base was the proposed location for the \n     Multinational Counter-narcotics Center.\n       (6) AWACS (E-3) aircraft used for counter-drug surveillance \n     is scheduled for relocation from Howard AFB to MacDill AFB in \n     April. The E3's are scheduled to resume this mission in May \n     from MacDill.\n       (7) USSOUTHCOM and the Department of State have been \n     examining the potential for\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n     alternative forward operating locations (FOLs). A potential \n     location would require the operational capacity to house E-3 \n     AWACS KC-135 tankers, Night Hawk F-16s/F-15s, Navy P-3s, U.S. \n     Customs P-3s and Citations, Army Airborne Reconnaissance Low, \n     and Senior Scout C-130s. No agreement has been reached \n     regarding the number of FOLs required, cost of relocating \n     these assets, time to build ensuing facilities, or plans for \n     housing these assets for long-term stays.\n       (B) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the United States is obligated to protect its citizens \n     from the threats posed by illegal drugs crossing our borders. \n     Interdiction in the transit and arrival zones disrupt the \n     drug flow, increases risk to traffickers, drives them to less \n     efficient routes and methods, and prevents significant \n     amounts of drugs from reaching the United States.\n       (2) there has been an inordinate delay in identifying and \n     securing appropriate alternate sites.\n       (3) the Senate must pursue every effort to explore, urge \n     the President to arrange long-term agreements with countries \n     that support reducing the flow of drugs, and fully fund \n     forward operating locations so that we continue our balanced \n     strategy of attacking drug smugglers before their deadly \n     cargos reach our borders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ASHCROFT (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 242\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Ashcroft for himself, Mr. Sessions,  Mr. \nGorton, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Bond, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Helms) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 20, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 73, after line 10, insert the following:\n       (c) Additional Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Children should be the primary beneficiaries of \n     education spending, not bureaucrats.\n       (2) Parents have the primary responsibility for their \n     children's education. Parents are the first and best \n     educators of their children. Our Nation trusts parents along \n     with teachers and State and local school officials to make \n     the best decisions about the education of our Nation's \n     children.\n       (3) Congress supports the goal of ensuring that the maximum \n     amount of Federal education dollars are spent directly in the \n     classrooms.\n       (4) Education initiatives should boost academic achievement \n     for all students. Excellence in American classrooms means \n     having high expectations for all students, teachers, and \n     administrators, and holding schools accountable to the \n     children and parents served by such schools.\n       (5) Successful schools and school systems are characterized \n     by parental involvement in the education of their children, \n     local control, emphasis on basic academics, emphasis on \n     fundamental skills, and exceptional teachers in the \n     classroom.\n       (6) Congress rejects a one-size-fits-all approach to \n     education which often creates barriers to innovation and \n     reform initiatives at the local level. America's rural \n     schools face challenges quite different from their urban \n     counterparts. Parents, teachers, and State and local school \n     officials should have the freedom to tailor their education \n     plans and reforms according to the unique educational needs \n     of their children.\n       (7) The funding levels in this resolution assume that \n     Congress will provide an additional $2,800,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000 and an additional $33,000,000,000 for the period \n     beginning with fiscal year 2000 and ending with fiscal year \n     2005 for elementary and secondary education.\n       (d) Additional Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) increased Federal funding for elementary and secondary \n     education should be directed to States and local school \n     districts; and\n       (2) decisionmaking authority should be placed in the hands \n     of States, localities, and families to implement innovative \n     solutions to local educational challenges and to increase the \n     performance of all students, unencumbered by unnecessary \n     Federal rules and regulations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HUTCHISON AMENDMENT NO. 243\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mrs. Hutchison) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S. Con, Res. 20, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       It is the sense of the Senate that a task force be created \n     for the purpose creating a reserve fund for natural \n     disasters. The Task Force should be composed of three \n     Senators appointed by the majority leader, and two Senators \n     appointed by the minority leader. The task force should also \n     be composed of three members appointed by the Speaker of the \n     House, and two members appointed by minority leader in the \n     House.\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the task force make a \n     report to the appropriate committees in Congress within 90 \n     days of being convened. The report should be available for \n     the purposes of consideration during comprehensive overhaul \n     of budget procedures\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       MOYNIHAN AMENDMENT NO. 244\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Moynihan) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

Mr. President, for the second time in less than a \nyear, the Senate is considering legislation to establish a pilot \ndisaster mitigation loan program at the Small Business Administration \n(SBA). Last year, the Committee on Small Business voted unanimously to \ninclude a proposal to establish a disaster mitigation pilot program \nintroduced by my colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, as an \namendment to H.R. 3412, the ``Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business \nPrograms Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.'' H.R. 3412 passed the \nSenate on September 30, 1998; however, the House of Representatives was \nnot able to consider the bill before Congress adjourned last fall.\n  As the Chairman of Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD and \nIndependent Agencies, I have been concerned about our Nation's disaster \nrelief program. I have worked at length with FEMA Director Witt and \nother Administration officials over the past several years to address \nthe escalating costs of disaster relief and the need to tighten up this \nprogram. Since 1989, we have spent $25 billion on FEMA disaster relief, \nand there remains more than $2.6 billion in anticipated costs \nassociated with open disasters. Much work needs to be accomplished to \ntighten the criteria for declaring disasters and eligibility for \ndisaster relief funding, as well as stronger insurance requirements, so \nthat we can bring these ever-escalating costs under control.\n  One way to mitigate against future disaster losses is to undertake \npreventive measures. Preventive measures to mitigate against future \ndisaster losses, rather than the current strategy of response and \nrecovery, could save as much as 50 percent of projected disaster relief \nloan costs.\n  S. 388 would create the Disaster Mitigation Pilot Program, which will \npermit SBA to establish a pilot program using up to $15 million of \ndisaster loans annually from FY 2000-2004 to provide small businesses \nlocated in disaster prone areas with low interest, long-term disaster \nloans to finance preventive measures to mitigate against future \ndisaster losses. The pilot program would operate in disaster prone \nareas designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). \nFEMA has launched ``Project Impact,'' which emphasizes emergency \npreparedness, in response to the problem of increased costs and \npersonal devastation caused by repeated natural disasters. I continue \nto have concerns about the criteria under Project Impact and urge FEMA \nto work to strengthen the criteria. I expect that SBA will develop the \nappropriate criteria for this new loan program that is consistent with \nFEMA's efforts to make improvements in this area. In the end, I do not \nbelieve we should have a proliferation of independent mitigation \nprograms housed in numerous Federal agencies, and we should be working \nto develop a cohesive national strategy to deliver disaster relief \nassistance.\n  Under current law, SBA disaster loans may be used for mitigation \npurposes only to the extent that includes repairing or replacing \nexisting protective devices that are destroyed or damaged in an area \nthat has recently suffered a natural disaster. In addition, up to 20 \npercent of the disaster loan amount may be used to install new \nmitigation devices that will prevent future damage. Under S. 388, the \nDisaster Mitigation Pilot Program, a small business borrower would be \nallowed to use 100 percent of an SBA disaster loan for disaster \nmitigation purposes within an area designated by FEMA.\n  Mr. President, S. 388, the Disaster Mitigation Pilot Program, makes \nsense. It is a worthy program that needs to be tested, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3538-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    OPEN-MARKET REORGANIZATION FOR THE BETTERMENT OF INTERNATIONAL \n                         TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the issue \nof international satellite reform. First I want to thank Senator Burns \nfor holding this important hearing. International satellite reform is \ncritical to consumers across the United States.\n  Yesterday I agreed to become a cosponsor of this bill--along with \nSenators Burns, McCain, Bryan, Brownback, Cleland, Frist and Dorgan. I \nsupport Senator Burns' bill because I believe that it is in the \nconsumer interest to have a private INTELSAT. Such a competitive entity \nwill lead to lower prices, better service, and more efficiency across \nthe globe.\n  Additionally, removing ownership restrictions on COMSAT will help to \nbring new services to American consumers. I believe that broadband \nsatellite services will play a very important role in West Virginia's \nfuture, and this bill will lead to further deployment of these services \nby lifting the ownership restriction on COMSAT. I am excited by the \npossibility of a new competitor in domestic satellite services, and the \nresulting advances in these satellite services. Our mountainous terrain \nand the high cost of providing traditional telecommunications services \nmake satellite services particularly important to West Virginia.\n  Furthermore, INTELSAT has a history of serving all parts of the world \nat reasonable prices. We have an interest in making sure that \ndeveloping nations are part of the global information infrastructure. I \nwill work to make sure that this bill will allow a privatized INTELSAT \nto continue to serve these areas at reasonable prices.\n  I must state, however, that while I support this bill, we are still \nin the middle of the legislative process. I am eager to continue \nworking with Senators Hollings, Breaux, and other Senators who are \nworking on important ideas with great promise. I want to stress that \nwhile I agree that this bill is the right platform for international \nsatellite reform, I intend to keep working hard on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3538-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3538-S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL INHALANTS AND POISONS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nfor increasing public awareness about the dangers of inhalant abuse. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of S. Res. 47, recently passed by the \nSenate, which designates this week as ``National Inhalants and Poisons \nAwareness Week.''\n  Our nation's drug control policy correctly places emphasis upon \nfinding solutions for combating the illegal sale, manufacture and \ntrafficking of well-known abused substances such as cocaine and \nmethamphetamine. However, I believe Congress and the President should \ndo more to focus attention on an emerging but equally dangerous \nthreat--inhalant abuse.\n  As my colleagues may know, inhalant abuse is the intentional \nbreathing of gas or vapors for the purpose of reaching a high. Most \npeople are familiar with common household products such as furniture \npolish, paint thinner, glue, felt tip markers, and deodorants. However, \nmany families are not aware of how misuse of these inhalants by \nchildren can result in sickness or death.\n  Far too often, these inhalants have caused heart, brain, and liver \ndamage in thousands of children across the country. Sadly, many \nchildren have died as a result of inhalant abuse, a condition known as \nSudden Sniffing Death Syndrome. In 1990, four young people in my home \nstate of Minnesota died in separate incidents after experimenting with \ninhalants. Continued misuse of these products may also lead to \nadditional illicit drug use.\n  Additionally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported in 1996 \nthat one in five American teenagers have used inhalants to get high. \nOver the\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nlast few years, our nation has witnessed an increase in new inhalant \nabusers from 382,000 in 1991 to an estimated 805,000 in 1996. In my \nview, these troubling trends can be reversed by educating the public \nabout the dangers of this abuse and encouraging communities to develop \neffective treatment and prevention programs.\n  In my view, greater awareness of inhalant abuse can best be achieved \nthrough passage of S. 609, legislation introduced by Senator Frank \nMurkowski that would amend the Safe and Drug Free Schools and \nCommunities Act of 1994 to include inhalant abuse among the Act's \ndefinition of ``substance abuse.'' Passage of this bill will give \nMinnesota and other states the opportunity to develop federally-funded \ninhalant abuse prevention and education programs. Importantly, these \nprograms will be based on the active involvement of parents, teachers \nand local communities. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation \nwhich is an important element of our war on drugs.\n  Mr. President, the federal government should not regulate the sale of \nthese legal and inexpensive products which are found in almost every \nhousehold. Instead, communities, parents and teachers should be \nencouraged to develop local solutions to this problem. A united effort \ntoward this epidemic will help the United States make significant \nprogress in our fight against drug abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3539-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SPRINGTIME\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to salute the Springtime and \nthe birth of Caroline Byrd Fatemi, great-granddaughter of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Last week, Senator Byrd took the floor to bring us glad tidings of \nspring and of Caroline's birth. Today, before we fly to the four \ncorners of America, I would like to salute our beloved colleague and \nhis progeny.\n  Time and again, Senator Byrd has graced this chamber with the lessons \nof history and the sweet music of poetry. Last week he ushered in \nSpringtime with a stanza from Algernon Charles Swinburne. Let me quote \nthe same poet to welcome Caroline to the world:\n\n     Where shall we find her, how shall we sing to her,\n     Fold our hands round her knees, and cling?\n     O that man's heart were as fire and could spring to her,\n     Fire, or the strength of the streams that spring!\n\n     For the stars and the winds are unto her\n     As raiment, as songs of the harp-player;\n     For the risen stars and the fallen cling to her,\n     And the south-west wind and the west-wind sing.\n\n     For winter's rains and ruins are over,\n     And all the season of snows and sins;\n     The days dividing lover and lover,\n     The light that loses, the night that wins;\n     And time remember'd is grief forgotten,\n     And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,\n     And in green underwood and cover\n     Blossom by blossom the Spring begins.\n\n  Mr. President, the link between the elder Byrd and the younger \nsymbolizes for me what our job here is all about: Looking forward every \nday, every month, every year to the eternal Spring that is America--and \nkeeping faith with every generation of American.\n  Whether we are working to improve education or save Social Security, \nwe who are privileged to serve in the United States Senate can, by our \nactions, strengthen the bonds that unite our nation from generation to \ngeneration.\n  As we strive to make the world a better place for Caroline and every \nchild of her generation, let us follow the advice in Laurence Binyon's \npoem ``O World, be Nobler''--\n\n     O World, be nobler, for her sake!\n     If she but knew thee what thou art,\n     What wrongs are borne, what deeds are done\n     In thee, beneath thy daily sun,\n     Know'st thou not that her tender heart\n     For pain and very shame would break?\n     O world, be nobler, for her sake!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3539-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ``BEST GRADUATE SCHOOLS'' IN THE NATION\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when East Tennessee State University \nopened its doors in 1911, it had 29 students and one primary mission: \nthe education of future teachers. A lot has changed in 85 years.\n  While teacher preparation is still a crucial part of its mission, \nETSU today consists of nine schools and colleges that offer over 125 \ndifferent programs of study to more than 12,000 students every year--\nincluding some fairly unique offerings such as its one-of-a-kind \nmaster's degree in reading and storytelling, and the only bluegrass and \ncountry music program offered at a four-year institution.\n  Over the last two decades, there has been an increasing emphasis on \nthe health sciences at ETSU--an emphasis that began in 1974 with the \nestablishment of the James H. Quillen College of Medicine which was \ncreated to help alleviate a critical shortage of primary care \nphysicians in East Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, this year the Quillen College of Medicine celebrates \nits 25th anniversary. But that proud accomplishment, although \nnoteworthy, is not the basis for my remarks this morning. Rather, I \nrise to commend its recent listing in U.S. News and World Report as one \nof the ``Best Graduate Schools'' in the Nation--a ranking well-deserved \nand well-earned.\n  According to the magazine, Quillen College earned the distinction of \nplacing third among all the schools in the Nation for its programs in \nrural medicine. Last year, it placed sixth in the same category.\n  I also rise, Mr. President, to commend the ETSU College of Nursing--\nwhich was also ranked among the Nation's best. And, like Quillen \nCollege, this is also the second year in a row it was so honored.\n  Both these schools, Mr. President, embrace the values of the people \nof Tennessee. Both are community oriented, both provide a valuable \nresource to local citizens and businesses, and both are making valuable \nand needed contributions to the practice and the quality of medicine.\n  My heartiest congratulations to the entire staff, faculty, students \nand alumni of both East Tennessee State University School of Nursing \nand the James H. Quillen College of Medicine for their splendid \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3539-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3539-S3540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANNIVERSARY OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 178th \nAnniversary of the revolution that won Greece's independence from the \nOttoman Empire. I am proud to join with forty-nine of my colleagues in \nsponsoring Senate Resolution 20 which designates today ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \nDemocracy.''\n  The Greeks have been members of the community in Rhode Island for \nover one hundred years. Over 6,000 residents of the state claimed Greek \nheritage in the last Census. When the Greeks first came to the New \nEngland, they worked in factories and on the waterfront. The \ndescendants of these first immigrants continue to prosper and enrich \nthe Northeast and the rest of the country through their contributions \nto banking, medicine, the tourism industry, and the arts.\n  Edith Hamilton praised Greeks in this quote, ``to rejoice in life, to \nfind the world beautiful and delightful to live in, was a mark of the \nGreek spirit which distinguished it from all that had gone before. It \nis a vital distinction.''\n  I have been grateful for this spirit, energy, and support in the \nRhode Island Greek community, and, for a very long time, I wished to \nvisit Greece and Cyprus. This summer, I finally had that opportunity. \nOn my trip, I had the pleasure of meeting Ambassador Burns and the U.S. \nAmbassador to Cyprus, Kenneth Brill. I also met and had candid \nconversations with Greece's Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Greek \nDefense Minister. In addition, I had the chance to tour the Green Line \nin Cyprus and speak with Dame Ann Hercus, the newly appointed Chief of \nthe United Nations mission and General De Vagera, the force commander.\n  During my visit, I was impressed by the beauty of these countries and \nthe hospitality of the people of Cyprus and Greece. However, I was also \noverwhelmed by the consequences of Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus. \nThe division of the island saps the economic vitality of a region rich \nin resources. The inability to move goods, people, or services between \nthe two parts of the island stymies growth.\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\n  We must continue to work to resolve the Cyprus problem and reduce the \ntensions that exist between Greece and Turkey. When I was a member of \nthe House of Representatives, I cosponsored numerous legislative \ninitiatives to this end, and I will continue to advocate for such \nsolutions as a Senator.\n  For today, let us celebrate the anniversary of Greek Independence, \nthe richness of the Greek heritage and legacy of democracy that country \ngave to the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3540-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO CONTOOCOOK VALLEY REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Contoocook Valley Regional High School for winning the \nregional competition of the Second Annual Ocean Sciences Bowl. I \ncommend them for their accomplishment.\n  The regional competition included teams from fifteen other schools in \nNew Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. Their final match, which was held at \nthe University of New Hampshire, was played against high school \nstudents from Bridgeton Maine. It was a close call and Contoocook \nValley won by the narrow margin of two points!\n  Contoocook Valley's team consists of five students. The team members \nare Amber Carter, Megan Cahill, Sonja Fritz, Cissy Courtemanche, and \nEmily Dark. Jon Manley, science teacher at the Contoocook Valley, is \nthe coach for the team.\n  The students train very hard every year for this competition. This is \nthe second year in a row that Contoocook Valley Regional High School \nhas won this competition. They will soon be traveling to Washington, \nD.C. to compete in the nationals.\n  As a former high school teacher, I appreciate the hard work the \nstudents and the coach have dedicated to this team effort. I look \nforward to their visit to Washington and wish them the best of luck.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nWayne County Medical Society, which is celebrating its sesquicentennial \nanniversary on April 14, 1999. The Wayne County Medical Society has \nbeen an important part of the Metro Detroit community for the past 150 \nyears.\n  The Wayne County Medical Society was formed in 1849 with 50 \nphysicians, who committed themselves to providing the best quality \nmedical care to the people of Wayne County. The Society has been \nengaged in many important public health campaigns throughout its \nhistory. One of the most notable examples was the Society's massive \npolio immunization drive of 1964, led by Dr. Francis P. Rhoades, which \nvirtually eliminated the disease from the City of Detroit.\n  Today, the 4,200 members of the Wayne County Medical Society work \ntogether to provide free health care services for people in need. The \nSociety maintains a free medical and dental clinic in Detroit, where \nneedy children receive physical exams, health education and dental \ntreatment. The Society also sponsors an annual Christmas party for \nchildren in foster care. In 1998, the Wayne County Medical Society held \na conference for more than 500 Detroit Public School children on the \nsubject of teen pregnancy. In addition to its public service endeavors, \nthe Society encourages excellence in health care by offering Continuing \nMedical Education credits to its members and by joining with the \nMichigan State Medical Society and the American Medical Association to \npromote issues of importance to the medical community at large.\n  Mr. President, the Wayne County Medical Society has been a valued \nmember of the Metro Detroit community since 1849. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in thanking the members of the Society for their \ncommitment, and in wishing them continued success as they address the \nhealth needs of the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3540-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3540-S3542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SUBMISS: PART III\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I wish to have printed in \nthe Record the final portion of Mark A. Bradley's award winning article \non the disappearance of the U.S.S. Scorpion. I have had the previous \ntwo parts of this article printed in the last two Records. I would like \nto applaud Mr. Bradley once more for his outstanding achievements, and \nthank him for serving as a loyal and valued member of my staff.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Submiss: The Mysterious Death of the U.S.S. ``SCORPION'' (SSN 589), \n                                Part III\n\n                          (By Mark A. Bradley)\n\n       Such dire predictions prompted Admiral David McDonald, then \n     Chief of Naval Operations, to follow Admiral Schade's request \n     and approve the development and testing of the experimental \n     ``Planned or Reduced Availability'' overhaul concept in the \n     submarine fleet. In a June 17, 1966, message to the \n     commanders of both the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets, he \n     wrote that in response to ``concerns about [the] percent [of] \n     SSN off-line time due to length of shipyard overhauls, [I \n     have] requested NAVSHIPS develop [a] program to test `Planned \n     Availability' concept with U.S.S. Scorpion (SSN 589) and \n     U.S.S. Tinosa (SSN 606). On July 20, 1966, he officially \n     approved the Scorpion's participation in this program which \n     aimed at providing the service's submarines with shorter and \n     cheaper but more frequent overhauls between missions. An \n     undated and unsigned confidential memorandum entitled \n     ``Submarine Safety Program Status Report'' summarizes what \n     lay behind the creation of this new concept: ``The deferral \n     of SUBSAFE certification work during certain submarine \n     overhauls was necessitated by the need to reduce submarine \n     off-line time by minimizing the time spent in overhaul and to \n     achieve a more timely delivery of submarines under \n     construction by making more of the industrial capacity \n     available to new construction.''\n       Admiral Moorer, who succeeded Admiral McDonald as CNO, \n     expanded upon what he hoped this new plan would accomplish in \n     a September 6, 1967, letter to Congressman William Bates. In \n     that letter, he stated that ``it is the policy of the Navy to \n     provide submarines that have been delivered without \n     certification with safety certification modifications during \n     regular overhauls. However, urgent operational commitments \n     sometimes dictate that some items of the full safety \n     certification package be deferred until a subsequent overhaul \n     in order to reduce the time spent in overhaul, thus \n     shortening off-line time and increasing operational \n     availability. In these cases, a minimum package of submarine \n     safety work items is authorized which provides enhanced \n     safety but results in certification for unrestricted \n     operations to a depth shallower than the designed test \n     depth.'' According to an April 5, 1968 confidential \n     memorandum, the Navy did not expect the Scorpion to be fully \n     certified under SUBSAFE until 1974, six years after she was \n     lost.\n       On February 1, 1967, the Scorpion entered the Norfolk yard \n     and began her ``Reduced Availability'' overhaul. By the time \n     she sailed out on October 6, she had received the cheapest \n     submarine overhaul in United States Navy history. Originally \n     scheduled for more extensive reconditioning, the Scorpion was \n     further hurt by manpower and material shortages in the yard \n     because of the overhaul of the U.S.S. Skate (SSN 578), \n     Norfolk's first of a nuclear submarine. This retrofit had \n     gobbled up both workmen and resources at an unprecedented \n     rate. This meant that a submarine tender--a maintenance \n     ship--and the Scorpion's own crew had to perform most of the \n     work normally done by yard workers. She received little more \n     than the emergency repairs required to get her back to sea \n     and the refueling of her reactor. Out of the $3.2 million \n     spent on her during these eight months, $2.3 million went \n     into refueling and altering her nuclear reactor. A standard \n     submarine overhaul of this era lasted almost two years and \n     cost over $20 million.\n       When the Scorpion left Norfolk on February 15, 1968, on her \n     Mediterranean deployment she was a last minute replacement \n     for the U.S.S. Sea Wolf (SSN 575), which had collided with \n     another vessel in Boston Harbor. During her last deployment, \n     the Scorpion had 109 work orders still unfilled--one was for \n     a new trash disposal unit latch--and she still lacked a \n     working emergency blow system and decentralized emergency \n     sea water shutoff valves. She also suffered from chronic \n     problems in her hydraulics. This system operated both her \n     stern and sail planes, wing-like structures that \n     controlled her movement. This problem came to the \n     forefront in early and mid-November 1967 during the \n     Scorpion test voyage to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin \n     Islands as she began violently to corkscrew in the water. \n     Although she was put back in dry dock, this problem \n     remained unsolved. On February 16, 1968, she lost over \n     1,500 gallons of oil from her conning tower as she sailed \n     out of Hampton Roads toward the Mediterranean. By that \n     time, she was called ``U.S.S. Scrapiron'' by many of her \n     crew.\n       On May 23, 1993, the Houston Chronicle published an article \n     that highlighted these mechanical problems. The article \n     quoted from letters mailed home from doomed crew members who \n     complained about these deficiencies. In one of these, \n     Machinist's Mate Second Class David Burton Stone wrote that \n     the crew had repaired, replaced or jury-\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\n     rigged every piece of the Scorpion equipment. Commander \n     Slattery also was worried about her mechanical reliability. \n     On March 23, 1968, he drafted an emergency request for \n     repairs that warned, among other things, that ``the hull was \n     in a very poor state of preservation''--the Scorpion had been \n     forced to undergo an emergency drydocking in New London \n     immediately after her reduced overhaul because of this--and \n     bluntly stated that ``[d]elay of the work an additional year \n     could seriously jeopardize the Scorpion material readiness.'' \n     He was particularly concerned about a series of leaking \n     valves that caused the Scorpion to be restricted to an \n     operating depth of just 300 feet, 200 less than SUBSAFE \n     restrictions and 400 less than her pre-Thresher standards.\n       This portrait is sharply at odds with the one the Navy \n     painted after the Scorpion was lost. From the outset, the \n     service claimed the submarine was in excellent mechanical \n     condition. At his first press conference on May 27, 1968, \n     Admiral Moorer told the gathered newsmen that the Scorpion \n     had not reported any mechanical problems and that she was not \n     headed home for any repairs. This was followed by other Navy \n     statements that claimed the Scorpion suffered only from a \n     minor hydraulic leak and scarred linoleum on her deck before \n     her Mediterranean deployment. On May 29, however, then \n     Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford pointedly asked the \n     Navy's high command for information about the Scorpion's \n     participation in SUBSAFE, her overhaul status in general and \n     any known mechanical deficiencies.\n       The Court of Inquiry did not ignore these questions and \n     asked several of its witnesses what they knew about the \n     Scorpion's mechanical condition and her maintenance history. \n     Vice Admiral Schade told the Court that her overall condition \n     was above average and that her problems were normal \n     reoccurring maintenance items. He added that the Scorpion \n     suffered from no known material problems that affected her \n     ability to operate effectively. Schade's testimony was \n     supported by Captain C.N. Mitchell, the Deputy Chief of Staff \n     for Logistics and Management and a member of the Vice \n     Admiral's staff. Mitchell testified about the Scorpion's \n     Reduced Availability overhaul and stated that she was in \n     ``good material condition.''\n       Captain Jared E. Clarke, III, the commander of Submarine \n     Squadron 6, also told the Court the Scorpion was sound and \n     ``combat ready.'' In his testimony he said, ``I know of \n     nothing about her material condition upon her departure for \n     the Mediterranean that in any way represented an unsafe \n     condition.'' When asked about the Scorpion's lack of an \n     operable emergency blow system, Clarke replied that this was \n     not a concern because her other blow systems were more than \n     adequate to meet the depth restrictions she was operating \n     under.\n       Admiral Austin also summoned the two surviving crew members \n     the Scorpion had offloaded for medical and family reasons on \n     the night of May 16, 1968. When asked about any material \n     problems, crewman Joseph W. Underwood told the Court that he \n     knew of no deficiencies other than ``a couple of hydraulic \n     problems.'' Similarly, crewman Bill G. Elrod testified the \n     submarine was operating smoothly with high morale. When asked \n     to speculate on what did happen, Elrod could not. After \n     hearing all this testimony, the Court determined that the \n     Scorpion's loss had nothing to do with her lack of a full \n     SUBSAFE package and that both here ability to overcome \n     flooding and her material condition were ``excellent.'' \n     Although at least one of the dead crewmen's families sent \n     their son's letters spelling out the Scorpion's poor state of \n     repair to the Navy, there is no evidence the Court ever \n     received or considered them.\n       Whatever the truth, the Scorpion's loss triggered neither \n     the klieg lights of the national media nor the congressional \n     investigations that followed the Thresher's demise. Lost \n     somewhere in the murky twilight among the North Koreans' \n     seizure of the U.S.S. Pueblo and the Tet offensive that \n     January and the assassinations of Martin Luther King that \n     April and Robert Kennedy that June, the Scorpion's death \n     failed to arouse much interest in a nation whose streets were \n     on fire and whose very fiber was being ripped apart by an \n     increasingly unpopular and bloody war in Vietnam. With \n     phrases like ``body count'' and acronyms like ``MIA'' and \n     ``KIA'' becoming part of the national vernacular, the loss of \n     one nuclear submarine and her crew of 99 men hardly made a \n     ripple.\n       The Navy added to the country's amnesia by conducting its \n     inquiries under a cloak of extraordinary secrecy. Even now, \n     much about the Scorpion's fate remains highly classified and \n     beyond the public's reach, and the crew's 64 windows and over \n     100 children know little more today about what happened to \n     their husbands and fathers than they did 30 years ago. This \n     gap between what is known and what is not has spawned many \n     conspiracy theories. The most popular is that the Soviets \n     finished the Scorpion in an underwater dogfight.\n       This theory had some credibility after the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation arrested master spy John Walker on May 20, \n     1985. Walker, a U.S. Navy warrant officer and the leader of a \n     Soviet-sponsored spy right for almost 20 years, did enormous \n     damage to America's security by giving his KGB masters many \n     of the Navy's most closely guarded secrets. On May 20, 1968, \n     he was working as a watch officer in the Navy's closely \n     guarded submarine message center in Norfolk. Although there \n     is evidence to believe that Walker gave the Soviets \n     intelligence about the Atlantic Submarine Force, particularly \n     about its coded communications, there is nothing to suggest \n     that he played any direct in the Scorpion's demise.\n       He appears to have played a much more important role when \n     he passed on to his Russian handlers much of the top secret \n     traffic that came through the message center immediately \n     after the submarine was reported lost. This highly classified \n     information included how the Navy conducted its search, what \n     the U.S. intelligence community knew about the Soviet vessels \n     operating off the Canary Islands, what part SOSUS had played \n     in detecting the disaster and what the service's main \n     theories were for the Scorpion's loss. While it is tempting \n     to blame the Soviets and Walker for this disaster, the \n     probable truth is far different but no less disturbing.\n       Although the theory of a weapons accident on board the \n     Scorpion has officially never been discounted, the physical \n     evidence does not seem to support it. None of the thousands \n     of photographs taken of the wreckage show any torpedo damage \n     nor does the Scorpion's approximately 3,000 feet by 1,800 \n     feet debris field contain any items from her torpedo room as \n     would be expected if that area had suffered a major \n     explosion. All the debris is from her operations center, the \n     locus of her galley and above her huge battery.\n       The more likely cause of the Scorpion's death lies in the \n     Navy's failure to absorb the lessons learned from the \n     Thresher. Hyman Rickover, the father of the Navy's nuclear \n     program, warned after that disaster that another would occur \n     if the service did not correct the inadequate design, poor \n     fabrication methods and inadequate inspections that caused \n     it. Through SUBSAFE, the Navy instituted a program to correct \n     these and maintain and build a nuclear submarine fleet that \n     was both safe and effective. Unfortunately, the strains of \n     competing with the Soviets in the Cold War while fighting an \n     actual one in Vietnam derailed this concept and forced the \n     service to look for ways to decrease the off-line time of the \n     submarines it already had while freeing its already choked \n     yards to build more.\n       The Reduced Availability concept arose from these pressures \n     and allowed the Navy to defer what the Thresher taught could \n     not be delayed. Through an accident of timing, the Scorpion \n     was the first nuclear submarine chosen for this program. She \n     was selected because her next regulatory scheduled overhaul \n     was predicted to set a record in duration, and the Navy's \n     high command believed that the work she received during her \n     1963-1964 reconditioning in Charleston provided enough of a \n     safety margin to see her through until her next overhauls. \n     She also was chosen because her 1967 overhaul came due during \n     a time when the service was feeling enormous pressure to \n     compete with the Soviets and reduce the amount of time its \n     submarines and yards were tied up with safety retrofits.\n       Rushed to the Mediterranean after the cheapest overhaul in \n     U.S. nuclear submarine history and lacking full SUBSAFE \n     certification, the Scorpion's mechanical condition and safety \n     capabilities were far from what the Navy advertised. A trash \n     disposal unit flood could have set into train a deadly chain \n     of events that triggered a succession of material and \n     systemic failures in an already weakened submarine that left \n     her unable to recover. Although the Court doubted that a \n     hydrogen gas explosion from the Scorpion's battery could have \n     generated enough force to rupture her hull, it did not \n     consider its exploding after being swamped with cold sea \n     water from uncontrollable flooding and filling her with \n     deadly chlorine gas.\n       Even under the best of circumstances, the submarine force \n     was a dangerous place to serve in the 1960s. Its sailors and \n     officers often were engaged in extremely hazardous missions \n     in warships that were like no others that had come before \n     them. With far greater speeds, diving capabilities and \n     complex operating systems, nuclear submarines required far \n     greater care in their construction and maintenance than their \n     diesel predecessors. This was the key lesson from the \n     Thresher and if may well have taken the loss of the Scorpion \n     finally to hammer home this point to the Navy's high command.\n       After this tragedy, the Navy quietly dropped the Reduced \n     Availability concept. In a May 21, 1995, article published by \n     the Houston Chronicle, the Naval Sea Systems Command stated \n     that it had no record of any such maintenance program. The \n     reason for this may lie in a March 25, 1966, confidential \n     memorandum from the Submarine Force: [The] ``success of this \n     `major-minor' overhaul concept depends essentially on the \n     results of our first case at hand: Scorpion.'' Although the \n     cause of her death is still officially listed as unknown, the \n     United States has never lost another nuclear submarine.\n\n\n                           a note on sources\n\n       In the 30 years since the Scorpion's loss, not one book has \n     been written on her. The only newspaper articles written \n     about her are eight by Ed Offley for the Virginian-Pilot & \n     Ledger-Star and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and four \n     written by Stephen Johnson for the Houston Chronicle. The \n     most important primary sources are the U.S. Navy Court of \n     Inquiry Record of Proceedings and the Supplementary Record of \n     Proceedings. In addition, the Naval Historical Center has \n     over 11 boxes of Scorpion material currently available to \n     researchers and expects to have more as already declassified \n     material is cataloged. These boxes include the sanitized\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\n     testimony of many of the witnesses who appeared before the \n     two courts of inquiry. Although the Chief of Naval Operations \n     currently is considering releasing more of the Navy's \n     Scorpion material, much still remains beyond the reach of \n     researchers and the Freedom of Information Act. On December \n     19, 1997, the Navy denied my attempt to get copies of the \n     first Court of Inquiry's Annex. Those documents still retain \n     their top secret rating and are withheld because ``of \n     information that is classified in the interest of national \n     defense and foreign policy.''\n       The most useful books for this article have been the \n     following:\n       On submarines, Modern Submarine Warfare by David Miller and \n     John Jordan, New York: Military Press (1987); Jane's Pocket \n     Book of Submarine Development, ed.

Vice Admiral Robert F. Fountain (Ret), a former \n     executive officer on the Scorpion, very kindly consented to \n     an interview as did Rear Admiral Hank McKinney (Ret), the \n     former commander of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Submarine Force.\n       In May 1998, the Chief of Naval Operations declassified a \n     1970 study undertaken by a specially appointed Structural \n     Analysis Group that pointed to a battery casualty as the most \n     likely cause for the Scorpion's loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3542-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SENATOR KENNEDY AND THE AMERICAN IRELAND FUND AWARD\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on March 16, the American Ireland \nFund hosted a dinner to honor Senator Edward Kennedy and his \nlongstanding efforts to promote peaceful and constructive change \nthroughout Ireland. The individuals that gathered together that night--\nTaoiseach Bertie Ahearn, Nobel Prize Winners John Hume and David \nTrimble, Sinn Fein Leader Gerry Adams, Secretary of State for Northern \nIreland Mo Mowlan, among many others--are the best indication of the \nsignificant progress that has been made to replace violence and \nmistrust with cooperation and dialogue. It is also an indication of the \nIrish community's high esteem for Senator Kennedy and his key role in \nbringing the parties to the negotiating table. While differences still \nimpede full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, pride in \nIreland's past and present, and a strong commitment to a peaceful and \nprosperous future was the common bond that united all of those in \nattendance on the eve of Saint Patrick's Day.\n  Mr. President, Senator Christopher Dodd was among those who \nintroduced Senator Kennedy that night, and I ask that Senator Dodd's \ninsightful remarks from the evening be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       Members of the clergy, leaders of Ireland--both north and \n     south--with a particularly warm welcome to the Taoiseach, \n     Bertie Ahern, my colleagues from Congress, members of the \n     diplomatic corps, members of the Kennedy family--Eunice \n     Kennedy Shriver, Ethel Kennedy, my colleague in the House of \n     Representatives, Patrick Kennedy, and a special welcome to \n     the former American Ambassador, Jean Kennedy Smith, and a \n     warm welcome to the light of our honoree's eyes, Vicki \n     Kennedy; distinguished guests and friends, and, while he is \n     not with us this evening, a particularly warm greeting to the \n     President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton; \n     and, last but not least, our honoree, the recipient of the \n     National Leadership Award, my colleague and best friend in \n     the Senate, Ted Kennedy.\n       At the outset, I want to commend the American Ireland Fund \n     for the marvelous work it has done on behalf of the people of \n     Ireland;\n       Secondly, I want to pay a special tribute to the two most \n     recent recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize who are with us \n     this evening and ask you to join me in expressing our \n     admiration for the work that these two men have done for \n     peace in Northern Ireland and will continue to do--John Hume \n     and David Trimble.\n       As we gather here tonight on the Eve of Saint Patrick's Day \n     to honor Ted Kennedy with the International Leadership Award, \n     I want to begin by recalling the ancient Kennedy/Fitzgerald \n     Gaelic Prayer:\n\n     For you who are with us, may God turn your fortunes bright;\n     For you who are against us, may God turn your hearts toward \n           us;\n     And if God cannot turn your hearts, may He at least turn your \n           ankles,\n     So we may know you by your limp!\n\n       I have the unique pleasure of presenting to you tonight a \n     man with whom I have served in the United States Senate for \n     nearly twenty years.\n       Most of you know the classic story of success in American \n     politics:\n       Born of a poor and obscure family; deprived of all but the \n     barest necessities; forced to quit school to support the \n     family and finally overcoming all odds working his way \n     through College by waiting tables in the cafeteria.\n       You know that story. So does Ted Kennedy. But he never let \n     it get in the way. He knew there was another way to do \n     things. And somehow even through he did none of those things, \n     he got elected to the Senate in 1962 when the previous \n     Senator changed his address. And for these past 37 years what \n     a record he has compiled.\n       He was a friend of Ireland when friends of Ireland were \n     few. In fact, he--and his family--have presided so long and \n     so firmly at the confluence of Ireland and America that a \n     writer in the Irish Times recently observed that it was \n     sometimes difficult to tell whether Senator Kennedy's \n     distinguished sister was the United States' Ambassador to \n     Ireland or Ireland's Ambassador to the United States.\n       There is a reason for this, and it's quite simple. \n     Throughout the adult lives of most people in this room, Ted \n     Kennedy has worked unremittingly, day in and day out, to \n     better the lot of the least fortunate of our fellow men and \n     women. Ted Kennedy's efforts regularly reach across the \n     borders of nation, race and religion.\n       It was only natural, then, that the conflict and injustice \n     in Northern Ireland would make a claim on Senator Kennedy's \n     conscience. His unceasing interest in achieving peace in \n     Northern Ireland was, and is, the one constant over the many \n     ups and downs on the still fragile road to resolving that \n     conflict.\n       Ted Kennedy's efforts to find the path to peace have not \n     been limited by the category of nationality. He labors not \n     only as a distinguished representative of the United States, \n     and a loyal son of Ireland, but as an ambassador from what \n     the Irish poet Seamus Heaney refers to as ``the Republic of \n     Conscience.''\n       ``The Republic of Conscience'', according to Heaney's poem \n     of that name, is a quiet place, and one where you might meet \n     some of your ancestors. According to Heaney's narrator:\n\n     When I landed in the Republic of Conscience;\n     It was so noiseless when the engines stopped;\n     I could hear a curlew high above the runway.\n     At Immigration, the clerk was an old man;\n     Who produced a wallet from his homespun coat;\n     And showed me a photograph of my grandfather.\n\n       When Heaney's narrator was leaving the republic, that old \n     man told him what all of us here tonight would tell Senator \n     Kennedy, namely that he is a ``dual citizen'' and, therefore, \n     on permanent assignment. Heaney's narrator put it this way: \n     The Republic of Conscience\n\n     . . . Desired me when I got home;\n     To consider myself a representative;\n     And to speak on their behalf in my own tongue.\n     Their embassies, he said, were everywhere;\n     But operated independently;\n     And no Ambassador would ever be relieved.\n\n       Teddy, you will never be relieved of your portfolio to \n     speak on behalf of the ``Republic of Conscience'' for the \n     rights of those least able to speak for themselves, and to \n     continue your splendid work in furthering peace and \n     reconciliation in Ireland and in the United States.\n       Reflecting on the way you have led so many of your \n     colleagues over so many years--many of whom are here \n     tonight--down the tortured path that must inevitably lead to \n     peace, I am reminded of the figure of the great Irish poet, \n     William Butler Yeats, standing amidst the portraits of his \n     contemporaries in the Dublin Municipal Gallery of Art, and \n     urging history to judge him not on this or that isolated deed \n     but to:\n\n     Think where man's glory most begins and ends;\n     And say my glory was I had such friends.\n\n       I know that all of us here tonight are proud to say that it \n     is our glory to have you, Teddy, as our friend, and \n     unstinting friend of the United States, an unwavering friend \n     of Ireland, and an Ambassador from the ``Republic of \n     Conscience'' who will never be relieved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3542-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3542-S3543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPPORT FOR U.S. TROOPS IN KOSOVO\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, yesterday, American men and women \njoined their military counterparts from 18 NATO countries in attacking \nthe forces of Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia. I had hoped that recent \ndiplomatic efforts by the United States and others would have led \ninstead to a peace agreement in the Balkans. However, Slobodan \nMilosevic's continued aggression toward Kosovar Albanians and his \nunwillingness to seek a lasting peace could no longer go unchecked.\n  My wife and I know first hand what thousands of American families are\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nfeeling today, seeing their husbands, wives, sons, or daughters in the \nmilitary travel overseas to face combat. My son, Brooks, recently \nreturned from a tour of duty with the U.S. Army in Bosnia where he was \npart of the multi-national effort to maintain peace in that war-torn \ncountry. The decision to commit U.S. troops overseas is never easy, nor \nshould it be done without a clear understanding of our country's \ninterests and goals. In the case of Kosovo, our country's interests are \nclear and warrant the current military action. A lasting peace is \ndirectly linked with stability in Europe, and it is our duty to \nparticipate in a multi-national effort to prevent the ethnic cleansing \ncurrently occurring in Kosovo.\n  This century's major wars started in the Balkans. Hundreds of \nthousands of Americans and millions of others around the world died as \na result of conflict in this region. Slobodan Milosevic directly \nthreatens the current political and economic stability of Europe, and \ntoday's military action against Milosevic is necessary to prevent an \ninevitable escalation of violence. The fighting in Kosovo could easily \nspread to neighboring Montenegro, Macedonia, and Albania, and has \nalready destabilized the region. A sea of ethnic Albanian refugees have \nattempted to flee Kosovo, only to be denied entry in some countries \nwhile further straining age-old tensions in others. There is an \nundeniable possibility for widespread conflict among Kosovo's \nneighbors, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece, and it is in our national \nstrategic interest to prevent a fourth Balkan war.\n  The United States and NATO have an opportunity to stop the cold \nblooded murders of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Since \nSlobodan Milosevic began his reign of terror against Albanians in \nKosovo, over 250,000 people--10 percent of the population--have been \nforced from their homes. Another 170,000 have fled the Yugoslav \nprovince in the past year. Milosevic's police forces and military have \nburned homes, preventing the return of entire villages. The reports of \natrocities by Milosevic against the ethnic Albanians are sickening and \ninvoke images of Bosnia and Nazi Germany. Since the first massacre of \nethnic Albanians at Drenica, last year, thousands more ethnic Albanians \nhave been killed by Serb paramilitary units and the Yugoslav Army, \nincluding the January 16 discovery of 45 slaughtered ethnic Albanians \nin the Kosovo village of Racak.\n  While I support air strikes now to prevent further bloodshed, I will \ncontinue to promote diplomatic efforts to ultimately resolve this \ncrisis in Kosovo. This multi-national military action will illustrate \nto Slobodan Milosevic the resolve of all democratic nations in the \nworld to reject oppression, and it is my hope that Slobodan Milosevic \nwill bring the people of Yugoslavia back from the brink of one man's \nmadness.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with our men and women overseas and their \nfamilies here at home. I fully support their efforts to bring peace and \nstability to the region and wish them all a quick and safe return \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3543-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNITION OF THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS COUNCIL 414\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nKnights of Columbus Council 414, of Bay City, Michigan. Council 414 is \ncelebrating its 100th anniversary on April 16, 1999.\n  The history of the Knights of Columbus stretches back 117 years, when \nFather Michael J. McGivney founded the fraternal order in 1882. Since \nthe order's founding, Knights of Columbus have promoted the Catholic \nfaith and have practiced the principles of charity, unity and \nfraternity. When Father McGivney passed away in 1890, there were 5,000 \nKnights of Columbus located in 57 councils in Connecticut and Rhode \nIsland. Just 15 years after his death, the Knights of Columbus was \nestablished in every state of the union, as well as in Canada, Mexico \nand the Philippines.\n  Bay City Council 414, known then as Valley Council 414, was \nestablished in 1899, 17 years after the founding of the order by Father \nMcGivney. It is the third oldest Knights of Columbus council in the \nState of Michigan. The driving force behind the founding of Council 414 \nwas Edward J. Schreiber. He and 48 other men were responsible for \nestablishing Council 414's charter, which was issued on April 16, 1899.\n  Since its chartering, Council 414 has helped to establish other \nKnights of Columbus councils in the area, and has participated in the \nmany community service activities for which the Knights of Columbus are \nrenowned. Perhaps most notably, Council 414's members raise money each \nyear in ``Tootsie Roll Drives'' to support organizations like Special \nOlympics, the Bay Arenac School District and special education \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, the members of the Knights of Columbus Council 414 of \nBay City, Michigan, are truly deserving of recognition for their \ncentury-long dedication to promoting the teachings of the Catholic \nChurch, and for living those teachings by serving those in need in \ntheir community.

Mr. President, last year the New York Yankees set \na new baseball record--125 wins in a single season, the most ever in \nmajor league history. Today, I want to speak about another--sadder and \nmore tragic--legacy that has befallen current and former members of \nthis great baseball team. That legacy is cancer.\n  We remember that the house that Ruth built lost its founder, the \ngreat Bambino, ``the sultan of swat,'' to cancer. During last year's \nseason, Darryl Strawberry was stricken with colon cancer. Former \nGeneral Manager Bob Watson is battling prostate cancer. Earlier this \nmonth, Joe DiMaggio lost his life to lung cancer. And recently we \nlearned that Yankee manager, Joe Torre, is another victim of prostate \ncancer.\n  I join millions of New Yorkers--and millions of Americans--in wishing \nJoe Torre a continued recovery, who joins a team of almost 200,000 \nAmerican men who will learn they have prostate cancer in 1999. It is \nthe most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in this country. And, like \nother cancers, prostate cancer must be stopped. For, it will claim the \nlives of nearly 40,000 Americans this year. My own state, New York, has \nthe third highest rate of diagnoses and deaths due to prostate cancer.\n  Unfortunately, this country invests only about one of every twenty \ncancer research dollars trying to stem the epidemic of prostate cancer, \nwhich accounts for about one in every six cancer cases. It is a \ndisproportion that\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\nmust be corrected, Mr. President. On behalf of Joe Torre, Bob Watson, \nSenator Bob Dole, General Norman Schwarzkopf, Andy Grove, Harry \nBelafonte--and millions of other men and their families whose lives \nhave been affected by prostate cancer--now is the time to renew those \nefforts.\n  I am pleased that Congress established a prostate cancer research \nprogram in the Department of Defense in 1996. I supported the \nestablishment of that program, just as I supported last year's increase \nin funding of the National Institutes of Health, with strong language \nto assure that $175 million become dedicated to prostate cancer \nresearch in 1999.\n  We must continue to develop these critical research initiatives. I \ncongratulate Senators Stevens, Inouye and many others in the Senate for \ntheir championship of the important program at the Department of \nDefense, and I hope to work with you to help fully fund this program \nover the next three years. We must work collaboratively with NIH to \naccelerate their sponsorship of clinical prostate cancer research, and \nI look forward to reports, due next month, by the NCI and NIH directors \nabout their five-year investment strategy for prostate cancer research. \nEven though this year promises some daunting budget challenges, we must \nnot let our commitment to end the war on cancer waver.\n  One in six American men will develop prostate cancer in his lifetime. \nAs frightening as that statistic may be for the general population, it \nis even more pointed in the African-American community. African-\nAmericans have the highest rates of prostate cancer incidence and \nmortality in the world, with occurrences 35% higher than among \nCaucasians and death rates twice higher than white males.\n  The battle that Joe Torre faced gives testimony to the fact that \nprostate cancer does not affect men only in their retirement years. \nAbout 25% of cases occur in men younger than 65 years old, and, with \nthe aging of our baby boom generation, we can fully expect both \nincidence and mortality to increase if the disease is unchecked.\n  Mr. President, I call on our membership to join with national \norganizations, like the National Prostate Cancer Coalition, CaP CURE, \nthe American Cancer Society and 100 Black Men, and take action to end \nthe toll prostate cancer takes on American men and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3544-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STRENGTHENING OUR FRONTLINES\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this week, Senator Graham \nof Forida and I introduced a bill to revitalize and modernize our \nefforts to defend U.S. borders from drug traffickers. This bill, the \n``Comprehensive Border Protection Act'', S. 689, is part of a bi-\npartisan effort by Congress to provide the resources for this critical \neffort. Its goal is to stop dangerous drugs and other contraband from \nreaching our streets. Last year, we took an important step in this \ndirection with increased funding for our counter-drug efforts in the \nWestern Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. As needed as that funding was, \nwe left something undone.\n  One of the critical frontline agencies in our counter-drug efforts in \nthe U.S. Customs Service. Despite the fact that trade has increased \nexponentially in the last several years, we have not provided the \nresources to expand the ability of Customs to manage this increased \nvolume. Every year, more than the total population of the United States \ncrosses our borders. In practice, that means more than 400 million \npeople annually coming into our airports, across our land borders, and \ninto our seaports. Nearly 15 million containers enter our ports. Some \n125 million privately owned vehicles come into the country. That is \nevery year. To deal with this volume, Customs has fewer than 20,000 \nemployees and equipment that is outdated.\n  Most of this traffic is legal. But criminal gangs, terrorists, and \ndrug traffickers willfully and cynically seek to hide their illegal \nacts in this flow. They use every means that vast resources and \nruthless intent puts into their hands to commit their crimes. And they \nhave increasingly sophisticated means to conceal their illegal \nactivities. Short of sealing our borders to all trade and financial \ntransactions, we must depend upon agencies like Customs to secure our \nborders We must, however, do this while facilitating the flow of people \nand legitimate trade. It is a daunting task.\n  Recognizing that our borders were under intense pressure from illegal \nalien smuggling, the Congress increased the resources to the \nImmigration Service. We almost doubled that agency's capacity. The \nchallenge facing Customs is far greater. Yet, we have not provided the \nresources, the technological improvements, or the support that is \nneeded to get the job done.\n  We have not given our men and women who do this job the support that \nthe task requires. And it is a demanding and dangerous job. It's not \nglamorous to spend hours a day at a major U.S. port of entry watching \ntens of thousands of vehicles and people cross the border. It's a \nlonely and risky livelihood to patrol long stretches of our border. The \nlong hours spent in undercover investigations and in analyzing reams of \ninformation go largely unnoticed. But being out of sight should not put \ntheir efforts or why they are undertaken out of mind.\n  That is what the legislation that we are offering today aims to do--\nto remind us of what we must be doing and to give the tools and support \nneeded to do the job to those we ask to do it. I have for the passed \nseveral years urged the Administration to provide Congress with a \ncomprehensive plan. We know that drug thugs have no respect for \nnational sovereignty, for the rule of law, or for international \nborders. These criminal gangs are ruthless and shrewd. And they are \nflexible. We have to be flexible also.\n  I have repeatedly noted that we need to develop a capacity to guard \nour borders with flexibility and forethought. Too often we simply \nreact. We respond to a threat in one area only to find the traffickers \nhave switched tactics. We need a comprehensive approach and a \nsustainable plan. Such a plan, however, has not been forthcoming. For \ntoo long, we have been merely reactive to the initiative of \ntraffickers, moving resources around to meet their latest tactic. We \nneed to be anticipating their efforts and we need to be comprehensive. \nThat is why this legislation addresses both our northern and southern \nborders, our ports and airports and our coastlines. We need the \nintelligence and investigative resources to focus our efforts. And we \nneed that consistency of purpose and sustained effort that \ncharacterizes resolve. We cannot affort to be less committed in our \npurpose than drug traffickers are in theirs. We must not be any less \ncomprehensive.\n  While this bill is not the whole solution to our quest for a coherent \nand comprehensive approach, it is an important step. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House to join us in making this effort \na reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3544-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3544-S3545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PENSION COVERAGE AND PORTABILITY ACT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, most people my age have known the \nheartache of having to watch their parents grow old. It is a sad day in \na person's life when they see their father get his first gray hair. Or \nthe day you notice lines in your mother's face where previously, there \nwere none.\n  This aging process is made worse by the scary and very real \npossibility that too many people who will become senior citizens in the \nnext several years are not at all prepared for the transition from work \nto retirement.\n  To be honest, it isn't our parents who we need to worry about so \nmuch. They survived the Depression. They know what it takes to get by \nduring the lean years--it takes planning and saving. Putting money \naside, when it might be easier to spend it in the moment.\n  Those are the values that our parents live by. They are the values we \nwould do well to heed. And even better to teach those who will follow \nus.\n  We as a nation have lost our imperative to save. Personal savings \nrates have dropped to one-half of one percent of our Gross Domestic \nProduct, the lowest since 1933.\n  Fifty-one million Americans in our nation's workforce have no pension \ncoverage. But statistics like those don't tell the whole story. They \ndon't do justice to the hardscrabble struggles\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\nthat real people go through every day. Struggles that involve agonizing \nquestions like: ``Should I eat today or take my medication?'' or ``Will \nI be able to heat my house this winter?''\n  Make no mistake, our nation's lack of saving for retirement is a \ntragedy in the making.\n  That is why I am so proud to join my colleagues in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  A bill that will make it easier for Americans to put money aside, and \na bill that will help move pension issues to the forefront of \nAmericans' minds. A bill that will:\n  Expand coverage for small businesses because they have a harder time \naffording health care and retirement plans;\n  Enhance pension fairness for women because they fall into categories \nthat have a harder time saving;\n  Increase the portability of pension plans so that when you change \njobs you don't have to worry about where your savings will go;\n  Strengthen pension security and enforcement so you can rest easy at \nnight, knowing your money is safe;\n  Reduce red tape so it's easier for employers to give their workers \nretirement options;\n  And encourage retirement education so that husbands and wives, \nparents and children, talk to each other-- make plans for their future. \nAnd know what to expect tomorrow and down the road.\n  One aspect of the bill I am particularly proud of are the small \nbusiness provisions. Thirty-eight million of the people in this country \nwho do not have a pension plan work at small businesses. Eighty percent \nof all small business employees have no pension coverage.\n  In my state of Montana, more than 95 percent of our businesses are \nsmall businesses. And almost 9 out of 10 offer no pension plans. We \ncannot let these hard-working Americans down.\n  Currently, most small businesses can't afford pension plans. They \nwould like to, but they just can't make ends meet.\n  Our bill makes it a smart business decision for small business owners \nto offer retirement plans.\n  I have made it my priority to work with members of the small business \ncommunity, both back in Montana and nationally, to identify legislative \nsolutions that will most readily enable small businesses to offer \npension plans to their employees. While this bill does not include \nevery recommendation we received, it does represent a collection of \nhigh-priority proposals which we believe could be supported by a bi-\npartisan majority of Congress.\n  The major provisions in this bill which would help small businesses \nstart and maintain pension plans include the following:\n  To help make pension plans more affordable we have included two new \ntax credits: one to help defray start-up costs and the other to defray \nthe cost of employer contributions to pension plans;\n  In addition, we provide for the elimination of some fees.\n  To address the problems the small business community has identified \nas a major impediment to establishing pension plans, we make \nsignificant changes in the top-heavy rules that limit employer \ncontributions to plans.\n  To address concerns of our smallest businesses, who want to provide \npensions but can only afford `start-up' plans at first, we provide \nincreases in income limits that apply to SIMPLE pension plans, along \nwith a new, salary-reduction SIMPLE plan;\n  And for those employers that want to provide the security of a \ndefined benefit plan for their employees but cannot because of the \nincreased regulatory burden, we create a simplified defined benefit \nplan for small business.\n  These provisions are designed to address the problems of cost and \ncomplexity that are a barrier to so many small businesses. They will \nhelp small employers establish a pattern of saving for themselves and \ntheir employees.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Pension Coverage and Portability Act will \nspearhead a national debate on how to improve employer-provided \npensions in this country.\n  This debate is essential if we are to achieve our goal of making \nAmerica in the next century, not only strong as a nation, but strong as \na community of individuals confident in the security of their financial \nfutures.\n  This is a good, bi-partisan bill. It takes the positive steps we as a \nnation need to put our future in safe hands.\n  I am eager for the coming debate on this bill.\n  I hope it sparks a debate in the coffee shops and kitchen tables all \nacross the country. Working together, and with this bill, we can turn a \nnation of spenders, into a nation of savers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3545-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL SCHOOL VIOLENCE VICTIMS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, school violence is a horrible, \nsenseless tragedy that must not continue. Last year's horrific \nshootings in Jonesboro, AR; Pakucah, KY; Pearl, MS; Richmond, VA; and \nEdinboro, PA, were meaningless acts of violence and should never have \noccurred. That's why I wholeheartedly support and have cosponsored \nNational School Violence Victims Memorial Day. This important \nresolution recognizes victims of school violence and encourages school \nadministrators to conduct programs on March 24 designed to help prevent \nfurther occurrences of school violence.\n  Mr. President, the statistics on school violence are truly \nfrightening. According to the National School Safety Center, there have \nbeen 225 school-associated violent deaths between July 1992 and June \n1998. What is going on in our classrooms that our Nation's youth feel \nlike the only way to resolve problems is through a gun? This resolution \nrecognizes victims of school violence and says to our children, that \nthere is a better way to resolve problems. By focusing community \nefforts on teaching students peaceful alternatives to conflict, we can \nequip our children to stop violent tendencies before they get out of \ncontrol. This resolution is a step in the right direction and I urge my \ncolleagues to put partisan politics aside and join me in encouraging \nlocal school districts and administrators to use their resources on \nviolence prevention programs. All of us--teachers, administrators, \nparents--must work together to show our children peaceful alternatives \nbefore violence erupts in our schools again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3545-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3545-S3546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADMINISTRATION LETTER REGARDING STEEL IMPORTS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, at the request of the \nAdministration, I ask unanimous consent that a letter received today \nfrom Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley and U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Charlene Barshefsky be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                        Secretary of Commerce,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: Following up on our testimony at \n     Tuesday's Senate Finance hearing on steel issues, we wanted \n     to apprise you of the most recent developments in our steel \n     policy and the effect on the steel industry. The President \n     and the Vice President are deeply concerned about the impact \n     on our steelworkers, communities, and companies of the recent \n     surge in steel imports, and they are fully and actively \n     committed to effectively addressing it. They are determined \n     to maintain the United States' strong manufacturing base and \n     the good jobs it provides by ensuring that our trading \n     partners play by the rules governing international trade.\n       This Administration has implemented a comprehensive \n     strategy that combines full and timely enforcement of our \n     trade laws, expedited administrative action, and intensified \n     engagement with major foreign steel producing nations to \n     address unfair trade practices injuring our steel industry \n     and its workers.\n       The import numbers for the past three months demonstrate \n     clearly that our strategy is producing results. The \n     preliminary data for February, released earlier today by the \n     Commerce Department, show that total steel imports in \n     February were 45 percent below November 1998 levels--and \n     reached the second lowest monthly level since April 1996. \n     Imports of hot-rolled steel have dropped 81 percent since \n     November. We will work to sustain the positive trends of the \n     past three months are sustained.\n       Our strategy has focused on Japan, Russia, and Korea, which \n     together accounted for 80 percent of the surge in steel \n     imports last year. Through strong public and private \n     statements by the President and other senior Administration \n     officials, we have put Japan on notice that we expect its \n     imports to reach pre-crisis levels, or we stand ready to take \n     appropriate action under our trade laws, including self-\n     initiation of trade cases. We\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\n     have, in addition, negotiated agreements with Russia that \n     will reduce our overall steel imports from Russia by almost \n     70 percent, and hot-rolled steel imports from Russia by \n     almost 90 percent this year. We have sought firm commitments \n     from Korea to ensure that its steel industry is fully \n     privatized and placed on a market footing, including through \n     the elimination of improper subsidies.\n       The declines in imports from these countries since November \n     have been dramatic. Hot-rolled exports from Russia fell from \n     over 600,000 metric tons in November to roughly ten tons in \n     February--a nearly 100 percent decline. Imports of hot-rolled \n     steel from Japan fell in that period from over 400,000 tons \n     to less than 5000 tons--a nearly 99 percent drop. Hot-\n     rolled imports from Korea dropped 35 percent since \n     November, while total steel imports from Korea are down 17 \n     percent. And total steel imports from Brazil, which, along \n     with those from Russia and Japan, are subject to an \n     ongoing antidumping investigation, have dropped 64 percent \n     since November.\n       The Department of Commerce has taken forceful steps to \n     eliminate dumping, including issuing critical circumstances \n     determinations only 45 days after initiating dumping \n     investigations on hot-rolled steel, a policy that could \n     result in retroactive application of dumping duties back to \n     last November. Last month, following an expedited \n     investigation, Commerce announced--a full month ahead of the \n     usual time schedule--preliminary determinations that \n     exporters in Japan, Russia and Brazil have dumped hot-rolled \n     steel into our market. The Commerce Department is currently \n     enforcing more than 100 antidumping and countervailing duty \n     orders and suspension agreements on steel products and is \n     currently conducting 45 new steel investigations.\n       We will continue to closely monitor steel imports, and--in \n     an unprecedented new policy--have made preliminary steel \n     import statistics available to the public up to 25 days \n     earlier than under past practice. This will help the \n     Administration, industry, and workers identify and respond to \n     import trends more quickly.\n       At the same time, last year's import surge demonstrated \n     that we need to look closely at our trade laws to ensure that \n     they deliver strong, effective relief in an expeditious \n     manner, while remaining consistent with our international \n     trade obligations. We believe the legislation introduced in \n     the House by Congressman Levin and Houghton constitutes a \n     constructive approach, and we stand ready to work with \n     Members of Congress to develop a bill we can recommend that \n     the President sign.\n       In contrast, we strongly oppose legislation mandating \n     quotas because it would constitute a violation of our \n     international obligations under the World Trade Organization \n     (WTO) and would not be in our nation's economic interest. We \n     are the world's largest exporter, and our firms and workers \n     benefit tremendously from the international trading rules we \n     helped put into place. Quotas or other import restraints \n     imposed outside of WTO-consistent processes contained our \n     trade laws (such as through our ``section 201'' safeguards \n     law or antidumping and countervailing duty laws) violate our \n     international trade obligations. Such quotas or import \n     restraints would not be based on a determination of whether \n     the imports are causing or threatening serious injury, or \n     whether unfair trade or subsidization is involved, as \n     required by the WTO and our laws.\n       Our current trade laws allow U.S. industry and workers to \n     seek such determinations, based upon which we can impose \n     quotas or other trade remedies consistent with our \n     international trade obligations. In addition, when the \n     procedures provided by our trade laws are followed, we can \n     take into account the full range of U.S. industry and worker \n     concerns and fashion remedies that do not result in \n     additional market distortions, import shortages, excessive \n     price hikes or retaliation that could harm U.S. export \n     industries and customers.\n       This Administration firmly believes that the best way to \n     address unfair trade practices or import surges is through \n     vigorous and timely enforcement and use of strong U.S. trade \n     laws that are consistent with our international obligations, \n     and we and our colleagues stand ready to work with you to \n     ensure that objective is fully realized.\n           Sincerely,\n     William M. Daley,\n       Secretary of Commerce.\n     Charlene Barshefsky,\n       U.S. Trade Representative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3546-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3546-S3548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE YEAR 2000 TECHNOLOGY \n                                PROBLEM\n\n Mr. BENNETT.

Failure to obtain counsel \n     shall not excuse the witness from appearing and testifying.\n       5. Transcript.--An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     closed and public hearings. Any witness shall be afforded, \n     upon request, the right to review that portion of such \n     record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony \n     in public or closed session shall be provided to the witness. \n     Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time limit set by \n     the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in \n     testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical \n     errors, and obvious errors of fact. The Chairman or a \n     designated staff officer shall rule on such requests.\n       6. Minority witnesses.--Whenever any hearing is conducted \n     by the Committee, the minority on the Committee shall be \n     entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority \n     Members to the Chairman, to call witnesses selected by the \n     minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration during at least one day \n     of the hearing. Such request must be made before the \n     completion of the hearing.\n       7. Conduct of witnesses, counsel and members of the \n     audience.--If, during public or executive sessions, a \n     witness, his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in \n     such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing, \n     the Chairman or presiding Member of the Committee present \n     during such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the \n     Senate, his representative, or any law enforcement official \n     to eject said person from the hearing room.\n\n\n                         VI.

Mr. President, I am very concerned about the \ndrastic cuts the Republican budget makes to our foreign affairs budget. \nIn his budget request, President Clinton asked for $21.3 billion in \nfunding for foreign affairs. The budget before us cuts $3.2 billion \nfrom that request.\n  U.S. leadership around the world requires adequate resources both for \nembassy security and for international programs. As a member of the \nForeign\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\nRelations Committee and the Ranking Member of the International \nOperations Subcommittee, I have heard many times that our embassies \nabroad are in dire need of security upgrades.\n  We should not forget the terrible tragedy that took place last year \nwhen over 100 people died in the embassy bombings in Nairobi, Kenya and \nDar es Salaam, Tanzania. It was a stark reminder that the men and women \nwho conduct our diplomacy abroad put their lives on the line to promote \nU.S. interests throughout the world. We have the obligation to ensure \ntheir safety in every way possible.\n  These cuts to the State Department budget are so deep that Secretary \nAlbright called them ``outrageous and unacceptable.''\n  Let me outline some of the important programs that will have to be \neliminated from the budget under the Republican budget. A $24 million \nanti-narcotics initiative and programs to fight money laundering and \ntrafficking in women could not be realized. The new Expanded Threat \nReduction Program to reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction in the former Soviet Union could not be implemented. And, \nthe U.S. request of $500 million to support the Wye Implementation \naccord would not be achievable under the Senate Budget Resolution.\n  I cannot believe that my colleagues would chose to undermine our \nefforts to fight the international war on drugs, control the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, and support the peace process in the \nMiddle East, in Ireland and in Bosnia.\n  We live in a very dangerous world, and this budget puts us at greater \nrisk. We must find the resources to fix this problem and properly fund \nthe international affairs budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3549-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FLEXIBILITY IN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the Education \nFlexibility Act. This legislation will address our continuing problem \nin education policy: too many Washington-knows-best policies and red-\ntape getting in the way of States and local districts as they attempt \nto address their unique educational needs.\n  Mr. President, over the past 16 years the Education Department has \nspent more than $175 billion on education programs. Yet achievement \nscores continue to stagnate and more young people than ever are \ndropping out of school. One crucial reason for this failure of Federal \nprograms has been the enormous burden of Washington strings and \nmandates on the States and local school districts.\n  While the Federal Government provides only 7 percent of total \nspending on education, Washington demands 50 percent of the paperwork \nfilled out by local school districts. That is wrong. It is inefficient, \nit is unfair and it is not the way to improve our children's education.\n  And this is why I support the Education Flexibility Act. This bill \nwould give every State a chance to waive many of the cumbersome rules, \nregulations, and red-tape often associated with education programs run \nby Washington.\n  The State of Michigan currently enjoys the benefits of the Ed-Flex \nprogram. In applying for its Ed-Flex waiver, Michigan streamlined \nseveral of its State regulations. Further, the very process of seeking \nwaivers has brought Michiganians together to improve education. A \nworking group of State and local officials, school board members, \nparents and principals was put together in Michigan to determine the \nbest way to streamline regulations and deliver education services.\n  I believe this legislation is moving in the right direction, and \nwould like to see it move even further. I believe Congress should be \neven more flexible in new authorizations and appropriations. \nCommunities are different and have different needs. Local school \ndistricts need to have more options on how to spend Federal education \ndollars. While some schools may need to hire additional teachers, other \nschool districts may need to implement a summer school program or a \nliteracy program. The point is, schools should have the flexibility and \nthe resources to meet the specific needs of their students.\n  A number of amendments have been offered during debate on this bill. \nMy general view is that to offer new authorizations for additional \nWashington-based programs is moving in the exact opposite direction of \nthe intent of this bill. This bill seeks to free up local education \nagencies from the Federal bureaucracies administering programs not to \nadd to them. To the extent that these issues have been raised, I have \nsupported the notion that we should first meet our current fiscal \nobligation to IDEA in addition to giving State and local education \nagencies flexibility in administering Federal education resources. I \nlook forward to a fuller discussion of these issues in the proper \ncontext of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  There has been a great deal of debate about the need to fully fund \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act provisions affecting \neducation. I believe that this raises an important point, particularly \ngiven the President's calls for new Federal programs such as his \nrequest for 100,000 new teachers, money for which would then compete \nwith IDEA appropriations.\n  For years now parents and local schools have been expressing concern \nover the rising costs of education for children with special needs. The \nFederal Government has made a strong commitment to the education needs \nof disabled children in every way, with one telling exception: it has \nnot lived up to its promise to provide its share of the funds necessary \nto educate these children. The result has been an increased burden on \nlocal school districts, which must make a choice between hiring a new \nteacher or paying the Federal Government's share of the IDEA bill.\n  Under the Republican Congress, funding for IDEA has increased \nsignificantly. Unfortunately, it is still not adequate to meet the \ncosts imposed by federal mandates. I believe we have an obligation to \ndo more to meet these previous commitments before we create new \nprograms and start spending on them money which could go to fulfill our \nIDEA promise. Moreover, if Congress would actually meet the federal \ngovernment's obligation to pay 40 percent of the costs for educating \nspecial needs children, it would free up millions for schools to spend \nmeeting other specific, local education needs.\n  For example, my state receives approximately $73 million from the \nfederal government for the educational needs of disabled children. If \nthe 40 percent mandate was reached, my state would receive $378 \nmillion. By meeting the federal government's obligation to current \nprograms, my state would have $305 million per year more (or one-\nquarter of the amount appropriated for the new teacher program last \nyear) to be used for whatever needs local school districts might have--\nincluding hiring more teachers, after-school programs, or tutoring \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I recently asked a school district in my state what \nkind of difference fully funding IDEA could make to them. Here is what \nI found: If the federal government met its obligation in funding IDEA \nin the Oakland School District, that district would have $60 million \nmore to spend on educating their students.\n  I think we can all agree on our commitment to elementary and \nsecondary education. The main point of disagreement is over how to \ndeliver federal resources to schools. I suggest that by freeing local \nschool districts of regulations and redtape and by giving them more \nflexibility in how they administer federal resources, we can free local \nschools to do what they do best: educate our children.\n  Education flexibility is not the answer to all our educational \nproblems. But I submit that it provides the best means available to get \nat those answers: allowing the parents, teachers, and local officials \nin a position to know what their students need to make the important \ndecisions involved in setting education priorities.\n  This is a crucial piece of legislation, Mr. President, and I am proud \nto lend my full support behind this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3549-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3549-S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMPREHENSIVE BORDER PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nComprehensive Border Protection Act of 1999 which Senator Grassley and \nI introduced on March 23, 1999. This bill enhances our efforts to \nsecure our borders by providing the U.S. Customs Service with\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\nthe necessary funding it requires to perform the multi faceted \nfunctions of drug interdiction, trade facilitation, and international \npassenger and cargo inspection services. The bill also addresses the \nconcerns that I, as well as many of my colleagues, have regarding the \nU.S. Customs Service and its ability to efficiently and effectively: \nDetermine enforcement and trade facilitation goals, objectives, and \npriorities; allocate assets and resources in response to changing \nthreats and needs; address employee misconduct and integrity concerns; \nand ensure full participation in a comprehensive strategy to combat \ninternational drug trafficking and money laundering.\n  Combating international drug trafficking is critical to our national \nsecurity. While we have experienced some success in our counter drug \noperations along the Southwest border, there are undeniable signs that \ndrug traffickers are adapting to our law enforcement efforts.\n  During the 1980s, as our law enforcement presence increased along the \nFlorida coast, drug traffickers responded by relocating their \noperations to the Southwest border. Reacting to this change, we \nabandoned Customs marine operations in Florida and intensified our \nefforts along the United States-Mexico border. Now, drug traffickers \nhave renewed the use of established smuggling routes in the Caribbean \nand off the coast of Florida to surreptitiously import their \ndestructive cargo into the United States.\n  During fiscal year 1998, Customs cocaine seizures in my home State of \nFlorida totaled 69,479 pounds, a 23 percent increase over 1997 \nseizures. Drug related deaths in Florida also increased as more and \nmore of our young adults experimented with heroin--the most pure heroin \nwe have ever encountered; heroin so pure it can be smoked, rather than \ninjected into a vein with a syringe.\n  An effective U.S. drug enforcement strategy must be proactive, \nincluding an intensified interdiction effort that exploits the inherent \nvulnerabilities of transporting drugs into the United States by air, \nland and sea. As one of our primary interdiction agencies, Customs must \nhave the necessary assets and resources to meet its interdiction \nresponsibilities.\n  Interdiction, however, is but one part of a successful drug \nenforcement strategy. Our strategy must also emphasize fundamental \ninvestigative work required to identify, infiltrate, disrupt and \ndismantle drug smuggling and money laundering organizations. To perform \nits investigative responsibilities, Customs must have the appropriate \nfunding to sustain an experienced work force of inspectors and agents \ndedicated to drug enforcement operations. These inspectors and agents \nmust be assigned to the most vulnerable and critical locations where \nillegal shipments of drugs enter the United States--our border with \nMexico, as well as Florida and the Gulf Coast.\n  Our counter drug strategy must also recognize the importance of, and \nbe sensitive to, the needs of the international trade community. \nEnhancing and facilitating open trade is essential to our economic \nhealth. To sustain U.S. economic growth, we must maintain the free flow \nof trade across our borders, while remaining vigilant to ensure that \nour open borders are not exploited by those who would use legitimate \ncommerce to conceal their illegal activities.\n  Over the past few years, U.S. seaports and airports have benefitted \nfrom the increasing growth of international commerce. During 1998, \ninternational traffic at Florida ports increased approximately 17.9 \npercent. In response to the increase in international passenger and \ncargo arrivals, a number of new cruise ship terminals, container \nfreight stations and passenger inspection facilities have been \nconstructed and expanded. Additionally, operations in free trade zones \nand bonded warehouses have increased. However, in the face of this \ngrowth, I am concerned that Customs have been unable to adequately \nrespond through the reallocation of personnel and funding.\n  We must ensure that Customs, in response to growth and change in \ninternational commerce, is prepared to review its resource allocation \nprocess on a regular basis. Customs must be able to shift both \npersonnel and funding as threat and need dictate. States, such as \nFlorida, that depend on the presence of Customs personnel to facilitate \ninternational trade, must be assured that sufficient Customs assets are \nin place to inspect and process both international passengers and cargo \nas they arrive in our seaports and airports.\n  The Comprehensive Border Protection Act of 1999 establishes a more \naccountable Customs Service by requiring Customs to report to this \nbody, no later than 120 days after this legislation is enacted, on the \nmethods utilized to identify enforcement priorities and trade \nfacilitation objectives. This legislation requires that Customs \nestablish performance standards and objectives against which we may \nevaluate the progress toward the goals identified in the customs annual \nplan. This legislaiton is a significant step toward giving customs the \nability and authority to reallocate resources in order to meet \nenforcement demands and commercial operations needs.\n  The bill also directs Customs to develop and implement an \naccountability model to address violations of administrative policies \nand procedures, as well as allegations of corruption. The purpose of \nthis provision is to ensure employee misconduct at the Customs Service \nis addressed in an efficient, effective and equitable manner. It is \nessential to the credibility of the agency that Customs address \nallegations of employee misconduct without unnecessary delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3550-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3550-S3551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nComprehensive Border Protection Act, a bill that addresses the urgent \nneed for increased Customs inspectors and technology along the U.S.-\nCanadian border.\n  Every day, the U.S. Customs Service must meet the dual challenges of \nenforcing our trade laws and easing the flow of goods across our \nborders. Customs carries out this mission at 83 ports-of-entry along \nthe U.S.-Canada border, the world's longest undefended border--some \n5,500 miles.\n  The resources, however, that we have provided to the Customs Service \nto process traffic and trade across this border are woefully deficient. \nIn a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee in September 1998, we \nlearned that the current number of authorized Customs inspectors \nworking on the northern border remains essentially the same as it was \nin 1980, despite the fact that the number of commercial entries they \nmust process has increased sixfold since then, from 1 million to 6 \nmillion per year. The increased workload reflects of course the \ntremendous growth in U.S.-Canada trade: two-way trade in 1988, the year \nbefore the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement entered into force, was \n$194 billion. In 1998, our two-way merchandise trade with Canada \nreached $331 billion, nearly $1 billion a day. Over one-quarter of our \ntotal imports from Canada enter the U.S. through three New York ports-\nof-entry--Buffalo, Champlain, and Alexandria Bay.\n  This bill aims to correct these problems by authorizing the \nadditional people and technology necessary to handle the increase in \ntrade and traffic between the United States and Canada. In particular, \nthis bill authorizes 375 additional ``primary lane'' inspectors and 125 \nnew cargo inspectors for the northern border, as well as 40 special \nagents and 10 intelligence agents. The bill also authorizes $26.58 \nmillion for equipment and technology for the northern border.\n  The resources available to the Customs Service over the last decade \nhave simply not kept pace with this enormous growth in workload. As \ntrade continues to grow, the day will come when our ports simply will \nnot be able to bear that load, unless we ensure that adequate staffing \nand equipment are in place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3551-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3551-S3563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The text of S. 544, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \nFiscal Year 1999, as passed by the Senate on March 23, 1999, follows:\n\n                                 S. 544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following sums are appropriated, out of any money in the \n     Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes, namely:\n\n             TITLE I--EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n                               CHAPTER 1\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                        Office of the Secretary\n\n\n EMERGENCY GRANTS TO ASSIST LOW-INCOME MIGRANT AND SEASONAL FARMWORKERS\n\n       For emergency grants to assist low-income migrant and \n     seasonal farmworkers under\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\n     section 2281 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and \n     Trade Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 5177a), $25,000,000: Provided, \n     That the entire amount shall be available only to the extent \n     an official budget request for $25,000,000, that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, is \n     transmitted by the President to the Congress: Provided \n     further, That the entire amount is designated by the Congress \n     as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) \n     of such Act.\n\n                     Agricultural Marketing Service\n\n\n                           marketing services\n\n       For an additional amount to carry out the agricultural \n     marketing assistance program under the Agricultural Marketing \n     Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.), $200,000, and the rural \n     business enterprise grant program under section 310B(c) of \n     the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1932(c)), $500,000: Provided, That the entire amount shall be \n     available only to the extent an official budget request for \n     $700,000, that includes designation of the entire amount of \n     the request as an emergency requirement as defined in the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended, is transmitted by the President to Congress: \n     Provided further, That the entire amount is designated by the \n     Congress as an emergency requirement under section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of such Act.\n\n\n          funds for strengthening markets, income, and supply\n\n                              (section 32)\n\n       For an additional amount for the fund maintained for funds \n     made available under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935 \n     (7 U.S.C. 612c), $150,000,000: Provided, That the entire \n     amount shall be available only to the extent an official \n     budget request for $150,000,000, that includes designation of \n     the entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement \n     as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985, as amended, is transmitted by the \n     President to Congress: Provided further, That the entire \n     amount is designated by the Congress as an emergency \n     requirement under section 251(b)(2)(A) of such Act.\n\n                          Farm Service Agency\n\n\n                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses'', \n     $42,753,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That the entire amount is designated by the Congress as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended.\n\n\n           AGRICULTURAL CREDIT INSURANCE FUND PROGRAM ACCOUNT\n\n       For additional gross obligations for the principal amount \n     of direct and guaranteed loans as authorized by 7 U.S.C. \n     1928-1929, to be available from funds in the Agricultural \n     Credit Insurance Fund, as follows: farm ownership loans, \n     $550,000,000, of which $350,000,000 shall be for guaranteed \n     loans;

Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. (a) \n     Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Emergency \n     Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States steel industry has been severely \n     harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of \n     steel imports into the United States in 1998, caused by the \n     world financial crisis;\n       (2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than \n     10,000 steel worker jobs in 1998, and was the imminent cause \n     of 3 bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme \n     Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;\n       (3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel \n     companies into--\n       (A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and\n       (B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations \n     and reinvestment in facilities;\n       (4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private \n     banks and investment institutions to make loans to the U.S. \n     steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in \n     facilities;\n       (5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial \n     losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax \n     base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential \n     health, education, and municipal services that these \n     government entities provide to their citizens; and\n       (6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate \n     defense preparedness of the United States in order to have \n     sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, \n     and armaments necessary for the national defense.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee Board \n     established under subsection (e);\n       (2) the term ``Program'' means the Emergency Steel \n     Guaranteed Loan Program established under subsection (d);

and\n       (C) has experienced layoffs, production losses, or \n     financial losses since the beginning of the steel import \n     crisis, after January 1, 1998.\n       (d) Establishment of Emergency Steel Guaranteed Loan \n     Program.--There is established the Emergency Steel Guaranteed \n     Loan Program, to be administered by the Board, the purpose of \n     which is to provide loan guarantees to qualified steel \n     companies in accordance with this section.\n       (e) Loan Guarantee Board Membership.--There is established \n     a Loan Guarantee Board, which shall be composed of--\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\n       (1) the Secretary of Commerce, who shall serve as Chairman \n     of the Board;\n       (2) the Secretary of Labor;

and\n       (4) the company has agreed to an audit by the General \n     Accounting Office, prior to the issuance of the loan \n     guarantee and annually while any such guaranteed loan is \n     outstanding.\n       (h) Terms and Conditions of Loan Guarantees.--\n       (1) Loan duration.--All loans guaranteed under this section \n     shall be payable in full not later than December 31, 2005, \n     and the terms and conditions of each such loan shall provide \n     that the loan may not be amended, or any provision thereof \n     waived, without the consent of the Board.\n       (2) Loan security.--Any commitment to issue a loan \n     guarantee under this section shall contain such affirmative \n     and negative covenants and other protective provisions that \n     the Board determines are appropriate.

Petroleum Development Management. (a) Short \n     Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Emergency Oil and \n     Gas Guaranteed Loan Program Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) consumption of foreign oil in the United States is \n     estimated to equal 56 percent of all oil consumed, and that \n     percentage could reach 68 percent by 2010 if current prices \n     prevail;\n       (2) the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United \n     States is at its lowest since 1944, when records of this \n     tally began;\n       (3) if prices do not increase soon, the United States could \n     lose at least half its marginal wells, which in aggregate \n     produce as much oil as the United States imports from Saudi \n     Arabia;\n       (4) oil and gas prices are unlikely to increase for at \n     least several years;\n       (5) declining production, well abandonment, and greatly \n     reduced exploration and development are shrinking the \n     domestic oil and gas industry;\n       (6) the world's richest oil producing regions in the Middle \n     East are experiencing increasingly greater political \n     instability;\n       (7) United Nations policy may make Iraq the swing oil \n     producing nation, thereby granting Saddam Hussein tremendous \n     power;\n       (8) reliance on foreign oil for more than 60 percent of our \n     daily oil and gas consumption is a national security threat;\n       (9) the level of United States oil security is directly \n     related to the level of domestic production of oil, natural \n     gas liquids, and natural gas; and\n       (10) a national security policy should be developed that \n     ensures that adequate supplies of oil are available at all \n     times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile \n     acts.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee \n     Board established by subsection (e).\n       (2) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Emergency Oil \n     and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program established by subsection \n     (d).\n       (3) Qualified oil and gas company.--The term ``qualified \n     oil and gas company'' means a company that--\n       (A) is incorporated under the laws of any State;\n       (B) is--\n       (i) an independent oil and gas company (within the meaning \n     of section 57(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986);

(a) The Senate finds:\n       (1) That an export license is pending for the sale of \n     United States wheat and other agricultural commodities to the \n     nation of Iran.\n       (2) That this sale of agricultural commodities would \n     increase United States agricultural exports by about \n     $500,000,000, at a time when agricultural exports have fallen \n     dramatically.\n       (3) That sanctions on food are counterproductive to the \n     interest of United States farmers and to the people who would \n     be fed by these agricultural exports.\n       (b) Now therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     pending license for this sale of United States wheat and \n     other agricultural commodities to Iran be approved by the \n     administration.\n       Sec. 2323. Prohibition. (a) Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, prior to eight months after Congress \n     receives the report of the National Gambling Impact Study \n     Commission, the Secretary of the Interior shall not--\n       (1) promulgate as final regulations, or in any way \n     implement, the proposed regulations published on January 22, \n     1998, at 63 Fed. Reg. 3289; or\n       (2) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking for, or \n     promulgate, or in any way implement, any similar regulations \n     to provide for procedures for gaming activities under the \n     Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.), in any \n     case in which a State asserts a defense of sovereign immunity \n     to a lawsuit brought by an Indian tribe in a Federal court \n     under section 11(d)(7) of that Act (25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(7)) to \n     compel the State to participate in compact negotiations for \n     class III gaming (as that term is defined in section 4(8) of \n     that Act (25 U.S.C. 2703(8))).\n       (3) approve class III gaming on Indian lands by any means \n     other than a Tribal-State compact entered into between a \n     State and a tribe.\n       (b) Definitions.--\n       (1) The terms ``class III gaming'', ``Secretary'', ``Indian \n     lands'', and ``Tribal-State compact'' shall have the same \n     meaning for the purposes of this section as those terms have \n     under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et \n     seq.).\n       (2) The ``report of the National Gambling Impact Study \n     Commission'' is the report described in section 4(b) of \n     Public Law 104-169 (18 U.S.C. sec. 1955 note).\n       Sec. 2324. Findings and Sense of Senate Regarding \n     Sequential Billing Policy for\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\n     Home Health Payments Under the Medicare Program. (a) \n     Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Section 4611 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n     included a provision that transfers financial responsibility \n     for certain home health visits under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.) from part A to part B of such program.\n       (2) The sole intent of the transfer described in paragraph \n     (1) was to extend the solvency of the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817 of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395i).\n       (3) The transfer described in paragraph (1) was supposed to \n     be ``seamless'' so as not to disrupt the provision of home \n     health services under the medicare program.\n       (4) The Health Care Financing Administration has imposed a \n     sequential billing policy that prohibits home health agencies \n     under the medicare program from submitting claims for \n     reimbursement for home health services provided to a \n     beneficiary unless all claims for reimbursement for home \n     health services that were previously provided to such \n     beneficiary have been completely resolved.\n       (5) The Health Care Financing Administration has also \n     expanded medical reviews of claims for reimbursement \n     submitted by home health agencies, resulting in a significant \n     slowdown nationwide in the processing of such claims.\n       (6) The sequential billing policy described in paragraph \n     (4), coupled with the slowdown in claims processing described \n     in paragraph (5), has substantially increased the cash flow \n     problems of home health agencies because payments are often \n     delayed by at least 3 months.\n       (7) The vast majority of home health agencies under the \n     medicare program are small businesses that cannot operate \n     with significant cash flow problems.\n       (8) There are many other elements under the medicare \n     program relating to home health agencies, such as the interim \n     payment system under section 1861(v)(1)(L) of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)), that are creating financial problems \n     for home health agencies, thereby forcing more than 2,200 \n     home health agencies nationwide to close since the date of \n     enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Health Care Financing Administration should--\n       (1) evaluate and monitor the use of the sequential billing \n     policy (as described in subsection (a)(4)) in making payments \n     to home health agencies under the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et \n     seq.);\n       (2) ensure that--\n       (A) contract fiscal intermediaries under the medicare \n     program are timely in their random medical review of claims \n     for reimbursement submitted by home health agencies; and\n       (B) such intermediaries adhere to Health Care Financing \n     Administration instructions that limit the number of claims \n     for reimbursement held for such review for any particular \n     home health agency to no more than 10 percent of the total \n     number of claims submitted by the agency; and\n       (3) ensure that such intermediaries are considering and \n     implementing constructive alternatives, such as expedited \n     reviews of claims for reimbursement, for home health agencies \n     with no history of billing problems who have cash flow \n     problems due to random medical reviews and sequential \n     billing.\n       Sec. 2325. A payment of $800,000 from the total amount of \n     $1,000,000 for construction of the Pike's Peak Summit House, \n     as specified in Conference Report 105-337, accompanying the \n     Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1998, Public Law 105-83, \n     and payments of $2,000,000 for the Borough of Ketchikan to \n     participate in a study of the feasibility and dynamics of \n     manufacturing veneer products in Southeast Alaska and \n     $200,000 for construction of the Pike's Peak Summit House, as \n     specified in Conference Report 105-825 accompanying the \n     Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999 (as contained in \n     division A, section 101(e) of the Omnibus Consolidated and \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law \n     105-277)), shall be paid in lump sum and shall be considered \n     direct payments, for the purposes of all applicable law \n     except that these direct grants may not be used for lobbying \n     activities.\n       Sec. 2326. Section 617 of the Department of Commerce, \n     Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1999 (as added by section 101(b) of \n     division A of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-277)) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n       ``(a) None of the funds made available in this Act or any \n     other Act hereafter enacted may be used to issue or renew a \n     fishing permit or authorization for any fishing vessel of the \n     United States greater than 165 feet in registered length, of \n     more than 750 gross registered tons, or that has an engine or \n     engines capable of producing a total of more than 3,000 shaft \n     horsepower as specified in the permit application required \n     under part 648.4(a)(5) of title 50, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, part 648.12 of title 50, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, and the authorization required under part \n     648.80(d)(2) of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, to \n     engage in fishing for Atlantic mackerel or herring (or both) \n     under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), unless the regional \n     fishery management council of jurisdiction recommends after \n     October 21, 1998, and the Secretary of Commerce approves, \n     conservation and management measures in accordance with such \n     Act to allow such vessel to engage in fishing for Atlantic \n     mackerel or herring (or both).''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``subsection (a)(1)'' \n     and inserting ``subsection (a)''.\n       Sec. 2327.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Small Business be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 440, \nand that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 440) to make technical corrections in the \n     Microloan Program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on H.R. 440, \nthe Microloan Program Technical Corrections Act of 1999. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this Act which, including my amendment, makes \nimportant changes to the Small Business Administration's (SBA) \nMicroloan program. It revises the loan loss reserve requirement for \nmicrolenders and makes changes that will more equitably distribute the \nmicroloan dollars available to each state. Ultimately, these changes \nwill allow microlenders and intermediaries to make more loans and offer \nmore technical assistance to our nation's small businesses.\n  Most of my colleagues know that microloans and technical assistance \nare effective and powerful economic development tools because they \nvoted to make the SBA's microloan program a permanent part of the \nAgency's lending programs in 1997.\n  Let's look at the record since the SBA's microloan pilot program was \nlaunched in 1991. It has provided more than 7,900 microloans, worth \nsome $80.3 million. For every microloan, 1.7 jobs are created. And, if \na borrower was a welfare recipient, it is common for them to hire other \nwelfare recipients. As the program was intended to do, a great \npercentage of microloans have gone to traditionally underserved groups, \nincluding 45 percent to women-owned businesses, 39 percent to minority-\nowned businesses and 11 percent to veteran-owned businesses. Voting for \nthese measures will be a vote to make a good program better.\n  Specifically, this legislation revises the loan loss reserve \nrequirement (a cash reserve to guarantee that the government is paid \nback if a loan defaults) for microlenders by setting a 15-percent \nceiling and a 10-percent floor. After a microloan intermediary has \nparticipated in the SBA Microloan program for five years and \ndemonstrated its ability to maintain a healthy loan fund, it can \nrequest that SBA review and, when appropriate, reduce its loan loss \nreserve from 15 percent to a percentage based on its average loan loss \nrate for the five-year period. The proposed change would continue to \nprotect the government's interest in microloans as well as enhance the \nprogram by freeing up cash which microlenders could reprogram for more \nmicroloans or technical assistance to small business owners.\n  With my amendment, this legislation establishes a floor for the \ndistribution of microloan funds available to the states, including the \nDistrict of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, Guam, and American Samoa. Depending on the amount of \nappropriations, the SBA must provide the lesser of either $800,000 or \nthe even division of the funds among the 55 states. For any monies that \nexceed $44 million ($800,000 x 55 states), the Administration has the \ndiscretion to decide how to distribute the microloan funds. The \nAdministration also has the discretion to distribute any additional \nmoney that is left over at the beginning of the third quarter of a \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. President, in Massachusetts and across the country, microloans \nand technical assistance are working; assisting individuals with the \ntools to successfully start and manage their own business. I thank my \ncolleagues for their past support of small business and urge them to \nvote for H.R. 440 as amended.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 248\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the equitable allocation of appropriated \n                                amounts)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. 388 be \ndischarged from the Small Business Committee and the Senate proceed to \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 388) to authorize the establishment of a \n     disaster mitigation pilot program in the Small Business \n     Administration.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, after one year of working to enact a \nprogram that emphasizes prevention over reaction in dealing with \nnatural disasters, the bill Senator Cleland and I first introduced in \nthe 105th Congress has made its way back to the Senate for our \nconsideration and support. I ask my colleagues to vote for S. 388, the \nDisaster Mitigation Coordination Act of 1999. Your vote will help our \nnation's small businesses save money and prepare for natural disasters.\n  This bill establishes a 5-year pilot program that would make low-\ninterest, long-term loans available to small business owners financing \npreventive measures to protect their businesses against, and lessen the \nextent of, future disaster damage. This pilot is designed to help those \nsmall businesses that can't get credit elsewhere and that are located \nin disaster-prone areas.\n  The small business pre-disaster mitigation loan pilot program would \nbe run as part of the Small Business Administration's regular disaster \nloan program, testing the pros and cons of preparedness versus \nreaction. Currently, SBA's disaster loans are available for mitigation \nafter a recent natural disaster. Those loans are also limiting because \nonly 20 percent of an SBA disaster loan may be used to install new \nmitigation techniques that will prevent future damage. In contrast, \nthis legislation would allow 100 percent of an SBA disaster loan to be \nused for mitigation purposes within any area that the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA) has designated as disaster-prone. In \nMassachusetts, that includes Marshfield and Quincy, two coastal \ncommunities that are prone to flooding, rainstorms and Nor'easters.\n  I see a great need for this type of assistance in the small business \ncommunity. Aside from avoiding inconveniences and disruptions, we know \nthat there are cost-benefits to making meaningful improvements and \nchanges to facilities before a disaster. According to the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, which has a disaster mitigation program \nfor communities, rather than businesses, we save two dollars of \ndisaster relief money for each dollar spent on disaster mitigation.\n  Nationwide, whether you're a business in Florida or Massachusetts, \nthis pilot would allow you to take out a loan to make the improvements \nto your building or office to protect against disasters. To lessen \ndamage from hurricanes, it can mean constructing retaining and sea \nwalls. To lessen damage from fires, it can mean adding sprinklers and \nflame-retardant building materials. And to lessen damage from floods, \nit can mean grading and contouring land or relocating the business.\n  The administration supports this pilot program and included it in \nPresident Clinton's budget request two years in a row--fiscal years \n1999 and 2000. As the bill authorizes, the President requests that up \nto $15 million of the total $358 million proposed for disaster loans be \nused for disaster mitigation loans.\n  Senator Cleland and I introduced this same legislation in the last \nCongress. And although it passed committee and the full Senate without \nopposition, the House did not vote on its merits before the 105th \nCongress ended. I thank our friends in the House and my colleagues in \nthe Senate for sharing our concern to meet the needs of our small \nbusiness owners while also working to find solutions that are smarter, \nmore pro-active and more cost-effective. Mr. President, I am pleased to \nbe a cosponsor of this legislation and am hopeful it will pass the \nSenate today and that the President will soon sign it in to law.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 388) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 388\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 98, which would \nreauthorize the aviation war risk insurance program for five years. As \nU.S. troops embark on strikes against Yugoslavia, it is important that \nwe make sure to provide the Administration all of the tools necessary \nto carry out our foreign policy interests.\n  The Aviation Insurance Program insures U.S. air carriers against \nlosses resulting from war, terrorism or other hostile acts. Program \ninsurance is available when a carrier's commercial insurance is \ncanceled, or is unavailable at reasonable rates. First, however, the \nPresident or his designee must determine that a flight is essential to \nthe foreign policy interests of the United States.\n  We must act on this legislation now. Otherwise, the Aviation \nInsurance Program will expire at the end of March. I cannot \noveremphasize its importance. During Operation Desert Storm, for \ninstance, the program insured more than 5,000 flights provided by \ncommercial airlines in support of the Department of Defense, as part of \nthe Civil Reserve Air Fleet. U.S. carriers simply would not be able to \nparticipate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet if they could not insure \nagainst high risks of loss or damage.\n  I want to emphasize another important point. The Senate recently \napproved legislation that, among other things, would reauthorize the \nAviation Insurance Program for two months. H.R. 98 would reauthorize \nthe program for five years. In the event that the legislation \ncontaining the two-month extension is enacted into law after H.R. 98 is \nenacted into law, the two-month provision should not trump the five-\nyear provision. In other words, it is our intent that the Aviation \nInsurance Program is reauthorized for five years.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to \nreauthorize the aviation war risk insurance program for five years.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, \nthe bill then be referred to the Commerce Committee; I further ask \nconsent that the bill then be immediately discharged, the Senate \nproceed to its consideration, the bill be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the measure appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I finally ask unanimous consent that the amendment to the \ntitle, which is at the desk, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``An Act to amend chapter 443 of \ntitle 49, United States Code, to extend the aviation war risk insurance \nprogram.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3567-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3567-S3568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MAKING OF RISK MANAGEMENT DECISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 756 introduced earlier today by Senator \nLincoln and Senator Hutchinson\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 756) to provide adversely affected crop \n     producers with additional time to make fully informed risk \n     management decisions for the 1999 crop year.\n\n  There being no objection the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this bill addresses a crop insurance \ncrisis that is plaguing my home state of Arkansas.\n  As many of you know, the outlook for the agricultural economy is very \nbleak for many parts of the country. As farmers in Arkansas and other \nstates making their planting decisions for the upcoming growing season, \nthey were offered what seemed to be a light at the end of the tunnel. A \ncrop insurance policy entitled CRCPlus.\n  CRCPlus is a supplemental crop insurance policy available only from \nAmerica Agrisurance, Inc. and is offered on corn, cotton, grain \nsorghum, soybeans, wheat and rice in several states. For Arkansas' rice \ngrowers, the original CRCPlus policies offered what appeared to be a \nfinancially viable risk management tool by adding a privately backed 3 \ncents per pound to the underlying federal Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC) \npolicies. This placed the guaranteed fall price for rice at a level \nabove projected prices. With commodity prices depressed across the \nboard, a large number of farmers decided to switch to growing rice \nbased on this ``too good to be true'' offer.\n  At a time when the agricultural climate in Arkansas is devastated to \nbegin with, these policies were a last ray of hope for hundreds of \nfarmers. Now, essentially, American Agrisurance has pulled the rug out \nfrom under these families. On March 1, the company reneged, saying it \nwould reduce the additional guarantee of coverage from 3 cents to 1\\1/\n2\\ cents per pound. This announcement came after the sales period for \ncrop insurance was closed, leaving many producers with a product they \nwould not have otherwise purchased. Many producers felt they had been \nmisled and I tend to agree. I am very thankful to Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman and Risk Management Agency Director, Ken \nAckerman for their assistance in opening the cancellation period for \ncrop insurance over the last two weeks so that the affected producers \nhad more time to evaluate whether to keep the CRCPlus policies. This \nextra time eased the mind of many producers in my state during a very \ntroubling period. During this extended cancellation period many \nproducers reevaluated the cost/benefit ratios calculated at the 1\\1/2\\ \ncent level rather than the 3 cent level. Several producers canceled \ntheir polities with American Agrisurance, but many producers decided \nthat the coverage offered was still sufficient to provide protection \nduring a very volatile growing season and opted to stick with American \nAgrisurance and the CRCPlus policy. I wish the story ended here.\n  American Agrisurance has since indicated that due to a problem with \nits reinsurers, they may not be able to live up to the additional 1\\1/\n2\\ cents of coverage on policies currently held by many producers. The \ncompany is reviewing its financial status and will announce on March \n25th whether or not the 1\\1/2\\ cent polices will be honored. This \nsituation has further clouded the outlook for producers and left them \nwondering what to believe and who to trust.\n  Regardless of the company's excuses for its actions, it is now \nimperative that farmers who were wronged by this company be able to \nwithdraw their\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\nbusiness. I have been working with the Administration, the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman \nLugar, and several other members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to \ndraft legislation that addresses our producers' needs. This bill allows \nthe Department of Agriculture to reopen the crop insurance sales period \nso that producers affected by the uncertainty of the CRCPlus situation \ncan transfer to another approved insurance provider.\n  Farmers are on the verge of planting, so a swift response is \nnecessary to clear up the confusion over their insurance protection. As \nthe daughter of a seventh generation Arkansas farm family, I truly \nunderstand that in situations like this it's the farmer who gets left \nholding the bag. Each year, farmers go out on a limb and make critical \nplanting decisions based on obligations and promises. My heart goes out \nto all who have made plans based on these policies. I urge my \ncolleagues to act quickly on this matter so that a wrong can be righted \nin America's heartland. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \nagain passed legislation to convey unwanted federal land to Rio Arriba \nCounty, New Mexico. While identical legislation passed the Senate last \nsummer, it was unable to get through the House of Representatives due \nto political wrangling in the waning days of the 105th Congress.\n  Meanwhile, Rio Arriba has been waiting for access to this much-needed \nland and facilities. The vast majority of this Northern New Mexico \ncounty is in federal ownership. Communities find themselves unable to \ngrow or find available property necessary to provide local services. \nThis legislation allows for transfer by the Secretary of the Interior \nreal property and improvements at an abandoned and surplus \nadministrative site for the Carson National Forest to the County. The \nsite is known as the old Coyote Ranger District Station, near the small \ntown of Coyote, new Mexico.\n  The Coyote Station will continue to be used for public purposes, \nincluding a community center, and a fire substation. Some of the \nbuildings will also be available for the County to use for storage and \nrepair of road maintenance equipment, and other County vehicles.\n  Mr. President, the Forest Service has determined that this site is of \nno further use to them, since they have recently completed construction \nof a new\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\nadministrative facility for the Coyote Range District. The Forest \nService reported to the General Services Administration that the \nimprovements on the site were considered surplus, and would be \navailable for disposal under their administrative procedures. At this \nparticular site, however, the land on which the facilities have been \nbuilt is withdrawn public domain land, under the jurisdiction of the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  The Administration is supportive of the legislation. Since neither \nthe Bureau of land Management nor the Forest Service have any interest \nin maintaining Federal ownership of this land and the surplus \nfacilities, and Rio Arriba County desperately needs them, passage of S. \n278 is a win-win situation for the federal government and New Mexico. I \nhope this meritorious bill will be passed promptly in the House, and \nquickly become law to give Rio Arriba County the necessary community \nland to grow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3569-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3569-S3570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CARLSBAD IRRIGATION PROJECT ACQUIRED LAND TRANSFER ACT\n\n  The bill (S. 291) to convey certain real property within the Carlsbad \nProject in New Mexico to the Carlsbad Irrigation District, was \nconsidered, ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, read the third \ntime, and passed; as follows:\n\n                                 S. 291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mrs. President, I once again rise to express pleasure \nthat the Senate has passed S. 291--the Carlsbad Irrigation Project \nAcquired Land Transfer Act. I, along with Congressman Skeen, have been \nworking to convey tracts of land--paid for by Carlsbad Irrigation \nDistrict and referred to as ``acquired lands''--back to the district, \nduring the past several congresses. Identical legislation passed the \nSenate last year, it enjoys bi-partisan support, and hopefully will \npass in the House of Representatives soon.\n  The Carlsbad Irrigation District has had operations and maintenance \nresponsibilities for this Bureau of Reclamation project for the past 66 \nyears. It met all the repayment obligations to the government in 1991, \nand it's about time we let the District have what is rightfully theirs. \nThis legislation will not affect operations at the New Mexico state \npark at Brantley Dam, or the operations and ownership of the dam \nitself. Furthermore, the bill will not affect recreation activities in \nthe area.\n  This legislation accomplishes three main things: it allows conveyance \nof acquired lands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; \nallows the District to assume management of leases and the benefits of \nthe receipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180 day\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\ndeadline for the transfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard \nfor carrying out the transfer.\n  Unfortunately, after years of testimony from the District and support \nfrom the Administration, this legislation failed to pass the House of \nRepresentatives in the waning days of the 105th Congress. With such \ncontinued support for this logical and fair bill, I hope the House will \nput aside its differences and pass this worthy legislation soon. The \nCarlsbad Irrigation District has been waiting more than long enough to \nbegin getting the benefits for that which they have paid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3570-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3570-S3571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROUTE 66 LEGISLATION\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 292) to preserve the \ncultural resources of the Route 66 corridor and to authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to provide assistance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, once again this body will take an \nhistoric step in preserving one of America's cultural treasures--Route \n66. Passage of S. 292, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Act, will \npreserve the unique cultural resources along the famous Route and \nauthorize the Interior Secretary to provide assistance through the Park \nService. Congresswoman Heather Wilson of Albuquerque, New Mexico, \nreintroduced a companion bill (H.R. 66) in the House of \nRepresentatives. This legislation almost became law at the end of the \n105th Congress, but failed to pass in the House of Representatives due \nto last minute political wrangling. However, I believe that unfortunate \nturn of events had more to do with political grandstanding than to any \nquestion of merit.\n  I introduced the ``Route 66 Study Act of 1990,'' which directed the \nNational Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, \ncommemorate and interpret Route 66. As a result of that study, I \nintroduced legislation last summer authorizing the National Park \nService to join with federal, state and private efforts to preserve \naspects of historic Route 66, the nation's most important thoroughfare \nfor east-west migration in the 20th century.\n  The Administration once again testified in favor of this legislation, \nwhich is identical to last year's bill. S. 292 authorizes a funding \nlevel over 10 years and stresses that we want the federal government to \nsupport grassroots efforts to preserve aspects of this historic \nhighway.\n  Designated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to \nSanta Monica, Calif. It rolled through eight American states, and in \nNew Mexico, it went through the communities of Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, \nAlbuquerque, Grants and Gallup. New Mexico added to the aura of Route \n66, giving new generations of Americans their first experience of our \ncolorful culture and heritage. Route 66 allowed generations of \nvacationers to travel to previously remote areas and experience the \nnatural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far West. This bill is \ndesigned to assist private efforts to preserve structures and other \ncultural resources of the historic Route 66 corridor.\n  S. 292 authorizes the National Park Service to support state, local \nand private efforts to preserve the Route 66 corridor by providing \ntechnical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, and \nmaking grants.

DESIGNATION OF SUDBURY, ASSABET, AND CONCORD SCENIC \n                   AND RECREATIONAL RIVERS, MASSACHUSETTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Wild and Scenic River \n     Study Act (title VII of Public Law 101-628; 104 Stat. 4497)--\n       (A) designated segments of the Sudbury, Assabet, and \n     Concord Rivers in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, totaling \n     29 river miles, for study and potential addition to the \n     National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; and\n       (B) directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish the \n     Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers Study Committee (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Study Committee'') to advise the \n     Secretary in conducting the study and in the consideration of \n     management alternatives should the rivers be included in the \n     National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n       (2) The study determined the following river segments are \n     eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \n     System based on their free-flowing condition and outstanding \n     scenic, recreation, wildlife, cultural, and historic values:\n       (A) The 16.6-mile segment of the Sudbury River beginning at \n     the Danforth Street Bridge in the town of Framingham, to its \n     confluence with the Assabet River.\n       (B) The 4.4-mile segment of the Assabet River from 1,000 \n     feet downstream from the Damon Mill Dam in the town of \n     Concord to the confluence with the Sudbury River at Egg Rock \n     in Concord.\n       (C) The 8-mile segment of the Concord River from Egg Rock \n     at the confluence of the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers to the \n     Route 3 bridge in the town of Billerica.\n       (3) The towns that directly abut the segments, including \n     Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Lincoln, Concord, Bedford, \n     Carlisle, and Billerica, Massachusetts, have each \n     demonstrated their desire for National Wild and Scenic River \n     designation through town meeting votes endorsing designation.\n       (4) During the study, the Study Committee and the National \n     Park Service prepared a comprehensive management plan for the \n     segment, entitled ``Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Wild and \n     Scenic River Study, River Conservation Plan'' and dated March \n     16, 1995 (in this section referred to as the ``plan''), which \n     establishes objectives, standards, and action programs that \n     will ensure long-term protection of the rivers' outstanding \n     values and compatible management of their land and water \n     resources.\n       (5) The Study Committee voted unanimously on February 23, \n     1995, to recommend that the Congress include these segments \n     in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System for management \n     in accordance with the plan.\n       (b) Designation.--Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(160) Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers, \n     Massachusetts.--(A) The 29 miles of river segments in \n     Massachusetts, as follows:\n       ``(i) The 14.9-mile segment of the Sudbury River beginning \n     at the Danforth Street Bridge in the town of Framingham, \n     downstream to the Route 2 Bridge in Concord, as a scenic \n     river.\n       ``(ii) The 1.7-mile segment of the Sudbury River from the \n     Route 2 Bridge downstream to its confluence with the Assabet \n     River at Egg Rock, as a recreational river.\n       ``(iii) The 4.4-mile segment of the Assabet River beginning \n     1,000 feet downstream from the Damon Mill Dam in the town of \n     Concord, to its confluence with the Sudbury River at Egg Rock \n     in Concord; as a recreational river.\n       ``(iv) The 8-mile segment of the Concord River from Egg \n     Rock at the confluence of the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers \n     downstream to the Route 3 Bridge in the town of Billerica, as \n     a recreational river.\n       ``(B) The segments referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be \n     administered by the Secretary of the Interior in cooperation \n     with the SUASCO River Stewardship Council provided for in the \n     plan referred to in subparagraph (C) through cooperative \n     agreements under section 10(e) between the Secretary and the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its relevant political \n     subdivisions (including the towns of Framingham, Wayland, \n     Sudbury, Lincoln, Concord, Carlisle, Bedford, and Billerica).\n       ``(C) The segments referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be \n     managed in accordance with the plan entitled `Sudbury, \n     Assabet and Concord Wild and Scenic River Study, River \n     Conservation Plan', dated March 16, 1995.

For the purpose of \n     that section, the towns are deemed to be ``villages'' and the \n     provisions of that section which prohibit Federal acquisition \n     of lands through condemnation shall apply.\n       (2) The United States Government shall not acquire by any \n     means title to land, easements, or other interests in land \n     along the segments designated by the amendment made by \n     subsection (b) or their tributaries for the purposes of \n     designation of the segments under the amendment.

Mr. President, I am pleased my colleagues have again \npassed this important legislation allowing for transfer of an unwanted \npiece of federal property to an educational institution which needs it. \nThe Old Jicarilla Site Conveyance Act of 1999 allows for transfer by \nthe Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior real property and \nimprovements at an abandoned and surplus ranger station to San Juan \nCollege. This college, located in a county that amazingly is 90% in \nfederal ownership, has been waiting for use of this land.\n  Finding appropriate sites for community and educational purposes can \nbe difficult in predominantly federally-owned areas. The site that is \nthe subject of this legislation is in the Carson National Forest near \nthe village of Gobernador, New Mexico. The Jicarilla Site will continue \nto be used for public purposes, including educational and recreational \npurposes of the college.\n  The Forest Service determined that the acreage is of no further use \nto them because a new administrative facility has been located in the \ntown of Bloomfield, New Mexico. In fact, the facility has had no \noccupants for several years, and the Forest Service testified last year \nthat enactment of this bill would ``provide long-term benefits for the \npeople of San Juan County and the students and faculty of San Juan \nCollege.''\n  While an identical bill passed the Senate last Congress, and was \nreintroduced this January, the Forest Service last week indicated it \nwished to make some last minute changes. The substitute amendment \nincorporates these technical corrections as to the acreage, and I hope \nthe House of Representatives will quickly act on this noncontroversial \nbill and the land can readily be put to good use for San Juan College \nand the area residents. We also need to put this property in the hands \nof the college soon so it can protect the area from further \ndeterioration and fire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3574-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3574-S3575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PERKINS COUNTY RURAL WATER SYSTEM ACT OF 1999\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 243) to authorize the \nconstruction of the Perkins County Rural Water System and authorize \nfinancial assistance to the Perkins County Rural Water System, Inc., a \nnonprofit corporation, in the planning and construction of the water \nsupply system, and for other purposes.\n  The amendment (No. 251) was agreed to, as follows:\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention to a \nmatter of pressing concern involving the upcoming visit of Chinese \nPremier Zhu Rongji and the prospects of China's accession to the World \nTrade Organization.\n\n\n                        Context of Relationship\n\n  Let me begin, however, with some context.\n  On April 8 and 9, the Premier of China will visit our country. As we \nspeak, the Administration is negotiating with China the terms of its \npossible accession to the WTO.\n  Already this session, the Senate has seen one floor debate concerning \nour overall China policy. That debate was prompted by an amendment that \nwould have required Congress to vote on the terms of China's accession \nprior to the Administration's completion of an agreement. Such a pre-\nemptive vote raised several constitutional and precedential questions.\n  Congress has not voted on any of the previous 110 GATT and WTO \naccessions because since 1948 WTO accessions have been executive \nagreements which generally require no U.S. concessions.\n  I spoke loudly against that amendment for three specific reasons. \nFirst, a vote on WTO accession would more likely be a judgment on the \nimmediate state of our overall relationship with China than on the \ntrade policy details of the accession. Second, such a vote could result \nin the U.S. holding a set of unilateral trade concessions by China to \nthe United States hostage to every other concern we have about China--\nfrom human rights to security, environment, labor policies and much \nmore. Third, we are already required to vote on China's permanent \nNormal Trading Relation status before the agreement becomes binding. \nTherefore, I was pleased that the Senate saw fit to defeat this \nresolution by a resounding vote of 69 to 30. Now we can move on to the \nmatter of pressing concern.\n  Mr. President, as the visit of the Chinese Premier nears, and as the \nAdministration continues with its negotiations, I am sure that the \nSenate, the Administration, and the country as a whole will engage in \nan intense debate on China policy. Participants in this debate will \nhave radically different views on the prospects of our relationship, \nand on the trade, security and human rights policies we should adopt in \nit.\n  I rise today to encourage all participants in this debate to take a \ndeep breath and to think carefully about this issue. For there is much \nat stake. And it is incumbent upon all of us to make sure that our \nactions are in the best interests of our country.\n\n\n                    STATEMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION\n\n  First, let me address my remarks to the Administration, for they are \nengaged in an on-going dialogue with China over WTO accession.\n  Simply put, we must not allow the pending visit of the Premier to \ncause us to want an agreement so badly that we will accept it on \nanything less than the best possible terms. It may sound trite, Mr. \nPresident, but this is serious stuff--we have to get it right. I do not \nwant to see us simply agree to a commercially viable agreement, instead \nI want us to sign a commercially powerful agreement.\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\n  We've waited a long time to achieve liberalized trade with China. \nMany times in the past dozen years, we have tried unsuccessfully. But \ndespite, our questions concerning enforcement never before have we been \nso close in terms of real progress and genuine commitment to agreeable \nterms that right now. And we must recognize that whatever happens, \nChina will be a challenge for years to come.\n  Take for example the matter of China refusing to import Pacific-\nNorthwest wheat. For the first time in over two decades, we are near a \nbreakthrough concerning their zero tolerance policy. While talk is good \nand I encourage it continue, we still have not resolved the underlying \nproblem. China is not importing our wheat. Thus the true measure of \nsuccess will be weighed in terms of action and reaction--both China's \ncommitment to dropping its ban and its importation of Pacific Northwest \nwheat.\n  On a broader scale, Mr. President, I believe that any agreement with \nChina must contain at a minimum, the following terms:\n  First, it must apply to three critical trade sectors: agriculture, \nmanufacturing, and financial services. We must ensure that China is \nwilling to trade fairly across the board with U.S. companies in each of \nthese sectors. The agreement should include significant tariff \nreductions, elimination of non-tariff barriers and other measures to \nliberalize trade in goods.\n  It should include market access for agriculture, including the \nelimination of phony health barriers on Pacific Northwest wheat, \ncitrus, meats and other products. And it should include liberalization \nof service sectors including distribution, telecommunications, finance, \nand audiovisual industries. Let me be very clear: China must agree to \naccept all WTO disciplines after a negotiated phase in. They should be \nafforded no special treatment.\n  Second, the agreement must be commercially viable, verifiable, and \nenforceable. Good words and good intentions are not enough, Mr. \nPresident. This must be a commercially powerful agreement. The American \npeople and American companies deserve to know that the words will be \nbacked up by actions. In other trade negotiations, some have proposed \nan annual report card to monitor progress.\n  Mr. President, I plan to review any accession agreement very \ncarefully. If necessary, I will carry legislation to ensure that \ncompliance with such an accession agreement is carefully monitored to \nensure that it is met in letter and spirit. For example, I think the \nconcept of a general safeguard which would allow unilateral sanctions \nif China failed to meet its commitments is the most important element. \nUse of this general safeguard should also be linked to an annual review \nof the agreement.\n  Third, and finally, I believe that the agreement should be coupled \nwith a showing of good-faith by China. Now, I don't want to prejudge \nthe on-going negotiations. Rather I want to wait and see what the \nresults of those negotiations are. But I don't think it is beyond \nreason to expect that a WTO accession agreement would include trade \ntargets or up-front purchase agreements for U.S. products.\n  But again, Mr. President, I am not in the room with the \nAdministration as they negotiate this agreement, and I want to leave \nthem some flexibility on this point. Let me reiterate that I mean \n``some'' flexibility and Mr. President, I can't emphasize this enough. \nFlexibility with Caution because we don't want an accession agreement \nwith China at any price. We do want an agreement must be fair and in \nthe best interests of the United States.\n  In particular I urge the Administration to closely scrutinize any \nagreement to make sure it meets this test and be vigilant about the \ndetails. And if the offer falls short of the mark, I would suggest that \nthe United States wait rather than push forward with this accession.\n\n\n                     STATEMENT TO SENATE COLLEAGUES\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to speak to my Senate colleagues today. \nIssues related to China can stir our passions. As we move forward with \nnegotiations on China's accession to WTO, I urge you to simply ``keep \nyour powder dry.'' Let's wait and take a look at the outcome of the \nnegotiations.\n  We must not lose sight of the vital American interests that are at \nstake. From our perspective, WTO accession can create a more reciprocal \ntrade relationship; promote the rule of law in China; and accelerate \nthe long-term trend toward China's integration into the world economy \nand the Pacific region.\n  And let me be absolutely clear. This is about more than wheat. The \nwhole spectrum of the U.S. economy stands to benefit from a \ncommercially powerful accession agreement with China. Agriculture, \nmanufacturing, and financial services--industries affecting literally \nevery state in the United States.\n  But, Mr. President, the WTO accession holds more at stake than the \ninterests of U.S. industries. This integration is, we should always \nremember, immensely important to our long-term security interests.\n  To choose one example, twenty-five years ago China would likely have \nseen the Asian financial crisis as an opportunity to destabilize the \ngovernments of Southeast Asia, South Korea and perhaps even Japan. \nToday China sees the crisis as a threat to its own investment and \nexport prospects, and has thus contributed to IMF recovery packages and \nmaintained currency stability. Thus China's policy has paralleled and \ncomplemented our own; and as a result, the Asian financial crisis \nremains an economic and humanitarian issue rather than a political and \nsecurity crisis.\n  From China's perspective, WTO entry has the long-term benefits of \nstrengthening guarantees of Chinese access to foreign markets and \npromoting competition and reform in the domestic economy; and the \nshort-term benefit of creating a new source of domestic and foreign \ninvestor confidence at a time of immense economic difficulty.\n  So I say to my Senate colleagues that we must review any agreement \ncarefully. Just as I have said that we should not accept it out of \nhand, so I do not believe that we should reject it out of hand. I \nbelieve that issues related to nuclear security, human rights and \nTaiwan are all important issues.\n  Mr. President, I believe that each of in the Senate need to take a \nclose look at the agreement and weigh it in the context of all U.S. \ninterests. Until we have done that, Mr. President, we should ``keep our \npowder dry.''\n\n\n                           STATEMENT TO CHINA\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, let me also send a message to \nChina. I believe that the window of opportunity for China's accession \nto the WTO is closing rapidly. The next WTO round begins in November in \nSeattle. If we cannot reach agreement on WTO accession, it may be many \nyears before this opportunity arises again.\n  Let me say this clearly to the Chinese leadership: If you are willing \nto negotiate in good faith, if you are willing to agree to a \ncommercially viable agreement and to eliminate phony barriers to the \nimport of Pacific-Northwest wheat and other products, then I will be \nwilling to support China's accession to the WTO. And I think that many \nof my colleagues feel the same way. But if you are not willing to take \nthat step; if you are not willing to agree to free and fair trade, then \nI will oppose China's accession to the WTO and I will urge the \nAdministration to join me in that opposition.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, China's pending accession must be \nconsidered carefully.\n  This Administration must closely scrutinize any agreement to ensure \nthat it meets the ``commercially powerful'' test. If the offer is \ngenuine and sound, the Administration should work toward an agreement, \nif it falls short, then the United States should wait.\n  We in the Senate should ``keep our powder dry.'' That is to let \ncalmer heads prevail by not pre-judging the agreement.\n  Instead we should play an active role in the negotiations and lend \nour input as we work toward a successful agreement.\n  And finally, China must make every effort to demonstrate its desire \nto enter the global marketplace by bringing forth a commercially \nmeaningful offer. The ball is in China's court.\n  In sum, I would say that Premier Zhu's visit offers us an immensely \nimportant opportunity to define the course of our overall U.S.-China \nrelationship. I welcome his visit and hope my colleagues and the \nAdministration will do the same.\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3577-5", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3577-S3579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CHINA'S WTO ACCESSION AND THE VISIT OF PREMIER ZHU RONGJI\n\n\n                          KEEP THE POWDER DRY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

This integration is, we should always \nremember, immensely important to our long-term security interests.\n  To choose one example, twenty-five years ago China would likely have \nseen the Asian financial crisis as an opportunity to destabilize the \ngovernments of Southeast Asia, South Korea and perhaps even Japan. \nToday China sees the crisis as a threat to its own investment and \nexport prospects, and has thus contributed to IMF recovery packages and \nmaintained currency stability. Thus China's policy has paralleled and \ncomplemented our own; and as a result, the Asian financial crisis \nremains an economic and humanitarian issue rather than a political and \nsecurity crisis.\n  From China's perspective, WTO entry has the long-term benefits of \nstrengthening guarantees of Chinese access to foreign markets and \npromoting competition and reform in the domestic economy; and the \nshort-term benefit of creating a new source of domestic and foreign \ninvestor confidence at a time of immense economic difficulty.\n  So I say to my Senate colleagues that we must review any agreement \ncarefully. Just as I have said that we should not accept it out of \nhand, so I do not believe that we should reject it out of hand. I \nbelieve that issues related to nuclear security, human rights and \nTaiwan are all important issues.\n  Mr. President, I believe that each of in the Senate need to take a \nclose look at the agreement and weigh it in the context of all U.S. \ninterests. Until we have done that, Mr. President, we should ``keep our \npowder dry.''\n\n\n                           STATEMENT TO CHINA\n\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, let me also send a message to \nChina. I believe that the window of opportunity for China's accession \nto the WTO is closing rapidly. The next WTO round begins in November in \nSeattle. If we cannot reach agreement on WTO accession, it may be many \nyears before this opportunity arises again.\n  Let me say this clearly to the Chinese leadership: If you are willing \nto negotiate in good faith, if you are willing to agree to a \ncommercially viable agreement and to eliminate phony barriers to the \nimport of Pacific-Northwest wheat and other products, then I will be \nwilling to support China's accession to the WTO. And I think that many \nof my colleagues feel the same way. But if you are not willing to take \nthat step; if you are not willing to agree to free and fair trade, then \nI will oppose China's accession to the WTO and I will urge the \nAdministration to join me in that opposition.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, China's pending accession must be \nconsidered carefully.\n  This Administration must closely scrutinize any agreement to ensure \nthat it meets the ``commercially powerful'' test. If the offer is \ngenuine and sound, the Administration should work toward an agreement, \nif it falls short, then the United States should wait.\n  We in the Senate should ``keep our powder dry.'' That is to let \ncalmer heads prevail by not pre-judging the agreement.\n  Instead we should play an active role in the negotiations and lend \nour input as we work toward a successful agreement.\n  And finally, China must make every effort to demonstrate its desire \nto enter the global marketplace by bringing forth a commercially \nmeaningful offer. The ball is in China's court.\n  In sum, I would say that Premier Zhu's visit offers us an immensely \nimportant opportunity to define the course of our overall U.S.-China \nrelationship. I welcome his visit and hope my colleagues and the \nAdministration will do the same.\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/senate-section/article/S3579-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 12 NOON MONDAY, APRIL 12, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
