Mr. President, first, before we get on to today's \nschedule, I wish to commend my friend, the guest Chaplain, this \nmorning. Father Damian is extended best wishes and thanks from this \nbody. Father Damian and I share a few things in common. One is we \ngraduated from the same high school just a few years apart--actually, \nMr. President, many years apart. Father Damian had the unenviable task \nof trying to redefine the standards that my brothers and I debased at \nSt. Bonaventure High School and Scotus High School in Columbus, NE--not \nan easy task but one that he achieved with great dignity and success.\n  We are very proud of Father Damian for many reasons. He is pastor of \ntwo Catholic parishes in Omaha--St. Agnes and Our Lady of Guadalupe in \nsouth Omaha.\n  Mr. President, you know a little bit about ethnic areas, coming from \nColorado. Father Damian has done as much to bring the Hispanic \ncommunity of Nebraska--indeed, middle America--together as any one \nindividual I have known in the last few years, and he has done it with \nremarkable ability, with common sense and truth. People respect him not \njust because he wears the Lord's uniform but because he has done it the \nright way; he brings respect and dignity to all whom he touches; he \nconveys that as he deals with people. We are very proud of what he has \nbeen able to accomplish in our community and across the Midwest, aside \nfrom being nationally recognized for his achievements with many \nrecognitions and honors. We are very proud to have him among us this \nmorning.\n  And again, on a personal note, it is wonderful to see Father Damian \nafter making the trek to Washington. Under the able tutelage of our \nresident Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, I know he has learned much this \nmorning.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend from Nebraska yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I think it is appropriate to say in front of the good \npriest that people in Nebraska are well served by the two Senators who \ncome from Nebraska. I am sure he is very proud of the work Senator \nHagel and Senator Kerrey perform for Nebraska in the Senate.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Senator. As a matter of fact, as the Senator \nknows, there was a little reception and party for my distinguished \nsenior colleague, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, last night. Father Damian \nwas able to participate and extend his long arm of justice and \nspiritual guidance over that gathering, even in the midst of some \nbandits who attended. The real coup de grace of last night's event was \nthe distinguished senior Senator from New York toasting our colleague, \nSenator Kerrey--an old Navy toast. I observed that I never believed \nthat serving in the Navy was a particular virtue, but nonetheless he \nwas toasted with the Senator's eloquent remarks.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8535-6", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8535-S8536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, prescription medication is one of the most \nsignificant issues before the family of America. Unfortunately, the \nfamily is hearing most of this through 30-second television ads. These \nads tend to be long on rhetoric and short on substance.\n  I hope the Senate can serve its national purpose as a great \ndeliberative body by bringing some deeper focus on an issue which \naffects, in the most intimate way, tens of millions of our citizens. I \nhope I can contribute to this by a series of floor statements on \ndifferent aspects of this important national issue of prescription \nmedication, especially for older Americans.\n  Older Americans often must take their medicine on a daily basis. It \nis important that the Senate also get a daily dose of reality of life \nfor those older Americans. I invite my colleagues with similar or \ndiffering perspectives to join me so we can have a daily discussion on \nthis important issue. I am pleased today to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, and invite others to join.\n  We have before the Senate the opportunity to achieve a broadly shared \nobjective--reforming Medicare. Many of my colleagues have discussed \nMedicare reform in the context of administrative changes and \norganizational restructuring. While there is certainly merit to that \ndiscussion, I believe the most fundamental reform that must be made to \nthe Medicare program is changing Medicare from a program that is based \non acute care, illness, treatment after the fact, and to move it to a \nprogram that emphasizes prevention, wellness, and the maintenance of \nthe quality of life. That is the fundamental reform we must make in \nMedicare.\n  To accomplish this shift we must first recognize that the face of \nhealth care has changed dramatically since the inception of Medicare in \n1965. Thirty-five years ago, America's health care system was almost \nwholly reacting. Patients sought help from chronic conditions that \nflared up, or waited to see a doctor when acute conditions hit or if \nthey had a serious accident. Their care was typically delivered in \nhospitals. Medicare responded to this acute care, hospital-based health \ncare system.\n  The fundamental reason the program was structured as such was based \non the fact that most Americans lived only a few years after they \nreached retirement. As we know from our colleague, Senator Moynihan, \nthe original rationale for 65 as the basis of retirement was the fact \nthat date was set in Europe at the end of the 19th century when the \naverage life expectancy of a European male was only 62. There was a \nhigh degree of cynicism in the selection of that date. That date has \ncontinued to be an important part of our culture. Only a few decades \nago the average American could only expect 7 years of life expectancy \nafter they reached 65. Today the average American has almost 20 years \nof life expectancy after they reach the age of 65, and by the end of \nthis century an American can expect almost 30 years of life expectancy \nafter attaining the age of 65.\n  We must reform Medicare to assure that today's seniors can spend that \ngift of years living healthy, productive lives. This can be done if we \nmake an investment in prevention care, which\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\nincludes screening, early intervention, and the management of the \nconditions which are detected through those early interventions.\n  The Medicare program should treat illness before it happens. New \npreventive screening and counseling benefits of the Medicare program \ngive us that opportunity. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and \nthe Institute of Medicine have recommended to the Congress that we add \nnew preventive screening and benefits to the Medicare program. These \nbenefits will address some of the most prominent underlying risk \nfactors for illness that face all Medicare benificiaries. These include \ncoverage for medical nutrition therapy for seniors with diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease or renal disease, screening for hypertension, \ncounseling for tobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling \nfor hormone replacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing, \nexpanded screening and counseling for osteoporosis, and screening for \ncholesterol.\n\n  In addition to adding to our current relatively short list of \npreventive efforts within Medicare, we need to change the basic \nstructure of how Medicare goes about determining when a new preventive \nmethodology is both medically appropriate and cost effective. Today we \nrely upon the conventional congressional process to add new prevention \nmethodologies. What I believe we should do is to establish a scientific \nnonpartisan basis to arrive at these determinations. I suggest we \nassign this responsibility to the Institute of Medicine and direct that \ninstitute conduct ongoing studies of prevention methodologies to assess \ntheir scientific validity and economic cost effectiveness. When they \nmake such a determination, they should submit it to Congress, and \nCongress, using a fast-track process, as we typically do in trade \nmatters, would make a determination either to accept or reject but not \nto modify those recommendations made by a scientific panel. I believe \nthat approach would assure us that we would be providing to our older \ncitizens the most modern scientifically tested means of maintaining a \nhigh standard of living.\n  It is critical that we assure Medicare beneficiaries, both present \nand future, those most appropriate health care possibilities. By making \npreventive care the cornerstone of Medicare reform, we can do just \nthat.\n  This discussion of a new Medicare, a Medicare focused on wellness, \nreminds me of an anecdote. A man walks into the doctor's office and the \ndoctor says: I have both good news and bad news. The good news is that \nbecause we have done a screening process we have detected your disease \nearly and we have the opportunity to prescribe the medicines and other \nmedical treatments to stop its spread and reverse its adverse effect on \nyour health. The bad news is you cannot afford the medicine to do this.\n  Sadly, this is not a joke. The list of diseases that were once fatal \nand are now preventable is long and growing. Years ago, people with \nhigh cholesterol could almost count on developing heart disease. Today, \ncholesterol levels can be kept in check with a number of drugs. One of \nthose is Lipitor, a widely prescribed drug for high cholesterol. This \ndrug has an average yearly cost of nearly $700. As with many other \nnear-miracle drugs, Lipitor is too expensive for many seniors. Yet \nMedicare, the Nation's commitment to take care of its elderly and \ndisabled, does not cover Lipitor or most other outpatient drugs. \nMedicare will, however, pay for the surgery after the heart attack \nwhich that man is likely to have because he was unable to treat his \ncondition while it was still subject to management.\n  That policy may have made sense in 1965 when the man would only live \na few years after retirement. Are we prepared in the year 2000 to tell \nan American who reaches 65 and has an average of almost 20 years of \nlife expectancy that we are going to treat them only after they have a \nheart attack; that is the point when we are going to provide access to \nthe means of managing a health condition?\n  I will soon address the critical link between prescription \nmedications and preventive medicine. Prevention and prescription drugs \nare a key to a modern health care system for our Nation's seniors. This \nSenate should contribute to delivering that key, and do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8537-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8537-S8538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  First of all, I commend my friend and colleague from Florida on an \nexcellent presentation and one that commends itself to the common sense \nof all of us in the Senate.\n  The fact is the Medicare program was built upon the existing programs \nin 1965. Since that time, we have discovered the importance of \npreventive health care--how important it is in keeping people healthy \nand how important it is for actually saving Medicare funds over a long \nperiod of time. The Senator from Florida has indicated a pathway we \nmight follow to deal seriously with these issues. We should not have to \nexplain to this body that for every $1 we spend for immunizations, we \nsave $8 to $9 by preventing disease.\n  I admire and am a strong supporter of the administration's series of \nrecommendations for preventive care. The Senator from Florida has \noutlined a process and system where we can finally take action on these \nrecommendations.\n  The bottom line is the Budget Committee doesn't take into \nconsideration the savings from preventive care so this body has been \nextremely slow in enacting these programs. But these preventive \nmeasures make a great deal of sense. They make sense for ensuring good \nquality health care for the families of this country, and they make \nsound economic sense. I certainly agree with the Senator that along \nwith preventive care, we ought to understand the importance of \nprescription drugs. I think what he has outlined today is enormously \nimportant for us to consider.\n  I will take a few moments to move beyond this very excellent \npresentation into what the challenge is for all of us in the Congress \nover these next 5 weeks. There is time, I believe, to take action on a \ngood prescription drug program. We have, now, two different systems \nwhich have been offered to the American people. The first is the \nproposal that was advanced initially by President Clinton and is now \nenhanced by Vice President Gore. The proposal has been changed--not \nreally dramatically--but I think it has been more carefully attuned to \nthe needs of Medicare enrollees than the alternative which has been \npresented by Governor Bush.\n  I hope even in the short time that remains--when we conclude the \naction on trade issues we still have more than 3 weeks of Senate time--\nI hope we can still take action on a minimum wage. Every Member of this \nbody knows that issue well. We know what is before us. We ought to take \naction on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have a bipartisan effort to \ntry to do that. There have been some suggestions and recommendations in \norder to accommodate some of those who voted against this previously. \nWe now, hopefully, will gain support for those proposals.\n  Finally, and very importantly, the other remaining issue which is of \nvital importance to seniors is a prescription drug program. Let me \nmention quickly some of the concerns I have about this program and some \nof the advantages that I believe are in the Vice President's program.\n  The Vice President's program is built upon Medicare. We have heard on \nthe floor of the Senate the Medicare system is a one-size-fits-all \nprogram. The fact is that seniors understand Medicare. They support \nMedicare. They understand there have to be some changes in the Medicare \nprogram but, nonetheless, it is a tried, tested process and it is one \nwhich offers the necessary flexibility.\n  What has been proposed by the Vice President is a prescription drug \nprogram that goes into effect a year from now, and is gradually phased \nin over a period of time. The seniors of this country would have a \nbenefit for prescription drugs a year from now. I think that is very \nimportant and one of the most compelling parts of the Vice President's \nprogram.\n  The alternative is the proposal offered by Governor Bush. I read here \nfrom the Governor's own proposal. It says in his proposal that \neffectively it will be a block grant program that will in effect ensure \nlow-income seniors do not have to wait for overall reform.\n\n  Our seniors ought to have some pause, because he is talking about\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\noverall reform of the Medicare system. That ought to bring some pause. \nWe do not really know what overall reform is. I think most seniors \nwould say: We have confidence in the Medicare system. We want a program \nthat will get the benefits to us quickly.\n  He says that low-income people will not have to wait for the overall \nreform. We are not sure what that really means. To have your \nprescription drugs covered, Governor Bush will establish the immediate \nhelping hand which will provide $48 billion to States for 4 years to \ndeal with low income seniors. So it will be 4 years before 27 million \nseniors will be able to participate because there are 27 million \nseniors who do not fall within Governor Bush's definition of those who \nneed an immediate helping hand. Those 27 million seniors will wait 4 \nyears--and then wait for the overall Medicare reform. The Vice \nPresident's plan goes into effect 1 year from now.\n  Second--and I think enormously important--is what we call the \nguaranteed benefit. This is very simple. A guaranteed benefit means the \ndoctor will make the decision on your prescription drug needs. When \nseniors go in--whatever their condition, whatever their disease, \nwhatever their problem--the doctor makes the recommendation as to what \nprescription drug is needed. That is fundamental. That is the \nguaranteed benefit.\n  That is not true with regard to the Governor's proposal. It will be \nthe HMO that the individual is enrolled in that will decide. We will \nfind that the HMO will make the decision about what prescription drugs \nare covered--whether it will be the only drug on the HMO's formulary, \nor whether other kinds of prescription drugs will be permitted to be \nused.\n  That is interesting, is it not, Mr. President? Most seniors want the \ndoctor to make the recommendation. This underlies the basic difference \nbetween our two parties on the prescription drug issue.\n  We are for the Patients' Bill of Rights so doctors are allowed to \nmake health care decisions. We want to make sure that doctors are going \nto make decisions about prescription drugs rather than turning this \nright over to the HMO.\n  Finally, what is being established under the Gore proposal is very \nclear. The government and the Medicare beneficiary will have a shared \nresponsibility in paying for prescription drugs. There will not be any \ndeductibles. There will be a premium, and half of the premium will be \npaid for by the Federal Government.\n  Under the Bush proposal, we do not know what the HMO is going to \ncharge. There is no prohibition against a deductible and we do not know \nwhat the copayments will be. We have no idea what the premium will be. \nThe Governor says the government will pay 25 percent of whatever the \npremium is, but there is no assurance to seniors that there is not \ngoing to be a sizable deductible in that program. The size of the \ndeductible is a mystery.\n  Under the Vice President's program, we can give assurance today that \nwhen the program goes into effect, as part of the Medicare program, \nwhatever that senior citizen needs, if the doctor prescribes it, that \nsenior citizen will get it.\n  Those who are opposed to Vice President Gore's program, who support \nthe Governor's proposal, cannot make that claim. They cannot tell us \nwhat the premiums are going to be over a period of time because they \nare not spelled out, at least in the papers that have been made \navailable.\n  The only thing that we know--which causes many of us a great deal of \nconcern--is that after 4 years, after overall reform of the Medicare \nsystem, then there will be a program for prescription drugs. That is a \nlong time to wait. That is a very long time to wait. What I have found \nin my State is that people want a prescription drug program and they \nneed it now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 8 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the final points I want to make are that \n70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, more than 27 million seniors, \nwill not even be eligible for Governor Bush's immediate helping hand \nprogram.\n  Finally, the nation's Governors have already rejected the block grant \napproach. Republican and Democratic Governors have said: This will be a \nmassive administrative nightmare for our States; we do not want the \nresponsibility even if it is going to be funded. We can understand \nthat.\n  We have an important opportunity to make a difference for our seniors \nwith a good prescription drug program. Let's reach across the aisle. \nLet's join forces. Let's try to get the job done before we recess. The \nopportunity is there. We are willing to do that, but we need to have a \nresponse from the other side and a willingness of the Republican \nleadership to try to get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Idaho has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, while I came to the floor to speak on \nanother issue, before I do that, I want to respond to the remarks of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts.\n  There is a very real difference between what Vice President Gore is \ntalking about and Gov. George Bush is talking about. Senator Kennedy \nhas effectively outlined it today. Senator Kennedy said let the \nGovernment run your health care; let the Government make your choices; \nlet the Government control the process.\n  The seniors of America do want choice. They want the same kind of \nhealth program Senator Kennedy has and this Senator has. They want \nchoice, and they want flexibility in the marketplace. That is the kind \nof program we are talking about offering them.\n  I cannot imagine we would want another federalized health care \nprogram where the Government tells the senior community of our country \nwhat kind of prescription drug they will get and where they will get \nit.\n  Those are very real differences that I am afraid were avoided in the \ncomments this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8538-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8538-S8539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FALN CLEMENCY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about a \nsignificant date in this Nation's fight against terrorism. This week \nmarks the Clinton-Gore administration's decision to jeopardize American \nlives by surrendering to one of the most violent terrorist groups ever \nto operate on this country's soil.\n  One year ago this week, President Clinton opened the jailhouse doors \nfor 11 members of a terrorist group known as the FALN, which is \ndedicated to the violent pursuit of Puerto Rican independence. The FALN \nhas claimed responsibility for some 130 bombings at civilian, \npolitical, and military sites in the United States. In all, the group \nmurdered six Americans and maimed, often permanently, 84 others, \nincluding law enforcement officers.\n  On one occasion, members attacked a Navy bus in Puerto Rico killing \ntwo sailors and wounding nine others. As a result, 16 members of this \nviolent terrorist group were convicted of dozens of felonies against \nthe United States, and as soon as these 16 were in prison, the bombings \nstopped.\n  I note that these violent terrorists were convicted of at least 36 \ncounts of violating Federal firearms control laws. So at the same time \nthe Clinton-Gore administration was demanding more gun control--and we \nhave heard it for hours and hours on end on the floor of the Senate and \ncertainly the White House has spoken openly for gun control over the \nlast number of years--not only were they failing to enforce current gun \nlaws already on the books, but when those laws are enforced, they brush \naside felony convictions as a political favor to their friends.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for a \nmoment to speak specifically about how this administration has \nmishandled the gun control laws of our Nation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will add to my friend's thoughtful \nanalysis. This is yet another example of the President's apparent lack \nof concern for the rule of law. All year long, the administration has \nberated the Republican majority for not doing enough on controlling gun \nviolence. Yet at the same time, by releasing these terrorists, he has \nset aside 36 specific Federal firearms convictions pertaining to:\n  Possessing an unregistered firearm;\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\n  Possession of firearms during the commission of seditious conspiracy;\n  Transport of firearms with intent to commit seditious conspiracy;\n  Possession of firearm without a serial number;\n  Conspiracy to make destructive devices.\n  Let there be no mistake, these were not people merely exercising \ntheir first amendment right of freedom of speech. They are responsible \nfor the deaths of six Americans and the injury of at least 84 others.\n  One has to wonder why the administration will not simply enforce \nexisting law. The record shows the Clinton-Gore administration has not \nenforced Federal gun laws, and more disturbing, they have conveniently \nforgotten the law if it suits their political ends. I believe the \nPresident's efforts for these terrorists were just that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. He so \nclearly spells out the frustration Americans have when we are going to \nbe tough against terrorism and then see a President offering clemency.\n  In 1982, the FALN detonated four powerful bombs in New York's \nfinancial district and demanded better treatment for 11 of their jailed \ncomrades and members. One year ago this week, President Clinton freed 8 \nof those 11, shredding the longstanding policy of the United States of \nnot granting concessions to terrorists.\n  Any reasonable American has to ask, Why would the President do it? \nWhat is he doing setting violent terrorists free to once again roam the \nstreets of America? None of these terrorists contested the evidence \nbrought against them at trial. None of these terrorists apologized to \ntheir victims. In fact, at least one of the freed terrorists stated \nthat he felt no remorse whatsoever for his crimes. None of these \nterrorists were ever asked to be let out of prison. The FBI asked the \nPresident not to do it. The Federal Bureau of Prisons asked the \nPresident not to do it.\n  Had he bothered to ask the victims of the FALN and their families, \nthey would have begged him not to do it. He did it anyway, and we are \nnot quite sure why.\n  Internal White House documents tell us, ``The Vice President's Puerto \nRican position would be helped,'' clearly demonstrating an impulse to \njeopardize public safety for political gain. Political gain by setting \nterrorists loose.\n  A former political adviser to President Clinton put it this way:\n\n       Anyone who doesn't believe the timing, and the likely \n     substance of [President Clinton's] decision was linked to the \n     [First Lady's] courtship of New York's large Puerto Rican \n     [community] is too naive for politics.\n\n  If there is one thing this administration has accomplished in its 8 \nyears, it is to shatter my naivete or my trust that when the President \nstands up and speaks, that there is not some political or clandestine \nmotive behind his very actions.\n  One year later, what do we have? Eleven violent terrorists at large \non our streets; two more to be released this coming year. True, there \nhave not been any killings that we can link to the terrorists since \nthat time, but they are loose on the streets of America demonstrating \nat least that this President has violated a cardinal rule in our \ncountry: the United States does not make concessions to terrorists.\n  For that action, one year ago today, Democrats and Republicans stood \non this floor and condemned this deplorable act. Interestingly, when I \nbegan to look into this, I saw that Al Gore's running mate Senator Joe \nLieberman stood up to the President and condemned his actions. Even the \nFirst Lady stood up to the President and condemned his actions. Just \nabout the only politician in Washington who has yet to stand up to Bill \nClinton is Vice President Al Gore.\n  As Vice President of the United States, Al Gore could have \nintervened. He could have talked to the President, said that this is \nmadness to let terrorists loose after they have been convicted, to \nshred gun control laws. But Al Gore did not lift a finger to protect \nthe FALN's next victims. All he said was, quote:\n\n       I'm not going to stand in judgment of his decision.\n\n  Not going to stand in judgment? When a madman killed 168 people in a \nsingle bombing in Oklahoma City, Al Gore said, and I quote:\n\n       [T]o those of you who doubt our resolve in America, listen \n     closely. If you plot terror or act on those designs, within \n     our borders or without, against American citizens, we will \n     hunt you down and stop you cold.\n\n  I guess what he is saying is: Bomb innocent Americans, and Al Gore \nwill stop you cold. But if you use small bombs, and you only kill a few \nAmericans, and you fit our political needs, then we will release you.\n  Mr. Vice President, maybe it is time you stand up and clarify for \nAmerica what you really believe.\n  Mr. Vice President, how hard is it to say: ``Violent terrorists \nbelong in jail''? How hard is it to say: ``I will not reward \nterrorism''? How hard is it to tell the American people: ``I will not \nrelease violent terrorists from prison for political gain''?\n  Al Gore is going to be in Manhattan today. I hope he will visit the \ncorner of Pearl and Broad Streets where Bill Newhall was maimed, and \nwhere Frank Connor, Alex Berger, Harold Sherburne, and Jim Gezork lost \ntheir lives to an FALN bomb. Perhaps that will help Al Gore make up his \nmind.\n  Or perhaps Al Gore should ask his running mate, Senator Joe \nLieberman, how to stand up to Bill Clinton. Maybe Senator Lieberman \ncould convince his running mate to stand up for the rights of innocent \nAmericans against those who perpetrate violence. Maybe then Al Gore can \nprevent the President from putting more American lives in jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8539-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8539-S8565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                      REPUBLIC OF CHINA--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on H.R. 4444. The time is under \ncontrol.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six hours evenly divided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4134\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4134.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour on this amendment equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have tried, in my feeble ability here \nover the years, to get the Senate to pay attention to the lack of a \ncompetitive trade policy. I had hoped on this PNTR, permanent normal \ntrade relations, with China that we might have a good debate with \nrespect to our trade policy--whether or not the American people approve \nof it and whether there are some adjustments that should be made. \nMeanwhile our trade deficit goes up, up, and away.\n  I was a Senator here in the early 1980s when we had a positive \nbalance of trade. I remember when it reached a $100 billion deficit in \nthe balance of trade; and there were all kinds of headline articles \nback in the 1980s, that--Chicken Little--the sky was going to fall, and \neverything else like that.\n  Now we have been numbed. It has gone to $100, $200, $300 billion, and \nit approximates to a $400 billion deficit in the balance of trade. They \ndon't even discuss it in the Presidential campaign. And they absolutely \nrefuse to discuss it in the world's most deliberative body. They refuse \nto deliberate.\n  They bring a fixed bill to the floor. And it is terribly tough to \ntalk to a fixed jury. But that is the way it is. The jury is fixed. The \nlegislation is fixed. There are no amendments. We send this to the \nPresident.\n  The National Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the \nConference Board and the National Association of Manufacturers are \ncontinuing their export of the industrial backbone of this Nation. \nObviously, they make a bigger profit. They could care less about the \ncountry.\n  In fact, years back, the chairman of the board of Caterpillar said: \nWe are not an American company, we are international.\n  Not long ago, earlier this year, the head of Boeing said: Oh no, we \nare not a United States company, we are an international company.\n  And the best of the best, Jack Welch of GE says: We are not going to \nbuy\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nfrom our suppliers unless they send those jobs down to Mexico.\n  There is a good, wonderful Business Week article about that--we are \nlimited in time or I would read it--but that is exactly what he said. \nUnless his subcontractors went to Mexico, he was going to do business \nwith those who had gone. So we are in one heck of a fix.\n  They do not understand trade. Free trade is, of course, an oxymoron. \nTrade is an exchange for something. It is not to give something for \nnothing. It is not aid. But we have been treating foreign trade--free \ntrade--as foreign aid.\n  They just ipso facto in those polls: Are you for free trade?\n  Oh, I am for free trade, obviously.\n  Obviously, they are trying to say: I am for trade without \nrestrictions and barriers.\n  But mind you me, we are all for world peace, but we do not disband \nthe Pentagon. As the father of the country said: The best way to \npreserve the peace is to prepare for war.\n  The best way to obtain free trade is not to roll over, as we have for \nthe past 50 years, and plead and cry and moan and groan: fair, fair, \nfair, fair.\n\n  Whoever heard of anybody in business being fair? In America, \nbusiness, unfortunately, is solely for profit. Do not give us any of \nthese ``fairness doctrines'' of the board of directors of corporate \nAmerica. You have to be able to raise a barrier in order to remove a \nbarrier. You have to compete. All we need is a competitive trade \npolicy.\n  In that light, let me say at the outset, I am not against China. All \nof these amendments have been very good ones with respect to the human \nrights in China, with respect to weapons of mass destruction, with \nChina not keeping its commitments, and so forth. Why should they keep \ntheir commitments? Japan never has. Come on. Korea knows that. China \nlearns. Monkey see, monkey do. They said: All you have to do is puff \nand blow. We'll get together. And America--the United States--will roll \nover.\n  So don't come around here berating China. Buy yourself a mirror and \nlook in it. It is the Senate. Article 1, section 8, of the Constitution \nsays: The Congress shall regulate foreign commerce--not the President, \nnot the Supreme Court, not the Special Trade Representative, but the \nCongress of the United States. And although the Trade Representative is \nrunning around trying to forge new agreements that contradict our laws, \neven those, if they are to take the force and effect of law, have to be \nin the form of a treaty ratified by this Senate.\n  So we are way out of kilter and acting with total disregard. We have \ngone, from the end of World War II, from 41 percent of our workforce in \nmanufacturing down to 12 percent. The Department of Commerce just \nreported this last month of August, we lost 69,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  I will never forget the exchange with the former head of Sony up in \nChicago. He was lecturing the Third World, the emerging nations, and \nsaid for them to become a nation-state, they had to develop a \nmanufacturing capacity. Somewhat afterward, pointing at me, he said: By \nthe way, Senator, that world power that loses its manufacturing \ncapacity will cease to be a world power.\n  The security of the United States is like a three-legged stool. The \none leg, of course, is our values. We are respected the world around \nfor our commitment to freedom and human rights. The second leg, \nobviously, is the military, the superpower. But the third economic leg \nhas been fractured over the past 50 years, as we have made a very \nsuccessful attempt to conquer communism with capitalism. We sent over \nthe Marshall Plan. We sent over the technology. We sent over the \nexpertise. But we rolled over with respect to actually enforcing any \nkind of trade policy.\n  I testified, some 40 years ago, before the old International Tariff \nCommission. Tom Dewey ran me around the room. The argument was: \nGovernor, what do you expect these emerging countries, coming out of \nthe ruins of the war, what do you expect them to make? Let them and the \nThird World countries, let them make the shoes and the clothing, and we \nwill make the airplanes and the computers.\n  Now I stand on the floor, and our global competition, they make the \nshoes. They make the clothing. They make the airplanes. They make the \ncomputers. They make it all. And we are going out of business.\n  And as we go out of business, they say this particular initiative, \nPNTR, is good for business. It is good for their profit, but not, in \nthe long run, good for business, no. They have to have employees. And \ndon't worry about the productivity of the U.S. industrial worker. We \nhave been for 30-some years now rated not only by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics but by the international economic section of the United \nNations as having the most productive industrial worker in the entire \nworld.\n  They are working harder and harder and longer hours and are getting \npaid less than they are in Germany, paid less than they are in Japan \nand several other countries. The U.S. industrial worker is not \noverpaid, and he is not underworked. He works more hours than any other \nindustrial worker.\n  Here we are, in the Senate, blabbing, be fair, whining, be fair, be \nfair. We continue to heap on the cost of doing business--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, safe working place, safe \nmachinery, plant closing notice, parental leave. You can go right on \ndown the list of all of these things we think up, and we, on a \nbipartisan basis, support them all. That goes into the cost of doing \nbusiness. So since NAFTA, 38,700 jobs have left the little State of \nSouth Carolina and gone down to Mexico where none of those conditions I \njust mentioned are required, and they have the audacity to stand in the \nwell and say NAFTA worked.\n  They told us at the time of the NAFTA vote it was going to create \njobs; 200,000 is the figure they used. The Chamber of Commerce, the \nNAM, Business Roundtable, the Secretary of Commerce, the President of \nthe United States: We are going to create 200,000 jobs.\n  We have lost 440,000 textile jobs alone since NAFTA. I don't know how \nmany jobs they have lost up in New Hampshire, but I am confident I can \ngo over to the Department of Labor and find out. Jobs are our greatest \nexport. Export, export, from those who have never really been in \ntrade--I practiced customs law--they keep hollering, export, export. \nThe biggest export we have is our jobs.\n  I am not against China. I am against us. That is who I am trying to \nawaken with these amendments, trying to engage in a debate so we can \nlearn from a country with a $350- to $400 billion trade deficit, \ncosting 1 percent of our GNP. They keep saying: Watch out, that dollar \nis going to have to be devalued. You watch it, when that happens, \ninterest rates go up. Then they will all be whining around here.\n\n  I remember the little $5 billion we put in some 25 years ago--we were \ntrying to create jobs--$5 billion for the highways, just to advance \nhighway construction, just to create jobs. Five billion? We have lost \nbillions of dollars just this last month, way more than $5 billion in \njobs; I can tell you that.\n  The idea is, as President Lincoln said, and there is no quote more \nappropriate:\n\n       The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy \n     present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we \n     must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must \n     think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and \n     then we shall save our country.\n\n  That was in his annual message to the Congress back in December of \n1862. We must disenthrall ourselves. We must act anew, think anew, \ndisenthrall ourselves, and try to save us, the great Yankee trader from \nNew Hampshire, and all of those other Northeastern States. We had all \nthis agriculture down South, and we believed in all that international \ntrade. That was the Civil War. That famous Yankee trader has rolled \nover now, and he has gone overseas.\n  We are definitely not against China. I could talk at length about \ntheir human rights policy. Their first human right is to feed 1.3 \nbillion. The second is to house 1.3 billion. The third is to educate \n1.3 billion. The fourth is one man, one vote. But, of course, the \npoliticians are running around on the floor of the Congress: We want \none man, one vote. You travel there. I was there in 1976 and 1986 and \n1996. You go there and you see the progress towards capitalism.\n  I am for continued trade. I have offered to cut out the ``permanent'' \nso I\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\ncould continue this dialog with my colleagues on the floor to try to \nget something going of a competitive nature.\n  We certainly don't go along with Tiananmen Square and everything else \nsuch as that, but it works for the Chinese. Suppose you were the head \nof China. If you let one demonstration get out of hand, another one \ngets out of hand. You have total chaos, with a population of 1.3 \nbillion. Then nothing gets done. So there has to be some kind of \ntraumatic control; let's be realistic. Don't berate them about their \nenvironment right now. It took us 200 years, and we still don't have \nthese waste dumps cleaned up. We still don't have clean air in certain \nStates. Workers' rights, we haven't gotten all of our workers' rights. \nThey don't have a right to a job because they are fast disappearing. \nThat is what it is all about. And it is not against business.\n  Jerry Jasinowski, the distinguished head of the National Association \nof Manufacturers, put an article in yesterday's New York Times, \nentitled ``Gore's War on Business.'' I ask unanimous consent to print \nthe article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the New York Times, September 13, 2000]\n\n                         Gore's War on Business\n\n                        (By Jerry J. Jasinowski)\n\n       I've known Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman for years. They are \n     smart, capable men who have a pretty good handle on what \n     makes our economy tick. But judging from their comments in \n     recent days, I'm a bit bewildered. In his speeches, Mr. Gore \n     attacked ``big oil,'' ``the pharmaceutical companies,'' ``big \n     polluters''--in short, corporate America in general.\n       He seems quite willing to play the populist card even if it \n     distorts the record of corporations, fosters antagonism \n     between company leadership and workers and encourages the \n     very stereotyping that, on other fronts, the Democratic Party \n     claims to be against.\n       Suddenly business is the enemy. Why, I'm not sure, since \n     the Clinton-Gore team takes such great pains to boast about \n     the economic achievements of the past eight years, including \n     the 22 million new jobs generated by the free enterprise \n     system. Consider the words of Mr. Lieberman in his recent \n     book, ``In Praise of Public Life'': ``We New Democrats \n     believe that the booming economy of the 1990's resulted more \n     from private sector innovation, investment and hard work than \n     from government action.''\n       Mr. Lieberman got it right. The men and women who make \n     things in America, from skilled workers on the factory floor \n     to innovators in the company lab, have fueled these \n     achievements.\n       And these workers have been duly rewarded. Today's \n     manufacturing jobs provide an average yearly compensation of \n     $49,000 per worker, nearly 17 percent higher than in the \n     private sector overall.\n       But great success of business in creating good jobs seems \n     to be lost in this campaign. Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman are \n     creating an atmosphere of division between employers and \n     employees at a time when workers and their employers are \n     partners as never before. The newfound angry populism of the \n     Gore-Lieberman ticket distorts the true picture of the \n     American economy and fosters resentment rather than \n     cooperation.\n       As another centrist Democrat, the late Senator Paul \n     Tsongas, said in his speech at the 1992 Democratic \n     Convention, ``You cannot redistribute wealth you never \n     created. You can't be pro-jobs and anti-business at the same \n     time. You cannot love employment and hate employers.''\n       This year's Democratic ticket would do well to heed these \n     wise words.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. These workers, he says, have been duly rewarded. Not at \nall. He talks about the manufacturing pay is less than their \ncompetition, that they are working long hours. They haven't been duly \nrewarded. What is the unease, the anxiety that they are talking about? \nThe anxiety they are talking about is having the job. The great success \nof business in creating good jobs seems to be lost. He should have read \nthe release put out the day before.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this NAM report on manufacturing \ntrade printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNew NAM Report on Manufacturing Trade Finds NAFTA Responsible for Half \n                     of U.S. Export Growth in 2000\n\n       Washington, D.C., August 29, 2000--The National Association \n     of Manufacturers today released the first in a new series of \n     quarterly reports on manufactured goods exports and imports \n     based on Commerce Department data. Manufactured goods \n     dominate U.S. trade, comprising 90 percent of U.S. \n     merchandise exports and 85 percent of merchandise imports.\n       The new data, which analyze detailed U.S. manufacturing \n     trade by both industry and geographic region, show that NAFTA \n     member countries accounted for an astonishing 54 percent of \n     total manufactured goods export growth for the first half of \n     the year.\n       ``The fact that exports to Canada and Mexico are \n     contributing more to export growth than exports to Asia, \n     Europe and the rest of the world combined clearly shows NAFTA \n     is a big plus to U.S. manufacturers, and underscores the \n     importance of further trade liberalization to the future \n     vitality of American industry'' said NAM President Jerry \n     Jasinowski.\n       Manufacturers' exports to and imports from NAFTA both were \n     up 18 percent over the first half of 1999, Jasinowski said, \n     noting that Mexico accounted for most of the U.S. export \n     growth, and Canada for the bulk of the import growth from \n     NAFTA.\n       For the first half of 2000, US manufactured exports overall \n     are up 12 percent compared to the first six months of 1999, \n     Jasinowski said. ``This is a significant turnaround. This \n     time last year, U.S. exports were down by 2 percent. At the \n     same time, strong domestic demand is pulling in imports at a \n     rate of around 20 percent. This is more than double the pace \n     of last year.''\n       Of the total $228 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit so \n     far this year, 77 percent has been in manufacturing. While \n     the expanding trade deficits in recent years have been due, \n     in part, to a slowdown in economic growth abroad, the trade \n     imbalance in 2000 is fueled primarily by a very robust \n     domestic economy and a strong dollar.\n       Manufactured goods trade highlights for the first half of \n     2000 include:\n\n\n                            geographic trade\n\n       Manufactured goods exports to NAFTA rose 18 percent in \n     first half of 2000, accounting for more than half of \n     manufactured goods export growth to the world. Exports to \n     Mexico alone increased by 30 percent during the first six \n     months of 2000, and have accounted for nearly one-third of \n     total U.S. manufactured goods export growth so far this year.\n       Imports from NAFTA have contributed 28 percent of \n     manufactures import growth thus far this year. The majority \n     was from Canada; Mexico accounted for only 13 percent.\n       Asia contributed 26 percent of U.S. manufactured goods \n     export growth in the first half of the year. Two-thirds came \n     from exports to the Asian Newly Industrialized Economies \n     (NIEs--Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan). Asia, \n     however, supplied 43 percent of U.S. manufactured goods \n     import growth for the first half of the year.\n       Although the European Union (EU) normally accounts for \n     about 22 percent of U.S. manufactured goods exports, exports \n     of manufactures to the EU are up only 4 percent so far this \n     year, and the EU accounted for an anemic 8 percent of U.S. \n     manufactures export growth during the first half of 2000. \n     Manufactures imports from the EU, on the other hand, were up \n     16 percent in the first half of the year, with Germany and \n     the United Kingdom accounting for about half.\n\n\n                         industrial composition\n\n       Durable goods contributed 69 percent of manufactures export \n     growth so far this year. The bulk was composed of computers \n     and electronic products, which have grown by 17 percent \n     through June and alone have been responsible for a third of \n     U.S. manufactures export growth. Forty percent of these \n     exports went to four markets (Canada, Mexico, Japan, and \n     South Korea.)\n       Durable goods imports constituted 68 percent of \n     manufactures import growth in the first half of 2000. \n     Reflecting strong domestic demand for information processing \n     equipment (which now makes up 47 percent of nonresidential \n     fixed investment), computer and electronic product imports \n     rose by 25 percent through June and have contributed to 28 \n     percent to the growth in overall manufactured goods imports \n     this year.\n       Non-durable manufactures contributed 31 percent of export \n     growth through June. Half of non-durable export growth has \n     been in chemicals. About 44 percent of these products were \n     shipped to the top four export markets (Canada, Mexico, Japan \n     and Belgium).\n       Non-durables accounted for a third of import growth through \n     June. The largest product groups were chemicals, apparel, and \n     petroleum and coal products.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You have to read this one line, quoting Jasinowski:\n\n       Of the total $228 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit, \n     so far this year 77 percent has been in manufacturing.\n\n  That is a deficit in manufacturing. Can you imagine that, Mr. \nPresident? So the leaders of business and the head of manufacturing say \nget rid of the manufacturing. He seems to be proud of it. If I had \nfound that statistic in my research, I would have secured it and stuck \nit, or deep-sixed it, or whatever you call it because you didn't really \nwant to publicize the fact that you are losing the manufacturing jobs.\n  With respect to understanding the need to have a competitive trade \npolicy, the President of the United States was up in New York just last \nweek, and he had his counterpart from London there, Tony Blair. They \nwere talking. The news reports said Tony Blair was worried about 1,000 \ncashmere jobs. Why? Because we were going to put\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\nsome heavy duty tariff on cashmere. For what? For bananas. We don't \neven produce bananas. Good Lord, have mercy. That is how far out the \nleadership of this country has gone. We don't even produce bananas. But \nEurope is not taking some other country's bananas, so we go and say we \nare going to start a trade war.\n  The Prime Minister is worried about 1,000 jobs, and here I am worried \nabout at least 800,000 jobs. Tell Tom Donohue of the Chamber of \nCommerce--he says he is going to create 800,000 jobs. I bet you we will \nlose that number of jobs with this PNTR. He knows it and I know it. \nThey are all begging for jobs, and the President is worried and \neverything else of that kind, and even the media don't know what \nprotectionism is. That is what you will soon listen to--protectionism. \nI hold up my hand to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled, ``Beware Plausible \nProtectionists'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Rercord, as follows:\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Sept. 12, 2000]\n\n                    Beware Plausible Protectionists\n\n       Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina is known for his \n     crude defense of textile protectionism, which impoverishes \n     bone-poor workers in developing countries. But his current \n     efforts at telecom protectionism are more subtle. He has \n     backed a measure that would block government-owned telephone \n     companies from buying American ones, and inserted it into the \n     Commerce, Justice and State Department spending bill. The \n     provision would torpedo the proposed takeover of VoiceStream, \n     a fast-growing wireless company, by Deutsche Telekom, which \n     is 58 percent owned by the German government.\n       Mr. Hollings points out that U.S. local phone companies \n     have been restricted from entering the long distance market \n     until they opened their own networks to competitors. He then \n     suggests that government-owned foreign phone companies, which \n     he says enjoy monopolistic profits in their domestic markets, \n     should likewise be forced to open up their home territory \n     before being allowed into the United States. On top of that, \n     the senator suggests that foreign government ownership of \n     American telephone firms raises concerns of privacy and \n     national security. Phone companies can eavesdrop on \n     subscribers, and (in the case of mobile callers) monitor \n     their whereabouts. Should a foreign government be allowed to \n     do that?\n       Mr. Hollings has assembled a powerful coalition in Congress \n     that shudders at this prospect. But the outrage is \n     unwarranted. The automatic link that Mr. Hollings imples \n     between government ownership and monopolistic profits is too \n     simple: In Germany, Telekom's Deutsche rivals have captured \n     two-fifths of the market for long distance voice calls and \n     nearly half of the market for international calls. Under \n     pressure from World Trade Organizations rules and U.S. \n     negotiators, Germany's government has been encouraging \n     telephone competition as well as gradually reducing its stake \n     in Deutsche Telekom.\n       Moreover, if Deutsche Telekom or any other firm can be \n     shown to have ``dominant-carrier benefits'' in its home \n     market, the Federal Communications Commission is already \n     empowered to impose conditions on the way it does business \n     here. Equally, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are \n     empowered to examine mergers and ensure that their phone-\n     tapping powers are not compromised. The privacy issue is \n     addressed by existing law, which protects phone users no \n     matte who owns the phone network. The Hollings legislation is \n     therefore unnecessary.\n       In an ideal world, all phone companies would be privatized: \n     This would eliminate the danger of anti-competitive subsidies \n     completely. But existing policy grapples sensibly with the \n     real world in which state-owned firms remain part of the \n     landscape: It builds in safeguards against abuses while not \n     depriving U.S. consumers of the benefits of foreign \n     investment. VoiceStream, the wireless firm that Deutsche \n     Telekom hopes to purchase, is itself an illustration of those \n     benefits. With the help of $2.2 billion from partners in Hong \n     Kong and Finland, it has expanded rapidly, creating more than \n     8,000 jobs for American workers and bringing wireless phone \n     and messaging services to 2.5 million consumers. To preserve \n     that kind of gain, the administration promises to veto any \n     spending bill containing the Hollings language. It would be \n     right to do so.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They said, ``Hollings' crude defense of \nprotectionism.'' They don't know what protectionism is. When you get \nthe Government out of the competition, you do get free capitalistic \nactivity, as Adam Smith said. Followed on by David Ricardo and his so-\ncalled comparative advantage, which said when you put the Government \nin, the Government has the right to print money. The Government \ncertainly is not going to let the industry fail.\n  Deutsche Telekom had a bond issued earlier this year and got $14 \nbillion. Their stock has gone from 100 down to 40. The fellow brags in \nthe newspaper: I have $100 billion in my back pocket. I am going to buy \nAT, MCI, Sprint, or any of them--they are all subject--and I want \ntotal control.\n  So what he has told you in plain, bold language is that the German \nGovernment, which owns Deutsche Telekom, says: Heads up, I'm coming in \nto buy your companies and get total control.\n  That is a distortion of the free market. That would be protectionism. \nI am trying to avoid that and keep the Government out of the market. I \nwas one of the leaders in the 1996 act deregulating telecommunications. \nSo we got the U.S. Government out, but certainly not to put the German \nGovernment in. But here they go writing these editorials about I'm a \nprotectionist. They have no idea what's going on. That is how far off \nwe have gotten with respect to trade.\n  So let's get to the point. What we do is that we trade more. We \nexport more to Belgium. We export more to the city-state of Singapore \nthan we do to the People's Republic of China. We've got a good, viable \ntrade partner there. We don't have any exports. I will get to the \ntechnology on another amendment. They said that high-tech is going to \ndo it. The truth is, high tech doesn't create the jobs. I will put it \nin one line: We have a deficit and a balance of trade in high \ntechnology with the People's Republic of China. So mark you me, this is \nnot going to do it whatsoever. So my amendment, which ought to be read \nsimply so we can find out who is telling the truth and find out what \nthe imports and exports are and what the jobs are and where they are \ngoing. Here it is:\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission shall amend its \n     regulations to require the inclusion of the following \n     information in 10-K reports required to be filed with the \n     commission.\n\n  This is just information.\n\n       The number of employees employed by the reporting entity \n     outside the United States directly, indirectly, or through a \n     joint venture or other business arrangement listed by \n     country; the annual dollar volume of exports of goods \n     manufactured or produced in the United States by the \n     reporting entity to each country to which it exports; the \n     annual dollar volume of imports of goods manufactured or \n     produced outside the United States by the reporting entity \n     with each country.\n\n  So we will find out with these reports just exactly where we are and \nwhat the competition is, whether they are increasing jobs in the U.S. \nrather than decreasing. The opposition to this amendment is telling \neverybody to forget about it, it is another one of those Hollings \namendments and we have to send it to the President and we have other \nmore important business--there is no more important business than what \nis going on on the floor of the Senate--10-K reports.\n  I don't want to belabor or compound the record itself, but I have in \nmy hand the Boeing 10-K report. For example, Boeing, on its 10-K \nreport, says ``the location and floor areas of the company's principal \noperating properties as of January 1, 2000.'' I wish you or somebody \nwho is really interested could look at that 10-K report. They have \nevery little item about the square footage.\n  They know how many employees. They know generally how many employees \nthey have, but they do not say where and what country.\n  That is all we are asking for--the number of employees; then, the \ndollar volume of imports and exports, and from whence. That is all.\n  That is all we are asking for in this particular amendment so we can \nget that to the Department of Commerce and finally find out.\n  Back in the 1970s when we were debating trade, the Department of \nCommerce gave me this figure: 41 percent of American consumption of \nmanufactured goods was from imports. That was 20-some years ago. I know \nthat over half of what you and I consume is imported. We are going out \nof business. We don't have a strong nation. High-tech is not \nstrengthening whatsoever--temporary employees and software people and \nInternet billionaires, as Newsweek wrote about the other day. But they \nare not really the automobile workers and parts workers or industry \nworkers. We have the so-called ``rust belt'' in the United States. Talk \nhow exports--that is the parts they are still\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nmaking up there and sending down to Mexico to come back into finished \nautomobiles. The most productive automobile plant in the world is not \nDetroit. It is down in Mexico at the Ford plant, according to J.D. \nPowers.\n  I have the Bell South 10-K report. As of December 31, 1999, they \nemployed approximately 96,200 individuals; 64,000 were employees of the \ntelephone operation, and 55,000 represented the communications workers. \nThey have a lot of detailed information. But all we want is the number \nand which country. That is all we are asking for with respect to those \nemployees--their imports and exports.\n  Why did the Boeing machinists lead the parade last December up in \nSeattle at the World Trade Organization? The premium showcase export \nindustry of the United States was leading the parade against WTO \nbecause their jobs have gone to China.\n  All you have to do is continue to read the different articles.\n  We have one with respect to our friend Bill Greider, who put out a \nvery interesting article. He wrote when President Clinton promoted \nBoeing aircraft sales abroad--boy, that was wonderful. He had gotten \nBoeing. For instance, he did not mention that in effect he was \nchampioning Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, and Fuji, the Japanese heavies that \nmanufacture a substantial portion of Boeing' planes; or that Boeing was \noffloading jobs from Seattle and Wichita to China as part of the deal.\n  There it is. We are exporting our jobs.\n  This book is nearly 6 years of age.\n  But let me retain the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Frist are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of my \ndistinguished colleague. The 10-K reports filed annually with the SEC \nare designed to inform investors about the operating conditions of \npublicly-held corporations offering their securities for sale on \nAmerican exchanges. The 10-K reports are expressly designed to inform \ninvestors about the prospects of companies turning to U.S. securities \nmarkets and form a bulwark against misrepresentations that might \nmislead or defraud U.S. investors. They are, in fact, one of the \nbulwarks that make American capital markets function precisely because \nof their focus on information that is relevant to a publicly-held \ncompany's predictions of its economic conditions.\n  The information that the amendment of my friend would require U.S. \npublicly-held companies to provide at some additional cost is largely \nirrelevant. For example, what difference does it make to the potential \npurchaser of IBM's stock precisely how many foreign employees it has \nand where they are employed? Would a single error in IBM's 10-K report \nregarding the number of employees in Botswana affect the investor's \ndecision to hold IBM stock? How would it benefit the U.S. investor to \nknow the precise dollar volume of U.S. Steel's exports and imports of \nmanufactured products listed by product and importing country? Would \nthe misstatement of U.S. Steel's imports of semi-finished steel \nproducts on its 10-K report actually mislead investors as to the \neconomic condition of U.S. steel or allow the investor to better \nevaluate U.S. steel's economic prospects relative to other issuers of \nsecurities on American exchanges?\n  Furthermore, SEC rules already require IBM or U.S. Steel to provide \nthat information when relevant to the investor--in other words, where \nsuch information would affect the bottom line. My point is that my \nfriend's amendment would not materially advance the interests of U.S. \ninvestors, but would add a potentially costly new reporting requirement \non U.S. issuers. More fundamentally, to the extent that my friend's \namendment succeeds and we are unable to pass PNTR as a result, the \ndamage done to the economic prospects of American publicly-held \ncompanies and to the interests of U.S. investors vastly outweighs any \nhypothetical benefit to investors that would accrue from collecting \nthis information on an annual basis. In my view, the number that U.S. \ninvestors are most likely to be interested in is the $13 billion in new \nU.S. exports that are likely to flow from the ground-breaking agreement \nnegotiated by Ambassador Barshefsky. That is the number that is likely \nto affect the bottom line in which American investors are interested. \nFurthermore, to the extent my friend wants to collect the date to \nillustrate that American companies are investing abroad simply to \nexport back to the United States, that information is likely already to \nbe reflected in the investment and import data that the U.S. Commerce \nDepartment already collects.\n\n  But, it is also worth questioning what those numbers are likely to \nreveal if we do pass PNTR and China does join the WTO. I have no doubt \nthat what they will show is an increase in U.S. exports to China and, \nto the extent that we see an increase in imports from China, that those \nimports come at the expense of other foreign companies exporting to the \nUnited States. The International Trade Commission's report on China's \naccession reflects that fact. Now, it is important to remember that the \nITC's report on the quantitative impact of China's accession was \nrestricted to the effects of tariff changes under the bilateral market \naccess agreement with China. It did not even purport to address the \nquantitative effects of China's removal of non-tariff barriers on trade \nin manufactured goods or agricultural products, much less the dramatic \nopening of China's services markets.\n  Nonetheless, what the ITC found was that the accession package would \nlead to an overall improvement in the U.S. balance of trade and, where \nChina did export more to the United States, those gains would come at \nthe expense of other foreign exporters. Given that we already know the \naffect of China's accession, is there any real reason to collect the \ndate required by my friend's amendment? And, if we are debating the \neconomic impact of China's accession to the WTO, would there be any \nreason to collect this date with respect to every country in which an \nAmerican company either buys components or sells its wares? The answer \nis no. The amendment serves no practical purpose, particularly in the \ncontext of this debate. Therefore, I oppose the amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have a simple proposition to make, \nafter discussions with the Treasury Department, which is simply to say \nthe amendment is burdensome in the extreme and would discourage U.S. \nlistings. The amendment would place an enormous, costly, and pointless \nregulatory burden on publicly traded companies in the United States. \nFirms would be required to list every single one of their overseas \nemployees as well as every single employee of any foreign company with \nwhich they do business. They would also be required to calculate the \ntotal value of all their exports and imports.\n  Such a regulatory burden would be a nightmare for both such firms \nplanning to go public--for most firms planning to go public. On the \nother hand, it would not discourage foreign firms from listing in the \nUnited States. This is not a regulation we want to impose on American \nbusiness--startup businesses, small cap businesses. I hope we will not \napprove this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had the privilege and experience of \nrunning a corporation myself. In fact, it was before Manny Cohen was \nthe Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. At that \ntime, I set a\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\nrecord getting approval in 13 days. I know how it works. I know how \ndetailed it is. That is why I brought up Boeing. They even have the \nsquare footage in different countries. They do have the total amount \nand the number of employees. They just break it down by country.\n  Exporters and importers have to keep books. They have to have the \nvalue. They want to know themselves. I want it reported in their 10-K. \nIt is not at the Department of Commerce.\n  By the way, they say the information does not affect the bottom line. \nIt most positively does. You can get your labor production costs and \nmanufacture for 10 percent of the United States cost.\n  I am not here for stockholders or against them. I am for \nstockholders, nonstockholders, for the people of the United States, for \nthe Senate, and for the Constitution in conducting trade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4134. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Feinstein) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was wondering if I could make about 5 \nto 10 minutes' worth of statements on other issues relating to my home \nState.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we would be honored if the distinguished \nSenator from Utah would proceed, as he will do, and at what length he \nchooses.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his courtesy and friendship and \nthe scholarship with which he addresses all of these issues.\n  I understand the President pro tempore wishes to make a statement on \nthe Boy Scouts first. I ask unanimous consent that following his \nstatement I be recognized as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thurmond are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bennett are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, seeing no other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate now consider, in the following order, division I of my \namendment, to be followed by division IV, and following the use or \nyielding back of the time, the amendments be laid aside with votes to \noccur at a time to be determined by the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4129, Division I\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, at this time I now call up \ndivision I of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur by a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. A rollcall vote on division I and \ndivision IV.\n  Mr. President, as you know, last Thursday, I offered an amendment \nthat would require the Congressional-Executive Commission, which is \ncreated under the permanent normal trade relations bill on China, to \nmonitor the level of Chinese cooperation on the POW/MIA issue and to \npass this information to the American people as part of an annual \nreport that the commission will issue.\n  I have long been an advocate of the POW/MIA issue. I believe the U.S. \nGovernment should make every effort to account for any missing American \nservicemen from any of our Nation's conflicts. I am sure you all agree \nthat we have a solemn obligation to these brave Americans and their \nfamilies. There are over 10,000 unaccounted-for American soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines from Korea, Vietnam, and the cold war, not \nto mention many from World War II.\n  The fate of many of these unaccounted-for Americans, especially from \nthe Korean war, could be easily clarified by the People's Republic of \nChina. This is an undisputed fact, that the Chinese continue to deny \nthat they have any information that could help us account for our \nmissing.\n  I have been to North Korea and have talked to the North Koreans on \nthis issue. I have talked to the Russians. Both the Russians and the \nNorth Koreans indicated to me, in private discussions, that the Chinese \nhad volumes of information on American servicemen, especially during \nthe Korean war because, as we know, the Chinese were heavily involved. \nThey maintained the camps in Korea during the war.\n  So all I am asking for in this amendment is that we can include this \nlanguage so the commission can monitor and put some pressure on the \nChinese to provide information. It is humanitarian. It is basic \nhumanitarian information about our missing service men and women.\n  I do not think this is unreasonable. I do not think it is going to \ndelay anything. It would simply go back to the House. The House would \nadd the amendment, and off it goes: We have now made a statement to the \nChinese Communists that we care about our American POWs and MIAs.\n\n  I would be astounded if anyone would even consider voting against \nthis\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\namendment, drawing the conclusion that somehow it is going to mess up \nthe permanent normal trade relations deal.\n  It would take about 5 minutes to get it approved in the House, \nanother 5 minutes for the President to take a look at it and sign the \nbill, and we are moving on and now have some attention on it. We have \nnow said to the Chinese Government: Not only do we care about our \nmissing, we want you to help us find some of our MIAs and POWs from \nthose conflicts.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues just a small fraction of the \ninformation that I have--and, believe me, it is a small fraction. I \npored through many intelligence files, and I am only giving you a \nsmattering of these files. But I can tell you, the Chinese deny any \ninformation, when, in fact, our own intelligence community has volumes \nof information to the contrary, that they could answer about what \nhappened to our POWs and MIAs, especially from the camps in North \nKorea, at the end of the war. But it is precisely the type of \ninformation I am going to share with you that makes it all the more \nimportant that we say to the Chinese: You have to cooperate with us on \nthis humanitarian issue.\n  For example, there are numerous declassified CIA intelligence reports \nfrom the 1950s that indicate the Chinese have knowledge about American \nPOWs from that war--numerous, numerous declassified intelligence \nreports, and many classified that we cannot talk about here.\n  I did this the other day when I offered the amendment. I believe I \nput these in the Record yesterday. I will check that. If I did not, I \nwill enter them. But I believe they are in the Record.\n  Here is a good example of one. This is a Central Intelligence Agency \nInformation report dated in May of 1951. So we were at the height of \nthe Korean war in May of 1951. The subject matter is: ``American \nPrisoners of War in Canton,'' China. Some of the information is blacked \nout because of sources and methods. Even today, 40 years later, it is \nstill blacked out. But, again, it is a reference to prisoners of war \nheld by the Chinese in the Korean war.\n  If the Chinese held prisoners, clearly they would know what happened \nto the prisoners or at least could share some information on the \nrecords they maintained in the camps.\n  Here is another one: 27 June 1951, another intelligence report right \nhere, entitled, ``Subject: American Prisoners of War in South China.'' \nI will just cite a couple of paragraphs from it:\n\n       A staff member of the State Security Bureau in Seoul \n     [Korea] on 12 February stated that all American prisoners of \n     war were sent to camps . . .\n\n  And then they list several cities in Manchuria where they were put to \nhard labor in mines and factories.\n  So that is another CIA intelligence report.\n  Why would we not want to say to the Chinese: Look, here is our own \nintelligence. We know you held our prisoners in the war. All we want \nyou to do is help us provide answers for their loved ones.\n  Yet I regret, sincerely regret, to say that people are going to come \ndown to this Senate floor shortly, before the end of the afternoon, and \nthey are going to vote no on this amendment. I believe so many will \nvote no that it will fail. The reason they are going to give for that \nvote--and that is what they are going to tell their constituents--is: \nOf course we would like to get information on our POWs and MIAs. Of \ncourse we would like to have the Chinese cooperate. But we are not \nwilling to put it in the permanent normal trade relations because--you \nknow what?--we might make them angry, and we will not be able to sell \nthem corn and wheat.\n\n  That is what we are saying. Maybe we can look our veterans in the eye \nand the families of these people in the eye and say: That's all right. \nBut it is not all right with me. My conscience will be clear. I know \nhow I am voting on this amendment. I would appreciate the consideration \nof my colleagues. It is not asking very much to send this back to the \nHouse with this one amendment that says we care.\n  It is interesting; there are many groups who oppose permanent normal \ntrade relations with China. But I will tell you, the veterans groups \noppose it. What does that tell you? The American Legion opposes it. \nMany veterans groups oppose it. They are the ones who made the \nsacrifice. I guarantee you, the families of these individuals who are \nmissing would sure love to see this language put in this bill.\n  I could go on and on. I will not cite many, but here is another one: \n``U.S. Prisoners of War in Communist China, 11 Aug. 1951.'' It is a CIA \nreport. This is one of just thousands that we have had--classified and \nunclassified--just like this.\n\n       On 2 August fifty-two US prisoners of war from Korea, who \n     had been held in the Baptist church . . .\n\n  And they name the location--\n\n     left Canton by train for [another location] under guard. . . \n     .\n\n  This is very detailed stuff. This is not just somebody who makes a \ngeneral statement. These are specific eyewitness sightings of prisoners \nbeing moved around in China during the war and who never returned.\n  I am not maintaining that these people are alive. It would be nice if \nthey were, but I am not maintaining that. But clearly, the Chinese, if \nthey would sit down with us with these documents, we could talk to \nthem, and we could trace this information. We could talk to the people \nin these provinces, and maybe we could get some information. Perhaps \nwhere were these prisoners buried? How were they killed? What kinds of \ninformation do we have on them? Are there personal effects, anything \nlike that?\n\n  Another report, September 1951, title: American Prisoners of War, \nCommunist China, CIA. On and on and on.\n  All I am asking my colleagues is to say that that is not acceptable, \nthat we will give permanent normal trade relations to China and not ask \nthem to at least help us account for our missing. I say to those of you \nwho might be skeptical, if you want me to provide you these documents \nin detail, I will provide the documents in detail. I can send you to \nthe proper locations in the U.S. Government where the classified \ndocuments, which are far more specific than this, will give you even \nmore specific information.\n  I went to North Korea. I sat down in Pyongyang with the North Korean \nofficials several years ago, the first American Senator to visit North \nKorea. I talked to the North Koreans about those camps that were run \nduring the war. They showed me photographs of the Communist Chinese \nguards who guarded those troops, our troops, our prisoners, American \nprisoners, during the war. They know what happened to those people. \nThey can provide us information. Why is that asking so much--to say we \nwant to monitor this to say to the Chinese, every time PNTR comes up \nfor discussion, we want you to help us find answers?\n  I wrote a letter to the Chinese Government on this and got a blunt \nresponse: We don't have any information. We are not going to share any \ninformation with you.\n  We know that is not true. Yet why should they give us information if \nwe say to them, you don't have to give us information because we are \ngoing to give you what you want, which is trade and credibility and \nrecognition on the international plain?\n  This is just basic human rights--basic. Senator Helms and others, \nSenator Wellstone and others, have offered amendments, over and over \nagain, about human rights violations--all defeated, including mine. We \ntalked about abuse in orphanages. We talked about forced abortions, \nwomen forced to have abortions at 9 months--all ignored, all voted \ndown--all in the name of profit, all in the name of saying we don't \nwant to risk antagonizing the Chinese. We don't want to take a few \nminutes to have this on the other side, to go back over to the House \nwhere they might have to add an amendment to send it to the President. \nThat is the reason for this.\n  As you can imagine, it is difficult to investigate reports that are \n50 years old. That is exactly why we need the Chinese to cooperate. You \nlook at a report such as this; it goes back 50 years. We need the \npeople on the ground. We need the Communist Chinese archives--not \nclassified top secret Chinese secrets, that is not what we want. We \nwant basic humanitarian information. They could give it to us, a lot of \nit. And probably we could clarify the fate of hundreds, perhaps even \nthousands, of American POWs and MIAs.\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\n  I will give one example. On my last trip to Russia, we were able to \naccess some archives. The Russians were very cooperative. They provided \n10,000 documents that helped us to identify flyers, American pilots, \nwho were lost in the Korean conflict because the Russians--Soviets \nthen--flew aircraft; they actually saw the shootdowns. They made \nnotations about the tail number of the aircraft, how many pilots, did \nthe pilot parachute out, did the plane go down in flames--very \npersonal, firsthand accounts, very helpful; 10,000 documents.\n\n  These documents will help us to be able to go to the families of \nthese men and be able to say to them, this is what happened to your \nhusband or your father, your brother, whomever, as best we know based \non the testimony of the Russians.\n  The Russians, to their credit, are being cooperative. Why can't we \nask the Chinese to do this? Why is that asking too much? This is the \nthing that disturbs me so much, that just basic humanitarian issues are \nthrown aside in the name of somehow taking a little more time. What is \nanother day, if we are going to give the Chinese permanent trade \nstatus? What is another day to include this kind of language?\n  Secretary Cohen, to his credit, at my request raised this issue with \nthe Chinese during his recent visit to China this last summer. Once \nagain, the Chinese simply brushed it aside. They said: we don't have \nany information--when in fact our intelligence files and our own \ninformation flat out knows and says the opposite.\n  But let's not forget what the real issue is here. The Chinese stand \nto make billions from trade with the United States. Shame on us if we \nfail to demand that in return for those billions, we ask for basic \nhumanitarian information on our servicemen. Shame on us.\n  All we can do is call this to the attention of our colleagues. I \ncan't make colleagues vote the way I want them to vote, nor should I. \nIt is up to them to make that decision. But I urge them to make the \ndecision to ask for this basic information.\n  I have worked on this issue for 16 years, as a Senator and a \nCongressman. I know what I am talking about. I have been to China. I \nhave been to Cambodia. I have been to Laos. I have flown a helicopter \nover the Plain of Jars. I landed in the Plain of Jars. I went into \ncaves looking for American POWs. I scoured the hillsides and \ncountrysides of Cambodia and Laos and Vietnam and Russia. They have all \nbeen relatively cooperative, some more than others, not cooperative \nenough. But the Chinese have done nothing--no access, zero, zippo. Yet \nhere we are, giving them permanent status. It is wrong.\n  My concern extends beyond Chinese knowledge of Americans missing from \nthe Korean war. We know approximately 320,000 Chinese military \npersonnel served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970. So moving now from the \nKorean war to the Vietnam war, it seems to me highly likely that many \nof these Chinese troops would be knowledgeable about the fate of some \n2,000 Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam war. It also \nimpacts the Vietnam war. It also impacts the cold war.\n  I am personally opposed to PNTR. I will vote against it. But it \ncertainly would be nice if those who are going to vote for it, since I \nknow it is going to pass, would be willing to at least have this basic \nnoncontroversial amendment which would help to account for missing \nAmericans.\n  Let me tell you what else it would do. It would provide a lot of \nsolace to American families who for 50 years have waited for some word \nabout their loved ones. Yet Senators don't want to vote for this \namendment because to vote for it means it might have to go to \nconference. They don't want to short-circuit the legislative process. \nDid anybody ask these folks before they went off to war whether they \ncared about short-circuiting the legislative process? They went. They \nserved. They were lost. They deserve this amendment. They earned this \namendment.\n  My amendment would merely expand the scope of the commission in the \npermanent normal trade relations bill to include the monitoring of \nChinese cooperation on the POW/MIA issue. It is about as \nnoncontroversial as anything we could do. Not only should we vote for \nthis amendment, we have an obligation to vote for this amendment. \nAnything less than that is wrong. You can rest assured that the 10,000 \nmissing Americans from the Vietnam and Korean wars didn't fight so that \nthe Senate could short-circuit the legislative process. That is not \nwhat they fought for. Ask the families what they fought for. I have a \nfather who died in the Second World War. I know what my family \nsuffered.\n  I know what it is like to grow up without a father. I knew what \nhappened to my father. He was killed serving his country. Many sons and \ndaughters out there have no idea what happened to their loved ones. \nWouldn't it be nice if the Senate said we would like to try to find out \nand that we are willing to attach this to PNTR? This is the least we \nshould do.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4129, Division IV\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I know Senator Hollings is \nwaiting. I just have one more amendment, the so-called division IV. I \ncall up division IV at this time and ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment, division IV.\n  This amendment deals with the environment. Again, this is commission \nlanguage that simply calls for the commission to report on the \nprogress, or lack thereof, that companies and the Chinese Government \nare making in China regarding environmental laws.\n  Our companies in America are under strict environmental regulations, \nyet there are no regulations in China. All this amendment asks is that \nwe monitor these regulations so we can find out what kind of progress \nis being made on these issues.\n  Over the past 30 years, we have heard a steady stream of arguments \nthat strong environmental protections are necessary, and that punitive \nsanctions are indispensable, because corporations will sacrifice the \nlong-term public interest in preserving the environment for the sake of \nshort-term profits.\n  For the past 8 years, the Clinton administration has added its voice \nto that stream. The administration has consistently told us that the \nAmerican business community cannot be trusted to deal with the \nenvironment in a responsible manner unless two conditions are met: \nFirst, we must have strong environmental laws on the books. Second, we \nmust ensure that those laws are vigorously enforced--that individual \nfirms can and will be aggressively sanctioned whenever they stray from \nwhat those laws allow.\n  To be sure, the Clinton administration has told us that economic \nprogress can neatly coexist with environmental protection--that swords \ncan be turned into plowshares without ruining the land to be tilled. \nBut the administration has not suggested that we should exempt any \nbusiness or State from compliance with Federal law.\n  Today, we have chance to implement those principles. I offer today an \namendment to H.R. 4444 that would require the Commission established by \nthe bill to report on the progress of China in the implementation of \nlaws designed to protect human health, and to protect, restore, and \npreserve the environment.\n  Let me tell you why we need that amendment:\n  China's environmental record to date is grim:\n  It has been said that China is home to half of the world's 10 most \npolluted cities.--See www.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Pages 1-2; Friends of \nthe Earth--World Trade, www.Foe.org/international/wto/china.html, Page \n1.\n  One source, however, says that the situation has worsened since 1995 \nand that China now has 8 of the 10 most polluted cities in the world.--\nSee Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), July 30, 2000, \n``China Expert Chen Qingtai Warns of Deteriorating Eco-System,'' \nDocument ID CPP20000730000042, Page 2.\n  Yet another source now puts the number at 9 out of 10.--See China \nFocus, May 2000: China's Environment,\n\nwww.virtualchina.com/focus/environment/index.html.\n\n  ``By the Chinese government's own standards, two-thirds of the 338 \nChinese cities for which air quality data are available are polluted. \nTwo-thirds of those are rated `moderately'--though still seriously--or \nheavily polluted.''--See Michael Dorgan, ``China gets serious about \ncleaning up its air,'' Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, August 1, \n2000.\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\n  The Chinese capital of Beijing is one of the those top 10 cities with \nthe world's worst air quality. In Beijing, the annual sulfur dioxide \nlevels are twice the maximum set by the World Health Organization, and \nthe particulates are four times the maximum WHO level.--See House \nRepublican Policy Committee 2 (July 6, 1998).\n  In 1999, ``on one day out of four--Beijing's air quality--reached \nLevel 4--out of 5--when even nonsmokers feel they have the lungs of the \nMarlboro Man, or Level 5, when it's so toxic that a few breaths can \nleave a person dizzy and nearby buildings seem lost in a filthy \nfog.''--See Michael Dorgan, ``China gets serious about cleaning up its \nair,'' Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, August 1, 2000.\n\n  An estimated 2 million people die each year in China from air and \nwater pollution.--See Friends of the Earth--World Trade,\n\nwww.Foe.org.international/wto/china.html, Page 1.\n\n  Water pollution in China is widespread and toxic. IN fact, 80 percent \nof China's rivers are so polluted that fish cannot live in them.--See \nwww.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Page 2.\n  ``[T]he 25 billion tons of unfiltered industrial pollutants that the \nChinese sent into their waterways in 1991 gave Communist China `more \ntoxic water pollution in that one country than in the whole of the \nWestern world.' ''--See House Republican Policy Committee 2 (July 6, \n1998), quoting Gregg Easterbrook.\n  A recent report from the Ministry of Water Resources of the Chinese \nGovernment states that the water supply to as many as 300 million \npeople in China fails the Chinese Government's health standard.\n  In addition, according to the China Economic Times, Chinese Ministry \nof Water Resources report said that 46 percent of China's more than 700 \nrivers were polluted, meaning that they fell within Grade 4 or 5 of the \nChinese Government's 5-Grade water quality rating system. Under that \nrating system, Grade 1 is deemed clean and suitable for consumption, \nwhile Grade 5 is considered undrinkable. Ministry experts explained \nthat industrial pollution was the main source of contamination. Those \nexperts estimated that factories produced about 60 billion tons of \nwaste and sewage each year and that 80 percent of that waste and sewage \nwas discharged into rivers without treatment.\n  Ninety percent of the water sources in China's urban areas are \nseverely polluted.\n  Acid rain degrades forest and farm land, and imposes an annual cost \nof an estimated $1.8 billion in economic losses.--See\n\nwww.greenpeace-china.org.hk/ press/19991101_pr_00.html.\n\n  China is the world's largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons, the \nchemicals that are said to be responsible for destroying the ozone \nlayer.--See www.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Page 2.\n  China already consumes more coal in energy production than any other \nnation. Energy planners expect that China's coal consumption will \ndouble, if not triple, by the year 2020. If China's coal use increases \nas expected over the next two decades, that growth alone will increase \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent--all but dooming efforts \nby the rest of the world to reduce a 50-70-percent reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions. See Mark Hertsgaard (July 19, 2000).\n  By 2020, China will become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse \ngases.--See www.SpeakOut.com, 5/17/00, Page 3.\n  Why is the environmental such a disaster in China today? The answer \nis simple--the people of China do not enjoy political and economic \nfreedom. Per capita emissions in China are 75 percent higher than in \nBrazil, which has an economy of similar size. The difference is that \nthe autocratic, Communist government in China robs the people of that \nnation of the ability to seek both a prosperous economy and a healthy \nenvironment.\n\n  A free people will not consent to the type of environmental \ndegradation seen today in China. Since 1970, in this nation we have \nbeen unwilling to put up with a far less dangerous state of affairs \nthan China has today. We have enacted and enforced strong environmental \nprotection laws, and we have supported environmental preservation in \nour decisions as consumers and as contributors to charitable causes.\n  Moreover, prosperity not only is compatible with a clean environment, \nprosperity also is a precondition for it. A rich people will have the \nability to recognize the long-term benefits of preservation. Mature \nfree market economies make increasingly efficient uses of resources, \nwhile leaving a smaller footprint on the air, the water, and the land.\n  Under our current law, we can urge China gradually to improve its \nenvironmental performance as a condition to being granted normal \ntrading privileges. We lose that option if we pass H.R. 4444. For that \nreason, this bill is our only, and last best, chance to exercise \nleverage in order to influence China's decision in the environmental \nfield.\n  We believe that laws such as the Clean Air Act are necessary for the \nhealth of this nation. Why should we expect less for anyone else--\nparticularly China? We believe that enforcement is necessary for law to \nbe meaningful in this nation? Why should we expect anything different \nacross the Pacific? We believe that a sound economy and a healthy \nenvironment can and should be attained from the Atlantic to the \nPacific? Why should we expect less from Pacific to the South China Sea?\n  There also is no good reason why, in the name of environmentalism, we \nshould impose a greater burden on American citizens than we expect \nother countries to impose on themselves.\n  China now has 20 percent of the world's population, so what China \ndoes environmentally greatly affects everyone else. All that this \namendment does it to require the Commission created by this legislation \nto monitor and report on China's efforts to protect the environment.\n  Former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick once criticized my \ncolleagues across the aisle for their tendency to ``Blame America \nFirst''--that is, for their belief that there must be something wrong \nwith this great Nation that causes the world's ills. Keep that in mind \nwhen you consider this amendment. If laws such as the Clean Air Act and \nthe Clean Water Act are necessary for the environmental health of this \nNation, then those laws--or something analogous--are necessary for \nChina, too. That is, they are necessary unless you believe in a policy \nof ``Restrict America First, Always, and Only.'' There is no good \nreason for us to give up our opportunity to ensure that annually we can \nencourage, cajole, or prod China into improving its environment, for \nits sake and for everyone's, until we are sure that China no longer \nwill be the world's superpolluter.\n  You might ask why China is such an environmental disaster. The same \nreason the Soviet Union was. The answer is, the people of China, as in \nthe Soviet Union, don't enjoy political and economic freedom. Per \ncapita emissions in China are 75 percent higher than in Brazil, which \nhas an economy of similar size. They don't have a choice. They don't \ncare. The Government doesn't care. They don't have a choice to clean it \nup. We could make a difference if we monitored this, talked about this \nto the world, brought this out each year in the commission report on \nPNTR. A free people would not consent to this kind of stuff, as we \nhaven't--to this type of environmental degradation. Moreover, \nprosperity is not only compatible with a clean air environment, but a \nprecondition for it.\n  So I hope we can move forward on this amendment and allow for the \ncommission to monitor these environmental disasters, where we apply one \nstandard to our Government and no standard to a government making huge \nprofits as a result of our trade.\n  Again, this is a very noncontroversial amendment but one I think all \nof my colleagues who say they are pro-environment ought to support. I \nguess I am going to draw the conclusion that if you can't vote for \nthis, you are pro-environment for America but not the rest of the \nworld--especially China. That is kind of sad. I hope I will have \nsupport on this amendment, as well as the other amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That completes any discussion I have on \nthe amendments.\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\n  At this time I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4136\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4136, and I \nask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point here, there are two \nsurprising features with respect to the globalization, global \ncompetition, international trade. I continue to try to get the Senate \nand the Congress itself, charged under the Constitution, article I, \nsection 8, to fulfill its responsibility.\n  The eye-opener has to do with agriculture, and the eye-opener has to \ndo with technology. This particular amendment deals with the \ntechnological argument that we hear about the wonderful opportunity we \nhave that ``you just don't understand, Senator.'' That is what we \nhear--that we have gone from the smokestack to post-industrial to high-\ntech. Everybody is running around talking about high-tech and the \nwonderful economy. Well, I wish high-tech did contribute that much to \nthe economy. But the fact of the matter is there are not that many \njobs, and the few jobs that are there just don't pay.\n  Let me summarize this amendment. I ask, as a result, that the balance \nof trade with China in advanced technology projects be reported by the \nPresident to the Congress each year. That is in advanced technology \nproducts in an amount in excess of $5 billion. We now have a deficit in \nthe balance of trade with the People's Republic of China of $3.2 \nbillion, as of the end of 1999.\n  Now I have heard from the best of sources that that deficit could \nbecome an approximate $5 billion. So I am asking the President that if \nit exceeds $5 billion, we not only report it, but request a negotiation \nwith the People's Republic of China to see if we can eliminate that \nimbalance. That is all the amendment calls for. It is all permissive \nrequests, asking the President to do it. There is no burden whatsoever, \nbut it is certainly in the context of global competition that we talk \nabout it.\n  Let's start acting as if we know something about the competition. I \nsay that the jobs don't pay and there are not that many of them. Right \nto the point, by comparison, for example, in Redmond, WA, Microsoft has \n21,000 jobs when Boeing down the road has 100,000. There are many more \njobs at General Motors, Ford, the auto parts industry, and otherwise, \nthan there are in high-tech.\n  There is a lot of money in software, and therein you find these \nInternet billionaires trying to get market share--not profit. They \nhaven't come out with a profit yet. But there has been a footrace on \nthe New York Stock Exchange to get market share and invest in those who \nare winners. That is understandable. That is fine. That is the American \nway. We applaud it. However, when you look at the number of jobs, you \ncan go to Oracle, you can go to America Online. They now have their \nemployees in the Philippines. Microsoft has several thousand of its \nemployees offshore.\n  In 1992, a suit was brought by the so-called ``part-time temporary'' \nemployees claiming they ought to share in these stock options, other \nhealth benefits, and otherwise. They are really working full time. They \nwon the suit. Now they have changed them to temporary employees so they \nare not allowed to work over 364 days a year to comply with the law.\n  This is an article from around the beginning of the year. In Santa \nClara, the heart of Silicon Valley, the number of temporary workers has \njumped to 42 percent of the workforce this year, from 19 percent in the \n1980s. With respect to Microsoft, temporary workers have accounted for \nas much as one-third of its roughly 20,000-person workforce in the \nPuget Sound area. In May, it stood at 5,300.\n  I know the industrial workers at BMW, for example, have benefits and \nearn $21 to $22 an hour in Spartanburg, SC. We enjoy that. We \nappreciate it. It doesn't call for necessarily a computer expert or \ncollege graduate. There are many college graduates, of course, in the \nworkforce. But these are jobs for high school graduates--the majority \nof our working population.\n  These are the jobs for the seniors in the middle class of our \ndemocracy. Everybody is running around as if there is joy in the world \non money. But they are not thinking of the strength of the democracy \neconomically and the strength the middle class brings to our democracy, \nwith jobs for high school graduates and not just high-tech college \ndegrees. Of course, it is said that the technology industry now has a \nshortage. There is no shortage. If they only gave them full-time work, \nthey would be there. What they are really applying for are the college \ngraduates out of India and other countries to come in under the \nimmigration laws. They don't want to have to pay the temporary workers \neven around $35,000 a year when they can get Indian workers for $25,000 \na year--any way they can cut costs. Even Chinese-trained workers and \nothers come in. They would like to change the immigration laws to cut \nback the permanent high-paid workforce and put in this low-paid \ntemporary work practice. That is an eye opener to me because I just \ncouldn't understand why they couldn't find skilled workers.\n  The truth is, I have proof. The proof of the pudding is in the \neating. It is not just bragging. It is true, as they say. We have the \nbest in technical training in South Carolina, and we are for high tech. \nThere isn't any question about that. We are attracting Hoffman-LaRoche, \nHitachi, Honda--go right on down the list--Michelin, and all the rest \nof the fine industries from afar. We are proud of it. We are proud of \nthese foreign investors. At the same time, we have to compete and \nmaintain the strength of our economy.\n  Look at the People's Republic of China and the comparison of exports \nto imports in advanced technology. The parts of advanced machinery \ndeficit is $18.23 billion; parts and accessories of machinery not \nincorporating, $7.74 billion; parts of turbojet or turbo-propeller \nengines $4.01 billion; turbojet aircraft engines, $3.74 billion.\n  These are all deficits with the People's Republic of China.\n  Parts for printers, $3.52 billion; cellular radio telephones, $3.2 \nbillion; videocassette cartridge recorders, $2.32 billion; display \nunits, $1.64 billion; optical disk players, $1.64 billion; medical and \nsurgical instruments and appliances, $1.22 billion; transistors, $740 \nmillion; facsimile machines, $670 million; television receivers, $57 \nmillion; laser printers, $480 million.\n\n  I could keep going down the list. The point is that we have had a \ngreat relationship with the People's Republic of China. But in the \nrequired transfers of technology, that plus balance of trade has now \nresulted in a deficit in the balance of trade.\n  Advanced technology products represent a rare consistent source of \nearnings for the United States. During the last decade alone, the \nsurplus in global sales was $278 billion. But during the same period, \nU.S. trade deficits with China totaled $342 billion. It is worsening \nevery year.\n  That has occurred in spite of the numerous agreements with China to \nend the obligatory transfer of technology from U.S. companies to their \nChinese counterparts to protect intellectual property and to ensure \nregulatory transparency and the rule of law. Failure to implement these \nagreements goes a long way in explaining why the total U.S. deficit \nwith China has doubled from $338 billion in 1995, to $68.7 billion by \nthe end of 1999.\n  The United States also lost its technological trade surplus with \nChina in 1995 and has suffered deficits in this area every year since \nthen.\n  Last year, U.S. technology exports to China failed by 17 percent \nwhile the imports soared by 34 percent. The record $3.2 billion \ntechnology trade deficit in 1999 may reach $5 billion. This year, \ntechnology imports now cost twice as much as the falling U.S. exports.\n  Quite simply, China is developing its own export-driven, high-tech \nindustry, and with U.S. assistance.\n  A recent Department of Commerce study found that transferring \nimportant technology and next generation scientific research to Chinese \ncompanies is required for any access to the Chinese cheap labor force \nor its market.\n  Three of the most critical technology areas are computers, \ntelecommunications, and aerospace. The United\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\nStates lost its surplus in computers and components to China in 1990, \nand now pays seven times as much for imports as it earns from exports.\n  Compaq: Another foreign computer company that once dominated the \nChinese market a decade ago has now been displaced by a local company.\n  After 20 years of normal trade relations with China, no mobile \ntelephones are exported from the United States to China. Indeed, the \nUnited States trade with China in mobile phones involves only the \npayment for rapidly rising imports that now cost $100 million a year. \nChina has total control of its telephone networks. It recently \nabrogated a big contract with Qualcom, Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia \nand sold 85 percent of China's mobile phone handsets until recently. \nLast November, China's Ministry of Information imposed import and \nproduction quotas on mobile phones, producers, and substantial support \nfor nine Chinese companies.\n  Now, this agreement doesn't disturb those quotas. It does not open up \nthat market. The People's Republic of China expects the nine companies \nto raise their market share from the current 5 percent to 50 percent \nwithin 5 years.\n  The United States now has a large and rapidly growing deficit with \nChina in advanced radar and navigational devices. Nearly half of all \nU.S. technology exports to China during the 1980s were Boeing aircraft \nand 59 percent were in aerospace. But according to the SEC filings, \nBoeing's gross sales to and in China have generally fallen since 1993.\n  Incidentally, that is easy to report. It is being reported by Boeing \nand we just asked all of the companies to do what Boeing is doing.\n  Boeing MD 90-30 was certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation \nAdministration last November with Chinese companies providing 70 \npercent of local contents.\n  That is a Chinese airline, and they wonder why the Boeing workers led \nthe strike in Seattle last December.\n  More troubling, with the help of Boeing, Airbus, and others, China \nhas developed its own increasingly competitive civilian and military \naerospace production within 10 massive state-owned conglomerates.\n  China is a valuable U.S. partner in many matters, but it is also a \nsignificant competitor. Experiences in the United States with deficits \nworsening after tariff cuts and other agreements show this is not the \ntime to abandon strong U.S. trade laws, but rather to begin to apply \nthem fairly and firmly, since 42 percent of China's worldwide exports \ngo to the United States.\n  The Chinese know how to compete. In 1990, we passed in the United \nNations General Assembly a resolution to have hearings with respect to \nhuman rights in the People's Republic of China. I will never forget, \nthey fanned out over the Pacific down into Australia, Africa, India and \neverywhere else, and of course they are very competitive. What do they \ndo? The Chinese focus their diplomatic efforts on separating West \nEuropean governments from the United States by offering them token \npolitical concessions and hinting they would retaliate economically \nagainst any country that supported the resolution in Geneva.\n  A vote after 7 years, each year, and the 7th year it was turned down \nagain by a vote of 27-17. They know how to use their valuable, mammoth \n1.3 billion population market. But we, with the richest market in the \nworld, don't want to use it. Be fair, we whine; we continue to be fair \nand whine.\n  Now, with that $68 to $70 billion deficit in the balance of trade, \nthat is their 8-percent growth. We could say we are just not going to \ncontinue this one-sided deal and we are not going to continue to import \ntheir articles. We will just stop them as they have stopped us, and \nwith the growth they have to have, they will come to the table and talk \nturkey. There is no chance in the world with these children here who \nare in charge of our trade policy. They keep going up there to talk and \ntalk.\n  Again, Ambassador Barshefsky testified at the hearings: ``The rules \nput an absolute end to forced technology transfers.'' That was after \nthe WTO agreement with the People's Republic of China. ``The rules put \nan absolute end to forced technology transfers''--but fast forward a \nfew months. This is what they had in the Wall Street Journal, from \nWednesday, June 7 of this year: ``Qualcom Learns from its Mistakes in \nChina, U.S. Mobile Phone Maker Listens to Beijing's Call for Local \nProduction.''\n  They report that after losing a lucrative deal to supply off-the-\nshelf cellular phones to China, Qualcom is mapping a new strategy to \nsell next-generation products in the world's fastest growing mobile \nphone market.\n  In other words, to send over their technology.\n  They talk about these agreements, but as John Mitchell, the former \nAttorney General said: Watch what we do, not what we say.\n  Look at what they actually do and it is a disaster.\n  Mr. President, I have a few pages of the deficits and balance of \nadvanced technology trade with the People's Republic of China. I ask \nunanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 US ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TRADE LOSSES WITH CHINA\n               [Even In Advance Technology Products: The US Now Imports 65% More Than It Exports]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   HS Code              (1999: Dollars)                 US Export            US Import           1999 Balance\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS*            $5,007,198,994       $8,216,991,682     ($3,209,792,688)\n              TOTALS\n  0000305000 PTS & ACCESSORIES OF MACH OF                          0        1,540,659,071      (1,540,659,071)\n              HEADING OF 8471, NESOI\n  0000301000 PRTS OF ADP MCH, NOT INCRPRTNG                        0        1,235,882,818      (1,235,882,818)\n              CRT, PRT CRCT ASSEM.\n  0000990045 OPTICAL DISC (INCLUDING COMPACT                       0          567,322,116        (567,322,116)\n              DISC) PLAYERS\n  0000704065 HARD DISK DRIVE UNT, NESOI, W/OUT            29,987,116          391,325,747        (361,338,631)\n              EXTNL POWR SUPLY\n  0000408020 CAMCORDERS, 8MM                                  58,716          176,379,994        (176,321,278)\n  0000704035 FLOPPY DISK DRIVE UNT, NESOI, W/    ...................  ...................  ...................\n              OUT EXTRNL POW SPY\n  0000209070 CELLULAR RADIOTELEPHONES FOR PCRS,  ...................  ...................  ...................\n              1 KG AND UNDER\n  0000900000 VIDEO RECORDING OR REPRODUCING      ...................  ...................  ...................\n              APPARATUS EXC TAPE\n  0000200020 URANIUM FLUORIDE ENRICHED IN U235   ...................  ...................  ...................\n  0000100080 SEMICONDUCTOR DIODES NOT            ...................  ...................  ...................\n              PHOTOSENSITIVE >0.5 A\n  0000210000 FACSIMILE MACHINES                  ...................  ...................  ...................\n  0000404000 DIGITAL STILL IMAGE VIDEO CAMERAS   ...................  ...................  ...................\n  0000408085 STILL IMAGE VIDEO CAMERA, VDEO      ...................  ...................  ...................\n              CAMERA RECORDR, NESOI\n  0000400095 HYBRID INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, NESOI   ...................  ...................  ...................\n  0000309060 TELEVISION CAMERAS, EXCEPT COLOR    ...................  ...................  ...................\n  0000124000 TURBOJET AIRCRAFT ENGINES, THRUST   ...................  ...................  ...................\n              EXCEEDING 25 KN\n             REC TV, COLOR, FLAT PANEL SCREEN,   ...................  ...................  ...................\n              NESOI, DIS N/O 34.29\n             REC TV, COLOR, FLAT PANEL SCREEN,   ...................  ...................  ...................\n              NESOI, DIS N/O 33.02\n             PHOTOSENSITIVE DIODES,              ...................  ...................  ...................\n             SEMICONDUCTOR DIODES NOT            ...................  ...................  ...................\n              PHOTOSENSIVE=\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8565-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.

Mr. President, yesterday, the House of Representatives \nvoted on a bill which would have repealed the Federal charter of the \nBoy Scouts of America. Fortunately, the bill received a mere twelve \nvotes. However, even the consideration of such an absurd proposal \nconcerns me tremendously.\n  I recognize that traditional values and institutions which uphold \nthose values are under attack and considered out of date by some \nelements of our society. Unfortunately, the Boy Scouts of America is \none of many fine organizations being challenged.\n  The Boy Scouts embody the beliefs on which the very foundation of \nthis country was built. Since its inception in the early 1900s, this \nfine American institution has taught the young men of our Country about \nthe importance of doing one's duty to God, of serving others, and of \nbeing a responsible citizen, and has in turn provided this Nation with \ncountless distinguished leaders.\n  I find it disappointing that at a time when the United States is in \ncritical need of organizations that teach our youth character and \nintegrity, some would choose to attack the Boy Scouts of America. Few \nfail to recognize the hurdles today's adolescents face. Confronted by \nobstacles that were unimaginable in my day, Boy Scouts provides young \npeople with the knowledge, self confidence and willpower to do what is \nright in difficult situations.\n  I commend the Boys Scouts of America for its dedication to our youth, \nand reaffirm my commitment to its preservation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8565-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8565-S8566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MICROSOFT LITIGATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues an article that appeared on September 1 in the Washington \nPost, written by Charles Munger, who is the vice chairman of Berkshire \nHathaway, on the issue of the Microsoft litigation and the impact that \nwill have in the marketplace.\n  As I have considered this particular issue, as I pointed out to my \ncolleagues, I come to the Senate unburdened with a legal education but \nwith a background in business. Here is a businessman commenting on the \nimplications of this litigation in a way that I think others might find \ninteresting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 1, 2000]\n\n                    A Perverse Use of Antitrust Law\n\n                         (By Charles T. Munger)\n\n       As best I can judge from the Microsoft antitrust case, the \n     Justice Department believes the following: that any seller of \n     an ever-evolving, many-featured product--a product that is \n     constantly being improved by adding new features to every new \n     model--will automatically violate antitrust law if: (1) it \n     regularly sells its product at one all-features-included \n     price; (2) it has a dominant market share and (3) the seller \n     plays ``catch-up'' by adding an obviously essential feature \n     that has the same function as a product first marketed by \n     someone else.\n       If appellate courts are foolish enough to go along with the \n     trial court ruling in the Microsoft case, virtually every \n     dominant high-tech business in the United States will be \n     forced to retreat from what is standard competitive practice \n     for firms all over the world when they are threatened by \n     better technology first marketed elsewhere.\n       No other country so ties the hands of its strongest \n     businesses. We can see why by taking a look at America's own \n     history. Consider the Ford Motor Co. When it was the dominant \n     U.S. automaker in 1912, a small firm--a predecessor of \n     General Motors--invented a self-starter that the driver could \n     use from inside the car instead of getting out to crank the \n     engine. What Ford did in response was to add a self-starter \n     of its own to its cars (its ``one-price'' package)--thus \n     bolstering its dominant business and limiting the inroads of \n     its small competitor. Do we really want that kind of conduct \n     to be illegal?\n       Or consider Boeing. Assume Boeing is selling 90 percent of \n     U.S. airliners, always on a one-price basis despite the \n     continuous addition of better features to the planes. Do we \n     really want Boeing to stop trying to make its competitive \n     position stronger--as it also helps travelers and improves \n     safety by adding these desirable features--just because some \n     of these features were first marketed by other manufacturers?\n       The questions posed by the Microsoft case are (1) What \n     constitutes the impermissible and illegal practice of \n     ``tying'' a separate new product to a dominant old product \n     and (2) what constitutes the permissible and legal practice \n     of improving an existing one-price product that is dominant \n     in the market.\n       The solution, to avoid ridiculous results and arguments, is \n     easy. We need a simple, improvement-friendly rule that a new \n     feature is always a permissible improvement if there is any \n     plausible argument whatever that product users are in some \n     way better off.\n       It is the nature of the modern era that the highest \n     standards of living usually come where we find many super-\n     successful corporations that keep their high market shares \n     mostly through a fanatical devotion to improving one-price \n     products.\n       In recent years, one microeconomic trend has been crucial \n     in helping the United States play catch-up against foreign \n     manufacturers that had developed better and cheaper products: \n     Our manufacturers learned to buy ever-larger, one-price \n     packages of features from fewer and more-trusted suppliers. \n     This essential modern trend is now threatened by the Justice \n     Department.\n       Microsoft may have some peculiarities of culture that many \n     people don't like, but it could well be that good software is \n     now best developed within such a culture. Microsoft may \n     have been unwise to deny that it paid attention to the \n     competitive effects of its actions. But this is the course \n     legal advisers often recommend in a case such as this one, \n     where motives within individuals at Microsoft were mixed \n     and differed from person to person. A proper antitrust \n     policy should not materially penalize defendants who make \n     the government prove its case. The incumbent rulers of the \n     Justice Department are not fit to hold in trust the \n     guidance of antitrust policy if they allow such \n     considerations of litigation style to govern the \n     development of antitrust law, a serious business with \n     serious consequences outside the case in question.\n       While I have never owned a share of Microsoft, I have long \n     watched the improvement of its software from two vantage \n     points. First, I am an officer and part owner of Berkshire \n     Hathaway Inc., publisher of the World Book Encyclopedia, a \n     product I must admire because I know how hard it was to \n     create and because I grew up with it and found that it helped \n     me throughout a long life.\n       But despite our careful stewardship of World Book, the \n     value of its encyclopedia business was grossly and \n     permanently impaired when Microsoft started including a whole \n     encyclopedia, at virtually no addition in price, in its \n     software package. Moreover, I believe Microsoft did this \n     hoping to improve its strong business and knowing it would \n     hurt ours.\n       Even so, and despite the huge damage to World Book, I \n     believe Microsoft was entitled to improve its software as it \n     did, and that our society gains greatly--despite some damage \n     to some companies--when its strong businesses are able to \n     improve their products enough to stay strong.\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\n       Second, I am chairman and part owner of Daily Journal \n     Corp., publisher of many small newspapers much read by \n     lawyers and judges. Long ago, this corporation was in thrall \n     to IBM for its highly computerized operation. Then it was in \n     thrall to DEC for an even more computerized operation. Now it \n     uses, on a virtually 100 percent basis, amazingly cheap \n     Microsoft software in personal computers, in a still more \n     highly computerized operation including Internet access that \n     makes use of Microsoft's browser.\n       Given this history of vanished once-dominant suppliers to \n     Daily Journal Corp., Microsoft's business position looks \n     precarious to me. Yet, for a while at least, the \n     pervasiveness of Microsoft products in our business and \n     elsewhere helps us--as well as the courts that make use of \n     our publications--in a huge way.\n       But Microsoft software would be a lousy product for us and \n     the courts if the company were not always improving it by \n     adding features such as Explorer, the Internet browser \n     Microsoft was forced to add to Windows on a catch-up basis if \n     it didn't want to start moving backward instead of forward.\n       The Justice Department could hardly have come up with a \n     more harmful set of demands than those it now makes.

Mr. President, I rise to address an issue that is of \ngreat concern to the people of my State, and, I think beyond the \nparochial issue, the people of the country as a whole.\n  Private Fuels Storage is in the process of seeking a license to store \nnuclear waste on the Goshute Indian Reservation in the State of Utah. \nTheir application seeks a 20-year license with the option of extending \nit for an additional 20 years. This is being described as an ``interim \nstorage'' place for nuclear waste. I have been silent on this issue up \nuntil now. But I have decided to take the floor and announce my \nopposition to this storage for two reasons, which I will outline. One \nis something that requires further study and might be dealt with, but \nthe second and more powerful reason for my opposition is a permanent \npolicy issue.\n  Let me address the perhaps less important issue first. But it is an \nimportant issue that requires consideration; that is, the location of \nthis particular site with respect to the Utah Test and Training Range.\n  One of the things most Americans don't realize is that we require the \nAir Force to train over land. There are very few training ranges that \nwill allow aircraft to train over land. Much of the training that takes \nplace in the Armed Forces takes place over the water, but it is not the \nright kind of training experience for pilots to always have to fly over \nwater.\n  The Utah Test and Training Range has a long history of service to our \nNation's military. It was there that the pilots trained for the flights \nover Tokyo in the Second World War. Indeed, it was there that the crew \nof the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was trained.\n  The proposal for the storage site at the Goshute Indian Reservation \nis in a location that will affect the flight pattern of Air Force \npilots flying over the Utah Test and Training Range. I have flown that \npattern myself in a helicopter provided by the military, and I have \nseen firsthand how close it is to the proposed nuclear waste \nrepository.\n  There are people at the Pentagon who have said the flight path will \nnot be affected; everything is fine. I have learned during the debate \nover the base realignment and closure activity that sometimes what is \nsaid out of the Pentagon is more politically correct than it is \nsubstantively correct. I have talked to the pilots at Hill Air Force \nBase who fly that pattern, and they have told me, free of any handlers \nfrom the Pentagon, that they are very nervous about having a nuclear \nwaste repository below military airspace that will require them to \nmaneuver in a way that might cause danger, and could certainly erode \nthe level of the training that they can obtain at the Utah Test and \nTraining Range.\n  I do not think we should move ahead with certifying this particular \nlocation until there has been a complete and thorough study of the \nimpact of this proposal on the Utah Test and Training Range and upon \nthe Air Force's ability to test its pilots.\n  That, as I say, is the first reason I rise to oppose this. But it is \na reason that is subject to study, analysis, and examination, and may \nnot be a permanent reason.\n  The second reason I rise to oppose this is more important, in my \nview, than the first one. I want to deal with that at greater length.\n  Let us look at the history of nuclear waste storage in the United \nStates. The United States decided 18 years before a deadline in 1998 \nthat the Department of Energy would, in 1998, take responsibility for \nthe storage of nuclear waste. That means that through a number of \nadministrations--Republican and Democrat--the Department of Energy has \nhad 18 years to get ready to deal with this problem. Current estimates \nare that the Department of Energy is between 12 and 15 years away from \nhaving a permanent solution to this problem. I do not think that is an \nadmirable record--to have had 18 years' notice, miss the deadline, and \nstill be as much as 15 years away from it.\n\n  The deadline is now 2 years past, and we are no closer to getting an \nintelligent long-term solution to this problem than we were. Perhaps \nthat is not true. Perhaps we are closer in this sense: That a location \nhas been identified. Up to $8 billion, or maybe even as much as $9 \nbillion, has been spent on preparing that location as a permanent \nstorage site for America's nuclear waste. We are no closer politically \nto being ready for that. We perhaps are a good bit closer in terms of \nthe site.\n  I am referring, of course, to the proposed waste repository at Yucca \nMountain in Nevada, on the ground that was originally set aside and \nused as the Nevada Test Site. Many times people forget that. The Nevada \nTest Site is where we tested the bombs that were dropped elsewhere, and \nthe bombs went into our nuclear stockpile. So the ground at the Nevada \nTest Site has already been subjected to nuclear exposure. The seismic \nstudies have been done, and Yucca Mountain has been found to be the \nmost logical place to put this material on a long-term basis. Twice \nwhile I have been in the Congress we have voted to move ahead on that, \nand twice the President has vetoed the bills.\n  Against that background comes this proposal to build an interim \nstorage site in the State of Utah on the reservation of the Goshute \nIndians adjacent to the Utah Test and Training Range.\n  This is my reason for opposing that so-called interim site: I do not \nbelieve that it will be interim. I do not believe that. If we start \nshipping nuclear material to the Goshute Reservation in Utah, that \ngives the administration and other politicians the opportunity to \ncontinue to delay moving ahead on Yucca Mountain.\n  Now, how much Federal money has been spent preparing the Goshute \nIndian Reservation to receive this? Virtually none, compared to the \nbetween $8 and $9 billion that has been spent on Yucca Mountain.\n  There will be one delay after another if this thing starts in Utah. \nPeople will say: We don't need to move ahead on Yucca Mountain; we have \na place we can put it in the interim. The interim will become a \ncentury, or two centuries, while the Government continues to dither on \nthe issue of Yucca Mountain.\n  I am in favor of nuclear power. I believe it is safe. I believe it is \nessential to our overall energy policy. I am in favor of the Energy \nDepartment's fulfilling the commitment that was made in 1980 that said \nby 1998 the Department of Energy will have a permanent storage \nfacility. I believe we have identified that facility through sound \nscience, through expenditure of Federal funds, through every kind of \nresearch that can be done, and we are ignoring, for whatever political \nreason, the opportunity to solve this problem at Yucca Mountain while \nwe are talking about an interim solution at the Goshute Reservation.\n  It is simply not a wise public policy to say that since we cannot \nsolve the permanent problem, we will find a backdoor way for a stopgap \ninterim solution. The stopgap interim solution\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\nwill become a permanent solution without the plan, without the \nanalysis, and without the expenditures that have already gone into the \npermanent solution that is available.\n  Therefore, for these two reasons, I announce my opposition to the \ndepository on the Goshute Reservation in Utah. I am sending a letter to \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission asking that they extend the time for \nanother 120 days for public comment on their proposal to proceed with \nthis license. I think the first reason that I have cited alone \njustifies that extension of time because there has not been sufficient \nanalysis of the impact of this proposed facility on the Utah Test and \nTraining Range. I hope in that 120-day period we can get that kind of \nanalysis.\n  The second more serious reason will still remain. I hope in that 120-\nday period we can begin to approach that, as well.\n  I thank the Senators for their courtesy in allowing me to proceed on \nthis issue. It relates directly to the State of Utah, but I think in \nterms of the impact on nuclear power as a whole, it is an issue about \nwhich the entire Nation should be concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8567-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8567-S8569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DR. WEN HO LEE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on the extraordinary case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee who was released \nfrom custody yesterday by the Federal judge saying that Dr. Lee was \nowed an apology because of major mistakes made by ranking officials at \nthe Department of Justice and the Department of Energy. This matter has \nbeen the subject of oversight inquiry by the Judiciary subcommittee, \nwhich I chair. Our inquiry began last October and ended in early \nDecember at the request of the Director of the FBI so that it would not \ninterfere with the pending prosecution of Dr. Lee.\n  There are many questions which arise from what has happened since--\nespecially the dramatic comments of Judge Parker yesterday that Wen Ho \nLee was owed an apology, and that blame lay at the doorsteps of the top \nofficials in Justice and Energy.\n  The questions which need to be explored are:\n  What evidence or what factors were there which led to Dr. Lee's \ndetention and solitary confinement for some 9 months?\n  What did the Department of Justice and the Department of Energy do by \nway of their investigation?\n  What were the specifics where the key FBI witness changed his \ntestimony from an earlier hearing where he said Dr. Lee was deceptive, \nto a later hearing where he omitted that very important fact which led \nto Wen Ho Lee's detention?\n  Was there any racial profiling in this case?\n  How did the Department of Justice focus on Dr. Lee?\n  Those are among the many questions to be answered in an oversight \nhearing which our subcommittee is attempting to schedule now for the \nweek of September 25.\n  The inquiries which we have already made have suggested that there \nwas significant reason for the FBI to conduct the investigation. Dr. \nWen Ho Lee is entitled to the presumption of innocence like every \nAmerican. And on this date of the report, he is presumed innocent, and \nhe is, in fact, innocent. But on this date of the record, the \nDepartment of Justice has convicted itself of absolute incompetence. \nLet me be very specific about why.\n  Director Louis Freeh sent his top deputy, John Lewis, to talk to \nAttorney General Janet Reno in August of 1997 to request a warrant for \nDr. Lee under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. There was a \nstatement of probable cause which was very substantial which justified \nthe issuance of that warrant to gather further evidence. Attorney \nGeneral Reno referred that matter to a man named Daniel Seikaly in her \ndepartment, a person who had never handled a warrant under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  The wrong standard was applied, and the FBI was turned down \nnotwithstanding the top deputy, John Lewis, having been sent there by \nDirector Freeh. Then, inexplicably, for the next 16 months, the FBI did \nnot conduct any investigations. Some memoranda were transmitted between \nWashington, DC, and Albuquerque, NM, but the case lay dormant.\n  It is really hard to understand why the case would lie dormant when \nthe FBI had been so arduous in asking for the warrant under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. But then, in late December of 1998, it \nwas known that the Cox committee was about to publish its report and \nwas said to be highly critical of the way the Department of Justice and \nthe Department of Energy handled the Wen Ho Lee case.\n  Then the Department of Energy initiated a polygraph of Dr. Lee on \nDecember 23, 1998, conducted by an outside agency--not by the FBI but \nby Wackenhut. The Wackenhut contractors told the FBI that Dr. Lee \npassed the polygraph but did not give the FBI agents the polygraph \ncharts or the videotape of the interview.\n  On January 17 of 1999, the FBI conducted an interview with Dr. Lee to \nclose out the case. But then, on January 22, 5 days later, the FBI \nfinally received the complete record of the December 23 polygraph and \nbegan to question the Wackenhut interpretation of the results.\n  Without going into more of the details in the limited time I have at \nthe moment--there will be more time to amplify this statement later in \nthe subcommittee hearings--Dr. Lee was not terminated until March 8. \nThe search warrant was not issued until April 9 in the context of \nsubstantial evidence of deletions and downloading. There are very \nsignificant questions for the Department of Justice to answer as to why \nthe warrant was not issued under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, why the investigation was not made by the FBI from August of 1997 \nto December of 1998, why Dr. Lee was kept on the job in the face of \ndownloading very substantial classified matters.\n\n  The issues about his retention require very serious oversight. There \nare all the appearances that the FBI's failure to handle the matter \nproperly, the Department of Justice's failure to handle the matter \nproperly, through the disclosure by the Cox committee in January of \n1999, and the ultimate firing, the ultimate search warrant, suggest \nthat the Department of Justice really threw the book at Dr. Lee to make \nup for their own failings. But there needs to be a determination on \noversight as to the justification for keeping Dr. Lee in solitary \nconfinement. When the judge finally suggested that he was going to \nrelease Dr. Lee to house arrest, the Federal Government put out an \nobjection to his having any contact with his wife, which was really \nextraordinary.\n  Then suddenly, on a plea agreement, on one of 59 counts under the \nindictment, according to the Department of Justice, it is OK to release \nDr. Lee on the plea bargain. There was no fine, no jail time on the \nconviction, only a debriefing. There is a real question as to how \nmeaningful that is since those materials are customarily offered on a \ntender by Dr. Lee's counsel before the plea bargain is entered into.\n  These are some of the issues which our Judiciary subcommittee will be \nlooking into on oversight, both as to the Department of Justice and the \nDepartment of Energy. When a Federal judge says that America owes Dr. \nLee an apology, the details have to be determined. When the FBI makes \nrepresentations that Dr. Lee poses a threat to the security of the \nUnited States, and that the information he has downloaded could lead to \nthe defeat of our military forces worldwide, those assertions need to \nbe investigated as a matter of oversight. How did the Department of \nJustice move from those very serious allegations to a statement, in \neffect, that let the matter go, without a fine, without a jail \nsentence, with only probation on a single one of 59 counts.\n  The handling of these espionage matters is of great import. The \nsubcommittee is nearing completion of a report on Dr. Peter Lee, who \nconfessed to providing information to the People's Republic of China on \nnuclear secrets and submarine detection. These are matters which \nrequire congressional oversight. Our Judiciary subcommittee will \nundertake just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, like most people this morning, I read the \nheadline ``Physicist Lee Freed With Apology.'' I want to comment on \nthis.\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\nI want to be careful about what I say because I am angered and \nembarrassed about what has happened to one of our fellow Americans.\n  For the last few months I have been troubled by the case of Wen Ho \nLee. I have been troubled because I have had the deep suspicion that \nDr. Lee was a victim of scapegoatism by the Justice Department and by \nthe Energy Department. But I tried to follow the old adage we all learn \nfrom our mamas--that when you do not have the facts, wait until you get \nthe facts before you have something to say. Today we have the facts. \nThe facts are that the Federal judge in this case said--talking about \nJanet Reno, the Attorney General of the United States of America, and \nBill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy--and I quote the Federal \njudge:\n\n       They did not embarrass me alone. They have embarrassed our \n     entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it.\n\n  Let me say they certainly embarrassed me. It seems to me that what \nhappened was we had a terrible breach of security. Our Energy \nDepartment was asleep at the switch when the nuclear secrets of this \ncountry were stolen. That was raised to a level of public awareness. \nRather than going out and finding the person who was guilty of stealing \nthese secrets, it now appears that what the Justice Department did, to \nits great shame and our embarrassment, is engage in racial profiling to \nidentify an Asian American of Chinese ancestry, Dr. Lee, and to use him \nas a scapegoat for the failure of this administration to protect \nAmerican national security.\n  This individual citizen ended up month after month in solitary \nconfinement, having been charged in a 59 count indictment, and then \nwhen it was clear that there was no case, they plea bargained to \nrelease him on a minor offense. I say ``minor'' only as compared to the \nselling of nuclear secrets of the United States to the Chinese, or \ngiving such information to them. Dr. Lee transferred secure data to a \nnonsecure source, a charge for which John Deutch, in a much higher \nposition of government in this administration, was never prosecuted.\n  In return for admitting guilt to this charge, this man, who was \ndenied his freedom and who was on the verge of having his life ruined, \nis now exonerated by a Federal judge. I would like to say this:\n  First of all, I don't understand an administration that stands up and \ndamns racial profiling and yet engages in it when it suits their \npolitical agenda.\n  I don't understand scapegoating when you are talking about a man's \nfreedom and when you are talking about a man's life.\n  I think if our Attorney General, Janet Reno, had any honor and any \nshame, and I think if Bill Richardson had any honor and any shame, they \nwould resign as a result of this outrage to the American people.\n  The idea that this man was in solitary confinement month after month, \ndeemed a public enemy, and vilified, it seems to me, at least, based on \neverything we know--and it seems if the Justice Department had any \nfacts, they would have presented them to this court and to this judge--\nbecause of his race. I think it is an outrage. And I think an apology \nis due from the President of the United States.\n  I think this is a terrible wrong and an outrage. I have for months \nbeen suspicious that this was happening, but I didn't want to say \nanything until we had the facts.\n  I hope my language hasn't offended anybody. But I just do not \nunderstand people who, to get political cover for their own failings, \ndon't seem to care that we are talking about the life of a real person. \nOur system is not based on my rights, or Bill Clinton's rights, it is \nbased on the rights of each individual citizen.\n  The idea that this man has had his good name and his family so \nattacked and has been in solitary confinement when the only thing the \nJustice Department ended up getting him to plea bargain on was that he \ntook material out of a secure setting to a nonsecure setting when \nanother official of this Government, by his own admission, did exactly \nthe same thing and was never prosecuted--this is a terrible outrage.\n  I just didn't feel comfortable not saying something about it. I just \nwanted to go on Record as saying that there is something very wrong in \nAmerica. This is not the America I grew up in when this kind of thing \nhappens. Somebody in the Senate needed to say something about it. I \ndecided that was me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, could I respond in the most emphatically \nsympathetic and supportive way to the statement of the Senator from \nTexas.\n  In 1993, this Congress passed legislation to create the Commission on \nProtecting and Reducing Government Secrecy in the United States. We had \na fine commission. Senator Helms and I represented the Senate, and in \nthe House, Larry Combest and Lee Hamilton, and John Deutch of the CIA. \nThe commission came up with a unanimous finding.\n  We began with the proposition--and I can say to a fellow academic; he \nwill recognize it--Max Weber set forth that secrecy is the natural \nweapon of a bureaucracy against the parliament and against the other \nagencies of the political system. We found the most extraordinary \nthings. I later wrote about this.\n  In December 1946, a brilliant crypto analyst at Arlington Hall Girl's \nSchool, not far from the Pentagon, and broke the first of the Soviet \nKGB codes. These are one-time pads. You ``can't break them'' but they \ngot a little careless, used once or twice. There were the names of all \nthe physicists at Los Alamos, the principal ones. A measure of the \nextent of the KGB operation in this country? As our crypto analyst \nworked along, an Army corporal cipher clerk handing him pencils, \ncoffee, whatever, an Army corporal cipher clerk, a KGB spy. In very \nshort order, the KGB knew we were breaking their code.\n  Then, of course, Kim Philby was at the British Embassy and we shared \nsome of these findings with the British--we probably still do. Then he \ndefected. In no time at all, they knew that we knew, and we knew that \nthey knew that we knew.\n  People might be interested to learn, who was the one person in the \nU.S. Government who did not know? The President of the United States. \nOn whose orders was this the case? Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. This is Army property. I guess he had a sense that if \nhe said, ``Give everything to the White House,'' it gets out.\n  President Truman never knew any of these things.\n  With the exceptions of the Rosenbergs, none of these persons were \never prosecuted. One of them, the most important, Hall, teaches physics \nat Cambridge University in England, and comes back and forth to this \ncountry. He had been part of that tremendous effort. He was from an \nimmigrant family living in Manhattan, went to Queens College. They \nspotted him at Queens College, and they sent him up to Harvard. Then he \nwas sent to Los Alamos. He was never prosecuted because to prosecute, \nit must be stated where we got the information and so forth.\n  Secrecy can be so destructive to the flow of information that is \nneeded. It will continue long after there is any conceivable need for \nsecrecy. We estimated recently that the classified documents we have in \nplace now would be 441 times stacked up the height of the Washington \nMonument.\n  A trivial example, but a characteristic example, President Ford at \none point had in mind that I might be Librarian of Congress. I was in \nIndia, leaving the post as Ambassador and had a cable exchange with the \nhead of personnel in the White House. I was going back through Peking, \nstaying with the Bushes, stopped at Pearl Harbor, and then would be \nhere. An historian writing about the Library of Congress--an \ninteresting post; there have only been seven or eight in our history--\npicked this up and went to the Ford Library. Yes, there is information; \nbut no, she couldn't see it, it was classified. It took months to get \nthe cable to Washington declassified.\n  One could argue that there was good reason to keep that classified \nfor seven days, but 30 years later? That is a pattern. It is a pattern \nthat the people who deal with these things as classified don't know the \nmaterial, the subject matter; they don't know the physics taught to \nfirst-year graduate students\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\nat MIT, but information is still classified ``top secret, no form,'' in \nsome bureaucracy in Washington. The absolute standard operating \nprocedure is to classify something ``Top secret'' and then send it to \nthe President in the hopes that it will get on his desk if it looks \nreally enormous.\n  There are endless examples of clippings from Newsweek magazine \nstamped ``Confidential.'' Just a bureaucratic mode.\n  The idea that Dr. Lee was imprisoned is hard to understand. Solitary \nconfinement, worse. But leg irons? There were leg irons so one could \nnot run off to Mexico. Obviously, much needs to be explained.\n  I say also for Dr. Deutch, this is a man of utmost patriotism. What \nwas his offense? I don't think it is a crime at all. He took work home \nwith him. After dinner he would sit down and work. There is a penalty \nfor that, and he accepted it. He has had all his clearances removed, \nwhich is a heavy price for a scientist, but he has accepted that. The \nidea that he has done anything wrong beyond that is to say to people: \nDon't go near the clandestine services of the United States, don't go \nnear the atomic laboratories.\n\n  I have no standing as a scientist, but I was a member of the \nPresident's Science Advisory Committee, and I am a fellow of the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, and having been a \nmember of the board and vice president at one point, I can say I know a \nfair number of scientists. Their postdoctorate students don't want \nanything to do with the Federal laboratories.\n  If you want to do something to the national security of the United \nStates, keep the best minds out of the weapons labs. That will do it \nfaster than any transfer of information, which has a half-life of nine \nmonths before others catch up or they think it up on their own.\n  I can speak to this. For example, with atomic secrets, we have a \nwonderful person, a great man, Hans Bethe, who was standing alongside \nOppenheimer at Los Alamos. A man of luminous intelligence. There is \nnothing that he is more skeptical about than the idea of keeping \nphysical science secret. He tells the story that after the atomic bomb \nwas detonated, he and the other physicists involved said: All right, \nbut no hydrogen bomb. No, that is too much.\n\n  And there was the further advantage:\n\n       And thank God, nobody knew how. It was not possible to make \n     one. It can't be done. The physics just won't work.\n\n  And then he said: Stanislaw Ulam and Edward Teller figured out how it \ncould be done.\n  And we said: Oh, Lord, if Ulam can think of it, Sakharov will think \nof it. So we had better go through with it.\n  He and Oppenheimer said:\n\n       You have to go through to a hydrogen bomb because science \n     is not in a box that you can put in a closet.\n\n  I also want to say on this floor that I have not known a more \npatriotic man than John Deutch; absolutely committed to this country's \nsecurity. Provost at MIT, a physical chemist, a man of great science, \nwho made the error of working after supper at home. Nothing was ever \ntransferred to anybody. He was working. What do I do in the morning? \nThat kind of thing. And the very idea we would try to punish him for \nthat is to put, I say, in jeopardy the whole reputation of American \nclassified science and clandestine service. We do that at a great cost, \nwhich you will not recognize for half a century, perhaps. But it will \ncome.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for what he has said. I appreciate his \nindulgence in what I have joined him saying.\n  I see my colleague seeks recognition. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8569-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8569-S8570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on an issue which \nhas been talked about on the floor of the Senate this morning, and that \nis prescription drugs.\n  We all hear the critical cry--I say ``cry'' because it is almost \nthat--as we talk to seniors across this country who say: We need some \nhelp; these drugs cost too much; they are out of our reach; we need \nhelp.\n  What is interesting is this is not heard from everybody. It is \nprincipally from a group of people who don't have access to affordable \nprescription drugs, and now we are charged as a body to develop a \npolicy to ensure, to guarantee that coverage and getting it as quickly \nas we can to those people who need it, who are crying out now.\n  This past year I received over 3,000 letters or e-mails from seniors \nin Tennessee on this very topic. What did I hear? One elderly couple \nfrom Kingsport, TN, wrote:\n\n       We are requesting that you do not support any big \n     government drug scheme. Government does not do things better \n     than individuals. Please protect seniors' choice of private \n     coverage. One size does not fit all. We do not want the \n     bureaucrats interfering with our doctor-patient prescription \n     drug choices.\n\n  A widow from Tennessee who had a liver transplant writes:\n\n       I'm against the big government plan. I have certain \n     medications I must take and want to be able to get whatever \n     medicines I need.\n\n  These letters speak volumes. They, first of all, point out the \nimportance of health care security for our seniors that prescription \ndrugs do provide but also the importance of having a right to choose \nwhat is best for one's individual needs.\n  I mention these letters because I do believe this body should respond \nas government should, in the broader sense, with a health care \nproposal, prescription drug plan, that gives affordable access to all \nseniors, making it a part of health care security. The plans we have \nheard talked about in the press today are the Bush Medicare plan and \nthe Gore prescription drug plan that have been contrasted on the floor \nearlier today by a colleague from the other side of the aisle.\n  I want to comment on those. It is useful for this body because, in \nessence, Governor Bush's proposal looks at two bills on this floor. One \nis Chairman Roth's bill, which gives an immediate helping hand to those \nseniors who need it today, working predominantly through the States; \nthe second component of the Bush proposal is modeled on the same \nconcept as Breaux-Frist, the bipartisan plan that is based on the way \nwe get our health care as Senators today.\n  On the Gore side--and that is why this contrast is useful --is the \nClinton-Gore proposal, which is also on this floor in terms of \nprescription drugs. Although we use Governor Bush and Vice President \nGore, they both represent bills that are currently on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Looking at Governor Bush's Medicare plan, it has two parts. One is \noverall modernization, long-term strengthening of the overall Medicare \nplan, the health care plan for our seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities. The second part offers immediately, right now, the help \nthat seniors are crying out for today. You simply cannot ignore those \nlow-income and middle-income individuals who can't afford the drugs, \nwho really are choosing between putting food on the table and buying \nthose prescription drugs.\n\n  The two-part plan has its overall goal to strengthen Medicare and to \nget that prescription drug coverage to all seniors. It is based on this \nbipartisan plan, this Breaux-Frist type principle.\n  The primary focus of Governor Bush's proposal is a universal \nprescription drug proposal that includes this comprehensive \nmodernization. It does several things. No. 1, it lets seniors choose. \nBeneficiaries can stay in traditional Medicare, what they have today, \nor they can choose a plan such as Senator Bill Frist or Senator Roth or \nPresident Clinton has, a model called the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan. Under Governor Bush's proposal and under the Breaux-\nFrist proposal, all current Medicare benefits are preserved.\n  The real advantage is that seniors for the first time are given a \nreal option to choose among plans that might better be able to meet \ntheir individual needs. One plan might have more preventive care. \nAnother plan might have vision care--not in Medicare today. Another \nplan might have dental care--not in Medicare today.\n  No. 2, Governor Bush's proposal, and the Breaux-Frist proposal in the \nSenate, provides all seniors some prescription drug coverage access. \nYes, there is a 25-percent subsidy of the cost of those premiums for \neverybody with a 100-percent subsidy for those people under 150 percent \nof poverty.\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\n  All seniors under Governor Bush's proposal have a limit, a cap on how \nmuch is spent out of pocket, not only for prescription drugs but for \nall health care--visits to the physician, visits to the hospital, \nprescription drug coverage. Once your out-of-pocket expenditures get \nabove $6,000, it is covered by the Government\n  Fourth, this proposal is based on the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan. I think that is very important because seniors \nunderstand if that care is really good enough for President Clinton or \nSenator Frist, health care will be good enough for me.\n  No. 5, Governor Bush has said yes, this is going to take more money. \nIt is going to take about $110 billion in more money. Why? Because that \nmodernization in bringing things up to date, that better coordination \nof services, is going to require an investment. That is in real \ncontrast to the Clinton-Gore proposal which, when we first heard about \nit, was going to cost $167 billion; that is when it was introduced last \nyear. Right now, the figure touted by the Gore campaign is $250 \nbillion. The Congressional Budget Office says no, it is not $167, it is \nnot $250 billion, but in truth it is about a $337 billion plan.\n  So, taxpayers, watch out. Seniors, watch out. This plan has already \ndoubled in size, in how much it costs, in the last 12 months, the plan \nof the Clinton-Gore team. No. 6, and most important, I think, in the \nshort term, is seniors deserve this coverage now, not 2 years from now, \nnot under the Clinton-Gore plan which phases in over another 8 years--\nactually they don't fully implement it until the year 2010. Our seniors \nneed health care now.\n  I would like to briefly turn at this point to S. 3016 and S. 3017, \nintroduced by Senator Roth. What this bill says--which complements, \nsupplements, and parallels very much what Governor Bush has said, and \nGovernor Bush did it through his helping hand--since we have a problem \nnow, let's reach out right now and get the money to the neediest \npeople, the low- and moderate-income people who need it right now; not \nto be phased in later.\n  What this Roth bill does is it makes grants immediately available to \nthose people who need it the most. It will extend prescription drug \ncoverage immediately, recognizing it is a transition program, until we \nmodernize Medicare through the Breaux-Frist or Governor Bush approach. \nIt immediately extends prescription drug coverage to about 85 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries.\n  It serves as a bridge to overall Medicare modernization, overall \nreform.\n  This is not the answer. This is the short-term answer to plug that \nhole that everybody agrees is there, whether Democrat or Republican. \nThat hole is created because true modernization is going to take 12 \nmonths or 24 months or 36 months. So let's start that modernization \nprogram now, but, in the meantime, let's get help to the people who \nneed it, who are out there making that choice between putting food on \nthe table, buying those groceries, or buying prescription drugs. Let's \nhelp them in 6 months, not 10 years from now, not 5 years from now. \nThat is where the Roth bill moves right in.\n  Let me point out that 22 States already have taken action. Remember, \nall 50 States right now are administering prescription drug programs. \nThat mechanism is there right now. It is not in HCFA, it is not in the \nFederal Government now, and that is why, under Chairman Roth's \nleadership, we can get that aid to the people who need it most.\n  I will talk more about the Clinton-Gore plan later, but let me just \nclose by saying all I said sharply contrasts it.\n  No. 1, the Gore plan forces seniors to wait 10 years before it is \nfully implemented. It doesn't even start offering any drugs or drug \ncoverage for at least 2 years.\n  No. 2, it doesn't give seniors any choice. They can choose one time, \nat 64\\1/2\\ years. They choose one time, and that is it. Contrast that \nwith the Breaux-Frist plan or Governor Bush's plan, which allows choice \nat any point in time.\n  No. 3, the Clinton-Gore plan does nothing to strengthen Medicare. It \nis a 50-percent copayments for drugs. It does nothing to modernize or \nstrengthen Medicare long term.\n  No. 4, it does nothing to benefit, to improve that underlying benefit \npackage in terms of preventive drugs, preventive care, in terms of \nvision care, in terms of dental care. The flexibility is simply not \nthere in the Gore plan.\n  I close by saying our debate about the various plans is an exciting \none for me. Our goal must be health care security for seniors. Governor \nBush and our plans, through Breaux-Frist and the Roth proposal, do just \nthat.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8570-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, at the end of this week the men and women \nof the United States Olympic Team will march into the Olympic Stadium \nin Sydney, Australia for the XXVII Olympic games. These athletes who \ninspire all of us to set high goals and reach those goals deserve our \ncongratulations and support. The American people also deserve praise \nand thanks for their individual contributions to our athletes and to \nthe United States Olympic Committee. Without those contributions, most \nof our athletes would never have the chance to compete.\n  American companies have also financially supported the United States \nOlympic Committee and the Olympic games through official sponsorships. \nUnfortunately, Mr. President, that Olympic sponsorship is being eroded \nby an insidious practice known as ``ambush marketing''--advertising \nthat falsely implies an official association with a particular event or \norganization. In no context is ambush marketing more prevalent or more \ndamaging than with the Olympic games which, because of the reliance on \nprivate and corporate funding, are increasingly threatened by a decline \nin sponsorship interest.\n  Internationally, it is fair to say that corporate sponsorship saved \nthe Olympic movement. In 1976, Montreal was left with a debt of nearly \none billion dollars following the summer Olympic games in that city. \nLos Angeles, however, managed to capitalize on corporate sponsorship, \nturning a profit and revitalizing international interest in the games.\n  American companies have long been proud to be official sponsors of \nthe Olympic games because of the humanitarian and inspirational values \nthe games present. These companies also recognize the valuable \nmarketing potential of the Olympics, enhancing\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\ntheir presence and business reputation in an increasingly global \nmarketplace. By encouraging corporate involvement, Olympic organizers \nhave ensured that such companies continue to devote tremendous \nfinancial and human resources to be identified as official Olympic \nsponsors. This sponsorship is particularly important in the United \nStates, because there is no direct government support of our athletes.\n  Congress has recognized the value of corporate sponsorship by \nadopting the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which I authored, to \nauthorize the International Olympic Committee to grant worldwide \nsponsors of the Olympic games exclusive rights to use certain emblems, \ntrademarks, and designations in the advertising, promotion and sale of \nproducts in designated product categories. The act also provides \nenhanced trademark protections to prevent deceptive practices \nspecifically involving the use of Olympic trademarks or trade names. As \na consequence, numerous major corporations have become Olympic sponsors \nand have contributed millions of dollars to the games and to U.S. \nathletes.\n\n  As the popularity of the Olympics has grown, so have the incentives \nto be associated with the games. Unfortunately, it is too easy for \ncompanies to imply an affiliation with the olympics, without becoming \nofficial sponsors. Such ambush or parasite marketing is often subtle--\nfrequently depicting olmypic sports, athletes, medals, the host city, a \nburning torch, or other olympic games indicia--but its effect is \nproven. Studies have concluded that ambush marketers have been quite \nsuccessful in their efforts to mislead the American public.\n  As companies begin to perceive only negligible goodwill or favorable \npublicity resulting from their Olympic sponsor status, their \nwillingness to support the Olympic games and our athletes may wane. \nThat is why I am considering legislation to further clarify the types \nof unauthorized use of Olympic games imagery and indicia that are \nactionable under the Amateur Sports Act. Australia, which will host the \nOlympic games in the next few weeks, has in place an ``Olympic Insignia \nProtection Act'' to protect against ambush marketing, and we may need \nadditional protection in the U.S. Unfortunately, that legislation \ncannot be addressed this year.\n  There is a vast difference between freedom of speech and deceptive \nadvertising. I will ask the congress to authorize private suits, \nsimilar to private antitrust legislation, to allow those injured by \n``ambush marketing'' to recover their losses and financially punish \nthose who try to mislead our people.\n  The USOC has been aggressive in protecting its trademark interests. \nThese additional tools may be needed, however, to ensure the value of \nOlympic sponsorships and encourage corporate participation in the \nOlympic movement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8571-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Protection Act of 2000. \nIt is critically important that the Congress soon pass this legislation \nto reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and to continue the \nprogress made since the Act was first passed in 1994.\n  I am proud to have been a cosponsor of both the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act, VAWA as well as S. 2787 and other legislation \nintroduced in the 106th Congress to reauthorize VAWA. Through a $1.6 \nbillion grants program, VAWA has provided hundreds of thousands of \nwomen with shelter to protect their families, established a national \ntoll-free hotline which has responded to innumerable calls for help, \nand funded domestic violence prevention programs across the Nation. \nMost importantly, VAWA has provided a new emphasis on domestic violence \nas a critical problem that cannot be tolerated or ignored.\n  In my own State of Maryland, the funding provided by VAWA is \nessential to the continued operation of facilities like Heartly House \nin Frederick, Maryland, which provides shelter to battered women, \naccompanies rape victims on hospital visits, and assists women in \ncrisis in numerous other ways. In Baltimore City, VAWA funds have \nhelped create a dedicated docket in the District Court which has \neffectively increased the number of domestic violence cases prosecuted. \nIn Montgomery County, Maryland, VAWA funds provide victims with legal \nrepresentation in civil protective order hearings. Importantly, the \nstaff for this program is located inside the Courthouse, making it easy \nand safe for victims to get the help that they need. VAWA funds are \nbeing used creatively in Garrett County, where the Sheriff's Department \npurchased a four wheel drive vehicle so that their domestic violence \nteam can travel to remote areas of the county--overcoming the feelings \nof isolation many victims feel, particularly in the winter months.\n  Programs like these are working in Maryland and all across the \ncountry to reduce the incidence of domestic violence. And, according to \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics, VAWA is working. Intimate partners \ncommitted fewer murders in 1996, 1997, and 1998 than in any other year \nsince 1976. Likewise, the number of female victims of intimate partner \nviolence declined from 1993 to 1998; in 1998, women experienced an \nestimated 876,340 violent offenses at the hands of a partner, down from \n1.1 million in 1993.\n  But despite these successes, clearly the incidence of violence \nagainst women and families remains too high. According to the National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), over 50 percent of all \nwomen will experience physical violence in an intimate relationship, \nand for 24-30 percent of those women the battering will be regular and \non-going. Additionally, the NCADV reports that between 50 and 70 \npercent of men who abuse their female partners also abuse their \nchildren.\n  Even though strides have been made, we still have a long way to go \nbefore domestic violence is evicted from our homes and communities. It \nis critically important that we not allow VAWA to expire, and that we \ntake this opportunity to reauthorize VAWA and build upon its success. \nThe Violence Against Women Protection Act of 2000 will authorize more \nthan $3 billion over five years for VAWA grant program and make \nimportant improvements to the original statute. For example, S. 2787 \nwill authorize a new temporary housing program to help move women out \nof shelters and into more stable living accommodations. S. 2787 will \nalso make it easier for battered immigrant women to leave their abusers \nwithout fear of deportation, and target additional funds to combatting \ndomestic violence on college campuses. Finally, the legislation will \nimprove procedures to allow states to enforce protection orders across \njurisdictional boundaries.\n  VAWA has made real strides against domestic violence, and the \nViolence Against Women Protection Act will continue the important work \nbegun in 1994. I am proud to report of the valuable programs all across \nMaryland combatting domestic violence thanks to VAWA, and I urge Senate \nleaders to bring S. 2787 to the floor for consideration as soon as \npossible. We have an invaluable opportunity to make a statement that \ndomestic violence will not be tolerated, and that all women and \nchildren should be able to live without fear in their own homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8571-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8571-S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS DUE TO THE McDADE LAW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came to the floor on May 25 to speak \nabout the pressing criminal justice problems arising out of the so-\ncalled McDade law, which was enacted at the end of the last Congress as \npart of the omnibus appropriations law. At that time, I described some \nexamples of how this law has impeded important criminal prosecutions, \nchilled the use of federally-authorized investigative techniques and \nposed multiple hurdles for federal prosecutors. In particular, I drew \nattention to the problems that this law has posed in cases related to \npublic safety--among them, the investigation of the maintenance and \nsafety practices of Alaska Airlines. The Legal Times and the Los \nAngeles Times recently reported on the situation regarding the Alaska \nAirlines investigation, and I ask unanimous consent to include these \nreports in the Record following my remarks.\n  Since I spoke in May, the McDade law has continued to stymie Federal \nlaw enforcement efforts in a number of States. I am especially troubled \nby\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\nwhat is happening in Oregon, where the interplay of the McDade law and \na recent attorney ethics decision by the Oregon Supreme Court is \nseverely hampering Federal efforts to combat child pornography and drug \ntrafficking.\n  I refer to the case of In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000). In Gatti, the \ncourt held that a private attorney had acted unethically by \nintentionally misrepresenting his identity to the employees of a \nmedical records review company called Comprehensive Medical Review \n(``CMR''). The attorney, who represented a client who had filed a claim \nwith an insurance company, believed that the insurance company was \nusing CMR to generate fraudulent medical reports that the insurer then \nused to deny or limit claims. The attorney called CMR and falsely \nrepresented himself to be a chiropractor seeking employment with the \ncompany. The attorney was hoping to obtain information from CMR that he \ncould use in a subsequent lawsuit against CMR and the insurance \ncompany.\n  The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the State Bar's view that the \nattorney's conduct violated two Oregon State Bar disciplinary rules and \nan Oregon statute--specifically, a disciplinary rule prohibiting \nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; a \ndisciplinary rule prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of law \nor fact; and a statute prohibiting willful deceit or misconduct in the \nlegal profession. In so doing, the court rejected the attorney's \ndefense that his misrepresentations were justifiable because he was \nengaged in an investigation to seek evidence of fraud and other \nwrongful conduct. The court expressly ruled that there was no \n``prosecutorial exception'' to either the State Bar disciplinary rules \nor the Oregon statute. As a result, it would appear that prosecutors in \nOregon may not concur or participate in undercover and other deceptive \nlaw enforcement techniques, even if the law enforcement technique at \nissue is lawful under Federal law.\n  Gatti has had a swift and devastating effect on FBI operations in \nOregon. Soon after the decision was announced, the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice informed the FBI Field Office that it would not concur or \nparticipate in the use of long-used and highly productive techniques, \nsuch as undercover operations and consensual monitoring of telephone \ncalls, that could be deemed deceptive by the State Bar. Several \nimportant investigations were immediately terminated or severely \nimpeded.\n  Because of the Gatti decision, Oregon's U.S. Attorney refused to \ncertify the six-month renewal of Portland's Innocent Images undercover \noperation, which targets child pornography and exploitation. Portland \nsought and obtained permission to establish an Innocent Images \noperation after the work of another task force over the past two years \nrevealed that child pornography and exploitation is a significant \nproblem in Oregon. With that finally accomplished, and with the \ninvestigative infrastructure in place, the U.S. Attorney refused to \nsend the necessary concurring letter to the FBI for Portland's six-\nmonth franchise renewal. Since the U.S. Attorney's concurrence is \nnecessary for renewal of the undercover operation, it now appears that \nPortland's Innocent Images operation will be shut down.\n  Gatti has also had an immediate and harmful impact on Oregon's war on \ndrugs. Last winter, there was a multi-agency wiretap investigation into \nthe activities of an Oregon-based drug organization. To date, the \ninvestigation has produced numerous federal and state indictments. \nRecently, the post-wiretap phase brought to the surface a cooperating \nwitness. During the initial briefing, the cooperating witness indicated \nhe had information about other drug organizations in Oregon and another \nState. In an effort to widen the investigation, the FBI sought the \nAUSA's concurrence in the cooperator's use of an electronic device to \nrecord conversations with other traffickers. Citing the Gatti decision, \nthe assigned AUSA refused to provide concurrence. Since AUSA \nconcurrence is required for such consensual monitoring, the FBI cannot \nmake use of this basic investigative technique. Thus, a critical phase \nof the investigation languishes because of the interplay of Gatti and \nthe McDade law.\n  These examples show how the McDade law is severely hampering federal \nlaw enforcement in Oregon. But as I made clear in my prior remarks, \nthis ill-conceived law is having dangerous effects on federal law \nenforcement nationwide. Let me update my colleagues on the Talao case, \nwhich I discussed at some length in May.\n  In Talao, a company and its principals were under investigation for \nfailing to pay the prevailing wage on federally funded contracts, \nfalsifying payroll records, and demanding illegal kickbacks. The \ncompany's bookkeeper, who had been subpoenaed to testify before the \ngrand jury, initiated a meeting with the AUSA in which she asserted \nthat her employers were pressing her to lie before the grand jury, and \nthat she did not want the company's lawyer to be present before or \nduring her grand jury testimony. The grand jury later indicted the \nemployers for conspiracy, false statements, and illegal kickbacks.\n  The district court held that the AUSA had acted unethically because \nthe company had a right to have its attorney present during any \ninterview of any employee, regardless of the employee's wishes, the \nstatus of the corporate managers, or the possibility that the attorney \nmay have a conflict of interest in representing the bookkeeper. The \ncourt declared that if the case went to trial, it would inform the jury \nof the AUSA's misconduct and instruct them to take it into account in \nassessing the bookkeeper's credibility.\n  When I last spoke about the Talao case, the Ninth Circuit was \nreviewing the district court's decision. The Ninth Circuit has now \nspoken, and although it found no ethical violation, it did so on the \nnarrow ground that the bookkeeper had initiated the meeting, and that \nthe AUSA had advised the bookkeeper of her right to contact substitute \ncounsel. Thus, the court sent a message that AUSAs and investigating \nagents may not approach employees in situations where there is a \npossible conflict of interest between the employee and the corporation \nfor whom the employee works, and corporate counsel is purporting to \nrepresent all employees and demanding to be present during interviews. \nLet me put that another way. If a corporate whistleblower in California \ntold an FBI agent that the agent should speak to a particular employee \nwho had important information, and the AUSA assigned to the case knew \nthat the corporation was represented by counsel in that matter, the \nAUSA arguably would have to nix the interview.\n  The need to modify the McDade law is real, and our time is running \nout. I introduced legislation last year that addressed the most serious \nproblems caused by the McDade law, and I worked with the Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee to refine and improve it. I described our \napproach when I spoke on this issue in May. Congress should take up and \npass corrective legislation before the end of the session.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have several articles printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Los Angeles Times, Tues., July 18, 2000]\n\n     Justice Dept. Faces Unexpected Roadblocks Due to Ethics Rules\n\n                         (By Robert L. Jackson)\n\n       Washington.--Consider it further proof of the law of \n     unintended consequences.\n       Aiming to prevent unethical conduct, Congress last year \n     passed a law requiring federal prosecutors to abide by the \n     ethics rules of the state bar where they are conducting \n     investigations.\n       Instead, the Justice Department says, the move has hampered \n     law enforcement in cases related to public safety--among them \n     the investigation of the maintenance and safety practices of \n     Alaska Airlines.\n       In documents submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee by \n     James Robinson, chief of Justice's criminal division, and \n     Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert Raben, the department has argued \n     that probes like this were ``stalled for many months'' by the \n     McDade law.\n       The law blocked FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers \n     from interviewing airline mechanics in a timely fashion for a \n     grand jury investigation of whether Alaska's maintenance \n     records were falsified in Northern California, the department \n     says. And it reportedly is causing problems for prosecutors \n     looking into complaints from corporate whistle-blowers \n     elsewhere.\n       While the law seems harmless on its face, California--like \n     many other states--has an ethics provision prohibiting \n     lawyers or government investigators from directly contacting \n     a person who is represented by counsel.\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\n       Federal officials say FBI agents who tried to interview \n     workers at the airline's Oakland maintenance facility were \n     blocked by company lawyers who claimed to represent all \n     airline personnel.\n       When mechanics then were served with grand jury subpoenas, \n     attorneys lined up by the airline were able to delay their \n     appearances by insisting on grants of immunity from \n     prosecution, which slowed the inquiry by months.\n       The federal investigation widened after the Jan. 31 crash \n     of an Alaska Airlines jet in the Pacific Ocean that killed \n     all 88 people on board. But FBI agents were similarly impeded \n     from questioning ground mechanics, according to the Justice \n     Department.\n       ``Those interviews that are most often successful--\n     simultaneous interviews of numerous employees--could not \n     be conducted simply because of fear that an ethical rule . \n     . . might result in proceedings against the prosecutor,'' \n     said Sen. Patrick J.

The department's \n     rule was clarified under Janet Reno in 1994.\n       In October 1998, Congress passed a law that made federal \n     prosecutors subject to state ethics codes. The law was named \n     for former Rep. Joseph McDade (R-Pa.), who was the subject of \n     an eight-year federal bribery investigation. McDade was \n     eventually acquitted.\n       The law went into effect last year, over strenuous Justice \n     Department objections. Since then, the department hasn't \n     given up the fight to overturn it. And its efforts have \n     support in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where bills \n     offered by the committee's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-\n     Utah), and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) would establish \n     separate ethical proscriptions for prosecutors.\n       The Hatch bill would repeal McDade. The Leahy bill would \n     specifically allow prosecutors to contact witnesses \n     regardless of whether they were represented by counsel. \n     Neither bill has made it out of the judiciary committee.\n       ``This law has resulted in significant delays in important \n     criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of federally \n     authorized investigative techniques and posed multiple \n     hurdles for federal prosecutors,'' Leahy said on the floor of \n     the Senate last month.\n       Both the American Bar Association and the National \n     Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers lobbied Congress \n     hard for the McDade law. Kevin Driscoll, a senior legislative \n     counsel for the ABA, said that his organization is reviewing \n     the Justice Department's complaints about the law's \n     implementation. But, he added, the ABA's support of McDade \n     has not changed.\n       William Moffitt, a D.C. criminal defense lawyer who is \n     president of the NACDL, says that the Justice Department is \n     ``looking for reasons to complain'' about McDade.\n       ``They don't have the unfettered ability to intimidate and \n     they don't like that,'' Moffitt said. ``People ought to be \n     able to go to the general counsel (of a corporation) if they \n     are subpoenaed and they ought to be able to be told to get a \n     lawyer.''\n       Few details of the grand jury's investigation of Alaska \n     Airlines have come to light. The airline says that it has \n     received three subpoenas for information related to 12 \n     specific aircraft. In a filing with the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission last month, the airline's parent company, \n     Alaska Air Group Inc., said one subpoena asked for the repair \n     records for the MD-83 craft that crashed in January.\n       Matt Jacobs, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in \n     San Francisco, declined comment on the status of the \n     investigation, as did the press office for Justice Department \n     in Washington.\n       The FAA conducted a separate probe of the Alaska Airline's \n     maintenance procedures and proposed a $44,000 fine, which the \n     airline is contesting. The agency recently threatened to shut \n     down the airline's repair facilities in Oakland and Seattle \n     if it did not provide a sound plan for improving its safety \n     protocols.\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8571-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8571-S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS DUE TO THE McDADE LAW\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came to the floor on May 25 to speak \nabout the pressing criminal justice problems arising out of the so-\ncalled McDade law, which was enacted at the end of the last Congress as \npart of the omnibus appropriations law. At that time, I described some \nexamples of how this law has impeded important criminal prosecutions, \nchilled the use of federally-authorized investigative techniques and \nposed multiple hurdles for federal prosecutors. In particular, I drew \nattention to the problems that this law has posed in cases related to \npublic safety--among them, the investigation of the maintenance and \nsafety practices of Alaska Airlines. The Legal Times and the Los \nAngeles Times recently reported on the situation regarding the Alaska \nAirlines investigation, and I ask unanimous consent to include these \nreports in the Record following my remarks.\n  Since I spoke in May, the McDade law has continued to stymie Federal \nlaw enforcement efforts in a number of States. I am especially troubled \nby\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\nwhat is happening in Oregon, where the interplay of the McDade law and \na recent attorney ethics decision by the Oregon Supreme Court is \nseverely hampering Federal efforts to combat child pornography and drug \ntrafficking.\n  I refer to the case of In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000). In Gatti, the \ncourt held that a private attorney had acted unethically by \nintentionally misrepresenting his identity to the employees of a \nmedical records review company called Comprehensive Medical Review \n(``CMR''). The attorney, who represented a client who had filed a claim \nwith an insurance company, believed that the insurance company was \nusing CMR to generate fraudulent medical reports that the insurer then \nused to deny or limit claims. The attorney called CMR and falsely \nrepresented himself to be a chiropractor seeking employment with the \ncompany. The attorney was hoping to obtain information from CMR that he \ncould use in a subsequent lawsuit against CMR and the insurance \ncompany.\n  The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the State Bar's view that the \nattorney's conduct violated two Oregon State Bar disciplinary rules and \nan Oregon statute--specifically, a disciplinary rule prohibiting \nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; a \ndisciplinary rule prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of law \nor fact; and a statute prohibiting willful deceit or misconduct in the \nlegal profession. In so doing, the court rejected the attorney's \ndefense that his misrepresentations were justifiable because he was \nengaged in an investigation to seek evidence of fraud and other \nwrongful conduct. The court expressly ruled that there was no \n``prosecutorial exception'' to either the State Bar disciplinary rules \nor the Oregon statute. As a result, it would appear that prosecutors in \nOregon may not concur or participate in undercover and other deceptive \nlaw enforcement techniques, even if the law enforcement technique at \nissue is lawful under Federal law.\n  Gatti has had a swift and devastating effect on FBI operations in \nOregon. Soon after the decision was announced, the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice informed the FBI Field Office that it would not concur or \nparticipate in the use of long-used and highly productive techniques, \nsuch as undercover operations and consensual monitoring of telephone \ncalls, that could be deemed deceptive by the State Bar. Several \nimportant investigations were immediately terminated or severely \nimpeded.\n  Because of the Gatti decision, Oregon's U.S. Attorney refused to \ncertify the six-month renewal of Portland's Innocent Images undercover \noperation, which targets child pornography and exploitation. Portland \nsought and obtained permission to establish an Innocent Images \noperation after the work of another task force over the past two years \nrevealed that child pornography and exploitation is a significant \nproblem in Oregon. With that finally accomplished, and with the \ninvestigative infrastructure in place, the U.S. Attorney refused to \nsend the necessary concurring letter to the FBI for Portland's six-\nmonth franchise renewal. Since the U.S. Attorney's concurrence is \nnecessary for renewal of the undercover operation, it now appears that \nPortland's Innocent Images operation will be shut down.\n  Gatti has also had an immediate and harmful impact on Oregon's war on \ndrugs. Last winter, there was a multi-agency wiretap investigation into \nthe activities of an Oregon-based drug organization. To date, the \ninvestigation has produced numerous federal and state indictments. \nRecently, the post-wiretap phase brought to the surface a cooperating \nwitness. During the initial briefing, the cooperating witness indicated \nhe had information about other drug organizations in Oregon and another \nState. In an effort to widen the investigation, the FBI sought the \nAUSA's concurrence in the cooperator's use of an electronic device to \nrecord conversations with other traffickers. Citing the Gatti decision, \nthe assigned AUSA refused to provide concurrence. Since AUSA \nconcurrence is required for such consensual monitoring, the FBI cannot \nmake use of this basic investigative technique. Thus, a critical phase \nof the investigation languishes because of the interplay of Gatti and \nthe McDade law.\n  These examples show how the McDade law is severely hampering federal \nlaw enforcement in Oregon. But as I made clear in my prior remarks, \nthis ill-conceived law is having dangerous effects on federal law \nenforcement nationwide. Let me update my colleagues on the Talao case, \nwhich I discussed at some length in May.\n  In Talao, a company and its principals were under investigation for \nfailing to pay the prevailing wage on federally funded contracts, \nfalsifying payroll records, and demanding illegal kickbacks. The \ncompany's bookkeeper, who had been subpoenaed to testify before the \ngrand jury, initiated a meeting with the AUSA in which she asserted \nthat her employers were pressing her to lie before the grand jury, and \nthat she did not want the company's lawyer to be present before or \nduring her grand jury testimony. The grand jury later indicted the \nemployers for conspiracy, false statements, and illegal kickbacks.\n  The district court held that the AUSA had acted unethically because \nthe company had a right to have its attorney present during any \ninterview of any employee, regardless of the employee's wishes, the \nstatus of the corporate managers, or the possibility that the attorney \nmay have a conflict of interest in representing the bookkeeper. The \ncourt declared that if the case went to trial, it would inform the jury \nof the AUSA's misconduct and instruct them to take it into account in \nassessing the bookkeeper's credibility.\n  When I last spoke about the Talao case, the Ninth Circuit was \nreviewing the district court's decision. The Ninth Circuit has now \nspoken, and although it found no ethical violation, it did so on the \nnarrow ground that the bookkeeper had initiated the meeting, and that \nthe AUSA had advised the bookkeeper of her right to contact substitute \ncounsel. Thus, the court sent a message that AUSAs and investigating \nagents may not approach employees in situations where there is a \npossible conflict of interest between the employee and the corporation \nfor whom the employee works, and corporate counsel is purporting to \nrepresent all employees and demanding to be present during interviews. \nLet me put that another way. If a corporate whistleblower in California \ntold an FBI agent that the agent should speak to a particular employee \nwho had important information, and the AUSA assigned to the case knew \nthat the corporation was represented by counsel in that matter, the \nAUSA arguably would have to nix the interview.\n  The need to modify the McDade law is real, and our time is running \nout. I introduced legislation last year that addressed the most serious \nproblems caused by the McDade law, and I worked with the Chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee to refine and improve it. I described our \napproach when I spoke on this issue in May. Congress should take up and \npass corrective legislation before the end of the session.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have several articles printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Los Angeles Times, Tues., July 18, 2000]\n\n     Justice Dept.

Jackson)\n\n       Washington.--Consider it further proof of the law of \n     unintended consequences.\n       Aiming to prevent unethical conduct, Congress last year \n     passed a law requiring federal prosecutors to abide by the \n     ethics rules of the state bar where they are conducting \n     investigations.\n       Instead, the Justice Department says, the move has hampered \n     law enforcement in cases related to public safety--among them \n     the investigation of the maintenance and safety practices of \n     Alaska Airlines.\n       In documents submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee by \n     James Robinson, chief of Justice's criminal division, and \n     Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert Raben, the department has argued \n     that probes like this were ``stalled for many months'' by the \n     McDade law.\n       The law blocked FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers \n     from interviewing airline mechanics in a timely fashion for a \n     grand jury investigation of whether Alaska's maintenance \n     records were falsified in Northern California, the department \n     says. And it reportedly is causing problems for prosecutors \n     looking into complaints from corporate whistle-blowers \n     elsewhere.\n       While the law seems harmless on its face, California--like \n     many other states--has an ethics provision prohibiting \n     lawyers or government investigators from directly contacting \n     a person who is represented by counsel.\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\n       Federal officials say FBI agents who tried to interview \n     workers at the airline's Oakland maintenance facility were \n     blocked by company lawyers who claimed to represent all \n     airline personnel.\n       When mechanics then were served with grand jury subpoenas, \n     attorneys lined up by the airline were able to delay their \n     appearances by insisting on grants of immunity from \n     prosecution, which slowed the inquiry by months.\n       The federal investigation widened after the Jan. 31 crash \n     of an Alaska Airlines jet in the Pacific Ocean that killed \n     all 88 people on board.

McDade was \n     eventually acquitted.\n       The law went into effect last year, over strenuous Justice \n     Department objections. Since then, the department hasn't \n     given up the fight to overturn it. And its efforts have \n     support in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where bills \n     offered by the committee's chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-\n     Utah), and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) would establish \n     separate ethical proscriptions for prosecutors.\n       The Hatch bill would repeal McDade. The Leahy bill would \n     specifically allow prosecutors to contact witnesses \n     regardless of whether they were represented by counsel. \n     Neither bill has made it out of the judiciary committee.\n       ``This law has resulted in significant delays in important \n     criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of federally \n     authorized investigative techniques and posed multiple \n     hurdles for federal prosecutors,'' Leahy said on the floor of \n     the Senate last month.\n       Both the American Bar Association and the National \n     Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers lobbied Congress \n     hard for the McDade law. Kevin Driscoll, a senior legislative \n     counsel for the ABA, said that his organization is reviewing \n     the Justice Department's complaints about the law's \n     implementation. But, he added, the ABA's support of McDade \n     has not changed.\n       William Moffitt, a D.C. criminal defense lawyer who is \n     president of the NACDL, says that the Justice Department is \n     ``looking for reasons to complain'' about McDade.\n       ``They don't have the unfettered ability to intimidate and \n     they don't like that,'' Moffitt said. ``People ought to be \n     able to go to the general counsel (of a corporation) if they \n     are subpoenaed and they ought to be able to be told to get a \n     lawyer.''\n       Few details of the grand jury's investigation of Alaska \n     Airlines have come to light. The airline says that it has \n     received three subpoenas for information related to 12 \n     specific aircraft. In a filing with the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission last month, the airline's parent company, \n     Alaska Air Group Inc., said one subpoena asked for the repair \n     records for the MD-83 craft that crashed in January.\n       Matt Jacobs, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in \n     San Francisco, declined comment on the status of the \n     investigation, as did the press office for Justice Department \n     in Washington.\n       The FAA conducted a separate probe of the Alaska Airline's \n     maintenance procedures and proposed a $44,000 fine, which the \n     airline is contesting. The agency recently threatened to shut \n     down the airline's repair facilities in Oakland and Seattle \n     if it did not provide a sound plan for improving its safety \n     protocols.\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8574-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Those \nwho have been prisoners of war have demonstrated steadfastly the \nbeliefs of duty, honor, and country. They never gave up on these \nbeliefs and the United States must never give up on them. We must take \ncare of those who have taken care of us and this includes making every \neffort to account for those patriots who are missing in action. Our \nNation must bring them home to their loved ones.\n  To those who paid the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives for \nour country, we must always be thankful.

Mr. President, a new study conducted by researchers \nat Hamilton College reveals that students across the country are \nstrongly in favor of sensible gun laws. According to the report, \napproximately ninety percent of high school students surveyed support \nproposals such as the registration of handguns and licensing of handgun \nowners, criminal background checks for prospective gun purchasers, and \nfive-day ``cooling off periods.'' In addition, eighty to ninety percent \nof the teens surveyed in the poll support laws that would require all \nguns to be sold with trigger locks, require all gun buyers to pass a \nsafety course, and hold adults criminally responsible for keeping a \nloaded firearm where it could be reasonably accessed by a child and \nthat child harms himself or others.\n  Here are some of the other findings from the report: ``High school \nstudents back handgun regulation at higher levels than respondents in \nrecent adult surveys; High school students believe that the \nConstitution protects the right of citizens to own guns. But they \nreject the idea that government regulation of the sale and use of \nhandguns violates this right; Almost half of high school students say \nit would be easy for a teenager to obtain a handgun in their \nneighborhood. A third report that they know of someone at their school \nwho has been threatened with a gun or shot at.''\n  The Hamilton College researchers were the first to nationally survey \nhigh school students about their feelings toward gun issues. I am not \nsurprised that the results show overwhelming support for the gun safety \nproposals that many of us in Congress have been trying to enact into \nlaw. Students are well-versed on the dangers of guns in their homes and \nschools. In this survey, more than twenty-five percent of students \nreported that they or someone close to them has been ``shot by a gun.''\n  Mr. President, with just a few weeks remaining until the Senate's \ntarget adjournment date, it's long past time to act. Let's listen to \nour young people and enact the sensible gun laws they want and need to \nkeep American schools safer from gun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8574-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8574-S8575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. MILO FRITZ\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Alaska lost one of its true \npioneers when Dr. Milo Fritz died at his home in Anchor Point at the \nage of 91.\n  One of America's pre-eminent eye, ear, nose, and throat surgeons, \nMilo treated patients throughout Alaska. Dr. Fritz came to Alaska 60 \nyears ago. With his wife Betsy, a nurse by his side, he began a \npractice that took him into almost every remote community of our \nState--to areas where there were no doctors, no clinics, no health care \nfacilities of any kind.\n  The area he served covered almost a quarter of our State's 586,000 \nsquare miles, from Anchorage northeast to the Canadian border near Fort \nYukon, west to Bettles and Huslia, south to Anvik and Shageluk, and \neast again over the Chugach Mountains to Anchorage.\n  Dozens of villages in that vast expanse would never have seen a \ndoctor if Milo Fritz had not traveled by dog sled or small boat, or \npiloted his own single-engine airplane, because in that region there \nwere no health-care facilities.\n  A command surgeon for the 11th Air force in World War II, Milo spent \nmuch of his service time in Alaska. After the war, and a brief sojourn \nin New York, he and Betsy returned to Alaska at the request of our \nthen-territory's commissioner of health to investigate problems of \nblindness and deafness among children in Alaska Native communities.\n  Sterilizing his surgical instruments in boiling water heated on a \nportable stove he carried with him, Dr. Fritz performed tonsillectomies \nand sometimes, in the absence of a dentist, even had to extract \ninfected teeth.\n  He specialized in treating otitis-media, a terrible and common \ndisease among Alaskan rural children.\n  He wrote this brief account of one of his typical visits, this one in \nthe village of Allakaket, which rests on the Arctic Circle in the \nfoothills of the Brooks Range:\n\n       In Allakaket, we operated in a log community hall and slept \n     in the schoolteacher's quarters. In this village we did 22 T \n     and A's (combined removal of tonsils and adenoids), five \n     tonsillectomies, extracted a few teeth, and prescribed two \n     pairs of glasses.\n       We took one night off and in my airplane went into the \n     wilderness into a heavenly spot called Selby Lake, where we \n     fished for grayling and lake trout amid majestic surroundings \n     that were as simple and beautiful and unspoiled as they must \n     have been on the seventh day (a reference to the biblical \n     account of creation).\n\n  After our territory of Alaska became the 49th State, Dr. Fritz took \nadvantage of an opportunity to bring the health problems he encountered \nto the attention of State government, and ran successfully for the \nAlaska State legislature. in the 1960s and early in the 1970s he \nrepresented Anchorage in our State house. In 1982 he represented the \nKenai Peninsula. I had the privilege to serve with him from 1966 to \n1968.\n  Just as he was a perfectionist in the practice of medicine, Dr. Fritz \nwas a\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\nstickler for fair and thorough legislative practices. I remember Milo \ncame to the Alaska House of Representatives at 5:30 a.m.--so he could \nread and analyze each bill before the regular session started. Milo had \na commitment to the processes of democracy that few people share or \nunderstand.\n  At the time of his death, a family member said:\n\n       He was a skilled practitioner of the healing arts; a patron \n     of the arts; humanitarian; solon; diligent inquirer into the \n     mysteries of jurisprudence and its philosophy; a student of \n     the legislative process; stern foe or hypocrisy and deceit; \n     physician in the true tradition of Hippocrates and Saint \n     Luke; and friend. Milo would want people to know that he \n     tried.\n\n  Mr. President, Milo Fritz's contributions to Alaska and Alaskans over \nalmost three generations are far more than those of a man who just \n``tried.'' He left a legacy of caring and hard work and love of people \nand of his profession that will be hard to match.\n  He gave his all, over and over again, whether in a distant village or \nin his office in Anchorage, and Juneau and Anchor Point. I was not only \nfortunate to serve with him in our legislature, I was also one of his \npatients. so I know first had of the excellence with which he \naccomplished whatever task was before him.\n  Flags in Alaska flew at half staff last week to honor the memory of \nDr. Milo Fritz, a great Alaska physician, legislator, and pioneer. A \ngreat man.\n  To Betsy, his wife of 63 years, and his son Jonathan, we extend our \ndeepest sympathy. I, too, Mr. President, have lost a friend.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the articles about Dr. Fritz's life and \ndeath which appeared in the Kenai Peninsula Clarion, and the Anchorage \nDaily News on September 8th and 9th respectively, and editor Bill \nTobin's tribute in the ``voice of the times'' column on September 10th, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Sept. 8, 2000]\n\n                         Doctor, 91, a Pioneer\n\n\n             fritz worked with deaf, blind in alaska's bush\n\n                            (By Jon Little)\n\n       SOLDOTNA.--Milo Fritz, a former state legislator and \n     pioneering physician who dedicated much of his life to \n     healing deaf and blind children in the Alaska Bush, died Aug. \n     31 at his home in Anchor Point.

Ted \n     Stevens, friends and family say. He briefly set up practices \n     on Park Avenue in New York, said Elizabeth Fritz, has wife of \n     63 years.\n       But Fritz's career path took a more meaning route, \n     following his heart to villages across Alaska.\n       ``So many of the Native children were going blind and deaf \n     for lack of medical care,'' she said.\n       Gov. Tony Knowles ordered state flags lowered through the \n     end of the workday today in Fritz's memory. The governor's \n     office recounted Fritz's career in detail:\n       He was born in Pittsfield, Mass., on Aug. 5, 1909, and came \n     to Alaska in 1940 to set up a practice in Ketchikan. He was \n     soon drawn away by World War II, serving in the Army Air \n     Corps beginning in 1941.\n       When asked where he wanted to serve, Fritz replied Alaska \n     and was sent back to the state where he'd already set up a \n     practice. He went across the state, helping soldiers. He rose \n     to the rank of command surgeon for the 11th Air force.\n       According to the governor's office, Fritz won commendations \n     for rescuing a pilot from a plane crash on Mount Redoubt and \n     another pilot from a burning plane at Elmendorf Air Base.\n       After the war; Fritz went to New York, but in 1947 he was \n     called back by the then Alaska commissioner of health to \n     investigate blindness among Alaska Native children.\n       Fritz was elected to the Legislature in 1966 and again in \n     1972 to represent Anchorage in the state House. After moving \n     to Anchor Point, he was elected to a third term in 1982.\n       Janet Helen Gamble, has long-time receptionist, described \n     Fritz as a missionary. ``Sometimes he got paid, sometimes he \n     didn't, because he really was not interested in money. He was \n     interested in people's health, how he could make people see \n     better.''\n       Fritz and his wife retired to the house they bought in \n     1949, where the scenery hasn't changed much over the decades. \n     ``We see nothing man-made from our windows in the summer \n     unless a ship goes by,'' Elizabeth Fritz said. ``It was the \n     perfect place to end our lives and do things we'd put aside \n     all these years.''\n       He is remembered by his family as, ``a skilled practitioner \n     of the healing arts'' as well as a humanitarian and a \n     ``diligent inquirer into the mysteries of jurisprudence and \n     its philosophy'' and a ``stern foe of hypocrisy and deceit.''\n       In addition to his wife of 63 years, Fritz is survived by \n     his son Jonathan, also of Anchor Point.

Physicians served, and went back to practices. \n     Druggists served, and went back to their stores. Real estate \n     agents served and went back to the job of selling houses.

JOHN DiBIAGGIO, PRESIDENT OF TUFTS UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \nto pay tribute to someone who has been a good friend to those of us in \nMassachusetts who are committed to quality higher education, Dr. John \nDiBiaggio, for his service, his vision, and the academic leadership the \nhe has shown--not just in Massachusetts, but nationwide. Dr. DiBiaggio \nhas been the president of Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts, \nsince 1993. Yesterday he announced that he will be retiring in June \n2002 and I know that he will be sorely missed.\n  I think anyone who has spent time at Tufts in the last several years \nhas seen Dr. DiBiaggio, or his wife, Nancy, walking their dogs on \ncampus. When the DiBiaggio's moved to Medford in 1993, they moved into \nGifford House, an on-campus residence. I think that that decision to \nlive on campus, just like an incoming freshman, to have an sincere \nopen-door policy, and to create a real sense of community, is an \nenormous testimony to his dedication to service.\n  Dr. DiBiaggio's tenure at Tufts has been an extremely successful one. \nSince Dr. DiBiaggio arrived at Tufts, the university has shored up its \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\ncondition by tripling the size of its endowment. The University has \nbuilt six new buildings at its Grafton campus and a new fieldhouse. The \nschool's student-faculty ratio has dropped to 8:1, one of the best of \nany major college or university. Since Dr. DiBiaggio became president, \nthe University has established study abroad programs in Chile, Moscow, \nJapan and Ghana.\n  Most recently, he announced the creation of a new school of public \nservice. In my judgment, The University College of Citizenship and \nPublic Service will be one of Dr. DiBiaggio's most enduring legacies at \nTufts. Despite the large increase in volunteer rates among Tufts \nstudents, Massachusetts residents and citizens nationwide, voter apathy \nand cynicism are at all-time highs. This new school will be a ``virtual \ncollege,'' which aims to incorporate the goals of public service into \nthe school's curriculum. In April, the College of Citizenship and \nPublic Service received a $10 million donation from Pierre and Pam \nOmidyar, the founders of the person-to-person online trading website, \neBay. This gift allowed the College of Citizenship and Public Service \nto grant twenty-one scholarships to undergraduates to participate in \nprograms geared to develop values and skills of active citizenship and \ncovers the financial aid needs of students who are eligible for \nscholarship assistance.\n  Tufts is no longer one of Massachusetts' best kept secrets. Under Dr. \nDiBiaggio's guidance, Tufts' undergraduate, medical, dental, nutrition, \ninternational relations, and veterinary schools have grown in stature \nand are consistently ranked among the nation's elite. The number of \napplicants increased by more than 70 percent in just the past five \nyears. The test scores, grades and class rank of the incoming freshmen \ncontinues to break school records. The University is now standard on \nU.S. News and World Report's annual list of top colleges and \nuniversities, rubbing elbows with Harvard, MIT and Boston College.\n  I again commend Dr. DiBiaggio on a successful term as President of \nTufts University.

WESTON\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJoshua S. Weston, a longtime friend, and one of New Jersey's most \nactively involved citizens, on the occasion of his receiving the \n``Distinguished Achievement Award'' by B'nai B'rith International.\n  Mr. President, over the years Josh and I have worked together on many \nendeavors. In 1949, Josh joined me and a childhood friend to form \nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP), a small payroll services company. \nThanks to the tireless efforts of many and Josh's leadership as \nChairman, ADP is now the leading provider of payroll services \nworldwide.\n  When I first heard that Josh was being honored, I was not surprised. \nJosh has always been an active participant of worthy causes. Josh and \nhis wife, Judy, formed the Weston Science Scholars Program, an \ninnovative science program that affords selected ninth- and tenth-grade \nstudents from Montclair High School the opportunity to work with Ph.D. \nscientists at Montclair State University.\n  While Josh knows the educational value of a good math and science \nprogram, he also recognizes the need for American Jewish students to \nform a bond with Israel. For more than five years, Josh has \nunderwritten the costs of a United Jewish Federation program in which a \ncollege student attends a semester abroad in Israel.\n  In addition to Josh's philanthropic contributions, he sits on many \ncommittees. Josh is the president of the Josh and Judy Weston Family \nFoundation of Montclair. He serves on the governing boards of the \nInternational Rescue Committee, the New Jersey Symphony, the New Jersey \nBusiness Partnership, the Liberty Science Center, Mountainside \nHospital, Boys Town of Jerusalem and Yeshiva University Business \nSchool, among others. He is the recipient of many awards, including an \nhonorary degree from Montclair State University.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to honor my good friend Joshua Weston on \nthis acclaimed occasion. We are indebted to him for his service. He has \ndemonstrated to his family, his friends, and his community that this \nhonor is well-deserved. I salute him on yet another great \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8576-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WYANDOTTE BOAT CLUB\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n125th Anniversary of the Wyandotte, Michigan, Boat Club, which will be \ncelebrated on September 23, 2000. Established in 1875, the club is \nrevered in the annals of rowing, and for 125 years it has been a staple \nof the Wyandotte community, encouraging the citizens of Southeastern \nWayne County to flourish physically, mentally and morally.\n  The Wyandotte Boat Club is located on the Detroit River, \napproximately 15 miles ``downriver'' of Detroit. It was formed in 1875 \nwhen a group of Wyandotte men, led by Mr. John McKnight, officially \norganized and together purchased a ten-oar barge. The first home of the \nclub was at the foot of Pine Street in a shed behind the summer home of \na resident of Wyandotte. And though the club has come a very long way \nsince this time, in a literal manner it has not moved an inch, for on \nJanuary 14, 1997, the club moved back to the foot of Pine Street, into \na state of the art, multi-million dollar facility.\n  The boat club has come to play a very large role in the lives of \nWyandotte citizens. Its more than 700 members assist in the coaching, \nmaintenance and administration of the club's activities and regattas. \nThey teach rowing programs to individuals of all ages. Furthermore, in \nthe mid 1940's, the club began to sponsor a program offering rowing to \narea high school students. In its 50 plus years, the program has now \nexpanded to include elementary and middle school students as well as \nhigh school students. The school programs are open to all students and \nthere is no charge to the student or the school for participation. Many \nof the high school oarsmen who have participated in the program have \nbecome known both nationally and internationally as top competitors in \nthe rowing arena.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the members of the Wyandotte Boat Club for \nthe many beneficial things they do for the citizens of Wyandotte on a \ndaily basis. In particular, to sponsor rowing for children of all ages, \nwhich not only provides these children with a lifelong hobby, but also \nhelps to teach them some of life's most basic and important lessons. On \nbehalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Wyandotte \nBoat Club on 125 successful years, and wish the group continued success \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8576-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8576-S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ANTIQUE AND CLASSIC BOATING SOCIETY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th \nAnniversary of The Antique and Classic Boat Society (ACBS), which will \nbe celebrated from September 21-24, 2000, at the Grand Hotel on \nMackinac Island, Michigan. For 25 years, the ACBS has united \nindividuals with an interest in historic, antique and classic boats, \nallowing them to share fellowship, information, and experiences.\n  The ACBS is an international organization headquartered on the St. \nLawrence River in the Thousand Islands region of Clayton, New York. It \ncurrently has 44 chapters worldwide, and a membership of over 6,500 \nindividuals. The organization was founded not only to unite individuals \nwith an interest in antique and classic boats, but also to protect and \npromote the heritage of boating. It does this through the preservation \nand restoration of historic boats, as well as by encouraging members to \nshare their love and enjoyment of all aspects of historic, antique and \nclassic boating with both other members and the general public.\n  I think it is important to note here the large role that the State of \nMichigan has played in the growth and development of the recreational \nboating industry. Beginning as early as the\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\n1920's, and continuing through the 1970's, the four most recognized \nAmerican boat builders were headquartered in Michigan: Chris Craft in \nAlgonac; Gar Wood in Marysville; Hacker Craft in Mount Clemens; and \nCentury in Manistee. Thus, I think that it is only right that the 25th \nAnniversary of the Antique and Classic Boat Society be celebrated in \nthe Water Wonderland State of Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the ACBS for having grown into the world's \nlargest organization dedicated to the preservation and enjoyment of \nhistoric, antique and classic boats, a fact which pays tribute to the \nmany people who have devoted themselves not only to promoting the \nheritage of boating, but also to promoting the ACBS and the many \nwonderful things it does to preserve this heritage. On behalf of the \nentire United States Senate, I congratulate the Antique and Classic \nBoat Society on its 25th Anniversary, and wish the organization \ncontinued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8577-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO MRS.

Mr. President, on August 25, 2000, Mrs. Patricia \nJankowski of Garden City, Michigan, took office as National President \nof the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars at the \norganization's 87th National Convention. On September 23, 2000, there \nwill be a Homecoming celebration in her honor at the Marriott Hotel in \nthe Detroit Renaissance Center, and I rise today to offer my \ncongratulations to Mrs. Jankowski as she returns to Michigan.\n  Mrs. Jankowski is a Life Member of Northville Auxiliary #4012. Since \nbecoming a member of the Ladies Auxiliary to the VFW, she has been \nactively involved on all levels of the organization. She has served \nserved as Auxiliary President, District #4 President, and in 1990-91 \nwas selected the Outstanding President of the Year in her membership \ngroup when she served as State President.\n  On the national level, Mrs. Jankowski has served as National Flag \nBearer, National Cancer Aid and Research Director, and National \nDirector for the VFW National Home program. As a member of Blazzette \nColor Guard for five years, she holds two Bronze and one Silver Medal \nfor competition at National VFW Convention. In 1989, she earned \nNational Aide-de-Camp status for recruiting members. And just last \nyear, as National Senior Vice-President, she represented the Auxiliary \non a tour of Europe.\n  Mrs. Jankowski's election to this national office is the highlight of \na career dedicated to public service. During her term in office, she \nwill encourage fellow members to raise $3 million for the Auxiliary \nCancer Aid and Research Fund for the 13th consecutive year, with her \nultimate goal being to top all previous program records.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Mrs. Jankowski for the wonderful work that \nshe has done for the Ladies Auxiliary to the VFW. Her supreme \ndedication to that cause and her unending desire to help our Nation's \nveterans is both admirable and inspirational. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I congratulate Mrs. Jankowski on taking office as \nNational President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign \nWars of the United States, and wish her great success as she leads this \noutstanding organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8577-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPUTY CHIEF CHARLES L.

Bidwell of the Brighton, Michigan, Area Fire \nDepartment, who will be honored for 50 years of fire service to the \nCity of Brighton at a dinner on September 19, 2000.\n  Deputy Chief Bidwell has been an active or on-call firefighter since \nSeptember 14, 1950. He spent his entire career with the City of \nBrighton Fire Department until July 1, 1998, when the City of Brighton \nFire Department and the Brighton Township Fire Department merged to \nform the Brighton Area Fire Department.\n  Deputy Chief Bidwell is retired from the General Motors Proving \nGrounds in Milford, Michigan. He has held the position of Deputy Chief \nsince 1988, and remains one of the most active members of the Brighton \nArea Fire Department. For the past decade, he has led the department in \nalarm response.\n  From June 27, 1994 until January 15, 1995, Mr. Bidwell acted as \ninterim Chief of the City of Brighton Fire Department. He was named the \nCity of Brighton's Firefighter of the Year in 1987, and, at the annual \nconference of the Michigan State Firemen's Association in Ludington \nearlier this year, he was selected as Michigan's Firefighter of the \nYear in honor of this remarkable achievement.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Deputy Chief Bidwell on his extensive \nfirefighting career and his dedication to the City of Brighton. He is \none of the State of Michigan's true role models, and I am glad that the \nCity of Brighton and the Brighton Area Fire Department have taken this \nopportunity to recognize his many contributions.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 30th \nbirthday of Harbor Tower Apartments in Escanaba, Michigan, which was \nofficially celebrated on July 13, 2000. For thirty years, the presence \nof Harbor Tower Apartments has enabled the Escanaba Housing Commission, \nin coalition with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to \nprovide low-income housing to members of the Escanaba community.\n  Harbor Tower, an 18 floor, 175 apartment building, was built in 1970. \nThe official dedication of the building took place on July 13th of that \nsame year, and was attended by Miss America Pamela Anne Eldred. The \nHarbor Tower Apartments are managed by the Escanaba Housing Commission, \na group comprised of five full-time employees and a five member Board \nof Commissioners appointed by the City Council of Escanaba.\n  To qualify to live in Harbor Tower Apartments, individuals must meet \nthe income guidelines set out by HUD. If they qualify under these \nguidelines, their rent is determined by their income, with HUD \nproviding subsidy funds. Harbor Tower Apartments is considered a high \nperformer by HUD's PHMAP scoring system. The PHMAP is a grade given to \nthe management and staff on their performance and upkeep of the \nbuilding.\n  Perhaps the most important element of Harbor Tower Apartments, at \nleast to the Escanaba Housing Commission, is to make residents feel as \nif they are a part of a community. They can participate in a variety of \nactivities, including a weekly Rosary, monthly church services, a \nmonthly club meeting, a summer picnic, and other special dinners. In \naddition, membership in the Harbor Tower Club is available to any \nresident for only $6 per year. The club's activities include a monthly \ncatered dinner and dance, an annual Christmas Bazaar, and special \nholiday parties.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate all of the people whose hard work over \nthe years has made this 30th birthday possible. It is because of their \ndedication that quality housing remains an option to Escanaba citizens \nof all income levels. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I \nwish the Harbor Tower Apartments continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8577-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8577-S8578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8577-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8577-S8578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8578-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8578-S8584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  REPORT OF THE INTERAGENCY ARCTIC RESEARCH POLICY COMMITTEE--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 127\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 108(b) of Public Law 98-373 (15 U.S.C. \n4107(b)), I transmit herewith the Eighth Biennial Report of the \nInteragency Arctic Research Policy Committee (February 1, 1998, to \nJanuary 31, 2000).\n                                                  William J.

In response to this \n     requirement, the IARPC has examined all recommendations of \n     the Arctic Research Commission since January 1998. The \n     previous IARPC report, submitted in January 1998, responded \n     to Commission recommendations through 1997. Many of these \n     recommendations deal with priorities in basic and applied \n     Arctic research that ongoing agency programs continue to \n     address.\n       The following recommendations are from the Arctic Research \n     Commission report ``Goals and Opportunities for United States \n     Arctic Research'' (1999).\n\n\n                      recommendations for agencies\n\n       At the request of the IARPC agencies we are including \n     specific recommendations for these agencies and interagency \n     groups in order to make clear to them our view of the \n     opportunities.\n     National Science Foundation\n       The National Science Foundation Arctic Science Section in \n     the Office of Polar Programs has made great strides in recent \n     years in their interest in and efforts on behalf of research \n     in the Arctic. We are pleased with several developments in \n     recent years, including the partnership with the Commission \n     in support of the ARCUS Logistics Study, the participation of \n     the Section's staff on the Commission's field trips to \n     Greenland and Arctic Canada, and the Foundation's support for \n     the swath bathymetric mapping system deployed in 1998 as part \n     of the SCICEX Program. Nevertheless, there still remains a \n     substantial disparity between support for research in the \n     Antarctic and in the Arctic. A new era is about to dawn in \n     Arctic research because of the arrival in 2000 of the new \n     Coast Guard icebreaker Healy. Healy has the potential to \n     become the most important ship for Arctic research ever \n     launched. On the other hand, it may languish at the dock \n     making only occasional forays into the Arctic. The National \n     Science Foundation has committed to Healy by ending its \n     support for the ARV design activity conducted by the \n     University National Oceanographic Laboratory System. Healy \n     will be the principal U.S. resource for surface studies of \n     the Arctic Ocean. Having committed philosophically to Healy \n     it is essential that NSF find the resources to operate Healy \n     as a research vessel with a minimum operating schedule of \n     approximately 200 days per year. Without sufficient operating \n     support, the NSF commitment to Healy will be a hollow one. \n     The FY 99 budget for the Foundation contains a substantial \n     increase in funding for Arctic Logistics needs.\n       NSF appreciates the Commission's comments on the great \n     strides in recent years by the Arctic Science Section, Office \n     of Polar Programs, on behalf of research in the Arctic. NSF's \n     commitment to supporting Arctic research in all areas remains \n     strong, but NSF is to the sole Federal sponsor for Arctic \n     studies. As the Commission is aware, both NSF and the Office \n     of Polar Programs must continually find the appropriate \n     balance of support for a wide variety of disciplines and \n     activities. In the specific case of supporting research that \n     requires the use of the Healy, NSF's FY 00 budget request \n     included funding for initial testing for scientific \n     applications of the Healy. In FY 00 the Foundation also hopes \n     to support limited research on the Healy during the science \n     system testing cruises.\n       Long-term planning (FY 01 and beyond) includes continued \n     support for research on the Healy. Support for up to 100 \n     operating days is planned, although it is unclear whether the \n     amount required to fully fund 200 operating days, including \n     science costs, would be available for this purpose from NSF. \n     NSF will work with other user agencies to develop mechanisms \n     for science support for the Healy.\n     Department of Defense\n       A number of activities fall under the Department of \n     Defense. Chief among these is the SCICEX Program of the \n     Department of the Navy. The 109th Airlift Wing of the New \n     York Air National Guard provides LC-130 support for both \n     Arctic and Antarctic research operations. In addition, DOD is \n     conducting a program entitled Arctic Military\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\n     Environmental Cooperation (AMEC) jointly with the Norwegian \n     and Russian ministries of defense. The Commission encourages \n     the Department of Defense to continue to provide support for \n     Arctic research and environmental studies and to communicate \n     with the Commission on any new programs.\n       The level of interest in Arctic research continues to wane \n     at the Office of Naval Research. The fact that the Arctic \n     Ocean is no longer considered an area of strategic threat is \n     due to the decrease in tensions with Russia. The result has \n     been a precipitous decline in funding for Arctic studies at \n     the Office of Naval Research. The Commission believes that \n     the decrease in Arctic operations is a reason for maintaining \n     research levels in the Arctic in order to maintain the \n     national capability in the region. Research is generally much \n     less expensive than operations and the knowledge base created \n     and maintained by research in the region may be of vital \n     national interest in the future, particularly as access to \n     the Arctic Ocean improves, a fact made likely through the \n     observed thinning of Arctic sea ice. Reduced military \n     activities in the region do not justify reduced research \n     efforts and may be an excellent justification for maintaining \n     and even increasing research.\n       With this mind, the Commission commends the efforts of the \n     Navy in carrying out the SCICEX cruises. The Commission notes \n     the substantial effort made by the Navy to support this \n     program in the face of shrinking resources and facilities. \n     These expeditions into the Arctic Ocean aboard operational \n     fast attack nuclear submarines show an extraordinary interest \n     in the support of science by the Navy. The question of the \n     continuation of these cruises after 1999 and the retirement \n     of the last of the Sturgeon Class submarines is of great \n     concern to the Commission, and the Commission recommends that \n     the Navy explore with the scientific community the means to \n     continue this invaluable access to the Arctic Ocean.\n       The SCICEX Program began in 1998 to collect swath \n     bathymetric data in the Arctic for the first time from a \n     submarine. This instrument, known as the Seafloor \n     Characterization And Mapping Pods (SCANP), has been made \n     possible by the enthusiastic support of the National Science \n     Foundation's Office of Polar Programs. These data collected \n     by SCAMP will be of great value for students of the region \n     from many disciplines. The region surveyed in 1998 and 1999 \n     will comprise only a moderate fraction of the area of the \n     deep water portion of the Arctic Ocean. The means to continue \n     gathering swath bathymetry with the SCAMP system should be \n     developed for the future, preferably using Navy nuclear \n     submarines. This recent development in submarines capability \n     is a reinforcing reason to continue the SCICEX Program. A \n     corollary issue is the declassification of achieved \n     bathymetry data collected on previous operations. These data \n     are a valuable resource for the research community. A \n     continuing program should be established to bring these data \n     out from the classified realm respecting the security \n     concerns, which may surround the collection of these data. \n     The construction of the new U.S.-Russian Arctic Ocean Atlas \n     CD shows that these difficulties may be overcome.\n       As a further indication of the utility of Navy nuclear \n     submarines for research in the Arctic Ocean, the Commission \n     also notes the cooperation of the Navy in attempting to carry \n     out a test of the submarine as a receiving ship for seismic \n     refraction measurements. This test, when completed, will \n     indicate the suitability of the submarine for such \n     experiments, and the Commission encourages further \n     investigation of this concept. The Commission also notes the \n     cooperation of the Navy in the declassification of \n     bathymetric and ice profile data collected by Navy nuclear \n     submarines in the Arctic. The value of these data is \n     indicated by the importance attached to the bathymetric data \n     by the international community in connection with the update \n     of the GEBCO chart of Arctic Ocean bathymetry. Navy data will \n     at least double the data base available for this update.\n       Finally, the Commission recommends that the Navy cooperate \n     fully in a study of the costs and benefits of retaining a \n     Sturgeon Class submarine as an auxiliary research platform \n     for worldwide use by the civilian science community as \n     discussed above.\n       The Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory \n     (CRREL) in Hanover is a national treasure. In the current \n     climate of budget stringency the pressure on Army labs is \n     growing. The Commission wishes to be on record in support \n     of the vital national resource that exists at CRREL. \n     Serious reductions at CRREL might be helpful in the short \n     term but a detriment to the national welfare over the long \n     term. The Commission encourages continued support for \n     CRREL.\n       The Commission has recently discussed with CRREL the \n     importance of understanding the effects of global climate \n     change on the permafrost regime. The Commission looks forward \n     to CRREL's plans for further study of climate change and \n     permafrost, supports the concept and encourages support for \n     these studies by all of the IARPC agencies.\n       The Department of Defense invests in R priorities \n     consistent with mission requirements and resources. First and \n     foremost, the Science and Technology investments within DoD \n     are undertaken to ensure that warfighters today and tomorrow \n     have superior and affordable technology to support their \n     missions and to give them revolutionary war-winning \n     capabilities. Thus, the DoD S investment is directly linked \n     to the assessment of current and future security threats. \n     While the interest of the Department of Defense and the \n     Office of Naval Research in Arctic research and environmental \n     studies remains strong, the prioritization of S funding is \n     subject to the fiscal realities and must consider present \n     strategic and operational requirements. The Department \n     remains committed to funding Arctic research at a level \n     commensurate with the mission requirements. Contrary to the \n     Commission's assertion, the decrease in military operations \n     in the Arctic is not a rationale for maintaining or expanding \n     departmental S efforts in the region.\n       From an S perspective, the Department of Defense supports \n     the Navy's ongoing examination of the feasibility of \n     continued Arctic research using Navy submarines. Such \n     analysis is taking into account DoD's national security \n     mission, the national security requirements for submarine \n     operations, downsizing of the operational fleet, and the \n     life-cycle costs of implementation of an extension of the \n     SCICEX research program. Further, the Navy is cooperating \n     with NSF and its contractors in an ongoing study of the costs \n     and benefits of retaining a Sturgeon Class submarine as an \n     auxiliary research platform for civilian science applications \n     operated on a reimbursable basis.\n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n       NOAA has been the leading U.S. agency for AMAP. In this \n     role, NOAA has supplied both staff efforts and funding to the \n     AMAP. These efforts have been largely conducted on a goodwill \n     basis without organized programs or a satisfactory funding \n     base. NOAA deserves great credit for these efforts and the \n     Commission commends and supports their efforts. NOAA has \n     conducted an Arctic Initiative beginning in 1996 at a funding \n     level of approximately one million dollars. The Commission \n     supports this initiative and recommends that it continue in \n     the coming fiscal year and eventually becomes an ongoing part \n     of the NOAA program.\n       NOAA appreciates the recognition by the Commission of its \n     role as U.S. lead agency for the Arctic Monitoring and \n     Assessment Program (AMAP). It is NOAA's intention to continue \n     its participation in AMAP, to coordinate interagency AMAP \n     projects in a partnership effort, to increase outreach to \n     impacted Alaskan communities, and to promote greater \n     involvement in AMAP activities by Alaskan people and \n     organizations at both local and statewide levels.\n       NOAA also appreciates the Commission's support of the \n     Arctic Research Initiative (ARI), a peer-reviewed research \n     effort that we have administered jointly with the Cooperative \n     Institute for Arctic Research at the University of Alaska \n     Fairbanks. After a start at the $1.0 million level in FY 97, \n     the ARI received $1.5 million in FY 98 and $1.65 million in \n     FY 99. NOAA intends to continue this program, and the \n     President included support for the ARI as part of NOAA's base \n     budget request for FY 00. NOAA completed a report on the \n     first three years of the ARI and provided copies of the \n     report to the Commission.\n       As the Commission is doubtless aware, in FY 00 NOAA is \n     combining ARI funds with International Arctic Science Center \n     funds in a joint announcement of opportunity. This \n     announcement was released to the Arctic science community on \n     August 18, 1999. It invites proposals on global change and \n     its effects on the Arctic, including detection; interactions \n     and feedback; paleoclimates, Arctic haze, ozone and UV; \n     contaminants; and impacts and consequences of change. The \n     announcement is available on the IARC web page at http://\nwww.iarc.uaf.edu and on the CIFAR web page at http://\nwww.cifar.uaf.edu.\n       In order to focus our Arctic research efforts more sharply, \n     we have established an Arctic Research Office within \n     NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.\n       The National Undersea Research Program (NURP) has had a \n     long and perilous history. Only occasionally has it appeared \n     in the President's budget. The Commission believes that NOAA-\n     NURP can be a valuable asset to the research community. In \n     particular, the Commission takes note of the report of the \n     ``Blue Ribbon Panel,'' which spelled out a new paradigm for \n     NURP. The Commission's interests in NURP's activities in the \n     Arctic include the use of unmanned and autonomous underwater \n     vehicles in the Arctic as well as the employment of the \n     Navy's nuclear submarine assets under the SCICEX Program \n     noted above. The Commission believes that the time has come \n     for an organic act for NURP that will establish it as an \n     ongoing activity with a structure based largely on the \n     recommendations of the ``Blue Ribbon Panel.'' As part of \n     their mission NURP should undertake to fulfill the commitment \n     made in the SCICEX MOA to support the research infrastructure \n     costs of the SCICEX Program.\n       Following the reinvention of the National Undersea Research \n     Program (NURP), which began in 1997, the program has been \n     included in the President's budget each year at increasing \n     levels. The Blue Ribbon Panel report was taken into account \n     in the restructuring of the program, and an organic act \n     supporting the reinvention is under review by the \n     Administration.\n       Regarding the SCICEX program, the Director of NURP serves \n     on the National Science Foundation's Study Steering Committee \n     to examine and analyze the costs and benefits\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\n     of employing a U.S. Navy nuclear submarine dedicated to \n     global oceanographic science. This would be a follow-on to \n     the SCICEX program. Based on the results of this study and \n     future budget levels, NURP will determine its contributions \n     to support infrastructure and research costs in any follow-on \n     to the SCICEX program.\n       NOAA operates a suite of National Data Centers including \n     the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the National \n     Oceanographic Data Center, the National Geophysical Data \n     Center and the National Climate Data Center. These data \n     centers are charged with the responsibility for data rescue \n     in the former Soviet Union. The Commission recommends that \n     the national data centers communicate the nature of their \n     data rescue activities to the Commission and expand them as \n     necessary to collect data vital to our understanding of the \n     Arctic, especially the dispersal of contaminants in the \n     region.\n       The NOAA National Data Centers (NNDC) continue their long \n     history of cooperative data exchange with counterpart \n     institutions in the former Soviet Union (FSU). The following \n     summary highlights some of the oceanographic, meteorological, \n     and geophysical data sets recovered and made public in the \n     past few years as a result of this cooperation. While these \n     data are significant contributions to our knowledge of Arctic \n     regions, our FSU colleagues indicate there are enormous \n     holdings still in manuscript form or on outdated magnetic \n     tapes. Reasonable estimates to acquire these additional data \n     and make them available far exceed the resources available to \n     NNDC.\n       The National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) has an \n     active, proposal-driven program of ``data archaeology and \n     rescue'' for oceanographic and ancillary meteorological data \n     for the world ocean. These activities are funded by NOAA's \n     Office of Global Programs and by the NOAA/NESDIS \n     Environmental Services Data and Information Management \n     program. As a result of this project, substantial amounts of \n     data for the sub-Arctic and Arctic have been made available \n     internationally without restriction on CD-ROM as part of \n     ``World Ocean Database 1998'' (WOD98) and the ``Climatic \n     Atlas of the Barents Sea 1998: Temperature, Salinity, \n     Oxygen'' products. The majority of these rescued data are \n     from Russian institutions. There are an estimated 500,000 \n     Russian Nansen casts from the Barents Sea and surrounding \n     areas still not available, many of these data being in \n     manuscript form.\n       The Ocean Climate Laboratory of NODC also is working with \n     the Murmansk Marine Biological Laboratory to construct and \n     publish a ``Plankton Atlas of the Barents Sea.'' A second \n     atlas on the physical properties of the Barents Sea will be \n     expanded to include the Kara and White Seas. Russian \n     institutions have expressed interest in developing atlases, \n     databases, and joint research projects, mainly for the sub-\n     Arctic. For example the Arctic and Antarctic Research \n     Institute (AARI) of St. Petersburg is proposing to prepare \n     such products for the Greenland-Norwegian Sea region. If \n     funding becomes available, AARI and the Ocean Climate \n     Laboratory will co-develop this database and analyses.\n       Recently, Arctic and sub-Arctic oceanographic data from \n     Sweden, Poland, the U.S., and Canada were added to WOD98, \n     and more data are being processed for future updates.\n       The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) has several \n     ongoing data rescue and exchange programs with Russian \n     counterparts to rescue, digitize, and render available \n     geophysical data from Russia. Most of these are part of \n     larger data exchange programs. Likewise, the National Snow \n     and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), in collaboration with NGDC, has \n     been involved in extensive Russian and former Soviet Union \n     data rescue activities. The NOAA/NESDIS Environmental \n     Services Data and Information Management program has funded \n     most of these activities. A list of rescued data sets at \n     NSIDC is available to the Commission. Many more data sets are \n     in need of rescue and publication. These include ice station \n     seismic refraction stations, borehole temperature \n     measurements, and additional years of sea ice data.\n       Since 1989 the National Climatic Data Center has been \n     exchanging meteorological and climate data on an annual basis \n     with the All-Russian Research Institute for \n     Hydrometeorological Information (RIHMI) under the ``U.S.-\n     Russia Agreement on the Cooperation in the Field of \n     Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources.'' Data \n     exchanged include three- and six-hourly synoptic weather \n     reports (since 1966), daily temperature and precipitation \n     (since 1884), daily snow (since 1874), daily snow in heavily \n     wooded areas (since 1996), monthly total precipitation (since \n     1890), and upper air data (since 1960).\n       In 1996 a project was initiated with RIHMI to rescue \n     synoptic weather observations contained on 10,000 magnetic \n     tapes at risk of being lost due to age and deterioration. The \n     data from approximately 80 observing sites from 1891 to 1935, \n     700 stations from 1936 to 1965, 1300 sites from 1966 to 1984, \n     and 2000 sites from 1985 to the present were copied to new \n     media. In addition, daily precipitation data were extracted \n     from the observations and provided to the National Climatic \n     Data Center for the preparation of a U.S.-Russian \n     precipitation data set for research.\n       During 1999 a cooperative project was initiated to make \n     available to NCDC the upper air data from the Russian Arctic \n     drifting stations (data beginning during the 1950s).\n     Environmental Protection Agency\n       The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research \n     and Development (ORD) has shown little interest in the study \n     of the special environmental concerns in the Arctic. Although \n     the EPA-ORD was closely engaged in the Arctic and a principal \n     support for the activities of the Arctic Environmental \n     Protection Strategy up until 1994, subsequent involvement has \n     been minimal. This has left the United States committed to \n     programs under the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, \n     particularly in AMAP, for which the appropriate agency \n     (Environmental Protection) refrained from providing support. \n     The Commission considers this to have been a short-sighted \n     decision and recommends strongly that the EPA-ORD make a \n     substantial effort in the study of contaminants in the \n     Arctic. The U.S. has been judged an underachiever by the \n     international community involved in the AEPS and the current \n     discussion on the future of AMAP under the Arctic Council has \n     become very difficult given that there are no plans for EPA-\n     ORD to directly support AMAP efforts.\n       The Commission notes the workshop held in Fairbanks in the \n     summer of 1996. The Commission also notes that the intention, \n     announced at the 1996 Meeting by the Head of the Office of \n     Research and Development, to establish an Arctic baseline \n     study station at Denali National Park fails to understand \n     that the Park is not in the Arctic, that experimental \n     opportunities in a National Park are extremely limited, and \n     that there are a number of superior sites in Alaska, notably \n     Toolik Lake and the Barrow Environmental Observatory, which \n     would provide a superior site where EPA could take advantage \n     of ongoing studies by many scientists.\n       The ability of EPA to interact with the Native residents of \n     the Arctic is compromised by the application of their risk \n     assessment paradigm. This paradigm has led to the conclusion \n     that the U.S. Arctic population is not of high priority \n     because of its small size. This ignores the closeness of the \n     relationship of these people to their environment (roughly 50 \n     percent of their annual caloric intake comes from native \n     plant and animal species), the environmental stresses on \n     village life (almost 50 percent of Alaskan villages use the \n     ``honey bucket'' system for human waste disposal), and their \n     vast and ancient store of traditional knowledge of the Arctic \n     environment.\n       There are important efforts in the Arctic sponsored by the \n     EPA's Office of International Programs. EPA's Office of \n     International Activities (OIA) has supported the study of \n     contaminants in umbilical cord blood samples from Arctic \n     residents. This AMAP-sponsored program was ignored during \n     the AMAP initial assessment activities but has been \n     resurrected with the assistance and support of EPA-OIA. \n     EPA-OIA has proposed other activities in the Arctic \n     including projects to assess and reduce sources of mercury \n     and PCBs. The Commission commends EPA-OIA for their \n     efforts and urges support for their activation and \n     expansion.\n       The Arctic Research Commission expressed appreciation for \n     ongoing research sponsored by the Office of International \n     Activities (OIA) on contaminants in cord blood of Native \n     infants, and strong concerns about the lack of investment by \n     the Office of Research and Development (ORD). Below are \n     responses to these concerns, and a brief outline of EPA's \n     relevant activities.\n       Support of AMAP\n       EPA's decision to withdraw from the AMAP process in 1994 \n     was based on issues other than recognition of the importance \n     of this activity. EPA has re-engaged with AMAP by directly \n     supporting the Heavy Metals workgroup and conducting other \n     work relevant to contaminant issues in the Arctic.\n       In March 1999 the Office of Research and Development (ORD) \n     agreed to chair the Heavy Metals Team during AMAP Phase II. \n     To that end, EPA organized and sponsored a workshop ``Heavy \n     Metals in the Arctic'' in September 1999 to produce a final \n     AMAP Phase II heavy metals research plan and to establish an \n     international heavy metals team. ORD has committed to \n     producing a Phase II report in 2003 that includes unreported \n     U.S. data from Phase I and new data from Phase II. The eco-\n     system-level risk assessment process will serve as the \n     conceptual framework for organizing research results. EPA's \n     ability to launch major new research programs to fulfill AMAP \n     research plans is problematic. Available funds will have to \n     be used strategically to focus on the most essential portions \n     of the AMAP Phase II plan. For success, efforts will be made \n     to find matching funds through partnerships and coordination.\n       AMAP is targeting ``effects'' and plans a special workgroup \n     on combined effects during Phase II. The ORD has also \n     targeted this as an issue and is planning a combined \n     symposium and workshop for multiple stressors and combine \n     effects on the Arctic Bering Sea during FY 00. Workshop \n     results will be framed by the risk assessment process and \n     offered to AMAP as an alternative approach for addressing \n     this scientific challenge.\n       Arctic Research\n       The Denali National Park Demonstration Intensive Site \n     Project under the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment \n     Program was designed to establish an air quality station with \n     UV-B monitoring capability. Data collected there can and do \n     provide very useful information about changes in UV-B \n     radiation in northern regions as well as long-\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\n     range transport of airborne contaminants from parts of the \n     world very remote from Alaska. However, EPA agrees that the \n     Denali National Park research station is outside of the \n     Arctic and recognizes the need for additional Arctic \n     research. To further development of an Arctic research \n     program, ORD established an Arctic Program office in \n     Anchorage, Alaska. Program staffs are directly involved in \n     AMAP and the Bering Sea Regional Geographic Initiative (see \n     ``Risk Assessment'' below).\n       The Office of International Activities (OIA) has been a \n     lead in supporting basic research with international \n     implications characteristics of Arctic environmental \n     concerns. OIA, in partnership with the ORD National Effects \n     Research Laboratory and in coordination wit NOAA and DOE, \n     installed a new state-of-the-art mercury Tekran speciation \n     monitoring unit at the NOAA research station in Barrow, \n     Alaska. The equipment became operational in January 1999 and \n     confirmed the ``Arctic Sunrise'' phenomenon this spring. In \n     addition, OIA has continued its support of the Alaska Native \n     Cord Blood Monitoring Program. The program is designed to \n     monitor the levels of selected heavy metals (including \n     mercury) and persistent organic pollutants (including PCB \n     congeners) in umbilical cord and maternal blood of indigenous \n     groups of the Arctic. The study will generate 180 infant-\n     mother specimen pairs and will include two groups of infants \n     from the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Canada) and infants \n     recruited from the Alaska native American populations. Other \n     OIA activities include the Multilateral Cooperative Pilot \n     Project for Phase-Out of PCB Use, and Management of PCB-\n     Contaminated Wastes in the Russian Federation.\n       REPA Region 10 continues to support contaminants research \n     through a new partnership with the Sea Otter Commission to \n     expand efforts in monitoring persistent, bioaccumulative, and \n     toxic pollutants (PBTs) in subsistence foods in Alaska. The \n     Traditional Knowledge and Radionuclides Project, conducted in \n     partnership with the Alaska Native Science Commission, is \n     ongoing\n       Risk Assessment\n       Risk assessment has a varied history of development and use \n     in EPA. Within the last 10 years, the process and its \n     application have broadened dramatically from single-stressor-\n     driven assessments to complex integrated ecosystem \n     assessments for multiple stressors and combined effects. \n     While it is true that EPA tends to target most resources \n     toward environmental issues impacting areas of greater \n     population density, this is a priority setting exercise \n     rather than an application of the risk assessment process.\n       EPA has found the broadened risk assessment approach to be \n     very effective in bringing together scientific research and \n     management strategies. Specifically it allows communities to \n     use available scientific information (and, particularly in \n     the Arctic, traditional knowledge) to better understand what \n     complement of stressors may be causing undesirable change in \n     important values, key scientific questions that need to be \n     investigated, and alternative problem solving strategies \n     designed to achieve environmental results.\n       It is within this broader frame of reference that EPA is \n     focusing resources and time in the Arctic. The risk \n     assessment process involves multiple steps, including \n     planning (establishing shared goals), problem formulation \n     (using available knowledge to develop conceptual models), \n     analysis (exposure and effects data), and risk \n     characterization (establishing relationships). The Bering Sea \n     Regional Geographic Initiative, sponsored by Region 10 and \n     ORD, is focused on planning and problem formulation to help \n     make sense of the enormous amount of available data and to \n     give direction to future research in the Bering Sea. The \n     Traditional Knowledge and Radionuclides Project sponsored by \n     Region 10 is helping redefine the risk management process \n     with tribes and may offer new ways to re-frame how risk \n     assessment is used in the Arctic. In a similar vein, ORD has \n     begun planning and problem formulation for the Pribilof \n     Islands in partnership with the people of St. Paul to develop \n     a demonstration case study of the process within a Native \n     community. Risk assessment will also provide the conceptual \n     framework for reporting on heavy metals for AMAP Phase II.\n       These activities will provide significant lessons within \n     the Arctic about how to establish management direction, \n     identify data gaps and research opportunities, link research \n     to management concerns, and provide a legitimized use of \n     traditional knowledge.\n     Department of State\n       The Department of State is responsible for the negotiation \n     and operation of our international agreements in the Arctic. \n     The Department seeks input from the IARPC agencies and others \n     through the Arctic Policy Working Group, which meets monthly \n     with the Polar Affairs Section at State. Over the years a \n     disconnect has occurred between the Department and the \n     officials in other agencies making the vital decisions \n     affecting our participation and performance in international \n     programs. This stems principally from the lack of \n     coordination between what the agencies will actually do and \n     the policies expressed in these programs. The most obvious \n     case was the failure of the United States to participate in \n     the AMAP health study of contaminants in umbilical cord \n     blood. While endorsing this program and its goals on the one \n     hand, no samples were actually sent for analysis even though \n     samples existed. The result is that the United States has \n     been viewed with a certain amount of scorn in AMAP meetings \n     (the Commission notes that this program has finally begun \n     under the auspices of the EPA Office of International \n     Activities). The cure for this is certainly not simple. The \n     most important step, however, is that the Department of State \n     must, in the future, meet with Agency policy officials to \n     review their recommendations, spell out the equivalent \n     commitments to action by agencies, and modify their positions \n     accordingly. These meetings must be carefully prepared so \n     that the issues to be discussed are clearly spelled out and \n     that the nature of the commitment required from the agencies \n     is understood well beforehand so that the agencies can come \n     to the table prepared to make commitments.\n       The complexity of this problem can be seen in the state of \n     affairs in October 1998. In October the United States took \n     over the chair of the Arctic Council. At the same time, \n     agency budget appropriations were passed for FY 99 but \n     virtually no specific budget commitments were identified as \n     supporting investigations relevant to Arctic Council needs. \n     Many relevant activities occur in agency programs which could \n     demonstrate U.S. commitment to the Arctic Council but there \n     is no system to collect results and report on relevant U.S. \n     activities to the Council and no financial support for these \n     activities. This problem needs to be addressed immediately \n     for FY 00 and beyond.\n       The Department of State is puzzled by the Arctic Research \n     Commission's recommendations for the Department with \n     regard to facilitation of U.S. Arctic Research. The entire \n     first paragraph is, verbatim, what was reported in their \n     ``Seventh Biennial Report to Congress,'' which was \n     submitted last year and which covered the period of \n     February 1, 1996 to January 1, 1998. The incident that \n     they highlight as an example of an ``interagency \n     disconnect'' that resulted in ``complete failure'' of the \n     United States to participate in an Arctic Council program \n     occurred in 1996 and involved a Federal agency outside of \n     the control of the State Department. From the perspective \n     of the Department, it appears that the Arctic Research \n     Commission has not seen our response to this same \n     evaluation last year. In that initial response, we \n     explained in detail what the State Department's role is \n     with regard to facilitating U.S. research in the Arctic \n     and the formulation of U.S. Arctic policy. It appears that \n     the Arctic Research Commission has failed to take this \n     into consideration. With regard to the additional language \n     that the Commission has submitted this year, the \n     Department would like to emphasize that all queried \n     Federal agencies, with the exception of one, offered \n     general support for the U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic \n     Council. While we are not in a position to comment on the \n     contents of the budgets of other agencies with regard to \n     support for the U.S. chairmanship, we note that the \n     Department received financial support in the amount of \n     $250,000 for its Arctic Council chairmanship in FY 99 and \n     has requested financial support for the Arctic Council in \n     its FY 00 budget request. We also note that a number of \n     other agencies, among them the Departments of Commerce/\n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Energy, \n     Interior/Fish and Wildlife Service, and Environmental \n     Protection Agency, have committed both financial resources \n     and staff time to assist with chairing the Arctic Council. \n     We also note that the Department of State has been \n     generally pleased with the level of participation and \n     leadership from the aforementioned U.S. agencies and \n     others within the Arctic Council's working groups.\n     U.S. Coast Guard\n       The U.S. Coast Guard is the principal provider of research \n     time on icebreakers for U.S. scientists not collaborating \n     with other nations. In the past, the lack of an open system \n     for soliciting participants and planning cruises has produced \n     friction and disagreement as well as some important \n     successes. With the advent of Healy, the new Coast Guard \n     icebreaker, a new system must emerge. The dialog between the \n     scientific community which will be using Healy, Coast Guard \n     designers, and ship builders has been substantially improved. \n     The formation of the Arctic Icebreaker Coordinating Committee \n     has been successful and has led to substantial improvements \n     in the design of research facilities aboard Healy. In the \n     near future the need for liaison and coordination will change \n     from the construction team to operations. The Commission \n     anticipates that the Coast Guard will work closely with the \n     AICC drawing upon the U.S. academic community's substantial \n     level of experience in oceanographic operations generally and \n     in Arctic studies in particular.\n       The AICC and the closer cooperation in which it is \n     participating will not help to produce the potential for a \n     new era of U.S. Arctic research unless a commitment to \n     operating funds for icebreaker utilization is forthcoming. \n     The Commission has recommended to the National Science \n     Foundation that it provide funds for full utilization of \n     Coast Guard icebreakers at up to 200 operating days per year \n     as appropriate depending on funding. The Coast Guard should \n     support NSF in its efforts to provide these funds.\n       The Coast Guard will depend heavily on the Arctic research \n     community to participate in determining scheduling priorities \n     for Healy. The UNOLS Ship Time Request System will be the \n     primary mechanism for fielding and sorting requests for ship \n     access.\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\n     There is a clear need for subsequent scheduling meetings to \n     occur. A specific plan for arbitrating competing scheduling \n     demands has yet to be defined. A discussion of how this \n     process should work is an agenda item for the January 2000 \n     Arctic Icebreaker Coordinating Committee meeting. The Coast \n     Guard envisions a process where it provides information on \n     ship availability and operational access to specific areas \n     and where the science community takes responsibility for \n     prioritizing research goals that will result in actual ship \n     access for investigators. Input from the Arctic Research \n     Commission, the National Research Council, and the National \n     Science Foundation will be key to developing an equitable \n     system that meets the national research requirements.\n     Interagency Task Force on Oil Spills\n       There is a substantial dearth of knowledge about oil spills \n     in Arctic conditions. The Commission has long recommended a \n     substantial research program on the behavior of oil in \n     ice-infested oceans based in part on the research agenda \n     spelled out in Appendix I. In addition, the Commission has \n     had substantial discussions with the Oil Spill Recovery \n     Institute. The Commission in collaboration with the Alaska \n     Clean Seas Association and others has recommended test \n     burns in the Arctic Ocean to study the variety of \n     questions associated with this highly effective method of \n     disposing of oil on the sea. The Commission recommends \n     that the Interagency Task Force commence such a program \n     soon, before the question is made imperative by an \n     accident in the Arctic.\n       The Coast Guard supports the ARC in its recommendation to \n     commence a research program on the behavior of oil in ice-\n     covered waters, although no funds are currently available to \n     support such a program. The Coast Guard continues to endorse \n     the preparedness and response efforts of the Emergency \n     Preparedness Prevention and Response Working Group of the \n     Arctic Council, as well as individual national research.\n       The task force was established as the Coordinating \n     Committee on Oil Pollution Research (CCOPR) under Title VII \n     of Public law 101-380, otherwise known as the Oil Pollution \n     Act of 1990. The Committee has not been funded since FY 95. \n     As a result the Coordinating Committee has focused on \n     ensuring that the research and development projects of its \n     member agencies are discussed and the results of that \n     research and development are shared with Federal, state, \n     local, and private sector researchers. The Coordinating \n     Committee has been unable to initiate any research not \n     already approved by an agency as part of the agency's \n     mission-specific activities. Thus, a proposal for the \n     Committee to initiate and manage a research and development \n     program to study methods of disposing of oil in Arctic waters \n     is not viable at this time. The Arctic Research Commission \n     may wish to propose meeting with the Coordinating Committee \n     to discuss proper research foci with attendant partnership \n     funds to the individual agencies that comprise the \n     Coordinating Committee.\n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n       The Commission has been briefed on the programs undertaken \n     by NASA in the Arctic or having a substantial component in \n     the Arctic. These programs are clearly of a high caliber. The \n     Commission notes, however, that these programs are poorly \n     publicized outside of the community of NASA Principal \n     Investigators. The Commission recommends that NASA carry out \n     a program of outreach to the Arctic Research Community to \n     publicize these programs and to encourage broader \n     participation. NASA is always at risk for the engineering \n     side of their programs to overwhelm scientific uses and \n     needs. The Commission believes that by broadening the \n     participation of the research community in their programs, \n     NASA can benefit from the resulting community support.\n       The Commission also notes that NASA is a participating \n     agency in the International Arctic Research Center and \n     supports the Alaska Synthetic Aperture Radar Facility at the \n     University of Alaska. The Commission supports these efforts \n     and looks forward to their continuation and expansion.\n       NASA welcomes the support of the Arctic Research Commission \n     for its Arctic research program. NASA is sympathetic to the \n     need for outreach of its programs within the broader \n     scientific community. NASA has established procedures by \n     which it seeks to inform the broader community of its goals \n     and vision.\n       NASA publishes a Science Implementation Plan for the Earth \n     Science Enterprise, which includes Arctic research. This \n     document is reviewed outside NASA and provides an opportunity \n     for scientists to understand the scope of planned activities \n     and their relationship to overarching science goals. NASA has \n     invested in the development of effective user interfaces at \n     its Data Active Archive Centers, realizing how important \n     these are to the productive use of mission data. In continued \n     recognition of this, NASA initiated a National Research \n     Council Polar Research Board review of its polar geophysical \n     products during 1999, with a view to obtaining independent \n     and science-driven advice on how best to provide data sets \n     for Arctic researchers. Furthermore, through this review, \n     NASA seeks to develop a strategy for broader use of its polar \n     data sets by the research community.\n       In recognition of the important role that the Arctic plays \n     in global climate, NASA will continue to support Arctic \n     research. The Alaska SAR Facility and the International \n     Arctic Research Center each have important roles to play in \n     encouraging innovative and collaborative Arctic research.\n     National Institutes of Health\n       Under the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy the \n     United States has become involved in programs concerning the \n     health of Arctic residents, particularly the indigenous \n     people of the region. In particular, the AMAP health study \n     has been focused on environmental effects on health in the \n     region. When the United States undertook to sign the AEPS \n     Declaration (and subsequently the Arctic Council Declaration) \n     the message to agencies was that there would be no new money \n     requested or appropriated for these activities. As a result, \n     the U.S. effort in the AMAP health program has been paltry. \n     It is clear that the responsibility for the national effort \n     in this regard falls to the National Institutes of Health, \n     particularly the National Institute for Environmental Health \n     Studies. Unfortunately, the NIH-NIEHS effort has been \n     virtually nonexistent. The Commission recommends that NIH \n     immediately organize an Arctic Environmental Health Study \n     focused primarily on the measurement program outlined by the \n     Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program. In addition, the \n     study of incidences and trends in the major causes of \n     morbidity and mortality in the Arctic should be included in \n     Arctic Council activities, perhaps as an initiative is \n     sustainable development. The effects of both communicable \n     diseases such as tuberculosis, systemic diseases such as \n     diabetes and cancer, and external causes of illness and death \n     such as alcoholism and accident have profound effects in the \n     Arctic.\n       The NIH should undertake to become the focal point for \n     Arctic Council health studies in both AMAP and the \n     sustainable development activities of the Council. To this \n     end NIH should provide secretariat support for U.S. Arctic \n     Council health-related activities and take on the \n     responsibility to see that the myriad relevant efforts at NIH \n     and elsewhere are collected and reported to the Arctic \n     Council as the U.S. contribution. This activity should also \n     include a program, in collaboration with relevant State of \n     Alaska agencies and institutions, to synthesize these results \n     and return them to the Arctic community in understandable \n     language along with their implications for life in the \n     Arctic.\n       The Arctic Research Commission observed that, despite the \n     agreement that the United States participate in the Arctic \n     Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) and subsequently the \n     Arctic Council, no new monies were requested or appropriated. \n     U.S. efforts in AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment \n     Program) were considered paltry. The ARC recommended that the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH), particularly its \n     component, the National Institute of Environmental Health \n     Sciences (NIEHS), organize an Arctic Environmental Health \n     Study, focused on AMAP measurements. A study of the major \n     causes of morbidity and morality was suggested to be included \n     in Arctic Council activities (but perhaps as part of \n     Sustainable Development), and the NIH should become a focal \n     point for reporting health studies to the Arctic Council, \n     including informing the Arctic community of implications for \n     life in the Arctic.\n       The NIH, and its sister agencies within the Public Health \n     Service (PHS), namely the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC) and the Indian Health Service (IHS), are \n     pleased to note considerable progress in supporting several \n     programs under the Arctic Council, including both AMAP/Human \n     Health and Sustainable Development.\n       AMAP Monitoring Program\n       Although the initial focus of AMAP was on the exposures to, \n     and effects of, anthropogenic pollution, there has been a \n     broadening of its sphere of interest, especially among the \n     Human Health expertroup, to include ancillary aspects that \n     are related to the central focus.\n       The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, which derived \n     from, and closely affiliates with, the Indian Health Service, \n     is sponsoring the Alaska Native Cord Blood Monitoring \n     Program, with the additional financial and moral support of \n     many other Federal, state, and local organizations. Such a \n     monitoring program comprised a ``core activity'' of AMAP in \n     its first phase, during which the U.S. was not able to \n     participate. Now, however, during the second phase of AMAP, \n     the U.S. is a full partner in the Arctic region monitoring \n     efforts.\n       AMAP Biomarkers Conference\n       It is evident that there would be tremendous value in \n     utilizing more sensitive indicators of exposure to, and of \n     the possible adverse effects of, the various anthropogenic \n     pollutants found in the Arctic environment. Applicability of \n     very sensitive ``biomarkers'' based on genetic or biochemical \n     tests could be expected to advance the research agenda \n     considerably if properly understood and applied. With this in \n     mind the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, \n     NIH, is sponsoring the International AMAP-2 Biomarkers \n     Conference, in Anchorage, Alaska, in early May 2000. The \n     conference will bring together Arctic health researchers \n     and experts on the use of biomarkers, with the purpose of \n     achieving cross fertilization of ideas and identifying \n     opportunities.\n       Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases\n       The Arctic Investigations Program of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\n     is contributing to the Human Health research agenda through \n     its program to study emerging and reemerging infectious \n     diseases in the Arctic. This is especially apropos because of \n     the suspected relationship of the adverse health effects of \n     pollution on an individual's resistance to infections (e.g. \n     due to an impaired immune response), especially in newborns, \n     infants, and youth.\n       Arctic Environmental/Health Database\n       Under consideration is a proposed computerized database \n     that would incorporate traditional environmental/health \n     knowledge from indigenous Arctic populations as well as \n     available data entries in the National Library of Medicine \n     (NLM, NIH) Medline database. The challenge is how to acquire \n     and codify such traditional knowledge in a machine-readable \n     format. If the project can be implemented, it would include \n     education and training of Arctic populations on the access \n     to, and use of, the database, which would also provide a \n     means of disseminating the activities of the Arctic Council \n     AMAP, Sustainable Development, and other working groups.\n       Arctic Telemedicine\n       In support of the Sustainable Development initiative \n     proposed by the State of Alaska, the PHS, which chairs the \n     White House Joint Working Group on Telemedicine, is providing \n     input to the Telemedicine Initiative. NIH components that \n     will be involved include the National Library of Medicine \n     (extramural grants support program) and the NIH Clinical \n     Center (intramural telemedicine project).\n     Department of the Interior\n       The U.S. Geological Survey has led the effort by IARPC \n     agencies in the assembly of a data structure for Arctic \n     research. Unfortunately, there has never been a satisfactory \n     funding base for this program. In the past, many IARPC \n     agencies have contributed to this effort but these \n     contributions have faded. Only NSF continues to provide \n     support. The Commission recommends that the USGS and the \n     Department of the Interior accept that this program belongs \n     to them and should be fully supported. The USGS should have \n     the full support of the other IARPC agencies. It is \n     particularly important that an effort be staged to save \n     important earth science data from the former Soviet Union. \n     Much useful data is collected in old paper records which are \n     even more vulnerable now that fuel has become scarce in many \n     places. The Commission has recommended that the NOAA National \n     Data Centers undertake a data rescue project coordinated with \n     the USGS.\n       The Commission is correct in stating that the data \n     collection effort by the U.S. Geological Survey is not a \n     funded effort. Consequently the U.S. Geological Survey is \n     able to continue this work only as a collateral effort. The \n     latest budget information indicates that this picture will \n     not improve in the foreseeable future. However, the USGS \n     intends to continue this work as best it can and will \n     continue to seek partners to help support the program.\n       The USGS Water Resources Branch has recently reduced the \n     number of hydrologic monitoring stations in the Arctic. Data \n     from these stations are urgently needed for testing and \n     improving the predictions of large-scale of freshwater runoff \n     in the Arctic. In addition, fresh-water runoff affects the \n     stratification of the Arctic Ocean and the distribution of \n     nutrients, traces, and contaminants brought to the Arctic \n     Ocean from the land. The World Climate Research program--\n     Arctic Climate System Study maintains an Arctic Runoff Data \n     Base for these purposes. The Commission recommends that the \n     USGS rebuild a strong program of Arctic hydrologic \n     measurements.\n       The measurement of Arctic rivers and streams has never \n     enjoyed sufficient funding, so there are just two rivers that \n     flow directly into the Arctic that have stream gages in \n     operation. The cost of maintaining a stream gage on an Arctic \n     river that requires helicopter access is prohibitive. \n     Consequently, unless the budget picture improves \n     significantly, it is unlikely that the U.S. Geological Survey \n     can increase the density of gages in the Arctic. However, the \n     USGS will continue to gather as much information as possible \n     and also promote cooperation with other interested parties \n     whenever possible.\n       Members and staff of the Commission have visited the \n     National Park Service research logistics housing facility \n     at Nome, Alaska. The Park Service is to be commended for \n     this effort and other agencies should consider the Park \n     Service's example as a model to follow.\n       The Department thanks the Commission for its continuing \n     endorsement of the National Park Service program.\n       The Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department has been a \n     stalwart in the work of the Arctic Council's working group on \n     the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna. The Commission \n     recommends that other divisions of the Department follow the \n     example of the Fish and Wildlife Service in their support of \n     Arctic Council Activities.\n       The Department thanks the Commission for its continuing \n     support for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Arctic Council \n     activities.\n     Department of Energy\n       The energy needs of Arctic villages in Alaska are extreme. \n     Poor transportation to remote villages, small communities \n     unable to take advantage of the economies of scale usually \n     associated with municipal energy systems, a mixed economy \n     with only modest cash flow, and the lack of a sophisticated \n     technical infrastructure all make the provision of adequate \n     energy resources in the Arctic difficult. The Commission has \n     no specific programs to recommend but will undertake a review \n     of DOE's village energy programs in FY 99. This study will \n     lead to a Commission Special Report with specific \n     recommendations for research and development of appropriate \n     technology for the Arctic.\n       The State of Alaska faces many unique challenges in helping \n     to ensure that its citizens have access to affordable and \n     reliable electric power. These challenges are particularly \n     evident in rural areas of the state, where electricity is \n     primarily produced by small, expensive, and difficult to \n     operate and maintain diesel power plants. At present the cost \n     of electricity for rural customers is eased somewhat by the \n     availability of the Power cost Equalization (PCE), an \n     electric rate subsidy program administered by the Alaska \n     Department of Community and Regional Affairs (DCRA). However, \n     funds for the PCE are derived from the sale of oil from \n     Prudhoe Bay and are projected to be exhausted in 2000 or \n     2001, and when that occurs, electricity rates in rural areas \n     could rise substantially. Faced with higher electricity \n     costs, and the potential danger of environmental damages \n     related to the use of petroleum energy in a fragile Arctic \n     ecosystem, various Alaskan entities are now exploring ways in \n     which renewable sources of energy can aid in the production \n     of electric power. To better understand the role that \n     renewable energy can play, the DOE's Wind energy Program is \n     engaged in collaborative efforts with a number of Alaskan \n     organizations at the state and local levels to explore ways \n     in which wind can make a greater contribution in the \n     production of electric power.\n       The Department of Energy has been an important source of \n     technology transfer to the Russian nuclear power reactor \n     program. Unfortunately, budget reductions threaten this vital \n     activity. The Commission is concerned that the future of U.S. \n     participation is in jeopardy and that in the future nuclear \n     energy production particularly in the Russian Arctic may \n     proceed without the support of the Department of Energy. The \n     budget for interaction with Russia on nuclear power systems \n     should be supported and reinforced.\n       The concerns of the Commission are noted. The Department \n     agrees that nuclear safety in the Russian Federation remains \n     an important focus of international concern.\n       The Commission fully supports the activities in the Arctic \n     under the Agency's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) \n     Program. The ARM Program is an important research effort and \n     is also an outstanding example of close cooperation between \n     researchers and Native communities and stands as an example \n     for other research programs.\n       The Department thanks the Commission for its continuing \n     endorsement of the ARM Program.\n     Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC)\n       Unfortunately, the current budget stringency has caused the \n     IARPC agencies to become hesitant about Arctic research in \n     the face of the many other demands on their scarce resources. \n     At the same time, however, the national commitment to \n     activities in the Arctic has grown. This is particularly true \n     in the case of the Arctic Council. The Commission recommends \n     that the NSE, in its role as lead agency for Arctic research, \n     call together the IARPC Seniors to agree on a plan of \n     research to support U.S. participation in the Arctic Council \n     which goes beyond the current rhetoric and demonstrates the \n     national commitment to carry on the goals of the U.S \n     Arctic Policy expressed by the President on 29 September \n     1994. Since the appropriation of new money to meet these \n     commitments depends on timely consideration of the \n     nation's participation in the Arctic Council, which we \n     currently chair, and the submission of budget requests to \n     allow agencies to meet their responsibilities as member \n     and chair to the Council, it is imperative that the IARPC \n     agencies come to the table with the intention to request \n     and redirect resources to carry out this task.\n       The biennial revision to the U.S. Arctic Research Plan for \n     2000-2004, as approved by the IARPC, includes a multiagency \n     focused initiative that is intended to support U.S. \n     participation in the Arctic Council. The Department of State \n     is the lead agency for the Arctic Council. The Department of \n     State has assigned personnel and resources to support the \n     Arctic Council secretariat, although no separate resources \n     were requested to support the research program. Several \n     agencies are conducting research that supports Arctic Council \n     priorities.\n       On another front, the United States agencies need to update \n     the IARPC plan for a comprehensive study of the Arctic Ocean. \n     While current experiments are important and of high quality, \n     there is no current plan for the study of the Arctic Ocean \n     which provides context for these studies. The National \n     Science Foundation has commissioned the formulation of a \n     strategy for the study of the Arctic Ocean. The other IARPC \n     agencies with responsibilities for research in the Arctic \n     Ocean include Navy, NOAA, USGS, USCG, EPA, NASA and parts of \n     several others. IARPC should organize an interagency meeting \n     of the principal agencies responsible for Arctic Ocean \n     research. The Commission has recommended such a plan in the \n     past and feels even more strongly that an organized\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\n     effort is needed given the increasing evidence for rapid and \n     substantial change in the Arctic Ocean. The Commission \n     recommends that IARPC update the 1990 IARPC report ``Arctic \n     Oceans Research: Strategy for an FY 1991 U.S. Program'' on a \n     multi-agency basis and that this program be submitted to the \n     Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy for consideration on a budget-wide basis.\n       The biennial revision to the U.S. Arctic Research Plan for \n     2000-2004, as approved by the IARPC, includes a multiagency \n     focused initiative on Arctic Marine Sciences. This is IARPC's \n     update of the 1990 IARPC report ``Arctic Oceans Research: \n     Strategy for an FY 1991 U.S. Program.''\n       The Commission also notes their recommendation above the \n     IARPC publish an annual report on Bering Sea research.\n       The IARPC biennial report of agency accomplishments, to be \n     published in the IARPC journal Arctic Research of the United \n     States (Spring/Summer 2000), will highlight Bering Sea \n     research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8584-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:29 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4986.

A bill to improve the quality, timeliness, and credibility \nof forensic science services for criminal justice purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   paul coverdell national forensic sciences improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on June 9, 1999, the late Senator Paul \nCoverdell introduced legislation aimed at addressing one of the most \npressing problems facing law enforcement today: the critical backlogs \nin our state crime labs. Senator Coverdell's National Forensic Sciences \nImprovement Act of 1999 (S. 1196) attracted broad bipartisan support in \nCongress, as well as the enforcement of national law enforcement \ngroups. Unfortunately, before Senator Coverdell's bill could move \nthrough Congress, he passed away.\n  As a fitting, substantive tribute to Senator Coverdell, I am today \nintroducing the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement \nAct of 2000 to eliminate the crisis in forensics labs across the \ncountry. This was an issue he cared a great deal about, and I am \nhonored to have the opportunity to carry on his efforts to address this \nproblem.\n  The crisis in our forensics labs is acute. According to a report \nissued in February by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of December \n1997, 69 percent of state crime labs reported DNA backlogs in 6,800 \ncases and 287,000 convicted offender samples. The backlogs are having a \ncrippling effect on the fair and speedy administration of justice.\n  For example, the Seattle Times reported on April 23 of this year that \npolice are being forced to pay private labs to do critical forensics \nwork so that their active investigations do not have to wait for tests \nto be completed. ``As Spokane authorities closed in on a suspected \nserial killer, they were eager to nail enough evidence to make their \ncase stick. So they skipped over the backlogged Washington State Patrol \ncrime lab and shipped some evidence to a private laboratory, paying a \npremium for quicker results. [A] chronic backlog at the State Patrol's \nseven crime labs, which analyze criminal evidence from police \nthroughout Washington state, has grown so acute that Spokane \ninvestigators feared their manhunt would be stalled.''\n  As a former prosecutor, I know how dependent the criminal justice \nsystem is on fast, accurate, dependable forensics testing. With \nbacklogs in the labs, district attorneys are forced to wait months and \nyears to pursue cases. This is not simply a matter of expediting \nconvictions of the guilty. Suspects are held in jail for months before \ntrial, waiting for the forensic evidence to be completed. Thus, \npotentially innocent persons stay in jail, potentially guilty persons \nstay out of jail, and victims of crime do not receive closure.\n  As an Alabama newspaper, the Decatur Daily, reported on November 28, \n1999, ``[The] backlog of cases is so bad that final autopsy results and \nother forensic testing sometimes take up to a year to complete. It's a \nfrustrating wait for police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges and \neven suspects. It means delayed justice for the families of crime \nvictims.'' Justice delayed is justice denied for prosecutors, \ndefendants, judges, police, and, most importantly, for victims. This is \nunacceptable.\n  Given the tremendous amount of work to be done by crime labs, \nscientists and technicians must sacrifice accuracy, reliability, or \ntime in order to complete their work. Sacrificing accuracy or \nreliability would destroy the justice system, so it is time that is \nsacrificed. But with the tremendous pressures to complete lab work, it \nis perhaps inevitable that there will be problems other than delays. \nEveryone from police to detectives to evidence technicians to lab \ntechnicians to forensic scientists to prosecutors must be well-trained \nin the preservation, collection, and preparation of forensic evidence.\n  The JonBenet Ramsey case is perhaps the most well-known example of a \ncase where forensics work is critical to convicting the perpetrator of \na crime. As the Rocky Mountain News reported on February 2, 1997, ``To \nsolve the slaying of JonBenet Ramsey, Boulder police must rely to a \ngreat extent on the\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\nresults of forensic tests being conducted in crime laboratories. [T]he \nlooming problem for police and prosecutors, according to forensics \nexperts, is whether the evidence is in good condition. Or whether lax \nprocedures . . . resulted in key evidence being hopelessly \ncontaminated.''\n  We need to help our labs train investigators and police. We need to \nhelp our labs reduce the backlog so that the innocent may be exonerated \nand the guilty convicted. We need to help our labs give closure to \nvictims of crime.\n  The bill I am introducing today is essentially a reintroduction of \nSenator Coverdell's National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 1999 \n(S. 1196). The bill expands permitted uses of Byrne grants to include \nimproving the quality, timeliness, and credibility of forensic science \nservices, including DNA, blood and ballistics tests. It requires States \nto develop a plan outlining the manner in which the grants will be used \nto improve forensic science services and requires States to use these \nfunds only to improve forensic sciences, and limits administrative \nexpenditures to 10 percent of the grant amount.\n  This new bill adds a reporting requirement so that the backlog \nreduction can be documented and tracked. Additionally, the funding is \nadjusted to begin authorizations in Fiscal Year 2001, rather than FY \n2000, as S. 1196 did. Otherwise, this is the exact same bill Senator \nCoverdell introduced and that I and many of my colleagues supported.\n  This bill has the support of many of my colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle, including Senators Cleland and Miller from Georgia, Senators \nLott, Nickles, Hatch, Stevens, Thurmond, Shelby, Cochran, Kyl, \nWellstone, Dodd, Grams, Durbin, Frist, Helms, Specter, Santorum, \nJeffords, Abraham, L. Chafee, Mack, Bunning, Ashcroft, Harkin, and \nothers. I also appreciate the strong support of Representative Sanford \nBishop of Georgia, the primary sponsor of Senator Coverdell's bill in \nthe House.\n  I spoke with Attorney General Reno last night, and she told me that \nshe ``supports our efforts to improve forensic science capabilities.'' \nShe also told me that this bill ``is consistent with the Department of \nJustice's approach to helping State and local law enforcement.''\n  Moreover, numerous law enforcement organizations, including the \nAmerican Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, American Academy of \nForensic Sciences, Southern Association of Forensic Sciences, the \nNational Association of Medical Examiners, the International \nAssociation of Police Chiefs, the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, Georgia \nBureau of Investigation, the National Association of Attorneys General, \nand the National Association of Counties.\n  These Members of Congress and these organizations understand, as I \ndo, that crime is not political. Our labs need help, and after 15 years \nas a prosecutor, I am convinced that there is nothing that the Congress \ncan do to help the criminal justice system more than to pass this bill \nand fund our crime labs. To properly complete tests for DNA, blood, and \nballistic samples, our crime labs need better equipment, training, \nstaffing, and accreditation. This bill will help clear the crippling \nbacklogs in the forensics labs. This, in turn, will help exonerate the \ninnocent, convict the guilty, and restore confidence in our criminal \njustice system. I hope my colleagues will join me in passing the Paul \nCoverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000 in the \nshort time we have remaining in this Session.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Paul \nCoverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000. I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of this important and necessary \nlegislation and commend my friends, Senator Sessions and the late \nSenator Coverdell, for all of their hard work and leadership they have \nshown in this matter.\n  To justify the need for this legislation, I point to the situation \nthat the Arkansas State Crime Lab is experiencing as a direct result of \nthe exponential increase in the production, use, and distribution of \nmethamphetamine. Simply put, with 16,000 test requests this year--\nresulting in a backlog of over 6,000 cases--the Arkansas State Crime \nLab is at the breaking point. Accordingly, it now takes five to six \nmonths from the receipt of a sample to complete the analysis necessary \nfor prosecution. I commend and thank Senator Gregg for his assistance \nin the procurement of funding to hire three additional chemists. \nHowever, I recognize that Arkansas is not alone in its great need and \nthat Congress must authorize more federal funding to fight the ever-\nincreasing proliferation in the production, use, and distribution of \nillicit substances in our nation.\n  The Act would provide an additional $768 million over the next six \nyears in the form of block grants by the Attorney General to states to \nimprove the quality, timeliness, and credibility of forensic science \nservices to the law enforcement community. It would do this by allowing \nstates the flexibility to use these monies for facilities, personnel, \ncomputerization, equipment, supplies, accreditation and certification, \neducation, and training. The Act's merit is further made manifest by \nthe fact that it is supported by such groups as the American Academy of \nForensic Sciences, the National Association of Medical Examiners, the \nAmerican Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, the Southern \nAssociation of Forensic Sciences, the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the National Association of Counties, and the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. Thus, I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in helping Senator Sessions in his efforts to \nenact that this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 3047. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe lifetime Learning credit and provide an optional deduction for \nqualified tuition and related expenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     college tuition tax deductions\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it has become increasingly apparent in \ntoday's society that a college education is no longer a luxury. In \norder for one to succeed in an ever-changing, high-tech world, a \ncollege education has become a near necessity.\n  However, just as a college degree becomes increasingly vital in \ntoday's global economy, the costs associated with obtaining this degree \ncontinue to soar out of control. At the same time, the annual income of \nthe average American family is not keeping pace with these soaring \ncosts. Since 1980, college costs have been rising at an average of 2 to \n3 times the Consumer Price Index. Now, in the most prosperous time in \nour history, it is simply unacceptable that the key to our children's \nfuture success has become a crippling burden for middle-class families.\n  According to the United States Department of Education, National \nCenter for Education Statistics, the average annual costs associated \nwith attending a public 4-year college during the 1998-1999 school \nyear, including tuition, fees, room, and board, were $8,018. For a \nprivate 4-year school these costs rose to an astonishing $19,970. and \nthese are only the average costs, Mr. President. The price tag for just \none year at some of the nations most prestigious universities is fast \napproaching the $35,000 range.\n  In 1996, and again in 1997, I introduced the ``GET AHEAD'' Act \n(Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is \nAffordable and Dependable). My main goal in introducing this \nlegislation was to help the average American family afford to send \ntheir children to college. Although this legislation never came before \nthe full Senate for a vote, I was extremely pleased that a number of \nthe provisions of the GET AHEAD Act--including the student loan \ninterest deduction and the establishment of education savings \naccounts--were included as part of the 1997 tax bill. Additionally, two \nother provisions of that bill--the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime \nLearning Credit--were based upon the core proposal of my GET AHEAD \nACT--a $10,000 tuition deduction.\n  The $10,000 tuition deduction is a proposal I have been advocating \nsince I first announced my candidacy for the Senate 28 years ago. \nToday, I am building upon a proposal the President made in his State of \nthe Union address earlier this year and am introducing legislation \nwhich would finally fully enact this proposal.\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide America's middle \nclass families with up to $2,800 in annual tax relief for the costs \nassociated with a higher education. This plan will give families the \noption of taking either an expanded Lifetime Learning Credit or a tax \neducation of up to $10,000.\n  Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, current law allows many American \nfamilies to claim the Lifetime Learning Credit, currently a tax credit \nof up to 20 percent on the first $5,000 of higher education expenses--\nmeaning a tax credit of up to $1,000 per family per year. For 2003 and \nafter, this will increase to a credit of up to 20 percent of the first \n$10,000 of higher education expenses--meaning a credit of up to $2,000 \nper family per year.\n  The bill I am introducing today will expand this important tax credit \nto 28 percent on the first $5,000 of higher education expenses through \n2002--amounting to a credit of up to $1,400. For the year 2003 and \nafter, this will increase to a credit of up to 28 percent on the first \n$10,000 of higher education expenses--amounting to a credit of up to \n$2,000 per family per year. To give families the flexibility to choose \nthe best approach for their own circumstances, my plan will give \nfamilies the option of deducting these higher education expenses \ninstead of taking the tax credit.\n  My legislation will continue to ensure that these important \neducational tax breaks help support middle class families while \nincreasing the income thresholds to $60,000 per year for individuals \nand $120,000 for couples.\n  Mr. President, the dream of every American is to provide for their \nchild a better life than they themselves had. A key component in \nattaining that dream is ensuring that their children have the education \nnecessary to successfully complete in the expanding global economy. It \nis my hope that this legislation will help many American families move \na step closer in achieving this dream and being able to better afford \nto send their children to college.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 3048. A bill to institute a moratorium on the imposition of the \ndeath penalty at the Federal level until a Commission on the Federal \nDeath Penalty studies its use and policies ensuring justice, fairness, \nand due process are implemented; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              federal death penalty moratorium act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in recent days, Congress has held \nhearings and considered legislation on the terrible tragedy involving \npotentially defective tires manufactured by Bridgestone/Firestone and \nplaced on certain vehicles sold by the Ford Motor Company. It has \ncaptured the nation's and the media's attention. And rightly so. I hope \nwe are able to get to the bottom of who knew what, when, why and how.\n  But while Congress demands accountability from these companies, as \nwell as the Transportation Department, Congress should also demand \naccountability from the Justice Department. As the Senate Commerce \nCommittee held hearings on the Firestone tire problem the other day, a \nfew blocks down the road the Justice Department released a report that \nseriously calls into question the fairness of the federal death penalty \nsystem. The report documents apparent racial and geographic disparities \nin the administration of the federal death penalty. In other words, who \nlives and who dies, and who is charged, tried, convicted and sentenced \nto death in the federal system appears to relate arbitrarily to the \ncolor of one's skin or where one lives. The report can be read as a \nchilling indictment of our federal criminal justice system.\n  I introduced legislation earlier this year calling for a national \nmoratorium on executions and the creation of a commission to review the \nfairness of the administration of the death penalty at the state and \nfederal levels. It is much-needed legislation that will begin to \naddress the growing concerns of the American people with the fairness \nand accuracy of our nation's death penalty system. I am pleased that \nthat bill, the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act, has the support \nof some of my colleagues, including Senators Levin, Wellstone, Durbin, \nand Boxer.\n  But now, with the first federal execution in almost 40 years \nscheduled to take place in December, I urge my colleagues to take \naction in the remaining weeks of this session to restore justice and \nfairness to our federal criminal justice system. I rise today to \nintroduce the Federal Death Penalty Moratorium Act. Like my earlier \nbill, this bill would suspend executions of federal death row inmates \nwhile an independent, blue ribbon commission thoroughly reviews the \nflaws in the federal death penalty system. The first federal execution \nin almost 40 years is scheduled to take place after this Congress has \nadjourned. But before we adjourn, we have an obligation--indeed, a \nsolemn responsibility--to the American people to ensure that the \nfederal criminal justice system is a fair one, particularly when it \ninvolves the ultimate punishment, death.\n  Mr. President, some have argued that the flaws in the administration \nof the death penalty at the state level do not exist at the federal \nlevel. But now, with the release of the Justice Department report \nearlier this week, our suspicions have been heightened. We now know \nthat the federal death penalty system has attributes of inequity and \nunfairness.\n  The Justice Department report makes a number of troubling findings:\n\n       Roughly 80 percent of defendants who were charged with \n     death-eligible offenses under Federal law and whose cases \n     were submitted by U.S. Attorneys under the Department's death \n     penalty decision-making procedures were African American, \n     Hispanic American or members of other minority groups;\n       United States attorneys in 5 of the 94 federal districts--1 \n     each in Virginia, Maryland, Puerto Rico and 2 in New York--\n     submit 40 percent of all cases in which the death penalty is \n     considered;\n       United States attorneys who have frequently recommended \n     seeking the death penalty are often from states with a high \n     number of executions, including Texas, Virginia and Missouri; \n     and\n       White defendants are more likely than black defendants to \n     negotiate plea bargains, saving them from the death penalty \n     in federal cases.\n\n  What do these findings tell us? I think we can all agree that the \nreport is deeply disturbing. There is a glaring lack of uniformity in \nthe application of the federal death penalty. Whether you live or die \nappears to relate arbitrarily to the color of your skin or where you \nlive. Why do these disparities exist? How can they be addressed? The \nJustice Department report doesn't have answers to these and other \nquestions. I am pleased that the Attorney General has requested \nadditional internal reviews. But with all respect to the Attorney \nGeneral, that's simply not enough. The American people deserve more. \nIndeed, American ideals of justice demand much more.\n  With the first federal execution since the Kennedy Administration \nonly three months away, Congress should call for an independent review. \nMr. President, if the Attorney General and the President won't act, \nthen it is our solemn responsibility, as members of Congress, to \nprotect the American people and ensure fairness and justice for all \nAmericans. Congress should demand an answer to the troubling questions \nraised by the Justice Department report. And I believe we have a duty \ndo so. After all, it was Congress that, beginning in 1988, enacted the \nlaws providing for the death penalty for certain federal crimes.\n\n  And I might add, the Justice Department has had more than enough time \nto right the wrong. As some of my colleagues may recall, concerns about \nracial disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty \nwere hotly debated in 1994 during debate on the Racial Justice Act as \nthe Congress decided whether to expand the federal death penalty. At \nthat time, a House Judiciary Subcommittee report found that 89 percent \nof defendants against whom the federal government sought the death \npenalty under the 1988 Drug Kingpin Statute were African American or \nHispanic Americans. In response to these concerns, the Attorney General \ncentralized the process for U.S. attorneys requesting the Attorney \nGeneral's authorization to seek the death penalty.\n  The Attorney General's centralized review process has now been in \noperation for nearly 6 years. But we have not seen anything approaching \nrough consistency, let alone uniformity in the federal death penalty \nsystem. We are continuing to see egregious disparities. One of the \ngreatest needs for additional data and analysis involves the\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nquestion of how line prosecutors and U.S. attorneys are making \ndecisions to take cases at the federal level and charge defendants with \ndeath-eligible offenses. But Congress and the American people should \nnot wait for another report that fails to ask and answer this and other \ntough questions. Indeed, an agency that tries to review itself can't \nalways be expected to be fully forthcoming or fully equipped to \nidentify its own failings. That's why an independent, blue ribbon \ncommission is the only appropriate response to the Justice Department \nreport.\n  And time is of the essence. It's not too late for Congress to act. We \nshould demand full accountability. In fact, the American people are \ndemanding accountability and fairness. In a poll released today by The \nJustice Project, 64 percent of registered voters support a suspension \nof executions while fairness questions are addressed, based on \ninformation that in several instances, criminals sentenced to be \nexecuted have been released based on new evidence or DNA testing. And \nthis is not just a partisan issue, or shouldn't be. The poll, conducted \nby Democratic and Republican polling firms, found that 73 percent of \nIndependents and 50 percent of Republicans, including 65 percent of \nnon-conservative Republicans, support a suspension of executions. The \nAmerican people get it. Something is terribly amiss in our \nadministration of the ultimate punishment, death. And this is just as \ntrue at the federal level.\n  So, as we approach the close of this 106th Congress, I urge my \ncolleagues to support a moratorium on federal executions while we study \nthe glaring flaws in the federal death penalty system through an \nindependent, blue ribbon commission. It is disturbing enough that the \nultimate punishment may be meted out unfairly at the state level. But \nit should be even more troubling for my colleagues when the federal \ngovernment, which should be leading the states on matters of equality, \njustice and fairness, has a system that is unjust. We are at a defining \nmoment in the history of our nation's administration of the death \npenalty. The time to do something is now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 3049. A bill to increase the maximum amount of marketing loan \ngains and loan deficiency payments that an agricultural producer may \nreceive during the 2000 crop year; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n   increasing the authorized amount of marketing loan gains and loan \n                          deficiency payments\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto double the limit on loan deficiency payments (LDP) and marketing \nloan gains.\n  The hard work and ingenuity of America's farmers have made U.S. \nagriculture the pride of the nation. But farmers today face serious \nchallenges. Record low commodity prices continue to besiege family \nthroughout our great nation. For the past 3 years, American farmers \nhave faced the lowest prices in recent memory. Prices have plummeted \nfor almost every agricultural commodity--corn, soybeans, wheat and the \nlist goes on. The bottom line is that many farmers throughout this \nNation are having trouble making ends meet.\n  Appropriately, Congress has responded with economic assistance to \noffset these hard times. However, while last year's assistance package \nincluded a much needed provision to expand limits on marketing loan \ngains and loan deficiency payments, this year's assistance package did \nnot include such a provision.\n  As we move into harvest time, prices have trended downward, and many \nnow realize that loan deficiency payments per bushel may be quite large \nfor many agricultural commodities. With the combination of high yields \nand high per bushel marketing gains, many farmers now realize that they \ncould easily bump up against these payment limitations. Recognizing \nthis impending problem, farm groups, including the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, have asked that these payment limitations be eased, but not \nremoved.\n  According to industry experts, a 700-acre corn farmer will exceed the \n$75,000 cap. For farmers who exceed this cap, their only recourse is to \nforego the much-needed income or use the bureaucracy-ridden commodity \ncertificates program. Estimates project that the additional drying, \nshrinkage and storage costs that a accompany the commodity certificate \nprogram will cost farmers an additional $33.46 per acre of grain. \nFarmers can ill-afford this lost income during these hard economic \ntimes.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to solve this dilemma. The bill \nsimply doubles the LDP limit from $75,000 to $150,000 for this crop \nyear. This legislation is consistent with a provision that was included \nin last year's farm economic assistance package.\n  Surprisingly, this provision may actually provide cost-savings to the \nfederal government through staff time reduction. Anecdotally, Illinois \nFarm Service Agency employees report that it takes about two hours of \nstaff time to complete a loan forfeiture using the commodity \ncertificate process, while the loan deficiency payment process requires \nonly 15 minutes.\n  When the 1996 farm bill was written, no one could have foreseen our \ncurrent situation of extremely low prices, and the $75,000 limit seemed \nappropriate. However, with the Asian market crash, unusually good \nweather, and exceptional crop yields, commodity prices have been driven \nto unforeseen lows, making a re-evaluation of the LDP cap appropriate \nand timely. This bill is good public policy and enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. I appreciate my colleagues--Senators Edwards, Ashcroft, and \nDurbin--who join me as sponsors of this legislation, and I encourage \nother Senators to co-sponsor this sorely-needed change in farm policy.\n  Agriculture is critical to the economy of America, and is the \nNation's largest employer. For farmers to prosper, our Nation must have \neconomic policies that promote investment and growth in agricultural \ncommunities and agricultural States like my home State of Illinois. A \nhealthy agricultural economy has ripple effects through many industries \nand is critical for the economic prosperity of both Illinois and \nAmerica.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 3050. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake improvements to the prospective payment system for skilled nursing \nfacility services; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY CARE ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, in introducing today legislation to increase Medicare \nreimbursements for skilled nursing facilities, SNFs, which care for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  As my colleagues recall, last year the Congress passed a measure to \nrestore nearly $2.7 billion for the care of nursing home patients. This \naction provided much needed relief to an industry that was facing \nextraordinary financial difficulties as a result of the spending \nreductions provided under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) as well \nas its implementation by the Health Care Financing Administration \n(HCFA).\n  Unfortunately, the problem is not fixed, and more needs to be done. \nThat is why Senator Domenici and I are introducing the ``Skilled \nNursing Facility Care Act of 2000'' to ensure that patient care will \nnot be compromised and so that seniors can rest assured that they will \nhave access to this important Medicare benefit.\n  As I have talked to my constituents in Utah about nursing home care, \nit is clear to me as I am sure it is to everyone that no one ever \nexpects--or certainly wants--to be in a nursing home. Yet, it is an \nimportant Medicare benefit for many seniors who have been hospitalized \nand are, in fact, the sickest residents in a nursing home.\n  In Utah, there are currently 93 nursing homes serving nearly 5,800 \nresidents. I understand that seven of these 93 facilities, which are \noperated by Vencor, have filed for Chapter 11 protection. These seven \nfacilities care for approximately 800 residents. Clearly, we need to be \nconcerned about the prospect of these nursing homes going out of \nbusiness, and the consequences that such action would have on all \nresidents--no matter who pays the bill.\n  The ``Skilled Nursing Facility Care Act of 2000'' has been developed \nto address this problem. Medicare beneficiaries who need care in \nnursing\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nhomes are those who have been hospitalized and then need comparable \nmedical attention in the nursing home setting. In other words, they \nhave had a stroke, cancer, complex surgery, serious infection or other \nserious health problem. These seniors are often the sickest and most \nfrail.\n  Medicare's skilled nursing benefit provides life enhancing care \nfollowing a hospitalization to nearly two million of these seniors \nannually. Unless Congress and the Health Care Financing Administration \ntake the necessary steps to ensure proper payments, elderly patients \nwill be at risk, especially in rural, underserved and economically \ndisadvantaged areas.\n  Moreover, in an economy of near full employment, nursing homes face \nthe added difficulty of recruiting and retaining high quality nursing \nstaff. The ability to retain high quality skilled nursing staff ensures \naccess to lifesaving medical services for our nation's most vulnerable \nseniors.\n  Flaws in the new Medicare payment system have clearly underestimated \nthe actual cost of caring for medically complex patients. Subsequent \nadjustments have led to critical under- funding. Patient care is being \nadversely affected. Unfortunately, HCFA maintains that it needs \nstatutory authority to fix the problem. The provisions in the Hatch/\nDomenici bill are designed to address this issue.\n  Our legislation provides that authority. In addition, the bill \nrequires HCFA to examine actual data and actual Medicare skilled \nnursing facility cost increases. Studies have indicated that the \ninitial HCFA adjustment has been understated by approximately 13.5 \npercent. Pursuant to the Hatch/Domenici bill, HCFA would be required to \nmake the necessary adjustments in the SNF market basket index to better \naccount for annual cost increases in providing skilled nursing care to \nmedically complex patients.\n  Since HCFA's review and adjustments as provided under our bill will \nnot be immediate, our legislation would also increase the inflation \nadjustment by four percent for fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002, \nrespectively. This immediate funding increase is necessary to ensure \ncontinuity of quality patient care in the interim. It will provide some \nassurance that quality skilled nursing facility services for our \nnation's seniors will continue, while HCFA examines actual cost data \nand develops a more accurate market basket index.\n  Skilled nursing facilities are being underpaid and most of the \npayment is for nurses' aides and therapists. According to a study \nconducted by Buck Consultants that surveyed managerial, supervisory, \nand staff positions in nursing homes, actual wages for these valued \nemployees increased, on average, 21.9 percent between 1995 and 1998.\n  Buck Consultants examined data gathered from a voluntary nursing home \nsurvey by looking at salary increases for 37 types of clinical, \nadministrative, and support positions. The difference between HCFA's \n8.2 percent inflation adjustment and these salary increases over the \nsame period of time equal 13.7 percent. Again, it is clear that skilled \nnursing facilities are not receiving adequate payment from the Medicare \nprogram. With such funding shortfalls, skilled employees cannot be \nhired and patient care will be impacted.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the ``Skilled Nursing Facility Care \nAct of 2000'' will provide immediate relief to skilled nursing \nfacilities and the seniors they serve, while attempting to address a \nfundamental payment shortcoming for the long-term. We cannot forget our \ncommitment to our nation's elderly.\n  Senator Domenici and I are working with the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, who is also concerned about the impact that \nthe BBA Medicare reimbursement levels are having on skilled nursing \nfacilities and who is currently developing a package of Medicare \nrestorations for health care providers. Over the next several weeks, we \nwill work with him and with members of the Finance Committee in an \neffort to restore funding for SNFs and for other health care providers \nwho are facing similar reimbursement reductions.\n  Once again, I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, and his staff for working with me in \ndeveloping this important bill and preserving Medicare's commitment to \nour nation's elderly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Hatch in \nintroducing the ``Skilled Nursing Facility Care Act of 2000.''\n  We can all take a certain amount of pride in the bipartisan Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. However, it should come as no surprise that \nlegislation as complex as the Balanced Budget Act (BBA), as well as its \nimplementation by the Health Care Financing Administration, has \nproduced some unintended consequences that must be corrected.\n  Heeding this advice, Congress made a down payment last year on the \ncontinued health of the skilled nursing facility benefit by passing the \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. While I believe this was a very \ngood first step, I am convinced the bill we are introducing today is \nurgently needed to assure our senior citizens continue to have access \nto quality nursing home care through the Medicare program.\n  The transition to the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for Skilled \nNursing Facilities (SNFs) contained in the BBA is seriously threatening \naccess to needed care for seniors all across the country. For instance, \nalmost 11 percent of nursing facilities in the United States are in \nbankruptcy. In my home State of New Mexico the number is nothing short \nof alarming, nearly 50 percent of the nursing facilities are in \nbankruptcy.\n  I simply do not know how we can stand by in the face of this crisis \nand watch our seniors continue to lose access to nursing home care. My \nbelief is only buttressed in light of the fact that as the baby boomers \ngrow older we will be needing more nursing homes, not less.\n  We must have a strong system of nursing home care not only now but, \nin the future. With time having already run out on many nursing home \noperators and quickly running out on others, I believe Congress must \nact immediately.\n  In New Mexico, there are currently 81 nursing homes serving almost \n7,000 patients, and as the bankruptcies have proven, the current \nMedicare payment system, as implemented by HCFA, simply does not \nprovide enough funds to cover the costs being incurred by these \nfacilities to care for our senior citizens.\n  For rural States like New Mexico, corrective action is critically \nimportant. Many communities in my State are served by a single facility \nthat is the only provider for many miles. If such a facility were to \nclose, patients in that home would be forced to move to facilities much \nfarther away from their families. Moreover, nursing homes in smaller, \nrural communities often operate on a razor thin bottom line and for \nthem, the reductions in Medicare reimbursements have been especially \ndevastating.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would go a long way to build \nupon the steps we took last year with the Balanced Budget Refinement \nAct in restoring stability in the nursing home industry. The Hatch-\nDomenici Care Act of 2000 would increase reimbursement rates through \ntwo provisions.\n  First, for a 2-year period, the bill eliminates the one percentage \npoint reduction in the annual inflation update for all skilled nursing \nfacility reimbursement rates and raises that same update by four \npercent. I believe this provision is a matter of simple fairness \nbecause we are merely attempting to accurately keep reimbursements in \nline with the actual cost of providing care.\n  Second, the bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto reexamine the annual inflation update, the so-called market basket \nindex, using actual data to determine the necessary level of update. As \na result of the reexamination, the Secretary may adjust the inflation \nupdate accordingly.\n  I look forward to again working with Senator Hatch to pass this \ncritical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 3051.

A bill to designate wilderness areas and a cooperative \nmanagement and protection area in the vicinity of Steens Mountain in \nHarney County, Oregon, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 steens mountain wilderness act of 2000\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I join my friend from Oregon, Senator \nSmith, in the introduction of the Steens Mountain Wilderness Act of \n2000. Located in southeastern Oregon, Steens Mountain is, in the words \nof Oregon environmentalist, Andy Kerr, ``an ecological island in the \nsky.'' Rising a mile above the desert floor, Steens Mountain actually \ncreates its own weather patterns. Though we from Oregon are blessed to \nhave it located\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nwithin our state boundary, it is truly a National natural treasure.\n  Some have wondered why any legislative action at all is needed to \nprotect the Steens. They say the Steens has been there a long time and \nis doing just fine. Why not just leave it alone?\n  There are three reasons why inaction at this time is an unacceptable \nchoice.\n  First, there are many landowners today in the Steens with a \ncommitment to protect this ecological treasure. There is no assurance \nthat this will always be the case.\n  Second, our federal land agencies are now committed to protecting the \nnatural ecology of the Steens. There is no assurance that this will \nalways be the case.\n  Third, the Steens includes many wilderness study areas. We now have \nthe opportunity to begin resolving the status of these lands that have \nbeen in limbo for twenty years. There is no assurance that Oregon's \nfuture elected officials, working with all concerned parties, will ever \nagain have such a unique opportunity to address this contentious issue.\n  The fact of the matter is that protecting the ecological health of \nthe Steens isn't going to happen by osmosis. It has taken the hard work \nof the Oregon Congressional delegation, Governor Kitzhaber, Secretary \nBabbitt and numerous staff and private citizens of Oregon to get this \nlegislation where it is today. It will take a bit more hard work to get \na Senate-passed bill.\n  It is my task, as a United States Senator, to move this legislation \nforward through the committee hearing and Senate floor processes. In \nthat context, this bill will most likely have to be fine-tuned to \naccommodate additional concerns. I look forward to working with all my \ncolleagues to see that this bill is passed before the lights go down on \nthe 106th Congress. But one major aspect of this bill can never change: \nthe protections for the ecological treasure that is the Steens will be \nput in place while we also preserve the important historical ranching \nculture that thrives there.\n  There have been issues raised about the valuation of the land \nexchanges that make the adoption of over 170,000 acres of wilderness \npossible in this bill. Let me make it perfectly clear that this bill \nshould stand or fall on whether there is significant public value at \nthe end of the day. I believe the Senate will find that the \nexpenditures authorized by this legislation purchase the sum of a \ngreater public value than can be accounted for by its individual parts. \nI will continue to work to assure that this legislation achieves the \ngreatest environmental good possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 3053. A bill to prohibit commercial air tour operations over \nnational parks within the geographical area of the greater Yellowstone \necosystem; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   The Yellowstone and Teton Scenic Overflight Exclusion Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprotect two crown jewels of the National Park Service, Yellowstone and \nGrand Teton National Parks.\n  Specifically, the ``Yellowstone and Teton Scenic Overflight Exclusion \nAct of 2000'' would prohibit all scenic flights--both fixed wing and \nhelicopter--over these two parks. A recent proposal for scenic \nhelicopter tours near Grand Teton Park has many in this area of Wyoming \nconcerned about the tranquility of Yellowstone and Teton parks. In \nfact, the proposal has evoked strong opposition by citizens in the area \nand over 4,500 people have signed a petition in support of banning \nthese tours.\n  We need to protect the resources and values of these parks in the \ninterest of all who visit and enjoy these national treasures--today and \nfor future generations. Every visitor should have the opportunity to \nenjoy the tranquil sounds of nature unimpaired in these parks.\n  I don't take the idea of legislation lightly. I am aware that the \nrecently passed National Parks Air Tour management Act provides a \nprocess that attempts to address scenic overflight operations. But this \narea of the country is unique and therefore requires quick and decisive \naction. For example, the proposed commercial air tour operations \noriginate from the Jackson Hole Airport, the only airport in the \ncontinental United States that is entirely within a national park. \nConsequently, every time a commercial air tour operation takes off or \nlands, it is flying through Grand Teton National Park. Further, \ncommercial air tour operations by their nature fly passengers \npurposefully over the parks, at low altitudes, at frequent intervals \nand often to the very locations and attractions favored by ground-based \nvisitors. These threats to the enjoyment of these two parks require \nbanning commercial air tour operations in the area.\n  It is my hope that this legislation can be enacted quickly to ensure \nthe preservation of natural quiet and provide the assurance that \nvisitors can enjoy the sounds of nature at Grand Teton and Yellowstone \nnational parks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Craig, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 3054. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to reauthorize the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out pilot \nprojects to increase the number of children participating in the summer \nfood service program for children; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                     summer meals for poor children\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nimprove the summer food service program, which provides summer meals to \npoor children.\n  On an average school day in 1999, nearly 27 million children received \nlunches supported by the national school lunch program. Of that total, \nover 15 million of these children were poor. Over 7 million children \nparticipated in the school breakfast program and more than 6 million of \nthese children were poor. These statistics clearly show that the \nAmerican people are generous and compassionate regarding the \nnutritional status of our children, especially poor children who may \nnot have access to enough food at home.\n  However, most of these poor children lose access to school lunches \nand breakfasts once the school year is over. The Federal Government \ndoes have programs to provide summer meals, but only about 22 percent \nof the poor children who get a school lunch also get a summer meal. \nCommon sense tells us that children's hunger does not go on vacation at \nthe end of the school year.\n  Basically, children can receive federally subsidized summer meals in \n2 ways: through the summer food service program; or, if they are in \nsummer school or year-round school, through the regular national school \nlunch and school breakfast programs.\n  Summer school and year-round school students can get the regular \nschool lunch and breakfast programs. Just as in the regular school \nyear, students can receive free, reduced price or full price meals, \ndepending upon their families' income. In July 1999, 1.1 million \nchildren received free or reduced price meals this way.\n  The summer food service program was created to provide summer meals \nfor children who are not in summer school or year-round school. The \nestablishment of a summer food service program site depends upon a \nlocal entity agreeing to operate a site. At the local level, the summer \nfood service program (SFSP) is run by approved sponsors, including \nschool districts, local government agencies, camps, private nonprofit \norganizations or post-secondary schools sponsoring NCAA National Youth \nSports Programs. Sponsors provide free meals to a group of children at \na central site, such as a school or a community center or at satellite \nsites, such as playgrounds. Sponsors receive payments from USDA, \nthrough their State agencies, for the documented food costs of the \nmeals they serve and for their documented operating costs.\n  The program is targeted toward serving poor children. States approve \nSFSP meal sites as open, enrolled, or camp sites. Open sites operate in \nlow-income area where at least half of the children come from families \nwith incomes at or below 185 percent of the Federal poverty level, \nmaking them eligible for free and reduced-price meals. Meals and snacks \nare served free to any child at the open site.\n  Enrolled sites provide free meals to all children enrolled in an \nactivity program at the site if at least half of them are eligible for \nfree and reduced-price\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nmeals. Camps may also participate in SFSP. They receive payments only \nfor the meals served to children who are eligible for free and reduced-\nprice school meals.\n  At most sites, children receive either one or two reimbursable meals \nor a meal and a snack each day. Camps and sites that primarily serve \nmigrant children may be approved to serve up to three meals to each \nchild, each day.\n  Participation in the SFSP and the summer portion of the school lunch \nprogram varies widely by State. Comparing the number of low-income \nchildren in summer programs to the number who get free and reduced \nprice meals during the regular school year gives a reasonable measure \nof how well the summer meal needs of low-income children are being met. \nAccording to the most recent data supplied by USDA, only about 22 \npercent of those children who received a regular school lunch also \nreceived a summer meal. Again according to USDA, participation ranges \nfrom over 53 percent in the District of Columbia to under 3 percent in \nAlaska. My home state of Indiana serves under 10 percent of these \nchildren.\n\n  In August, I visited the successful summer feeding program \nimplemented this year by the New Albany-Floyd County Consolidated \nSchool Corporation in Indiana. I discussed with community leaders ideas \nto encourage more participation in the program throughout my home \nstate.\n   Mr. President, hunger does not take a summer vacation. We need to \nexamine new means of encouraging local entities to agree to offer the \nsummer food service program in poor areas. In talking with program \nexperts, a recurring problem they mentioned regarding the decision to \nenter the program was the amount of paperwork necessary to gain USDA \napproval.\n  That is why we propose today legislation to provide a targeted method \nof increasing participation in those states with very low \nparticipation. This method will be tested for a few years to see if it \nis effective and, thus, should be extended to all states.\n  Under current SFSP law, sponsors get a food cost reimbursement and an \nadministrative reimbursement of the amounts that they document, up to a \nmaximum amount. Based on the most recent data available, SFSP sponsors \ndocument costs sufficient to receive the maximum reimbursement over 90 \npercent of the time. Some institutions (e.g., schools, parks \ndepartments) may not offer the SFSP because they do not want to put up \nwith the administrative burden of documenting all their costs in a \nmanner acceptable to USDA. Under the regular school lunch program, \nschools do not have to document their costs, but instead automatically \nreceive their meal reimbursements. The extra paperwork burden of \ndocumenting all their costs may discourage sponsors from offering \nsummer meals. Public sponsors, such as schools and parks departments, \nhave to meet public accounting standards that make it unlikely that \nmoney meant for child nutrition could be siphoned off and used for \nunlawful purposes.\n  My bill would establish a pilot project to reduce the paperwork \nrequired of schools and other public institutions (like parks \ndepartments) to run a summer food service program, and thus, hopefully, \nencourage more sponsors to join the program and offer summer meals. The \nbill would allow, in low participation states, public sponsors to \nautomatically receive the maximum reimbursement for both food costs and \nadministrative costs. In this way, the SFSP would be identical to the \nschool lunch program.\n  Low participation states would be defined as those states where the \nnumber of children receiving summer meals (compared to the number \nreceiving free or reduced price lunches during the school year) was \nless than half the national average participation in the summer meals \nprograms (compared to the number receiving free or reduced price \nlunches during the school year). This pilot program would run for 3 \nyears, FY 01 to FY 03.\n  USDA would be required to study whether reducing the paperwork burden \nincreased participation in the program. USDA would also be required to \nstudy whether meal quality or program integrity was affected by \nremoving the requirement for sponsors to document their spending. \nResults of the study will be available for the 2003 child nutrition \nreauthorization.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Hutchinson):\n  S. 3055. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrevise the payments for certain physician pathology services under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         physician pathology services fair payment act of 2000\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Hutchinson, to introduce the ``Physician Pathology \nServices Fair Payment Act of 2000.'' This important legislation allows \nindependent laboratories to continue to receive direct payments from \nMedicare for the technical component of pathology services provided to \nhospital inpatients and outpatients. This bill encompasses both the \ninpatient and outpatient technical components in a comprehensive manner \nthan will allow Congress to address both of these pressing issues in a \nsingle legislative vehicle.\n  As you know, many hospitals, particularly small and rural hospitals, \nmake arrangements with independent laboratories to provide physician \npathology services for their patients. They do so because these \nhospitals typically lack the patient volume or funds to sustain an in-\nhouse pathology department. Yet, if the hospitals are to continue to \nprovide surgery services in the local community, Medicare requires them \nto provide, directly or under arrangements, certain physician pathology \nservices. Without these arrangements, patients may have to travel far \nfrom home to have surgery performed.\n  Recently, HCFA delayed implementation of new inpatient and outpatient \ntechnical component (TC) reimbursement rules until January 1, 2001. \nHowever, many providers esepectially those in rural or medically \nunderserved areas, remain concerned that the new rules will impose \nburdensome costs and administrative requirements on hospitals and \nindependent laboratories that have operated in good faith under the \nprior policy. For hospitals and independent laboratories that have \noperated in good faith under the prior policy. For hospitals and \nindependent laboratories with existing arrangements, changing the way \nMedicarepays for the TC physician pathology services provided to \nhospitals is likely to strain already scarce resources by creating new \ncosts that cannot be easily absorbed. For the first time, independent \nlaboratories will have to generate two bills--one for the technical \ncomponents to the hospital and onother to Medicare for the professional \ncomponents. Since each laboratory may serve five, ten or more \nhospitals, these separate billings will be costly and complicated.\n  The ``Physician Pathology Services Fair Payment Act of 2000'' is \nessential to the many communities in my home state of South Dakota, and \nacross the country, who rely on the continued presence of pathology \nservices to retain a high-quality health care delivery system that is \nboth responsive and accessible to each and every individual requiring \nthese services. Pathologists provide an extremely powerful and valuable \nresource to these communities and the ``Physician Pathology Services \nFair Payment Act of 2000'' will ensure that these health care \nprofessionals continue to positively impact the lives of not only South \nDakotans but the lieves of millions of Americans who utilize these \nservices without perhaps even knowing the critical role that they play \nin our health care delivery system.\n  Mr. President, I ank unanimous consent that the complete text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3055\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Forest System, which is managed by the \n     United States Forest Service, was established in 1907 and has \n     grown to include approximately 192,000,000 acres of Federal \n     lands.\n       (2) The public domain lands known as revested Oregon and \n     California Railroad grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay \n     Wagon Road grant lands, which are managed predominantly by \n     the Bureau of Land Management were returned to Federal \n     ownership in 1916 and 1919 and now comprise approximately \n     2,600,000 acres of Federal lands.\n       (3) Congress recognized that, by its decision to secure \n     these lands in Federal ownership, the counties in which these \n     lands are situated would be deprived of revenues they would \n     otherwise receive if the lands were held in private \n     ownership.\n       (4) These same counties have expended public funds year \n     after year to provide services, such as education, road \n     construction and maintenance, search and rescue, law \n     enforcement, waste removal, and fire protection, that \n     directly benefit these Federal lands and people who use these \n     lands.\n       (5) To accord a measure of compensation to the affected \n     counties for the critical services they provide to both \n     county residents and visitors to these Federal lands, \n     Congress determined that the Federal Government should share \n     with these counties a portion of the revenues the United \n     States receives from these Federal lands.\n       (6) Congress enacted in 1908 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 25 percent of the revenues derived from \n     National Forest System lands be paid to States for use by the \n     counties in which the lands are situated for the benefit of \n     public schools and roads.\n       (7) Congress enacted in 1937 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 75 percent of the revenues derived from \n     the revested and reconveyed grant lands be paid to the \n     counties in which those lands are situated to be used as are \n     other county funds, of which 50 percent is to be used as \n     other county funds.\n       (8) For several decades primarily due to the growth of the \n     Federal timber sale program, counties dependent on and \n     supportive of these Federal lands received and relied on \n     increasing shares of these revenues to provide funding for \n     schools and road maintenance.\n       (9) In recent years, the principal source of these \n     revenues, Federal timber sales, has been sharply curtailed \n     and, as the volume of timber sold annually from most of the \n     Federal lands has decreased precipitously, so too have the \n     revenues shared with the affected counties.\n       (10) This decline in shared revenues has affected \n     educational funding and road maintenance for many counties.\n       (11) In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, \n     Congress recognized this trend and ameliorated its adverse \n     consequences by providing an alternative annual safety net \n     payment to 72 counties in Oregon, Washington, and northern \n     California in which Federal timber sales had been restricted \n     or prohibited by administrative and judicial decisions to \n     protect the northern spotted owl.\n       (12) The authority for these particular safety net payments \n     is expiring and no comparable authority has been granted for \n     alternative payments to counties elsewhere in the United \n     States that have suffered similar losses in shared revenues \n     from the Federal lands and in the funding for schools and \n     roads those revenues provide.\n       (13) There is a need to stabilize education and road \n     maintenance funding through predicable payments to the \n     affected counties, job creation in those counties, and other \n     opportunities associated with restoration, maintenance, and \n     stewardship of Federal lands.\n       (14) Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \n     Management face significant backlogs in infrastructure \n     maintenance and ecosystem restoration that are difficult to \n     address through annual appropriations.\n       (15) There is a need to build new, and strengthen existing, \n     relationships and to improve management of public lands and \n     waters.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to stabilize and make permanent payments to counties to \n     provide funding for schools and roads;\n       (2) to make additional investments in, and create \n     additional employment opportunities through, projects that \n     improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement \n     stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, and \n     restore and improve land health and water quality. Such \n     projects shall enjoy broad-based support with objectives that \n     may include, but are not limited to--\n       (A) road, trail, and infrastructure maintenance or \n     obliteration;\n       (B) soil productivity improvement;\n       (C) improvements in forest ecosystem health;\n       (D) watershed restoration and maintenance;\n       (E) restoration, maintenance and improvement of wildlife \n     and fish habitat;\n       (F) control of noxious and exotic weeds; and\n       (G) reestablishment of native species; and\n       (3) to improve cooperative relationships among the people \n     that use and care for Federal lands and the agencies that \n     manage these lands.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Sections 13982 and 13983 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66; 16 U.S.C. 500 \n     note; 43 U.S.C. 1181f note) are repealed.\n\n    TITLE V--THE MINERAL REVENUE PAYMENTS CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2000\n\n     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Mineral Revenue Payments \n     Clarification Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Subtitle C of title X of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66) changed the \n     sharing of onshore mineral revenues and revenues from \n     geothermal steam from a 50:50 split between the Federal \n     Government and the States to a complicated formula that \n     entailed deducting from the State share of leasing revenues \n     ``50 percent of the portion of the enacted appropriations of \n     the Department of the Interior and any other agency during \n     the preceding fiscal year allocable to the administration of \n     all laws providing for the leasing of any onshore lands or \n     interest in land owned by the United States for the \n     production of the same types of minerals leasable under this \n     Act or of geothermal steam, and to enforcement of such laws . \n     . .''.\n       (2) There is no legislative record to suggest a sound \n     public policy rationale for deducting prior-year \n     administrative expenses from the sharing of current-year \n     receipts, indicating that this change was made primarily for \n     budget scoring reasons.\n       (3) The system put in place by this change in law has \n     proved difficult to administer and has given rise to disputes \n     between the Federal Government and the States as to the \n     nature of allocable expenses. Federal accounting systems have \n     proven to be poorly suited to breaking down administrative \n     costs in the manner required by the law. Different Federal \n     agencies implementing this law have used varying \n     methodologies to identify allocable costs, resulting in an \n     inequitable distribution of costs during fiscal years 1994 \n     through 1996. In November 1997, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of the Interior found that ``the congressionally \n     approved method for cost sharing deductions effective in \n     fiscal year 1997 may not accurately compute the deductions''.\n       (4) Given the lack of a substantive rationale for the 1993 \n     change in law and the complexity and administrative burden \n     involved, a return to the sharing formula prior to the \n     enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 is \n     justified.\n\n     SEC. 503. AMENDMENT OF THE MINERAL LEASING ACT.\n\n       Section 35(b) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. sec. \n     191(b)) is amended to read as follows: ``(b) In determining \n     the amount of payments to the States under this section, the \n     amount of such payments shall not be reduced by any \n     administrative or other costs incurred by the United \n     States.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8600-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8600-S8604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, \nand I were discussing some dialog that had taken place on the floor of \nthe Senate earlier today, and we wanted to visit a bit about the issue \nof a prescription drug benefit for the Medicare program.\n  We are in session in this 106th Congress perhaps only another 4 or 5 \nweeks at the outset, and much is left to be done prior to the \nadjournment of this Congress.\n  One of the issues that most people think is very important to the \nAmerican people is for this Congress to add a prescription drug benefit \nto the Medicare program. Almost everyone in this country now \nunderstands that the price of prescription drugs is moving up very \nquickly. Last year, the price of prescription drugs increased very \nrapidly. In fact, the cost of prescription drugs last year alone, \nbecause of increased utilization, price inflation and other things, \nincreased 16 percent.\n  The senior citizens in this country are 12 percent of our country's \npopulation but consume one-third of all the prescription drugs in \nAmerica. Senior citizens are at a point in their lives where they have \nreached declining and diminished income years and they are least able, \nin many cases, to be able to afford to pay increasing prescription drug \nprices.\n  There are a range of issues with prescription drugs. I talked about \nsome of these in this Chamber before. There are wild price variations. \nThe same drug in the same bottle made by the same company is being sold \nin Canada for a tenth of the price that it is sold to a consumer in the \nUnited States.\n  The other day I held up two pill bottles of medicine on the floor of \nthe Senate--exact same medicine, made by the same company, put in the \nsame bottle, shipped to two different pharmacies, one in the U.S. and \none in Canada. One was priced three times higher than the other. Guess \nwhich. The U.S. consumer was asked to pay three times more than the \nCanadian consumer for the same prescription drug. That is one issue.\n  There is a second issue changing or altering the Medicare program to \nadd a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. There is no \nquestion that if the Medicare program were being written today instead \nof the\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\nearly 1960s it would include a benefit for prescription drugs. Many of \nthe lifesaving prescription drugs that are now available were not \navailable then.\n  We clearly should add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nprogram. We have proposed, the President has proposed, and the Vice \nPresident has proposed a plan that would provide an optional and an \naffordable prescription drug benefit available to senior citizens to \ntry to help them cover the cost of their needed prescription drugs.\n  Earlier today we had Members of the Senate talk about this being a \nbig Government scheme. It is no more a scheme than the Medicare \nprogram. The Medicare program is not a scheme at all. It is something \nthis Congress did over the objections of those who always object to \nanything that is new. We have a few in this Chamber. It has been done \nfor two centuries. No matter what it is, they say: We object.\n  The Medicare program was developed in the early 1960s at a time when \none-half of the senior citizens in America had no health care coverage \nat all. We proposed a Medicare program. Now 99 percent of the senior \ncitizens have health care coverage.\n  Do you know of any insurance companies that are going around America \nsaying: You know what we would like to do is provide unlimited health \ncare insurance to people who have reached the retirement years? We \nthink it is going to be a good business proposition to find those who \nare in their 60s, 70s, and 80s and provide health insurance because we \nthink that is really going to be profitable. It is not the case.\n  That is why 40 years ago half the senior citizens couldn't afford to \nbuy health insurance. That is why there was a need for the Medicare \nprogram. We not only have a Medicare program, and one that works, but \nwe now need to improve it by offering a prescription drug benefit. When \nwe do, the same tired, hollow voices of the past emerge in this Chamber \nto say: You know what they are proposing is some sort of Government \nscheme.\n  It is not a scheme. It is not a scheme at all. It is an attempt to \nstrengthen a program that every senior citizen in this country knows is \nvaluable to them and their neighbors. That is what this is.\n  Most Members of the Senate understand that we ought to do this. Some \nwho understand it ought to be done, don't want to do it through the \nMedicare program and are proposing we provide some stimulus for the \nprivate insurance companies to offer some sort of prescription drug \nbenefit. But the private insurance companies come to our office and \nsay: We won't be able to offer this benefit; we would be required to \ncharge senior citizens $1,100 for $1,000 worth of benefit for \nprescription drugs. They say: We are not going to offer it; it doesn't \nadd up; we won't do it. That is what the U.S. executives say.\n  I am happy to bring out a chart, as I did the other day, to quote the \nhead of the Health Insurance Association and others who say it won't \nwork--I am talking about the plan proposed by the majority party--it \ndoesn't work at all. But to have them come to the floor of the Senate \ncalling our desire to add an optional prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare program some sort of Government scheme doesn't wash. We are \ntrying to do something that we think is thoughtful, we think is \nnecessary, and we think most senior citizens will take advantage of on \nan optional basis because they understand the price of prescription \ndrugs continues its relentless increase year after year after year.\n  We have people who have never supported the Medicare program. They \ndon't talk about it, but they have never supported it, never liked it. \nIt is the same people who don't like to add a prescription drug benefit \nto the program. They say: Gee, we have financial problems with \nMedicare.\n  Do you know what our problems are with Medicare and Social Security? \nOur problems are success. People are living longer. In the year 1900, \npeople in this country were expected to live to be 48 years of age; a \ncentury later, people are expected to live to almost 78 years of age. \nIn one century, we have increased the life expectancy nearly 30 years. \nThat is success.\n  Does that put some strains on the Medicare program and Social \nSecurity program because people are living longer? Yes. But of course \nthat strain is born of success. This isn't something to be concerned \nabout; it is something to be proud of. People are living longer and \nbetter lives, and part of that is because of the Medicare program. We \nought to improve that program by adding the prescription drug benefit \nto that program now, in this Congress, in the remaining 4 weeks.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague from the State of Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota that I, along with my \nconstituents from the State of Nevada, appreciate the Senator being \nable to articulate the problems with the cost of prescription drugs. \nThe Senator has been on this floor with visual aids showing how much a \ndrug costs, the cost of a prescription being filled in Canada and the \ncost in America. There is a 300- to 400-percent difference in some of \nthose medications. These are lifesaving drugs, drugs that make lives \nmore comfortable. It makes people's live bearable.\n  No one in the Congress has done a better job of suggesting and \nshowing the American people how unfair it is that the United States--\nthe inventor, the manufacturer, the developer of these prescription \ndrugs--why in the world do we, the country that developed the drugs, \nwhy do the people from Nevada and North Dakota and every place in \nbetween, why do we pay more than the people in Canada, Mexico, and \nother places in the world?\n  We don't have an answer to that, do we?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to my colleague from Nevada, we do not have an \nanswer, except I presume it is probably fairly simple: It is about \nprofits. The companies that manufacture prescription drugs have a \nmanufacturing plant, and they produce those drugs in the plant, and \nthey put them in a bottle and put a piece of cotton on top, and they \nseal it up, and they ship it off. They will ship a bottle to Grand \nForks, ND; they will ship a bottle to Reno, NV; and they will ship a \nbottle to Pittsburgh, PA. Then they will ship a bottle to Winnipeg, \nCanada, and into Brussels or Paris, and they price it.\n\n  They say the U.S. consumers will pay the highest prices of anybody in \nthe world for the same pill in the same bottle; we will charge the \nAmerican consumer triple, in some cases 10 times, what we charge \nothers. Why? Because they can. Why? Because they want to.\n  The pharmaceutical industry has profits the Wall Street Journal says \nare the ``envy of the world.'' I want them to succeed. I appreciate the \nwork in developing new drugs. But a lot of work in the development of \nnew drugs is publicly funded by us, through the National Institutes of \nHealth and other scientific research.\n  I want them to be successful. I don't, however, want a pricing policy \nthat says to the U.S. consumer, you pay the highest prices for drugs of \nanybody in the world. It is not fair. And too many of our consumers--\nespecially senior citizens--have reached that stage in life where, with \na diminished income, they cannot afford it.\n  One of the results of the unfairness of all of this and one of the \nresults of not having a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nprogram is this: Three women who suffer from breast cancer are all \nseeing the same doctor and the doctor prescribes tamoxifen. Two of the \nwomen say: I can't possibly afford it; I have no money. The third, who \ncan, says: I will purchase my dose of tamoxifen, and we will divide it \ninto three, and we will each take a third of a dose.\n  Or the woman, a senior citizen in Dickinson, the doctor testified \nbefore a hearing, suffered breast cancer, had a mastectomy. The doctor \nsaid: Here's the prescription drug you must take in order to reduce \nyour chances of a recurrence of breast cancer. The woman said: Doctor, \nI can't possibly do that; I can't possibly afford that prescription \ndrug. I will just take my chances with the recurrence of breast cancer.\n  The point is that senior citizens across this country understand, \nbecause their doctor has told them the drugs they need to try to deal \nwith their disease and try to improve their lives, all too often they \ncannot afford it.\n  In hearing after hearing I have held, I have heard from senior \ncitizens who say: My druggist is in my grocery store. The pharmacy is \nin the back of the store. When I go to the grocery store, I must go to \nthe back of the\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\nstore first because that is where I buy my prescription drug. Only then \ndo I know how much I have left for food.\n  In State after State, I heard that message. It is not unusual.\n  That is why this is such an important issue, both with respect to \ninternational pricing and the unfairness of asking the American \nconsumer to pay the highest prices in the world for these prescription \ndrugs, but also in terms of whether we add a prescription drug benefit \nto the Medicare program.\n  We have proposed that. What has happened is we have people dragging \ntheir feet here in the Congress. While they don't want to be against \nit, they understand we should do it; neither do they really want to do \nit in the Medicare program, because they have never believed that was a \nvery good program and it was a program pretty much resisted by those \nwould resist everything, as I said.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I carry in my wallet, and I have pulled it out on \noccasion--it is pretty worn and tattered--some quotes just confirming \nwhat my friend from North Dakota said about how people on the majority \nfeel about Medicare.\n  Let me read some direct quotes: ``I was there fighting the fight, 1 \nof 12, voting against Medicare because we knew it wouldn't work in \n1965.'' Senator Robert Dole. He, as one of the leaders of the \nRepublican Party, opposed it in 1965. I am sure he still opposes it.\n\n  We don't have to look at Senator Dole, even though I think he is one \nof the patriarchs of the Republican Party. Let's look at one of the \npresent leaders, Dick Armey: ``Medicare has no place in a free world. \nSocial Security is a rotten trick, and I think we are going to have to \nbite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out over time.'' This \nis the House majority leader, Dick Armey.\n  What my friend from North Dakota has said is right: The majority has \nnever felt good about Medicare.\n  As my friend has said, in 1965 when Medicare came into being, there \nreally wasn't a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs \nwere in their infancy and it didn't matter the vast majority of the \ntime whether someone was going to live or die, be comfortable or not.\n  Now, how can we, the only superpower in the world, a nation that is \nleading the world in research and medical products, how can we have a \nMedicare program, a program for health care for senior citizens, that \ndoes not include the prescription drug benefit? We can't do that.\n  I also say to my friend, the reason we are here is this morning a \nSenator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend \nfrom North Dakota said: Sure, we want to do something about Medicare, \nbut I have gotten letters from my constituents saying ``I'm against the \nbig government plan.''\n  This is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the \ntelevision advertisements that are paid for by the health care \nindustry. They want the American people to think that the program the \nDemocrats are propounding is a big government plan. There could be \nnothing further from the truth.\n  What does this have to do with big government? A woman by the name of \nGail Rattigan, from Henderson, NV writes:\n\n       I am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82-year-\n     old woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldn't \n     afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to \n     prevent a stroke. It would be much more cost effective for \n     the Government to pay for medications that prevent more \n     serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations. These \n     include but are not limited to blood pressure medications, \n     anti-stroke anticoagulants, and cholesterol medications. The \n     government's current policy of paying for medications only in \n     the hospital is backward. Get into health promotion and \n     disease promotion and save money.\n\n  This is a registered nurse from Henderson, NV.\n  I want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be \nable to come over and make these statements as if there is no \nopposition to it. What my friend from Tennessee says is wrong. He \nstates he has gotten all of these letters saying: I am against the big \ngovernment plan.\n  That is because of the radio and TV advertisements from the powerful \nhealth insurance industry. But the real people are like the 82-year-old \nwoman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldn't get medication.\n  Also, I want to spread across this record that my friend from \nTennessee, who came and said, ``We need the Republican plan,'' makes \nthe statement that he wants to involve Senator Breaux in this.\n  The majority can't have it both ways. They either support the Bush \nplan, the plan of the person running for the President of the United \nStates on the Republican ticket, or they don't support the nominee. It \nappears what my friend from Tennessee is doing is trying to have it \nboth ways because the Senator from Louisiana does not support Governor \nBush's plan.\n  The majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work \nbecause of their nominee's $1.6 trillion tax cut proposal. Senator \nBreaux pointed this out quite clearly today.\n  My point is, I say to my friend from North Dakota, people who come \nhere and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation. I \nsay the Senator from Louisiana does not support the Bush Medicare plan.\n  I also say the majority has introduced a proposal--so we understand \nit, but it is a Medicare prescription drug benefit in name only. A New \nYork Times writer states:\n\n       . . . all indications are that this plan is a non-starter. \n     Insurance companies themselves are very skeptical; there \n     haven't been many cases in which an industry's own lobbyists \n     tell Congress that they don't want a subsidy, but this is one \n     of them.\n\n  I take just another minute or two of my friend's time.\n\n       The GOP plan subsidizes insurance companies, not Medicare \n     beneficiaries. Health insurance companies continue to say the \n     Republican plan is unworkable.\n\n  The majority tries to give this to the insurance industry, but the \ninsurance industry doesn't want it because it won't work.\n  Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica, has stated:\n\n       . . . we continue to believe the concept of the so-called \n     drug-only private insurance simply would not work in \n     practice.\n       I don't know of an insurance company that would offer a \n     drug-only policy like that or even consider it.\n\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from North Dakota, we know there \nneeds to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  No. 2, we know there has to be something done with Medicare to help \nsenior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs. \nThat is all we are saying. And we want everyone to know the program put \nforth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens. It is \nnot something that is means tested, but a program that helps all senior \ncitizens, not people who make less than $12,000 a year. It is a program \nthat is essential. It is essential because people, as we speak, such as \nGail Rattigan, who is a registered nurse, who wrote to me, write that \npeople are considering suicide. If they are to take one pill a day, \nthey are splitting them in two; they are asking if they can get half a \nprescription filled because they simply can't afford it. We need to \nchange that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some weeks ago I was attending a meeting \nin North Dakota dealing with farm issues. An elderly woman came to the \nmeeting. She sat quietly, said nothing. At the end of the meeting, \nafter everyone else had pretty much left, we had shaken hands with a \nnumber of them, she came over to me. She was very quiet. She grabbed my \narm and she said:\n\n       I just want to talk to you for a moment about prescription \n     drug prices.\n\n  I am guessing she was in her mid to late seventies. She said she had \nserious health problems and she just couldn't afford to buy the \nprescription drugs her doctor said she needed.\n  As she began talking about this, her eyes began brimming with tears \nand then tears began running down her cheeks and her chin began to \nquiver and this woman began to cry about this issue, saying:\n\n       I just can't afford to buy the prescription drugs my doctor \n     says I need.\n\n  This repeats itself all over this country. If it is no longer a \nquestion of whether we ought to do this--and perhaps that is the case \nbecause we hear almost everyone saying we ought to do this--then the \nquestion remaining is: How do we do it?\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\n  We say we have a program that works. The Medicare program works. It \nhas worked for nearly four decades. We know nearly 99 percent of \nAmerica's senior citizens are covered by that Medicare program. And we \nsay let's provide an optional prescription drug benefit that senior \ncitizens, with a small copayment, can access.\n  Others say let's not do that. That is big government. Medicare is big \ngovernment, they say. They say what we want to do is have the private \ninsurance companies somehow write policies that would provide \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Is that big insurance? If one is big government, are they saying we \ndon't want big government, we want big insurance to do this?\n  But if it is big insurance--and it is--let's hear what the insurance \nfolks have to say about it. My colleague just mentioned it. Here is a \nchart.\n  Mr. Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica, says:\n\n       We continue to believe the concept of the so-called drug-\n     only private insurance simply would not work in practice.\n\n  It simply would not work in practice.\n  I have had two CEOs of health insurance companies come to my office \nand say to me: Senator, those who are proposing a prescription drug \nbenefit by private insurance company policy, I want to tell you as a \nPresident of a company, it will not work. We will not offer such a \npolicy. And if we did, we would have to charge $1,100 for a policy that \npays $1,000 worth of benefits.\n  That is Charles Kahn, again, from the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica.\n  Private drug-insurance policies are doomed from the start. The idea \nsounds good, but it cannot succeed in the real world.\n\n       I don't know of an insurance company that would offer a \n     drug-only policy like that or even consider it.\n\n  That is from the insurance industry itself. Let me just for a moment \nask this question.\n  If the insurance industry would have been able to offer a policy for \nprescription drugs that was affordable and practical and usable, would \nthey not already have done so? Ask yourself: If in 1960 it would have \nbeen profitable for health insurance companies to say, Our marketing \nstrategy is to try to find the oldest Americans, those who are nearest \nthe time when they will have a maximum call for needs in the health \ncare industry, to find those people and see if we can insure them--if \nthat were the case, would there have been a need for the Medicare \nprogram? No, there would not have.\n  Of course, that is not the case. In the private sector, these \ncompanies are after profits. How do you find profits in health \ninsurance? Find some young, strapping man or woman who is 20 years old, \nhealthy as a horse, is not going to get sick for 40 years, and sell \nthem a health insurance policy and not have them see a doctor in 40 \nyears, and all the premium is profit. Good for them, good for the \ncompany, and good for the healthy person.\n  But they do not make money by seeking out someone who is 70 years old \nand probably 5 or 10 years away from the serious illness that is going \nto have a claim on that health insurance policy, and that is why, in \n1960, senior citizens could not afford to buy health insurance. Half of \nAmerican senior citizens did not have it. The Federal Government said, \nwe have to do something about it. Even when there were those who were \npulling the rope uphill, trying to do the positive things, we had \npeople here with their foot stuck in the ground saying: No, we will not \ngo; no, it will not work; it is big government; no, it is a scheme.\n  We have such people on every single issue in this Chamber. There is a \nstory about the old codger, 85 years old, who was interviewed by a \nradio announcer. The radio announcer said to him: You must have seen a \nlot of changes in your life, old timer. The guy said: Yep, and I've \nbeen against every one.\n  We know people like that. There are a lot of them in politics. I can \ntell you about people who are against everything new. Then, of course, \nwe do it because it is important to do it; it makes life in this \ncountry better.\n  About 10 years later, guess what. They said: Yes, I started that; I \nwas for that. Of course, they were not.\n  This is not about Republicans or Democrats at this moment. There is \nno Republican way or Democratic way to get sick; you just get sick. \nThere is no Democratic or Republican way to put together a program like \nthat.\n  My point is there are some, Governor Bush and others, who have a \nproposition with respect to prescription drugs that will not work \nbecause those on whom they rely to offer a policy say they cannot offer \nit; it will not work; it cannot be done.\n  If that is the case, and if they believe, as we do, that we ought to \nput a prescription drug plan in the Medicare program, then I say join \nus and help us and work with us over the next 4 weeks and get this \ndone.\n  The question is not whether, it is how, and the answer to the how is \nhere. You cannot do it the way you say you want to do it. You cannot \npretend to the American people you have a plan that will work when the \nindustry you say will do it says it is unworkable.\n  I did not come here to cast aspersions on anybody or any group. This \nis one of those issues of perhaps three or four at the end of this \n106th Congress that we owe to the American people to do, and the only \nway we are going to get this done is if those who say they favor a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare program will stop coming to \nthe floor and calling the Medicare program some giant Government \nscheme. Those who do that understand they are calling a program that \nhas worked for 40 years, that has made life better for a lot of folks \nin this country, a scheme.\n  Let's work together. Let's decide we will embrace those things we \nknow will work and help people. That is why I am pleased the Senator \nfrom Nevada has joined me today.\n\n  I will not go on at length, but the other issue--and at some point I \nwant to visit with the Senator from Nevada about the other issue--is a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We held a hearing in his State on that issue. \nSometime I want to talk on the floor of the Senate about that hearing. \nThat is another health issue we ought to do in this 4-week period. We \nowe it to the American people to do it. It is so important.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. We do need to talk about that hearing in Las Vegas. There \nis not anyone who could watch that and listen to that and not shed a \ntear.\n  I want to take off on something my friend from North Dakota said. \nDuring that hearing--those sick people and the mother who lost her \nson--there was not a question about whether or not they were Democrat \nor Republican. There was not a single word about that. Democrats get \nsick, and Republicans get sick. That is why I underscore what the \nSenator from North Dakota has stated today: That we need to come up \nwith a plan that will work. We know the private insurance plan will not \nwork. We do not have to have politicians tell us. The people the \nmajority is trying to help tell us it will not work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator is right. I end by saying this \nis not about politics; it is about solutions to real problems. We \nunderstand this is a problem. Prescription drug prices are too high. \nThey are going up too rapidly. Senior citizens cannot afford them.\n  We have a serious problem in this country in this area. We understand \nwe have a responsibility to do something about it. What? There are two \nchoices. One does not work, and one we know will. This is not rocket \nscience. We know what works. All we need to do is get enough votes in \nthis Congress to decide we will do what works to put a prescription \ndrug benefit in the Medicare program which is available to senior \ncitizens across this country. Six or eight weeks from now, it can be \ndone. We will have it in the Medicare program, and there will be a lot \nof senior citizens advantaged because of it.\n  We will have more to say about this, but because others wanted to \ncome to the floor today and talk about schemes and other things, I \nthought it was important--and the Senator from Nevada did as well--to \nprovide the perspective about what this issue is.\n  A lot of people speak with a lot of authority. Some are not always \nright but never in doubt. Some old codger said to me one day: There are \na lot of smart people in Washington and some ain't so smart; it's hard \nto tell the difference.\n  He is right about that. The currency in Congress is a good idea to \naddress a\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\nreal problem that needs addressing. We have a real problem that needs \naddressing now, and a good idea to address this problem of prescription \ndrugs is to put in the Medicare program an optional program which is \naffordable, with a small copay that will give senior citizens who need \nit an opportunity to get the prescription drugs they need to improve \ntheir lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8604-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8604-S8605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 4444, legislation that will extend permanent normal trade \nrelations status to China.\n  In the past few days, the Senate has held a number of votes on \namendments that address issues about which I care deeply. We have \ndebated amendments that deal with such issues as ensuring religious \nfreedom in China; organ harvesting; Tibet; and Senator Thompson's \namendment dealing with Chinese nuclear proliferation--an issue that \nneeds definite action.\n  However, I have reluctantly voted against including these, and other \namendments, to H.R. 4444. I am committed to passing PNTR, and I believe \nwe must pass a clean bill and present it to the President for his \nsignature as soon as possible. It is long overdue.\n  Fortunately, as we approach a final vote on PNTR, the Senate is \npoised to pass a clean bill, which, in my view, will help continue the \ngrowth of our economy, and help bring us closer to realizing many of \nthe reforms in China that my colleagues wish to see implemented.\n  For the past several years, the United States has enjoyed one of its \nlongest periods of economic expansion in our history. International \ntrade has been a vital component of this remarkable economic boom. In \nfact, the growth in U.S. exports over the last ten years has been \nresponsible for about one-third of our total economic growth. That \nmeans jobs for Americans and of particular concern to this Senator, \njobs for Ohioans.\n  As my colleagues know, America's trade barriers are among the lowest \nin the world, and as a result, American workers face stiff competition \nfrom overseas. Nevertheless, it is this competition that has made \nAmerican workers the best and the most productive anywhere, and the \nU.S. economy the strongest and most vibrant in the world.\n  In my state of Ohio, tearing down trade barriers has helped us become \nthe 8th largest exporter in the United States, and part of Ohio's \nexport-related success can be linked to passage of NAFTA.\n  Thanks to NAFTA, historic trade barriers that once kept American \ngoods and services out of Canadian and Mexican markets either have been \neliminated or are being phased out. The positive economic effects have \nbeen astounding, including a growth in U.S. exports to Canada of 54 \npercent and a growth of U.S. exports to Mexico of 90 percent since \n1993--the year before NAFTA took effect.\n  My State of Ohio has outperformed the nation during that time period \nin the growth of exports to America's two NAFTA trading partners. Ohio \nexports to Canada have grown 64 percent and Ohio exports to Mexico have \ngrown 101 percent. In the last several years, Mexico has moved from our \nseventh largest trading partner to fourth.\n  Since 1994--the same year NAFTA went into effect--nearly 600,000 net \nnew jobs were created in Ohio. Although NAFTA did not create all of \nthese jobs, the boom in export growth triggered by NAFTA, as well as \nthe overwhelming success of the ``New Economy'' have contributed \nsignificantly to this job growth.\n  As in many States in America, unemployment in Ohio today is at a 25 \nyear low; and some areas of the State are even facing worker \nshortages--in fact, too many. The claims that ``countless numbers of \nworkers'' would lose their jobs due to NAFTA and become \n``unemployable'' have rung hollow.\n  According to the most recent data from the United States Department \nof Labor, the number of workers who have been certified by the DOL as \neligible for NAFTA trade adjustment assistance benefits between January \n1, 1994, and September 28, 1999, is 6,074.\n  However, not all workers who have been certified for NAFTA trade \nadjustment assistance have actually collected benefits. Additional data \nfrom the Department of Labor suggests that only 20 to 30 percent of all \ncertified workers have collected benefits. This means that most workers \nhave moved on to other employment. It also means that NAFTA works.\n  Building on the success of NAFTA, we have an opportunity to watch \nlightning strike twice.\n  In November of last year, the U.S. signed an historic bilateral trade \nagreement with China, a crucial first step in China's effort to gain \nentry into the World Trade Organization. This agreement--a product of \n13 years of negotiation--contains unprecedented, unilateral trade \nconcessions on the part of China, including significant reductions in \ntariffs and other barriers to trade.\n  In return, China would receive no increased access to U.S. markets, \nno cuts in U.S. tariffs and no special removal of U.S. import \nprotections. This is because our market is already open to Chinese \nexports, and by signing the bilateral agreement, China has agreed to \nopen its market unilaterally to the United States in exchange for U.S. \nsupport for Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization.\n  If implemented, this agreement would present unprecedented \nopportunities for American farmers, workers and businesses. In fact, \naccording to the Institute for International Economics, China's entry \ninto the WTO would result in an immediate increase in U.S. exports of \n$3.1 billion.\n  An analysis produced by Goldman Sachs, which took into account \ninvestment flows, estimates that China's entry into the WTO could \ntranslate into $13 billion in additional U.S. exports by the year 2005.\n  As good as this may sound, the United States risks losing the \nsubstantial economic benefits of this agreement unless permanent normal \ntrade relations status is extended to China. Currently, China's PNTR \nstatus is annually reviewed by the President and is conditioned on the \nfulfillment of specific freedom-of-emigration requirements established \nin 1974 by the Jackson-Vanik law.\n  However, WTO rules require all members to grant PNTR status to all \nfellow members without condition. If the U.S. fails to extend PNTR \nstatus to China, then both this trade agreement and WTO rules may not \napply to our trade with China.\n  I understand that many Americans oppose PNTR for China because of \nChina's record on a number of important issues, including trade \nfairness, human rights, labor standards, the environment, and China's \nemergence as a regional and global military power. I share those \nconcerns, but I believe that rather than unilaterally locking the \nUnited States out of the Chinese market, the best way to address these \nissues is by opening China up.\n  For years, American businesses have been repeatedly frustrated in \ntheir attempts to penetrate the Chinese market and get through numerous \ntrade barriers used by China to protect its uncompetitive state-owned \nenterprises. In signing the November agreement, China has agreed to \nremove and significantly reduce these trade barriers. This would open \nup one of the world's fastest growing and potentially largest markets \nto American goods and services in a wide range of sectors, from \nagriculture to automobiles and banking to telecommunications. It would \neventually allow U.S. exporters to freely distribute their products to \nany part of China without interference from government middlemen.\n  This agreement also maintains and strengthens safeguards against \nunfair Chinese imports. It preserves a tougher standard in identifying \nillegal dumping. What's more, with this agreement, we will have better \nprotections from import surges than under current U.S. law. Most \nimportantly, this agreement sets the stage for China to join the WTO \nand, hence, become subject to both its trade rules and its binding \npunishments for breaking these rules.\n  The United States has worked for more than a decade to secure freer \naccess to the Chinese market. If the U.S. does not capitalize on this \nagreement\n\n[[Page S8605]]\n\nby giving China PNTR status, America's competitors in Europe and Asia \nmost certainly will.\n  Like most Americans, I am deeply concerned about human rights, labor \nand environmental conditions in China. Some opponents argue that \ngranting PNTR status would somehow remove pressure on China to improve \nits poor record on these issues. I don't agree.\n  It is important to remember that China already has the privilege of \nfull access to the U.S. market. Let's get that clear. They already have \nthe privilege of full access to the U.S. market. While Congress has \nrepeatedly criticized China's record on these issues, it has never once \nrevoked China's trade status in an annual review.\n  Furthermore, granting China PNTR status would not prevent Congress or \nthe administration from continuing to speak out on any and all issues \nof concern that have been raised, nor would it preclude sanctioning \nChina in the future.\n  In addition, I regard the expansion of our economic relationship as a \nfar more effective method of influencing change in Chinese behavior \nthan the status quo. If China joins the WTO, the United States will \nhave an unprecedented opportunity to not only export more of our goods \nand services to China, but also our culture and values. This increased \ninteraction will allow the United States to expose the Chinese people \nto Western standards of political freedom, human rights, business \npractices and environmental protection.\n  No one can predict with any degree of certainty the path China will \nultimately choose for itself. But I firmly believe that opening China \neconomically to the rest of the world can only help efforts to open up \nits political system and improve the lives of its people.\n  Some argue that China has become a major military rival to America \nand that increased trade would finance China's military buildup, \nthereby enhancing China's threat to our national security. I think this \nlogic as inherently wrong.\n  History has shown that economic integration diminishes military \ntension and the threat of war, even among historical enemies. The \nEuropean Union, which brought together two longtime adversaries, France \nand Germany, is a prime example of this phenomenon.\n  Nations that trade together share a common interest in remaining at \npeace and preserving the mutual benefits of free trade. Conversely, \nrejecting opportunities for economic cooperation would only play into \nthe hands of the old hard-line elements in China who are already \nhostile to both free trade and the United States.\n  As the final vote on PNTR approaches, the question that this body \nmust consider is not whether China deserves to enjoy the benefits of \nWTO membership.\n  At this point, that is not a decision the U.S. can make wholly on our \nown, because China will be able to join the WTO if it has the support \nof its other major trading partners. Nor does the Senate need to \ndetermine whether China needs to improve its record on human rights, \nlabor standards and the environment. It is already clear that these \nissues need to be addressed.\n  What the Senate needs to do is to decide whether our Nation will be \nable to benefit from a hard-fought agreement that unilaterally opens \nChina's markets to American products, and whether the United States \nshould use this trade relationship to advance democratic reform, build \na trusting relationship, and address grievances without hostility. In \nmy view, granting China permanent normal trade relations status is the \nfirst step in that process.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my admiration for the Senator \nfrom Ohio.

It was a bill to further Federal support to State forensic \nlaboratories, those places where DNA evidence is evaluated, where drug \nevidence is evaluated, where fingerprints, ballistics, and all the \nother scientific data from carpet fibers, and so forth, are evaluated, \nand then reported out to the prosecutors around the country so cases \ncan be prosecuted on sound science.\n  Today we have a crisis in our criminal justice system. We clearly \nhave a bottleneck, of major proportions, in the laboratory arena. There \nis simply an exploding amount of work. More and more tests are \navailable. People are demanding more and more tests on each case that \ncomes down the pike. We are way behind.\n  In my view, as a person who spent 15 years of my life prosecuting \ncriminal cases, swift, fair justice is critical for any effective \ncriminal justice system. We need not to see our cases delayed. We need \nto create a circumstance in which they can be tried as promptly as \npossible, considering all justice relevant to the cases.\n  I ran for attorney general of Alabama in 1994. I talked in every \nspeech I made, virtually, on the need to improve case processing. The \nvery idea of a robber or a rapist being arrested and released on bail \nand tried 2 years later is beyond the pale. It cannot be acceptable. It \ncannot be the rule in America.\n  Yet I am told by Dr. Downs of the forensic laboratory in the State of \nAlabama that they now have delays of as much as 20 months on scientific \nevidence. We know Virginia last year, before making remarkable \nimprovements, had almost a year--and other States. Another police \nofficer today told us his State was at least a year in getting routine \nreports done. This is a kind of bottleneck, a stopgap procedure that \nundermines the ability of the police and prosecutors to do their jobs.\n  I was pleased and honored to be able to pick up the Paul Coverdell \nforensic bill and to reintroduce it as the Paul Coverdell National \nForensic Improvement Act of 2000. We have had marvelous bipartisan \nsupport on this legislation. Senator Max Cleland from Georgia, Paul's \ncolleague, was an original cosponsor of it. He was at our press \nconference this morning. Senator Zell Miller, former Governor of \nGeorgia, who has replaced Paul in the Senate, was also at the press \nconference today, along with Arlen Specter, a former prosecutor, \nPaul Wellstone, Dick Durbin, and others who participated in this \nannouncement.\n\n  We need to move this bill. It will be one of the most important acts \nwe can do as a Senate to improve justice in America. It is the kind of \nthing this Nation ought to do. It ought to be helping States, providing \nthem the latest equipment for their laboratories, the latest techniques \non how to evaluate hair fiber or carpet fiber or ballistics or DNA. It \nought to be helping them do that and ought not to be taking over their \nlaw enforcement processes by taking over their police departments, \ntelling them what kind of cases to prosecute, what kind of sentences to \nimpose and that sort of thing.\n  A good Federal Government is trying to assist the local States. One \nof the best ways we could ever do that is to support improvements in \nthe forensic laboratories. I believe strongly that this is a good bill \nin that regard.\n  The numbers of cases are stunning. I will share a few of the numbers \nand statistics that I have. According to the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics of the Department of Justice, as of December of 1997--it has \ngotten worse since--69 percent of State crime labs reported DNA \nbacklogs of 6,800 cases and 287,000 offender samples were pending. That \nis human DNA we are talking about. That is not available in every case, \nbut that is not all they have backlogs on. Every time cocaine is seized \nand a prosecutor wants to try a cocaine case, the defense lawyer is not \ngoing to agree to go to trial. He will not agree to plead guilty until \nhe has a report back from the laboratory saying the powder is, in fact, \ncocaine. It is almost considered malpractice by many defense lawyers to \nplead guilty until the chemist's report is back.\n  This is slowing up cases all over America. The labs have lots of \nproblems in how they are falling behind. I think we need to look at it.\n  One article reports:\n\n       As Spokane, Washington authorities closed in on a suspected \n     serial killer they were\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\n     eager to nail enough evidence to make their case stick. So \n     they skipped over the backlogged Washington State Patrol \n     crime lab and shipped some of the evidence to a private \n     laboratory, paying a premium for quicker results. * * * [A] \n     chronic backlog at the State Patrol's seven crime labs, which \n     analyze criminal evidence from police throughout Washington \n     state, has grown so acute that Spokane investigators have \n     feared their manhunt would be stalled.\n\n  Suspects have been held in jail for months before trial, waiting for \nforensic evidence to be completed. Thus potentially innocent persons \nstay in jail, potentially guilty persons stay out of jail, and victims \nget no closure while waiting on laboratory reports to be completed.\n  A newspaper in Alabama, the Decatur Daily, said:\n\n       [The] backlog of cases is so bad that final autopsy results \n     and other forensic testing sometimes take up to a year to \n     complete.\n\n  Now they are saying it takes even longer than that in Alabama.\n\n       It's a frustrating wait for police, prosecutors, defense \n     attorneys, judges and even suspects. It means delayed justice \n     for families of crime victims.\n\n  Another article:\n\n       To solve the slaying of Jon Benet Ramsey, Boulder police \n     must rely to a great extent on the results of forensic tests \n     being conducted in crime laboratories. [T]he looming \n     problem for police and prosecutors, according to forensic \n     experts, is whether the evidence is in good condition. Or \n     whether lax procedures * * * resulted in key evidence \n     being hopelessly contaminated.\n\n  We need to improve our ability to deal with these issues. This \nlegislation would provide $768 million over 6 years directly to our 50 \nState crime labs to allow them to improve what they are doing.\n  At the press conference today, we were joined by a nonpolitician and \na nonlaw enforcement officer, but perhaps without doubt the person in \nthis country and in the world who has done more than any other to \nexplain what goes on in forensic labs. We had Patricia Cornwell, a \nbest-selling author of so many forensic laboratory cases--a best \nselling author, perhaps the best selling author in America. She worked \nfor a number of years in a laboratory, actually measuring and \ndescribing, as they wrote down the description of the knife cuts and \nbullet wounds in bodies. She worked in data processing.\n  She has traveled around this country, and she has visited \nlaboratories all over the country. She said at our press conference \nthey are in a deplorable state. She said the backlog around the country \nis unprecedented. She lives in Richmond, VA. She personally has put \n$1.5 million of her own money, matched by the State of Virginia, \nGovernor Gilmore, to create a laboratory in Virginia that meets the \nstandard she believes is required. It is a remarkable thing that she \nwould do that, be that deeply involved.\n  She is involved and chairman of the board of the foundation that \nhelped create that. She told us how police, defense attorneys, \nprosecutors, are asking for DNA evidence on cigarettes, on hat bands. \nThey want hair DNA done, hundreds and hundreds of new uses, a Kleenex, \nperhaps, take the DNA off of that, in addition to the normal objects \nfrom which you might expect DNA to be taken. Her view was--and she is \nquite passionate about this; she has put her own money in it; she \nunderstands it deeply--that nothing more could be done to help improve \njustice in America than to help our laboratories around the country.\n  We have people on death row who are being charged with capital \ncrimes. We have people who have been charged with rape who are out \nawaiting trial because they haven't gotten the DNA tests back on semen \nspecimens or blood specimens, and they may well be committing other \nrapes and other robberies while they are out, if they are guilty. Also, \nthere is evidence to prove they are not guilty if that is the case.\n  I believe we had a good day today. I believe this Senate and this \nCongress will listen to the facts about the need for improvement of our \nforensic laboratories which will respond to the crush of cases that are \npiling up all over the country and will recognize the leadership that \nour magnificent and wonderful colleague, Paul Coverdell, gave to this \neffort and will be proud to vote for the bill named for him, the Paul \nCoverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000, and that \nwe can, on a bipartisan basis, move this bill and strike a major blow \nfor justice in America.\n  I talked with the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, \nyesterday. She told me this was very consistent with her views. She \nsupports our efforts to improve forensic science capabilities, and she \nsaid it is consistent with the Department of Justice's approach to \nhelping State and local law enforcement. I believe the Department of \nJustice will be supporting this legislation, and we intend to work with \neverybody who is interested to improve it. At this point, the \nlegislation speaks for itself. It is receiving broad bipartisan \nsupport, and I believe we can move it on to passage this year. Nothing \nwe could do would help fight crime more and produce a better quality of \njustice in our courts over America than passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Harkin, \nMcConnell, Bunning, and Grams be added as original cosponsors of S. \n3045, which I introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I also want to express my appreciation for legal \ncounsel on the Judiciary Committee, Sean Costello, who is with me \ntoday, and my chief counsel, Ed Haden, for their support and the \nextraordinary work they have done in helping to prepare this bill for \nfiling.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8606-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SELLING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES TO CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback, is here. I had the pleasure recently to be at a press \nconference with him, which he arranged. He had written a letter to a \nnumber of businesses, which I joined. Senator Tim Hutchinson and Joe \nLieberman also signed that letter. We asked them to consider whether or \nnot they ought to continue to sell video games rated ``M,'' for mature \naudiences, to young people without some control. In fact, Sears and \nMontgomery Ward said they would not sell them anymore. They didn't want \nthem in their stores. Wasn't that a good response? Kmart and Wal-Mart \nsaid they are not going to sell to minors without an adult or parent \npresent. We believe that was a good corporate response.\n  I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Kansas and his \nhearing, subsequent to that press conference, with a lot of the \nmanufacturers of this product. I understand, from what I have seen, he \nwas particularly skillful in raising the issues and holding these \nproducers of this product to account and challenging businesses and \ncorporate leadership to be more responsible because we now have a \nconclusive statement from the American Medical Association and half a \ndozen other groups that this kind of violent entertainment and video \ngames have the capability of harming young people and leading them on \nto violence. That is bad for them and our country.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama, \nSenator Sessions, for his role in this matter. As a former attorney \ngeneral, he brought up some excellent points about what these do when \nyou put a child and a video game in a first person shooter role and you \nreward them for mass killings. You give them points. Particularly at \nthe end, some of these games give a reward which is a particularly \ngrisly killing scene. He pointed out that when you train children in \nthis type of situation, this is harmful to them psychologically, and it \nis something to which we should be limiting their access.\n  He also brought a lot of personal insight from his background as an \nattorney general, and that was really helpful. I hope we are going to \nbe able to draw more attention to parents in the country about these \nproducts because it has a harmful effect.\n  Some of our military actually buy the same products and train our \nmilitary personnel on the video games. They use it as a simulator. They \ndo it as a way of trying to get people to\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\nreact and also to get them up on what is called their ``kill ratio.'' \nIn World Wars I and II, we had problems with soldiers who would not \nshoot to kill because it was not a natural reaction. They would tend to \nshoot around. So they had to figure out how to get that ratio up in the \nmilitary. The problem is when you do that with a child in an \nunsupervised game--the same game being used by military personnel as a \nsimulator of combat conditions--that can be very harmful.\n  We found out yesterday at the hearing that it is not only rated for a \nmature audience, it is not supposed to be used by a child. The industry \nitself rates it ``mature,'' but they market it to the child. They are \ntarget marketing it to children, according to a Federal Trade \nCommission study.\n  I will speak about the Federal Trade Commission report that was aired \nin the Commerce Committee yesterday on marketing of violent \nentertainment products to our children. I want to talk about what that \nreport brought forward, what we saw at the hearing yesterday, and some \nconclusion and things I think we can move forward on in dealing with \nthis problem.\n  At the outset, I recognize the work of one of my staff members, \nCherie Harder, who has done outstanding work in the time she has been \nwith me in the Senate in raising the visibility of this issue.\n  It has been said that every good idea goes through three stages: \nFirst, it is ridiculed; second, it is bitterly opposed; last, it is \naccepted as obvious.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have chaired three hearings in the Commerce \nCommittee on the effectiveness of labels and ratings, the impact of \nviolent entertainment products on children. The first hearing on \nwhether violent products are being marketed to our children happened \nabout a month after the Columbine killings took place in Colorado. When \nwe started out in these hearings, these ideas I put forward were \nridiculed, bitterly opposed shortly afterwards; but now, in reviewing \nthe FTC report, the fact that harmful, violent entertainment is being \nmarketed to kids is now being accepted as clear and obvious.\n  We have come a long way. This is an important Federal Trade \nCommission report. When I introduced the legislation last year to \nauthorize the FTC report, which was cosponsored by several of my \ncolleagues, I did so because of overwhelming anecdotal evidence that \nviolent adult-rated entertainment was being marketed to children by the \nentertainment industry. It has been said that much of modern research \nis corroboration of the obvious by obscure methods. This study \ncorroborates what many of us have long suspected, and it does so \nunambiguously and conclusively. It shows, as Chairman Pitofsky of the \nFTC noted, that the marketing is ``pervasive and aggressive.''\n  It shows that entertainment companies are literally making a killing \noff of marketing violence to kids. The problem is not one industry. It \ncan be found in virtually every form of entertainment--music, movies, \nvideo games. Together they take up the majority of a child's leisure \nhours. The message they get and the images they see often glamorize \nbrutality and trivialize cruelty.\n  Take, for example, popular music. The FTC report notes that 100 \npercent of sticker music--that is music that has been rated by the \nindustry rating board itself as not appropriate for the audience under \nthe age of 18. The survey by the FTC was of the entertainment industry \ntarget-marketing to kids. This is both troubling and fairly \npredictable--troubling in that the lyrics you see that we previously \ndiscussed are target-marketed to young kids--mostly young boys--whose \ncharacters, attitudes, assumptions, and values are still being formed \nand vulnerable to being warped, and predictable in that there are few \nfans for such music who are over the age of 20.\n  Movies are equally blatantly marketed to kids, and they are appalling \nin their content. Movies have great power because stories have great \npower; they can move us; they can change our minds, our hearts, and \neven our hopes.\n  The movie industry wields enormous influence. When used responsibly, \ntheir work can edify, uplift, and inspire us. But all too often that \npower is used to exploit.\n  I have seen some movies that are basically 2-hour long commercials \nfor the misuse of guns.\n  The movie industry has the gall to target-market teen slasher movies \nto child audiences and then insist that the R ratings somehow protect \nthe movie industry. From reading the FTC report, it seems clear that \nthe ratings protect the industry from the consumers rather than the \nconsumers from the industry.\n  Take video games. When kids play violent video games, they do not \nmerely witness slaughter; they engage in virtual murder. Indeed, the \npoint of what are called the first-person shooter games--that is \nvirtually all of the M-rated games, sticker games that the industry \nitself says are inappropriate for an under-age-18 audience--the object \nis to kill as many characters as possible. The higher the body count, \nthe higher your score. Often bonus points are given for finishing off \nyour enemy in a particularly grisly way. Common sense should tell us \npositively that reinforcing sadistic behavior is a bad idea, and that \nin itself cannot be good for children.\n  We cannot expect that the hours spent in school will mold and \ninstruct the child's mind but that hours spent immersed in violent \nentertainment will not. We cannot expect that if we raise our children \non violence, they are going to somehow love peace. This is not only \ncommon sense, it is a public health concern.\n  In late July, I convened a Public Health Summit on Entertainment \nViolence. At the summit, we released a joint statement signed by some \nof the most prominent associations in the public health community. \nThese are some of them: The American Medical Association; the American \nAcademy of Pediatricians; the American Psychological Association; the \nAcademy of Family Physicians; the American Psychiatric Association, and \nthe Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychologists. All of them signed \nthe same document. I will only read a portion of that document to you. \nThis portion of it reads this way:\n\n  ``Well over 1,000 studies point overwhelmingly to a causal \nconnection''--not correlation, causal connection--``between media \nviolence and aggressive behavior in some children. The conclusion of \nthe public health community based on over 30 years of research is that \nviewing entertainment violence can lead to increases in aggressive \nattitudes, values, and behavior, particularly in children.''\n  There is no longer a question as to whether disclosing children to \nviolent entertainment is a public health risk. It is just as surely as \ntobacco or alcohol.\n  The question is, What are we going to do about it? What does it take \nfor the entertainment industry and its licensees and retailers to stop \nexposing children to poison?\n  There is an additional element that this generally excellent FTC \nstudy fails to cover. That is the cross-marketing of violence to kids.\n  There is ample proof that the entertainment industry not only \ndirectly targets children with advertising and other forms of promotion \nbut also markets to them via toys and products that the entertainment \nindustry itself rates as inappropriate for children.\n  Walk into any toy store in America and you will find dolls, action \nfigures, hand-held games, Halloween costumes based on characters in R-\nrated movies, musicians noted for their violent lyrics, and M-rated \nvideo games. Maybe I am particularly sensitive to this because I have \nfive children. But I know this is accurate.\n  There is an equally egregious aspect of marketing violence to \nchildren and cross-marketing of violent products to kids--one that has \nnot yet adequately been investigated. We need to do so. I look forward \nto working with the FTC to ensure that this is done as well.\n  Another media step we need to take is to ensure that these industries \nenter into a code of conduct.\n  Consumers and parents need to know what their standards are for these \nindustries; how high they aim; or how low they will go.\n  I have introduced legislation--S. 2127--that would provide a very \nlimited antitrust exemption that would enable but not require \nentertainment companies to enter into a voluntary code of conduct--have \nthem set a floor, a base below which they won't go to get products out \nto children.\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\n  We had a very telling exchange yesterday in committee. We had two \nexecutives from the movie industry and two from the video game \nindustry. I asked them several times, Is there any word, is there any \nimage so grisly, so bad, is there any example so horrible that you \nwouldn't put it in music or into a video game? Is there anything, any \nword, any image? We have some music that is very hateful toward women \nand harmful. Is there anything that you wouldn't include, that you \ncould say here today you wouldn't put in music or in a video game? They \nwouldn't state anything that they wouldn't put in--nothing at all.\n  We need them to set an industry code of conduct where they would set \nthe standard below which they wouldn't go because many of them are \nsaying if you don't do it, somebody else will. They will chase it. \nThese billion-dollar industries think they don't have to go this low. \nBut why not engage them in setting a voluntary code of conduct? They \nneed to do so, and we need to pass this legislation to allow them to do \nit.\n\n  There are other steps we should consider, but a rush to legislate is \nnot one of them. Frankly, imposing 6-month deadlines on an industry \nthat is actively fleecing money is unlikely to bring about lasting \nreform such as that suggested by the Vice President. We need to \nencourage responsibility and self-regulation. We need a greater \ncooperation from the corporations regarding their view of what they can \ndo to help our children morally, physically, and emotionally--for the \nwell-being of our children rather than harming them. This FTC report is \nan important step in that direction because although it concentrates on \nthe tip of the iceberg, it does shed light on the magnitude of the \nproblem that we have with the entertainment industry. It shows kids are \nbeing exploited for profit and exposes a cultural externality in this \nmarket.\n  Ultimately, we asked the entertainment executives to come in front of \nthe Commerce Committee yesterday--and in 2 weeks the movie industry--to \nwork with us and to appeal to their sense of corporate responsibility \nand citizenship. Our appeal is this: Please just do the right thing. \nStop marketing violence to our kids. If you believe a product is \ninappropriate for somebody under the age of 18, then don't target-\nmarket to that child that same product that you yourselves rate \ninappropriate for a child under the age of 18. Just stop it. Just do \nnot do it.\n  If the industry persists, the FTC has stated that they are going to \ndo an investigation into whether or not some members of the industry \nwho are doing this are liable to charges of false and deceptive \nadvertising of these products.\n  As I mentioned, a code of conduct would be an appropriate step \nforward for the industry to take.\n  Yesterday, we discussed the music industry making widely acceptable \nand available to parents the lyrics that are in the music because, \nright now, those are not readily accessible or available to parents. \nBut ultimately, we all protect the first amendment, and nobody is for \ncensorship. I state that again. Nobody is for censorship. But we need \nto appeal to this industry to just do the right thing and stop target-\nmarketing their products to our children. It is just wrong, and they \nneed to stop it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/14/senate-section/article/S8608-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 2090\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
