Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 4577, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4577) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Helms amendment No. 3697, to prohibit the expenditure of \n     certain appropriated funds for the distribution or provision \n     of, or the provision of a prescription for, postcoital \n     emergency contraception.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 3698, to provide for a limitation \n     on the use of funds for certain agreements involving the \n     conveyance of licensing of a drug.\n       Harkin amendment No. 3699, to fully fund the programs of \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, one item came up in the course of the \nconsideration of the bill on which I commented I would respond to \nregarding the increase in this bill over last year's bill.\n  This year's bill contains a program level of $104.5 billion for \nfiscal year 2001. This is a $7.9 billion increase over fiscal year \n2000, which had a program level of $96.6 billion. When assertions have \nbeen made that the bill has grown by 20.4 percent--that is over 20 \npercent--that is not correct. That calculation is made by comparing the \nfiscal year 2001 program level of $104.5 billion with the fiscal year \n2000 budget authority level of $86.5 billion. That is not an accurate \ncomparison.\n  When you compare the 2001 actual program level to the 2000 program \nlevel, the real increase is 8.2 percent.\n  This question has come up with some frequency. I thought it would be \nuseful to make that explanation.\n  Mr. President, I think we are now prepared to proceed to the \nWellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before we proceed, could I ask my \ncolleague, is it 2 minutes equally divided or 4 minutes equally divided \non each amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is correct. \nEach side has 1 minute, and then we go to the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3698\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for explanation prior to a vote on Wellstone amendment No. \n3698.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment reinstates the Bush \nadministration's policy of requiring a reasonable pricing clause in the \nNIH drug patent licensing agreements and cooperative research \nagreements with pharmaceutical companies unless waived on public \ninterest grounds. It does not apply to universities. A very similar \namendment passed by a 2-to-1 margin in the House of Representatives.\n  All this says is, when it is our public dollars--taxpayer money, our \nconstituents' money--we expect that the drug companies, when they \nbenefit from all this, will agree to charge our constituents a \nreasonable price.\n  I think this is an amendment that should command widespread support. \nI have offered this amendment with Senator Johnson. It has support from \nthe National Council of Senior Citizens, Families USA, and the \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n  I also want to say that I think Senator Levin, last night, hit the \nnail on the head when he said: It is bad enough that we have exorbitant \nprices. It is worse when we actually subsidize the research, and then \nwe do not ask anything in return from these companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the objective of the Wellstone amendment \nis laudable in trying to have reasonable prices. The difficulty is that \nthis was tried 7 or 8 years ago and was found to be very \ncounterproductive. Instead of encouraging tests and development of \npharmaceutical products, it discouraged them. We have already adopted \nthe Wyden amendment which provides for a study on this issue.\n  There are some very important matters raised by the Senator from \nMinnesota. Our subcommittee will hold hearings on this subject shortly \nupon our return in July to try to find out whether the NIH ought to \nhave a share of the patents or what would be a fair approach. There has \nbeen substantial experience with what the Senator from Minnesota \nsuggests in the 1992, 1993, 1994 range, and it was counterproductive. \nThat is why, although the objective is laudable, I am forced to oppose \nthe amendment.\n  I move to table the Wellstone amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Wellstone \namendment No. 3698.

Mr. President, lest there be any confusion on the vote we \nare about to cast, it is my understanding that minors who seek a \nprescription drug from a school-based health clinic can do so only \nafter receiving consent from a parent or guardian. Given that this \nstandard is already in place, I don't believe it is the place of the \nfederal government to instruct states and localities what specific \nservices can or cannot be offered in these clinics--I trust communities \nto decide for themselves what services should be offered\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\nin their school-based clinics, based on their values and priorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, a basic question--and I think a significant one--\npending with this amendment is: Should the taxpayers be required to pay \nfor the controversial ``morning-after pill''--which is identified as an \nabortifacient--to be distributed to schoolgirls on school property? The \nanswer, Mr. President, is absolutely not.\n  But as CRS reported to me, federal law does, indeed, permit the \n``morning-after pill'' to be distributed at school-health clinics.\n  I urge my colleagues to prohibit funds from the Labor, HHS, and \nEducation appropriations bill to be used to distribute the ``morning-\nafter pill'' on school property.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Who seeks recognition in \nopposition? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let's make it clear. We are not talking \nabout an abortion bill. What we are talking about is a contraceptive \npill a young woman would get, the morning after she may have been the \nvictim of rape or incest. This amendment does not deal with RU-486, it \nclearly states it is about denying contraceptive services, and it has \nno exception for young victims of rape or incest.\n  Right now, under existing law, some localities have chosen to provide \nminors access to contraceptive pills through community health centers \nand other programs that are based in the school. The decision to \nprovide school-based contraceptive services is a local decision under \ncurrent law. A local decision. Not a federal one. But this amendment \nwould change that.\n  This amendment says if a young woman has unprotected sex, or even if \nshe is the victim of rape or incest, and is panic stricken the next \nmorning, she cannot take a contraceptive pill the next morning, not \nknowing whether she is pregnant or not, in order to prevent a pregnancy \nfrom occurring.\n  That is what this is about.\n  And I want to reiterate that the Helms amendment has no exception for \nthe victims of rape or incest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It fully funds \nthe Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. As far as I know, this \nis the first time we in the Senate have had a chance to vote directly \non whether to take the action to fully fund IDEA.\n  I cannot say it any better than our colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, said it Wednesday night:\n\n       This body has gone on record in vote after vote that we \n     should fully fund IDEA. If we can't fully fund IDEA now with \n     the budget surpluses and the economy we have, when will we do \n     it? I do not believe anyone can rationally argue that this is \n     not the time to fulfill that promise.\n\n  I could not have said it any better. This is the first time I know of \nthe Senate has ever gone on record. This is the vote to fully fund \nIDEA. We have the surpluses. We have the money. Let's meet our goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the education budget now is $4.5 billion \nover last year. We have increased IDEA by $1.3 billion. Sometimes we \ntalk about big spenders. Adding $8.75 billion is going to put a burden \non the biggest spenders in this Chamber to support this kind of an \nincrease. I want to see a lot more funding in a lot more places, \nincluding IDEA, but this is just over the top. I say that with great \nrespect for my esteemed colleague.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order under 302(f) of the Budget \nAct that this amendment would exceed the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation and is not in order.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I now ask for the adoption of the \nmanagers' package which has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Collins-\nReed amendment to the Labor HHS Appropriations bill which will increase \nthe availability of funds to provide substance abuse treatment services \nfor our Nation's homeless men and women.\n  I would like to extend my thanks to Senator Jack Reed who has joined \nas a cosponsor of this amendment and who has made increased funding for \nservices to benefit the homeless one of his highest priorities. I would \nalso like to extend my thanks to Senators Domenici, Feinstein, \nMikulski, Sarbanes, Jeffords, Kennedy, Bingaman, Wellstone, Lincoln \nChafee, Dodd, Leahy, Durbin, Snowe, Edwards and Moynihan, all of whom \ncosigned a letter to appropriators which I and Senator Reed sent \nearlier this year calling for an increase in funding for mental health \nand substance abuse treatment for the homeless.\n  Like all Americans, homeless men and women need decent shelter, but \nin many cases, homeless people also need treatment to address the \nunderlying problem which has kept them on the street. An estimated 25 \npercent to 40 percent of homeless people need programs to help them \nrecover from drug and alcohol abuse illnesses. Despite the prevalence \nof these illnesses among our nation's homeless, very limited funds are \navailable to serve their specific treatment needs.\n  For a variety of reasons, addicted homeless people often have \ndifficulty accessing mainstream treatment services. For example, many \nsubstance abuse service providers are not equipped to handle the \ncomplex social and health issues that homeless persons present, and may \nreject them or provide ineffective care. In addition, the reality of \nlife on the street may significantly complicate the receipt of \neffective treatment. For example, homeless men and women may have \ndifficulty in adhering to treatment schedules or may lack \ntransportation to and from outpatient services.\n  Comprehensive programs which link treatment to other health, housing, \nsocial and maintenance services often provide the best opportunity for \nthe homeless to adhere to treatment programs and ultimately achieve \nstability in their lives. The funding addressed in my amendment will \nprovide grants which will assist communities in providing treatment \nservices tailored to best serve the needs of their own homeless \npopulation.\n  I thank the Chairman of the Committee, who has been tireless in his \nefforts to increase substance abuse treatment services for all \nAmericans in need, and who has been so receptive to this amendment and \nthe needs of our Nation's homeless men and women.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3701\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funds for the Web-Based Education Commission)\n\n       On Page 68, line 23 before the colon, insert the following: \n     ``, of which $250,000 shall be for the Web-Based Education \n     Commission''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3702\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funds for the purchase of automated external \n defibrillators and the training of individuals in basic cardiac life \n                                support)\n\n       On page 24, line 1, strike ``and''.\n       On page 24, line 7, insert before the colon the following: \n     ``, and of which $4,000,000 shall be provided to the Rural \n     Health Outreach Office of the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration for the awarding of grants to community \n     partnerships in rural areas for the purchase of automated \n     external defibrillators and the training of individuals in \n     basic cardiac life support''.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers have \naccepted the amendment that I introduced with my colleague from \nWisconsin. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee for their assistance and support. \nOur amendment will improve access to automated external defibrillators, \nor AEDs, in rural areas, where they are sorely needed to increase the \nchance that individuals in these communities who suffer cardiac arrest \nwill survive. Joining us in cosponsoring this amendment are Senators \nJeffords, Biden, Enzi, Murray, Abraham, Wellstone, Bingaman, Robb, \nKerry and Reed.\n  Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the State of \nMaine and the United States. According to the American Heart \nAssociation, an estimated 250,000 Americans die each year from cardiac \narrest. Many of these deaths could be prevented if automated external \ndefibrillators were more accessible. AEDs are computerized devices that \ncan shock a heart back into normal rhythm and restore life to a cardiac \narrest victim. They must, however, be used promptly. For every minute \nthat passes before a victim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or \nher chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent.\n  According to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard \nequipment in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other emergency \nvehicles and getting these devices into more public places could save \nmore than 50,000 lives a year. Cities across America have begun to \nrecognize the value of fast access to AEDs and are making them \navailable to emergency responders. In many small rural communities, \nhowever, limited budgets and the fact that so many rely on volunteer \norganizations for emergency services can make acquisition and \nappropriate training in the use of these life-saving devices \nproblematic. Our amendment will increase access to AEDs and trained \nlocal responders for smaller towns and rural areas in Maine and \nelsewhere where those first on the scene may not be paramedics or \nothers who would normally have AEDs.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Wisconsin who has led \nthis effort to increase access to AEDs in rural areas.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you. I would like to commend my friend and \ncolleague from Maine for her leadership in passing this amendment that \nwill help improve cardiac arrest survival rates across rural America by \nmaking AEDs more accessible.\n  I recently visited DeForest, Wisconsin, where the area's citizens and \nbusinesses recently finished a fund-\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\nraising effort that resulted in the purchase of three new \ndefibrillators. When I visited with the DeForest police department, \nthey provided a real life example of why we must increase the \navailability of defibrillators: since they were purchased just three \nmonths ago, two people have been saved by these devices.\n  They helped show me that cardiac arrest victims are in a race against \ntime, and unfortunately, for those in many rural areas, Emergency \nMedical Services have simply too far to go to reach people in need, and \ntime runs out for victims of cardiac arrest. It is simply not possible \nto have EMS units next to every farm and small town across the nation. \nThis amendment will begin to address this problem.\n  Just so my colleagues are aware, I would like to ask my friend from \nMaine to describe how these grants will be made.\n  Ms. COLLINS. These grants will be awarded on a competitive basis by \nthe Health Resources and Services Administration to community \npartnerships in rural areas that are composed of local emergency \nresponse entities, such as community training facilities, local \nemergency responders, fire and rescue departments, police, community \nhospitals, and local non-profit entities and for-profit entities \nconcerned about cardiac arrest survival rates. Our amendment will \nprovide $4 million through the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration for the awarding of grants to community partnerships in \nrural areas to purchase automated external defibrillators and to train \nindividuals in basic cardiac life support. These rural partnerships \nwill also be required to evaluate the local community emergency \nresponse times to assess whether they meet the standards established by \nnational public health organizations such as the American Heart \nAssociation and the American Red Cross. They must also submit to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services an application at such time, in \nsuch manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may \nrequire.

Mr. President, last year, on October 7, during the \nconsideration of the FY 2000 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill, \nSenators Ron Wyden, Gordon Smith and I offered an amendment which was \naccepted as part of the legislation that passed.\n  It directed the Department of Labor to send to Congress its \nsuggestions, or a plan, to improve the day-to-day lives of farmworkers.\n  We are here again. The Labor-HHS Appropriations bill is being \ndebated, and we are still awaiting answers to concerns raised in the \nlast debate.\n  In fairness, I should mention that the Secretary of Labor has \nindicated that this report is underway and that we can expect it later \nthis year. But yet another year has slipped by without the \nAdministration designing a plan to improve the lives of those who do so \nmuch to provide for us.\n  The purpose of our amendment and speech last year was to outline the \nthree previous years of frustration in our efforts to secure this plan \nfrom the Department of Labor. We sought legislatively what we had not \nbeen able to obtain in personal meetings and phone calls. Now, we are \nhere again, on this same bill, asking for the same assistance.\n  For the past several years I have worked with several of our \ncolleagues to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve the lives of \nour Nation's farmworkers.\n  Almost everyone agrees that the status quo is unacceptable. GAO \nestimates that at least 50 percent of agricultural workers in the \nUnited States do not have documented status. This is a conservative \nestimate since these are workers who have admitted their illegal \nstatus, the actual number without work authorization is likely much \nhigher.\n  I respect the fact that the Department of Labor has concerns about \nour bipartisan legislation. What we have asked, year after year, is \nthat they improve it, modify it, or offer their own alternate \ncomprehensive plan.\n  I commend the work that the Department has done up to this point to \nrespond to us, but I urge Secretary Herman to finish work on this \nproposal and submit it to Congress at the earliest possible \nopportunity. The legislative calendar is short this year, and we have \nno time to waste.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in October, 1999, I came to the Senate \nfloor to speak about an important amendment to the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 concerning farm \nworkers. I have worked on this issue for over three years. I worked \nwith my friend, Senator Smith of Oregon, as well as my colleague \nSenator Graham of Florida, to have our bipartisan amendment adopted by \nthe managers of the bill, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin.\n  I come to the floor today as the Senate completes debate on the \nLabor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2001 to again ask the administration to get serious about addressing \nthe very real problems in the current farm worker system.\n  The amendment that was adopted into last year's Labor HHS \nappropriations bill required the Department of Labor to report to \nCongress with plans to improve compensation, working conditions, and \nother benefits for farm workers in the United States. The adopted \namendment became report language in the Labor HHS Conference Report \ndirecting the Department of Labor to deliver the administration's farm \nworker plan to Congress as soon as possible.\n  It is almost ten months since that directive was adopted by the \nentire Congress--and almost three years since I was first promised by \nSecretary of Labor Herman that such a plan was being devised--and still \nthe administration has delivered no plan. As we enter the busiest time \nof the year for American farms, once again I am\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nforced to point out the ineptitude of the Administration in dealing \nwith this critical issue.\n  The General Accounting Office completed a report in 1997 on the farm \nworker situation in our country. They said there are enough farm \nworkers. But they came to that conclusion only by counting illegal farm \nworkers.\n  Today's agricultural labor program is a disaster for both farm \nworkers and farmers. Estimates are that well over half of the farm \nworkers in this country are here illegally. They are smuggled into the \nUnited States by people called ``coyotes.'' Because they are here \nillegally, these farm workers have no power--they cannot vote. The \nillegal, but much needed, farm worker is often subjected to the worst \npossible living and working conditions imaginable. This situation is \nnothing short of immoral.\n  At the same time, the growers, who need a dependable supply of \nworkers to pick our crops, are also in a completely untenable \nsituation. Senator Smith and I represent Oregon farmers who literally \nhave no where to turn to find legal farm workers. The current situation \nturns those farmers who want to do the right thing into people who have \nto make a Hobbesian choice: do they become felons by hiring illegal \nfarm workers or do they go bankrupt.\n  It bears repeating: Well over half of the farm workers in the United \nStates are illegal immigrants.\n  Oregon farmers have told me that in meetings, with the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service and the Department of Justice, the \nAdministration has admitted that they know farmers must become felons \nby hiring illegal workers. It is deplorable that farmers are greeted by \nthe Administration with winks and nods--not a legal farm worker system.\n  In 1998, in the second session of the 105th Congress, Senator Graham, \nSenator Smith, and I put together a bipartisan proposal to change this \nwholly unacceptable system. We tried to create a new system for dealing \nwith agricultural labor that would be in the interest of both the farm \nworker and the farmer. Under our bill, workers who were legal would get \na significant increase in their benefits and farmers would be assured a \nconsistent, legal work force.\n  But after 67 Senators passed our bill, the administration refused to \nwork with us to hammer out badly needed H2A reform legislation.\n  At that point, Senators Graham, Smith, and I started alternatively \nwaiting for and asking for the Administration to produce their plan for \na new agricultural worker system that would address the legitimate \nconcerns of both farm workers and farmers.\n  In the spirit of comity and a desire to reach agreement with the \nexecutive branch, we have been waiting to see the Administration's \nplan. Mr. President, to date, after meetings, phone calls and \ncongressional directives, we have been kept waiting for more than three \nyears to see the administration's proposal.\n  By its inaction, the Administration is perpetuating a system that is \na disaster for both the farm-worker and the farmer. It is a system that \nis totally broken--a system that has condemned the vast majority of \nfarm workers to some of the most terrible and immoral conditions \nimaginable. It is a system that has made it impossible for farmers who \nwant to do the right thing.\n  Our bipartisan effort was not a good enough solution for the \nadministration. Well, the administration's inaction is not a good \nenough solution for me.\n  All of us--farm workers and growers, Senators Graham, Smith, and I--\ncontinue to wait. It is time for the administration to get off the \nsidelines. They should do what they promised to do well over two years \nago and what we, as Congress, required them to do over 10 months ago.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3706\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that those students at risk of dropping out of \n school receive appropriate attention and to ensure that all students \n     are given the support necessary to graduate from high school)\n\n       On Page 59, line 12, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That of the amount made \n     available under this heading for activities carried out \n     through the Fund for the Improvement of Education under part \n     A of title X, $10,000,000 shall be made available to enable \n     the Secretary of Education to award grants to develop and \n     implement school dropout prevention programs.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank \nSenators Specter and Harkin for agreeing to include my amendment \ndedicating $10,000,000 from the Fund for the Improvement of Education \nto support proven dropout prevention programs in the managers' package. \nAs my colleagues know, I filed an amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenators Reid, Collins, and DeWine seeking $20 million for this \npurpose. While both of these amounts fall short of the $150,000,000 \nlevel authorized in an amendment passed by the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee to the ending ESEA reauthorization bill, \nthis $10,000,000 is an important first step in supporting local efforts \nto develop, implement, and disseminate effective dropout prevention \nprograms. It is my hope that in future years we will be able to grow \nthe funds for this crucial effort in order to ensure that all schools \nwith high dropout rates have the resources and information that they \nneed to curb the high incidence of students dropping out of school.\n  Today, the lack of a high school education is a greater barrier than \never to employment, income, and advancement opportunities; though we \nfrequently talk about how strong the economy is in the United States, \nwe simply cannot overlook the fact that there are millions of working \nAmericans who have never finished high school, and they earn less than \na third of what their peers with a college degress earn.\n  High school completion rates remain distressingly low in many locales \naround the country--over 3,000 young people drop out of our high \nschools and middle schools each school day. Not surprisingly, the \nproblem is disproportionately great along racial, ethnic and \nsocioeconomic lines; Hispanic youth for instance, are nearly three \ntimes more likely to drop out than their white classmates, and African \nAmerican students are still dropping out at a rate higher than their \nwhite peers as well. As The Hispanic Dropout Project found, widespread \nmisunderstandings of the underlying causes of dropouts, combined with a \nlack of familiarity with effective programs, has prevented increased \nschool completion for some groups.\n  It is my hope that when ESEA is reauthorized, we will be able to \nfurther extend the critical support that is needed to help our at-risk \nstudents complete high school with the skills necessary for the \nworkplace or continued education. In the meantime, this commitment to \nfunding is an important step towards ensuring that all students who are \nat risk of dropping out of school receive the appropriate attention and \nsupport they need to further their learning and graduate from high \nschool. I thank my colleagues for working with me on this important \neffort.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, those who drop out of high school are at a \ngreater risk of being unemployed or holding a position with no career \nadvancement opportunities. These individuals also earn less, are more \nlikely to be poverty stricken, and received public assistance.\n  To address the dropout problem, the Department of Education \nadministers 11 programs. These programs resulted in a downward trend in \nthe national dropout rate. Nonetheless, we have what we could call the \n``dropout divide''--dropout rates in 1998 were higher for Hispanic \n(9.4%) than blacks (5.2%) and whites (3.9%).\n  This holds true in Nevada, where Hispanic students dropped out of \nschool at a higher rate than other racial/ethnic groups. In the 1996-97 \nschool year, the Hispanic dropout rate is 15.7 percent while White and \nAsian/Pacific Islander students had the lowest dropout rates at 8.3% \neach.\n  It is unacceptable that we allow students--of any race--to dropout. \nIn our new high-tech economy, education is more important than ever. It \nis the key to a happy and secure future, and we must work harder to \nmake sure that our children don't lose this valuable chance to get an \neducation. We must convince them to stay in school.\n  For Nevada, the latest numbers show that 17 percent of our school \nstudents will drop out before they get their degrees. Almost one in \nfive students in the 12th grade (19.4%) dropped out of school during \nthe 1996-97 school year,\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\ncompared with a dropout rate for 9th grade students of 3.5 percent.\n  As a member of the HELP Committee, Senator Bingaman has been a strong \nadvocate for dropout prevention programs and funding. I am pleased that \nthe Bingaman/Reid amendment--adding $10 million of funding for dropout \nprogram grants--was accepted.\n  Our role is to provide needed resources to carry out innovate \nprograms tailored to the specific circumstances encountered. This money \ngoes to states and local school districts, in grants, to finance new \ndropout prevention programs.\n  Dropout prevention programs must remain a priority for educators, \nparents, and policymakers. All students deserve an opportunity to \nreceive a quality and complete education.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3707\n\n  (Purpose: To revise the purpose of the National Institute of Child \n      Health and Human Development relating to gynecologic health)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n        national institute of child health and human development\n\n       Sec.  .

Mr. President, I rise today today with my colleagues, \nSenators DeWine, Fitzgerald, Kerry, Bingaman, Schumer and Abraham to \noffer this critical amendment to increase funding for childhood asthma \nprograms at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  For the next 15 minutes imagine breathing through a tiny straw the \nsize of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine \nsuffering through the process three to six times a day. This is asthma.\n  ``America is in the middle of an asthma epidemic--an epidemic that is \ngetting worse, not better.'' So says the PEW environmental Health \nCommission in its most recent report on asthma.\n  The prevalence of asthma continues to rise at astounding rates--every \nregion of the country and across all demographic groups, whether \nmeasured by age, race or sex. In America today, no chronic disease is \nincreasing faster than asthma. And asthma is considered the worst \nchronic health problem plaguing this nation's children. Among those \nfour years old, it has mushroomed by 160 percent over the last 2 \ndecades.\n  Asthma affects nearly 15 million Americans. That figure includes more \nthan 700,000 Illinoisans, of whom 213,000 are children under the age of \n18. Chicago has the dubious distinction of having the second highest \nrate of childhood asthma in the country. According to a study published \nby the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, of inner-city school \nchildren in Chicago, researchers found that the prevalence of diagnosed \nasthma was 10.8 percent, or twice the 5.8 percent the federal Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention estimates in that age group \nnationally. The study also found that most of the children with \ndiagnosed asthma were receiving medical care, but it may not be \nconsistent with what asthma care guidelines recommend.\n  If rates continue unchecked, a child born a generation from now will \nbe twice as likely to develop asthma as a child born today. By the end \nof this decade, if no action is taken to reverse this trend and it \ncontinues at its current pace, the PEW Commission calculates that 22 \nmillion Americans will suffer from asthma--eight million more than at \npresent. That's one in 14 Americans and one in every five families \nforced to live with the disease. By 2020, the Commission estimates that \nthe number could increase to 29 million--more than twice the current \nnumber.\n  These figures are staggering. At the current rate of growth, that \nmeans that the number of asthma cases in 2020 will exceed the projected \npopulation of New York and New Jersey combined. If by chance all asthma \nsuffers lived in one state, it would be the second most populous in the \ncountry. Put another way, if all those with asthma stood side by side, \nthey would stretch the distance between LA, California and Washington \nDC, over four times.\n  If general rates of asthma are high and getting higher, the rates are \neven worse for society's most vulnerable. Asthma disproportionately \nattacks them. A recent New York Times article described a study in the \nBrooklyn area where it was found that an astounding 38 percent of \nhomeless children suffer from asthma. Some of the factors known to \ncontribute to asthma such as poor living circumstances, exposure to \ncockroach feces, stress, exposure to dampness and mold are all \nexperienced by homeless children. They are also experienced by children \nliving in poor housing or exposed to urban violence. There are other \nfactors such as exposure to second hand smoke and smog that also \nexacerbate or trigger asthma attacks.\n\n  Not only is asthma itself on the rise but it is becoming more deadly. \nFor minorities, asthma is particularly deadly. The asthma death rate \nfor African-Americans is more than twice as high as it is for other \nsegments of the population. Nationwide, the childhood asthma-related \ndeath rate in 1993, was 3 to 4 times higher for African-Americans \ncompared to Caucasian Americans. The hospitalization rate for asthma is \nalmost three times as high among African-American children under the \nage of 5 compared to their white counterparts. Illinois has the highest \nasthma related deaths in the country for African-American men. The \nincreased disparity between death rates compared to prevalence rates \nhas been partially explained by decreased access to health care \nservices for minority children.\n  However, even though asthma rates are particularly high for children \nin poverty, they are also rising substantially for suburban children. \nOverall the rates are increasing for all groups. Everyone of us knows a \nchild whether our own, a relatives' or a friends' who suffers from \nasthma.\n  In an effort to stem the tide of this epidemic, Senator DeWine and I \nalong with 23 other Senators submitted a request to the Labor HHS \nappropriators to ask for $50 million for childhood asthma programs at \nCDC. One fifth of the money would be available for improved tracking \nand surveillance efforts for asthma, as suggested by the PEW commission \nfor environmental health. Currently, the bill does mention a specific \nallocation for asthma.\n  The amendment, which has been agreed to, provides $20 million for \nstate and community-based organizations to support asthma screening, \ntreatment, education and prevention programs and for a new surveillance \nand tracking system as called for recently by the PEW Environmental \nHealth Commission in their report ``Attack Asthma.'' Again, one fifth \nof the amount, in this case $4 million would be available for new \nsurveillance and tracking.\n  The amendment also states that these community funds may be used by \nboth health and school-based services. Many school districts, including \nthe Chicago Public Schools are involved in screening children for \nasthma and for seeing to it that they get treatment and management to \ndeal with their asthma. CDC should see to it that these new funds are \nused to coordinate local efforts and to link both school based and \nhealth facility based asthma programs. With additional resources, CDC \nshould diversify the types of programs that they fund, so that \nevaluations can be done to measure the effectiveness of these different \nprograms. Furthermore, programs need to be tailored to the individual \nneeds of localities with coordination of local services and local \nefforts to combat childhood asthma.\n  The amendment also includes a restriction on the amount that CDC may \nuse for administration or reprogramming including the 1 percent Public \nHealth Service evaluation. Both Senator DeWine and I believe that \nasthma\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\nshould be a high priority for CDC and that CDC should not seek to \nreprogram this money or use it for other purposes. Last year, CDC chose \nto disproportionately allocate rescissions to the asthma program. We \nstrongly object to that decision. At a time of an asthma epidemic, we \nbelieve that this program should be protected from such cuts. \nTherefore, this year we have included language that states that only 5 \npercent of the total amount allocated for childhood asthma programs may \nbe used for administration, evaluations, or other activities.\n  Let me tell you why we need this money. Despite the best efforts of \nthe health community, childhood asthma is becoming more common, more \ndeadly and more expensive and the effects of asthma on society are \nwidespread.\n  Most children who have asthma develop it in their first year, but it \noften goes undiagnosed. Many of you may be surprised to learn that \nasthma is the single most common reason for school absenteeism. Parents \nmiss work while caring for children with asthma. Beyond those missed \ndays at school and parents missing work, there is the huge emotional \nstress suffered by asthmatic children. It is a very frightening event \nfor a small child to be unable to breathe. A recent US News article \nquoted an 8-yr old Virginian farm girl, Madison Benner who described \nher experience with asthma. She said ``It feels like something was \nstanding on my chest when I have an asthma attack.'' This little girl \nhad drawn a picture of a floppy-eared, big footed elephant crushing a \nfrowning girl into her bed.\n  In many urban centers, over 60 percent of childhood admissions to the \nemergency room are for asthma. There are 1.8 million emergency room \nvisits each year for asthma. Yet the emergency room is hardly a place \nwhere a child and the child's parents can be educated in managing their \nasthma.\n  During a recent visit to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, I \nmet a wonderful little boy whose life is a daily fight against asthma. \nHe told me he can't always participate in gym class or even join his \nfriends on the playground. Fortunately, Nicholas is receiving the \nmedical attention necessary to manage his asthma. Yet for millions of \nchildren, this is not the case. Their asthma goes undiagnosed and \nuntreated, making trips to the emergency room as common as trips to the \ngrocery store.\n  However, we do have treatments that work for most people. Early \ndiagnosis, treatment and management are key to preventing serious \nillness and death. The National Institutes of Health is home to the \nNational Asthma Education and Prevention board. This is a large group \nof experts from all across the fields involved in health care and \nasthma. They have developed guidelines on both treating asthma and \neducating children and their parents in prevention. It is very \nimportant that when we spend money on developing such guidelines that \nthey actually get out of communities so that they can take advantage of \nthis research.\n  CDC has been working in collaboration with NIH to make sure that \nhealth professionals and others get the most up to date information. My \namendment could further help this effort by providing grantees with \nthis information.\n  One interesting new model that appears to work is the ``breathmobile' \nprogram in Los Angeles that was started 2 years ago. This program \nprovides a van that is equipped with medical personnel, asthma \neducation materials, and asthma treatment supplies. It goes out to \nareas that are known to have a high incidence of childhood asthma and \nscreens children in those areas. Children are also enrolled in the \nChildren's Health Program if they are income eligible. We have all \nheard of how slow enrollment in the children's health program has been \nand anything that we can do to speed enrollment up, I think it vitally \nimportant. This ``Breathmobile'' program has reduced trips to the \nemergency room by 17 percent in the first year of operation. I hope \nthat we can be as successful in Illinois and other parts of the \ncountry.\n  In Illinois, the Mobile CARE Foundation is setting up a program in \nChicago based on the Los Angeles initiative. In addition, the American \nAssociation of Chest Physicians has joined with other groups to form \nthe Chicago Asthma Consortium to provide asthma screening and \ntreatment. Efforts like these need our amendment.\n\n  In West Virginia, a Medicaid ``disease management'' program which \nseeks to coordinate children with asthma's care so that they get the \nvery best care has been found to be very cost effective. It has reduced \ntrips to the emergency room by 30 percent.\n  This Childhood Asthma Amendment would expand these programs to help \nensure that no child goes undiagnosed and every asthmatic child gets \nthe treatment he or she needs.\n  Last year, an additional $10 million was dedicated to start this \nprogram for a total of $11.3 million. CDC will be putting out a request \nfor proposals this summer. The $20 million agreed to here today is a \ngood start and I hope that we will be able to do better by increasing \nit to $50 million in conference. This $50 million level of funding is \nsupported by the American Lung Association, the Asthma and Allergy \nFoundation, Mothers of Asthmatics, the National Association for \nChildren's Hospitals and Research Institutions, the Academy of \nPediatrics, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and others who \nsupport children's health.\n  No child should die from asthma. We need to make sure that people \nunderstand the signs of asthma and that all asthmatic children have \naccess to treatment and information on how to lessen their exposure to \nthings that trigger asthma attacks. Funding for this program is \ncritical.\n  I am delighted that my colleague Senator Specter has agreed to accept \nthis amendment to nearly double the funding level for this important \npublic health effort. I hope that he will work with me in conference to \nincrease this level of funding to as close as possible to the $50 \nmillion originally requested by myself and 23 of my Senate colleagues. \nAgain I thank my colleagues Specter and Harkin for recognizing the \nimportance of this issue to the nation's children.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3709\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and \n   Prevention to provide for the adequate funding of State and local \n         immunization infrastructure and operations activities)\n\n       On page 54, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this title for the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, $37,500,000, to be utilized to provide grants to \n     States and political subdivisions of States under section 317 \n     of the Public Health Service Act to enable such States and \n     political subdivisions to carry out immunization \n     infrastructure and operations activities: Provided, That of \n     the total amount made available in this Act for \n     infrastructure funding for the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, not less than 10 percent shall be used for \n     immunization projects in areas with low or declining \n     immunization rates or areas that are particularly susceptible \n     to disease outbreaks, and not more than 14 percent shall be \n     used to carry out the incentive bonus program: Provided, That \n     amounts made available under this Act for the administrative \n     and related expenses of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, the Department of Labor, and the Department of \n     Education shall be further reduced on a pro rata basis by \n     $37,500,000.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nregarding childhood immunization. Remarkable advances in the science of \nvaccine development and widespread immunization efforts have led to a \nsubstantial reduction in the incidence of infectious disease. Today, as \nyou know, national vaccination coverage is at record high levels. \nSmallpox has been eradicated; polio has been eliminated from the \nWestern Hemisphere; and cases of measles have been reduced to record \nlows.\n  Still, the job is not done and it is important that we remain \nvigilant. Every day, nearly 11,000 infants are born and each baby will \nneed up to 22 doses of vaccine by age two. New vaccines continue to \nenter the market. And although a significant proportion of the general \npopulation may be fully immunized at a given time, coverage rates in \nthe United States are uneven and life-threatening disease outbreaks do \noccur. In fact, recent data from the CDC indicate that coverage rates \nmay be leveling off and that in many areas of the country, including \nChicago, Houston, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota and New Mexico, \nthey are actually declining.\n  At the same time, funding to states and localities for immunization \ndelivery activities has also been dramatically reduced over the past \nfive years.\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\nStates are now struggling to maintain immunization rates and have \nimplemented severe cuts to immunization activities. Many have already \nreduced clinic hours, canceled contracts with providers, suspended \nregistry development and implementation, limited outreach efforts and \ndiscontinued performance monitoring.\n  Last week, the Institute of Medicine issued a landmark report on the \nstate of our Nation's immunization infrastructure. This report \nconfirmed that the situation requires immediate attention. The IOM in \nits report stated:\n\n       The combination of new challenges and reduced resources has \n     led to instability in the public health infrastructure that \n     supports the U.S. immunization system. Many states have \n     reduced the scale of their immunization programs and \n     currently lack adequate strength in areas such as data \n     collection among at-risk populations, strategic planning, \n     program coordination, and assessment of immunization status \n     in communities that are served by multiple health care \n     providers. If unmet immunization needs are not identified and \n     addressed, states will have difficulty in achieving the \n     national goal of 90 percent coverage by year 2010 for \n     completion of childhood vaccination series for young \n     children. Furthermore, state and national coverage rates, \n     which reached record levels for vaccines in widespread use \n     (79 percent in 1998), can be expected to decline and \n     preventable disease outbreaks may occur as a result, \n     particularly among persons who are vulnerable to vaccine-\n     preventable disease because of their undervaccination status.\n\n  The amendment I am offering today with my colleagues Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, Senator Jack Reed, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator \nJohn Kerry addresses the recommendations of the IOM and responds to the \nissues raised by state and local immunization program administrators \nwho are struggling to reach underserved children. The provision does \nthree things: First, it provides a $37.5 million increase in \nimmunization grant funding to state and local programs for immunization \ninfrastructure activities in FY 2001, bringing the total funding for \ninfrastructure up from $139 million to $176.5 million. Second, it \nlimits to 14 percent the amount of the total that can be spent for \nincentive grants to states. Third, it targets 10 percent of the total \ninfrastructure funding to areas with low or declining immunization \nrates and areas susceptible to outbreaks.\n  While $37.5 million is a good start, additional funding is needed. \nThe IOM recommends a $75 million increase in the annual federal share \nof funding to states for immunization programs. This number was derived \nfrom 3 calculations: (1) annual state expenditure levels during the \nmid-1990's; (2) the level of spending necessary to provide additional \nresources to states with high levels of need without reducing current \naward levels for each state; and (3) additional infrastructure \nrequirements associated with adjusting to anticipated changes and \nincreased complexity in the immunization schedule. Dozens of \norganizations support this level of funding, including Research. \nAmerica, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the March of Dimes, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, the Association of State and Territorial \nHealth Officials, Every Child by Two, and many others.\n  I intend to work with my colleagues on the Committee and in the \nSenate to increase this funding level by an additional $37.5 million in \nFY 2002 in order to reach the level recommended by the IOM.\n  The 317 immunization grant program to states and localities for \n``infrastructure and operations'' is the sole source of Federal support \nfor many critical activities, including: immunization registries; \noutreach efforts to educate parents about the value and importance of \nvaccines as well as the risks and possible side effects; training and \neducation of providers to ensure timely vaccinations and keep them \nupdated about the routine schedule including changes resulting from the \naddition of new vaccines; outbreak control and monitoring and \ninvestigating disease occurrence; identifying under immunized children \nand development of strategies to overcome barriers to vaccination; \nlinking immunization activities with other public health services such \nas the WIC program; and evaluations of immunization strategies to \ndetermine what works.\n  While overall funding to the Centers for Disease Control's \nimmunization program has actually seen slight increases, the grant \nprogram to States and localities has dramatically declined over the \npast 5 years. Actual appropriations levels have gone from $271 million \nin FY1995 to $208 million in FY 96 to $139 million in FY2000. But the \nstory is even worse. The measles outbreak of the late 1980's and early \n1990's prompted Congress to give states hefty funding increases. \nUnfortunately, the states were not immediately prepared for the influx \nof funds. Money was ``carried over'' from one year to the next as they \nworked through barriers such as computer acquisitions, legislative \napprovals and hiring freezes. This carryover has compensated for the \ndramatic reductions in funding that followed. Now there is no more \ncarryover money to pick up the slack. So while actual appropriations \nhave declined by about $68 million since 1996, states are experiencing \nreductions of 50 percent or more in the same time period. As a result, \nstates are struggling to maintain immunization rates and have \nimplemented severe cuts to immunization activities. Many have already \nreduced clinic hours, canceled contracts with providers, suspended \nregistry development and implementation, limited outreach efforts and \ndiscontinued performance monitoring. An increase of $75 million will \nbarely get states back up to the funding levels they were experiencing \nin 1998.\n  The amendment also limits the amount that can be allocated for \nincentive grants to 14 percent of the total infrastructure funding. \nHistorically, Senate report language has included a formula to reward \nareas that achieved high coverage levels and set aside $33 million out \nof the state infrastructure money to pay for this incentive. When this \nwas first put in place in 1994, this amount represented approximately \n14 percent of all grant funding available. Now, because the total \nfunding has decreased, the percentage is equal to about 25 percent of \nthe total. Because the overall base funding has decreased (from $271 \nmillion in FY95 to $139 million), the incentive allocation is eating up \na greater share of total infrastructure funding pulling money away \nfrom project areas that have lower immunization rates. In addition, \nbecause immunization rates have gone up, nearly every state gets some \nincentive money--but it is no longer considered an ``incentive'' by the \nstates. Rather, states use the money to offset recent decreases in 317 \nfederal grant funding. As a result, this ``incentive'' that has \nhistorically been included in the Senate Appropriations report is no \nlonger achieving its intended effect. Quite simply, the advantage of \nawarding funds as incentives, rewarding successful immunization \nprograms, has decreased as total funding has decreased. Those grantees \nwith the lowest coverage levels and most in need are receiving less \nfunding than those who have already achieved high coverage levels.\n\n  To address this issue, this amendment would limit the percentage of \ntotal funding that can be used for incentive money to the percentage it \nrepresented when it was first implemented. No state will experience a \nreduction in funds.\n  I also want to note that the House Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations \nreport included language, which I strongly support, asking the CDC to \nreport back to Congress regarding the utility of this incentive program \nand recommending a mechanism to phase it out if it is not found to be \nachieving its intended purpose. It is my hope that the Senate will \nagree to this language in conference.\n  The amendment also targets 10 percent of total infrastructure funding \nto areas of the country with low or declining immunization rates. Even \nwith significant gains in national immunization rates, subpopulations \nof underimmunized children still exist. Rates in many of the Nation's \nurban areas, including Chicago and Houston, are unacceptably low and \ngetting lower. These pockets of need create pools of susceptible \nchildren and increase the risk of dangerous disease outbreaks. The IOM \nreport highlights the fact that disparities in levels of immunization \ncoverage still exist. National surveys reveal a gap of 9 percentage \npoints between children above and below the federal poverty level. \nTargeting just 10 percent of the total amount, as IOM recommends, will \nhelp CDC respond to unexpected outbreaks, gaps in immunization \ncoverage, or other exceptional circumstances within the states.\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will provide \nadditional funds to every single state. No state loses money. In this \nday and age, it is simply not acceptable that more than one million \nchildren have not been adequately vaccinated. Vaccines are one of the \nmost cost-effective tools we have in preventing disease. For every \ndollar spent on vaccines, society saves up to $24 in medical and \nsocietal costs. Controlling vaccine-preventable disease has been one of \nthe most significant public health accomplishments of the 20th Century. \nBut current success does not guarantee future success. And there is \nstill much work to be done.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nDurbin on an amendment to restore funding to one of our most \naccomplished public health initiatives, our national immunization \nprogram.\n  The purpose of the amendment is quite simple--it seeks to strengthen \nand enhance the operations and infrastructure grants administered by \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Section 317 \nimmunization program.\n  These monies fund a variety of essential programs and services within \nthe immunization program for children, including outreach efforts to \neducate parents about the immunization schedule, training and education \nof providers about new vaccines and outbreak control when cases of \ninfectious diseases arise. The CDC's operation and infrastructure \ngrants also support vital initiatives to identify under-immunized \nchildren, provide resources necessary to implement and maintain state-\nbased immunization registries and allow the state immunization program \nto forge linkages with other public health services, such as WIC and \nHead Start, since these places are often points of entry for low-income \nchildren who may lack all or some of the recommended vaccinations.\n  Originally, Senator Durbin and I had intended to offer an amendment \nthat would add a total of $75 million for the CDC Section 317 \noperations and infrastructure grant program. We have modified our \namendment so that it now calls for a $37.5 million increase in funding \nfor these grants this year with the understanding that Chairman Specter \nhas agreed to work to provide additional $37.5 million in FY 2002 for \nthis grant program. I would thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member \nfor agreeing to accept this important amendment.\n  Numerous public health and provider groups including the National \nAssociation of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), the \nAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and every Child by Two, just to name a \nfew support our amendment.\n  Since the advent of the polio vaccine in 1955, the United States has \ninvested in a national immunization campaign to rid the population of \ndevastating diseases such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria and measles.\n  The CDC Section 317 program has been an integral part of our national \nimmunization initiative. The Section 317 program can be broken down \ninto two main categories--(1) vaccine purchase and (2) infrastructure \nto facilitate the delivery and monitoring of vaccines. The Section 317 \nprogram is the only source of critical federal funding to support the \ninfrastructure necessary to administer immunizations to children in \ncommunities throughout the country.\n  A little over a week ago, the Institute of Medicine released their \nreport on immunization finance policies and practices. This report was \nconducted at the request of the Senate Appropriations Committee and \nmore specifically by our colleague Senator Dale Bumpers, a long-time \nchampion of the immunization program.\n  This landmark report offers us many important insights into the \ncomplex federal-state-local partnership that makes up our national \nimmunization initiative. The report found that although average \nimmunization coverage levels are at record highs, several problems \ncontinue to plague the program, while even greater challenges lie \nahead. The issues threaten the great success we have achieved in \nessentially eradicating deadly and debilitating diseases that were \nprevalent in this country a relatively short time ago. Many of these \nsame diseases continue to strike children in developing nations \nthroughout the world.\n\n  According to the IOM report, one of the greatest challenges currently \nfacing our immunization program is the persistent disparities in \ncoverage that exist among and within states, as well as within major \ncities.\n  The 1998 National Immunization Survey (NIS) found a gap of between 7 \nand 8.6 percent between the immunization rates for non-Hispanic white \nchildren and those of Hispanic and African-American children for one of \nthe most important series of immunizations. Disparities in immunization \nlevels also fall along the poverty line. For the same series, National \nImmunization Survey found a 9 percentage point difference between the \nimmunization rates for children living below the poverty level compared \nto those at or above the poverty line.\n  These disparities in coverage are often found in concentrations of \nun-immunized and under-immunized children who typically reside in urban \nareas as well as in certain rural areas. These areas are also referred \nto as `pockets of need'.\n  Our investments in the immunization program thus far have yielded \ngreat benefits in terms of improving the health of children, as well as \nproducing significant health care cost savings. For example, for every \ndollar spent on the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine, $10.30 in \nsavings were captured in terms of direct medical costs and $13.50 in \nindirect societal costs, such as lost work time, disability and death.\n  While great progress has been made in boosting immunization coverage \nnationally, we are at a point where it will require additional \nresources in order to reach those remaining children who have not been \nimmunized. In other words, reaching these remaining un-immunized and \nunder-immunized children in `pockets of need' areas, will require more \neffort and more resources.\n  Another significant problem outlined in the IOM report is the, ``The \nrepetitive ebb and flow cycles in the distribution of public resources \nfor immunization programs . . .'' Federal funding for the immunization \nprogram has been volatile, particularly over the past decade.\n  To give my colleagues some background, the federal government began \nto pay greater attention to the need to support and strengthen our \nimmunization program after a measles outbreak struck several parts of \nthe U.S. in 1989-1990. Following the epidemic, the CDC launched a \nnational initiative designed to strengthen state immunization programs \nand provide resources for a broad array of direct services and \noutreach. The goal of this effort was to strengthen and enhance our \ncapacity to monitor immunization levels and improve our ability to \nrespond to disease outbreaks.\n  During that period, federal funding for infrastructure grants \nincreased seven-fold from a total of $37 million in 1990 to $271 \nmillion in 1995. However, states were not immediately prepared for the \ndramatic funding increases and the expansion of immunization delivery \nsystems at the state level took time. As a result, funds were ``carried \nover'' from one year to the next as states prepared to make the capital \ninvestments necessary to strengthen critical areas of \ntheir immunization program, such as vaccine delivery, outreach into \nunderserved areas and improvements in monitoring through the \ndevelopment of state-based immunization registries.\n\n  However, as the threat of another disease outbreak faded, carry-over \nfund balances grew and pressure to reduce federal discretionary \nspending intensified here in Congress. What happened as a result was an \nalmost 50 percent decline in funding, and for the past two years, the \nCDC infrastructure grant program has been level funded at $139 million.\n  For the past few years, states have been using remaining carry-over \nfunds to cover expenses that could not be met by their new award. The \nestimated FY 2001 figures indicate that most states have exhausted \ntheir carry-over funding and must rely solely on their new grant award \nto finance their operations.\n  This cut has seriously eroded states' ability to develop and \nimplement program innovations and threatened their capacity to \nadminister vaccines. These reductions over the past several years\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\nhave also forced states to scale back on other important activities \nsuch as community outreach, parental and physician education and the \ndevelopment and operation of registries.\n  This reduction in the operations and infrastructure grant awards has \nhad a significant impact on my home state of Rhode Island. My state has \ngone from a high of approximately $3 million to a low of $500,000 in \njust four years. These kinds of swings in funding make it virtually \nimpossible for a state to administer its program, let alone plan ahead \nfor the future.\n  And these dramatic declines have not only happened in my state--they \nhave happened in virtually every state in the country.\n  Fortunately, my state has been extremely successful thus far in \nexpanding immunization coverage rates in the nation (89%). However, \ncontinued vigilance is necessary to maintain coverage rates in states \nlike Rhode Island, while additional effort and resources are required \nto bring up immunization rates in areas like Chicago (69%) and Houston \n(56%).\n  Mr. President, we must remain diligent and focused on our \nimmunization goals and invest in the tools necessary to protect our \nchildren. This additional funding will help to achieve that end by \nrestoring immunization grant awards to a level that will enable states \nto carry out critical program activities. As I mentioned before, our \namendment would add $37.5 million over two years to the CDC operations \nand infrastructure grant program.\n  The IOM report makes clear that our immunization system is at a \ncritical juncture, and I am pleased that Chairman Specter and Ranking \nMember Harkin have agreed to accept our amendment because we should not \nwait for a serious outbreak to a vaccine-preventable disease to address \nthe shortfall in the CDC immunization program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3710\n\n   (Purpose: To require that contracts for the care of research NIH \n   chimpanzees be awarded to contractors that comply with the Animal \n                              Welfare Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following: ``None of the \n     funds appropriated under this Act shall be expended by the \n     National Institutes of Health on a contract for the care of \n     the 288 chimpanzees acquired by the National Institutes of \n     Health from the Coulston Foundation, unless the contractor is \n     accredited by the Association for the Assessment and \n     Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International or has \n     a Public Health Services assurance, and has not been charged \n     multiple times with egregious violations of the Animal \n     Welfare Act.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the Senate \nmanagers for including my amendment in the managers' package. This \namendment relates to the Request for Proposals (RFP) recently issued by \nthe National Institutes of Health for the care of 288 chimpanzees \nrecently acquired by NIH from The Coulston Foundation. The Coulston \nFoundation, an animal research facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico, has \na very troubling record of animal care, and has been investigated and \ncharged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture numerous times for \negregious violations of the Animal Welfare Act relating to the deaths \nof several chimpanzees and other primates. At least 14 chimpanzees and \n4 monkeys have died at the lab in the past seven years, due to \nnegligence and a lack of appropriate veterinary care.\n  Last August, following the deaths of several chimpanzees at Coulston, \nUSDA ordered the lab to halve its chimpanzee colony, leading to the \ntransfer of 288 chimps to NIH. However, the transfer was in title only. \nFor the time being, the chimpanzees will remain in Coulston's physical \npossession, in direct defiance of the spirit and intent of the USDA \norder.\n  I am eager, therefore, for NIH to proceed with its RFP to secure the \nservices of an entity that can provide high quality care for the 288 \nchimpanzees. The easiest way to ensure this is to insist that bidders \nfor the contract be accredited by the Association for the Assessment \nand Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International, or AAALAC. \nAAALAC is a private, internationally recognized accrediting body. Its \nstamp of approval guarantees that a laboratory provides high standards \nof care to its animals. AAALAC accreditation is often required in \nPublic Health Service (PHS) contracts and, in fact, is strongly based \non strict compliance with NIH's own Guide for the Care and Use of \nLaboratory Animals. In 1994, NIH made a site visit to The Coulston \nFoundation, and recommended that Coulston achieve AAALAC accreditation \nwithin 3-5 years. That was six years ago, and Coulston is still not \naccredited by this international organization, despite applying.\n  Although I would expect that any entity selected by NIH to receive \nthis contract would be highly qualified and therefore AAALAC-\naccredited, bidders for the contract that are not accredited may \ndemonstrate their qualifications by holding a valid PHS Animal Welfare \nAssurance. In theory, an Animal Welfare Assurance shows that a \nlaboratory is compliant with the federal Animal Welfare Act and PHS \npolicy on animal care. Sometimes these assurances are restricted. For \ninstance, Coulston's assurance is restricted because of its poor animal \ncare record. However, it is still considered valid.\n  I think it is important to stress that the recipient of NIH's \ncontract should have a good record of animal welfare and should be \ncompliant with federal animal welfare laws. As such, I have included \nlanguage in my amendment which states that NIH cannot give its contract \nto a facility that has been charged multiple times with egregious \nviolations of the Animal Welfare Act, as is the case with The Coulston \nFoundation. These animals can live to 50, even 60 years of age, and are \nvery similar to humans in many ways. We should make certain that they \nreceive the level of care appropriate to them. The amendment which I am \noffering will address these concerns. I would like to thank the \nmanagers for working out this language and for supporting my amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT No. 3711\n\n (Purpose: To Provide an additional $800,000 for technology and media \n                   services and to provide an offset)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA SERVICES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act--\n       (1) the total amount appropriated under this title under \n     the heading ``Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative \n     Services'' under the heading ``special education'' to carry \n     out the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act shall be \n     $7,353,141,000, of which $35,323,000 shall be available for \n     technology and media services; and\n       (2) the total amount appropriated under this title under \n     the heading ``Departmental Management'' under the heading \n     ``program administration'' shall be further reduced by \n     $800,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Spector, and \nthe Ranking member, Senator Harkin, for accepting an amendment I have \nproposed to S. 2553, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, and related agencies appropriation bill for fiscal year \n2001. This amendment provides an additional $800,000 for the Technology \nand Media Services section of the Department of Education \nappropriation. The funds allocated to Technology and Media Services are \ncrucially important because they are used to make competitive awards to \nsupport the development, demonstration, and use of technology and \neducation media activities of value to children with disabilities.\n  In that regard, the National Theatre of the Deaf (NTD) has a long and \nworthy history as an organization dedicated to helping deaf and hard-\nof-hearing children and adults achieve their fullest potential. In \n1967, the NTD was created with the assistance of the Department of \nEducation to support educational and artistic programs for the deaf \ncommunity. With strong and enduring support from the Congress, the NTD \nhas developed an innovative training program and seasonal workshop \nseries to foster the growth of a unique form of theater. Presented in \nboth American Sign Language and spoken English, NTD performance have \nexpanded the boundaries of theatrical expression and made an original \ncontribution to professional theater while simultaneously building \nbridges between the hearing and non-hearing communities. The NTD has \nrepeatedly won recognition for it's work over the last 33 years, \nincluding a Tony Award. The NTD has touched over 3.5 million people \nthrough local, national and international live performances, and \nmillions more through televised specials. As a result of the massive \nsuccess of the NTD , more than 40 similar Theaters of the Deaf have \nsprung up worldwide.\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\n  Unfortunately, in fiscal year 2000, the NTD was not funded by the \nDepartment of Education, an unintended consequence of modifications \nmade by Congress to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in \n1997. I have no reason to believe that the Congress is any less \nsupportive of the National Theater of the Deaf today than it has been \nfor the last 33 years. It is the intent of the amendment that I offer \ntoday to provide the Department of Education with sufficient means to \nfund an additional competitive grant from the Special Education \nTechnology and Media Services program.\n  Once again, I am grateful to the Chairman and Ranking Member for \naccepting this amendment and, I think I speak for our colleagues in \nthanking them for their continued support for the deaf and hard-of-\nhearing community in our country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like to commend the Senator from Connecticut for \nbringing this amendment to our attention. While the amount requested in \nthis amendment is a modest sum, it will make a major difference to an \nimportant community in this country. I look forward to working with the \nSenator from Connecticut as this matter moves to conference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my \nChairman and that of the Senator from Connecticut, particularly with \nregard to the important role that the National Theater of the Deaf has \nplayed over the last 33 years.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues \nSenator Specter and Senator Harkin for including an amendment I have \noffered to increase funding for the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of the managers' \npackage. My amendment would provide an increase of $2.5 million for the \nOffice of Civil Rights to protect the civil rights of Americans. I want \nto take a moment to explain why I believe this funding increase is so \nimportant.\n  The Office of Civil Rights at HHS has the responsibility to enforce \ncivil rights laws in the health and human service setting throughout \nthe United States. What does this mean? Essentially, the Office of \nCivil Rights oversees anyone who receives funding from HHS--hospitals, \nmanaged care organizations, nursing homes, and social service agencies \namong others--to ensure they are complying with civil rights statutes. \nAlthough it enforces a wide array of civil right laws, the bulk of \nOCR's efforts center around enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, which addresses discrimination in federally funded \nprograms, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  The civil rights challenges that confront OCR continue to grow. A few \nof the issues the office is focusing on include racial and ethnic \ndisparities in health; ensuring that individuals with disabilities \navoid unnecessary institutionalization and can live in their \ncommunities; and fighting discrimination among minorities and \nindividuals with disabilities in managed care.\n  It seems to me that this office already has a pretty big workload. \nWell, it is about to become much larger. In addition to the important \nefforts the OCR currently works on, this office will soon be \nresponsible for implementing and enforcing the proposed medical privacy \nregulations. The administration has been required to establish \nsafeguards to protect personal medical information of Americans because \nthis Congress missed its own self-imposed deadline. If we're not going \nto do our job in Congress, we should at least support the Office that \nwill have to do it for us.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act (HIPAA). This legislation set a self-imposed \ndeadline for Congress to pass comprehensive medical privacy legislation \nby August 1999. If Congress was unable to meet the deadline, the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services was required \nby law to establish medical privacy protection through regulation. \nSecretary Shalala issued her draft regulations last fall and there was \na public comment period that extended until this past February. \nCurrently, HHS is working to finalize the draft regulations which \nshould be issued later this year.\n  I have been on this Senate floor countless times to talk about the \nneed to establish privacy protections for personal medical information. \nIt angers me that this Congress could not even move privacy protections \nthrough the committee process, let alone, to actually have a debate on \nthis critical issue before the full Senate. We couldn't do the job on \nour own and we have instead shifted the responsibility to the \nadministration. This Congress has the responsibility to protect the \nprivacy of Americans--and that includes the protection of their medical \nrecords. The place for these protections is in legislation--not \nregulation. But that's not the issue right now. The issue before us is \nthe need to adequately fund the office that will have the sole \nresponsibility for enforcing these essential privacy protections.\n  The FY 2000 Budget for the Office of Civil Rights is $22 million. \nThis figure has remained unchanged since 1980. I find this hard to \nbelieve. The Office has seen its enforcement responsibilities increase \ndramatically with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nand other major legislation. Add the impending implementation of the \nmedical records privacy regulation and it becomes clear that this \nbudget must come in line with the current times and allow the Office to \ndo what they must--protect the civil rights of Americans.\n  This additional funding provided in this amendment will help the \nOffice of Civil Rights do the job we have asked them to do. I do not \nthink this increase is nearly enough. However, I recognize that we have \nlimited funds for a wide range of important programs. I am hopeful that \nthis will be the first of many steps to increase the resources for this \noffice. Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their support of this \namendment and for their support of the important work of this \noffice.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the increase in funding \nfor the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human \nServices. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) enforces civil rights laws \nin health and human services settings. OCR oversees hospitals, managed \ncare organizations, nursing homes, social service agencies--literally \nany state, local, or private agency that receives HHS funding, to \nensure compliance with civil rights laws.\n  In the next year, OCR will be responsible for enforcing several \ninitiatives of real importance to me and to health care consumers \nacross America. First, OCR will be responsible for enforcing the \nlandmark health information privacy regulations. These regulations will \nprovide consumers with protections against the inappropriate disclosure \nof their health information. Indeed, Americans are concerned about\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\nwho gets to see and use their personal medical information. Privacy is \nthe first defense against discrimination on the basis of health \nstatus--an issue I know a lot about through my work on the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act.\n  One of OCR'S other top priorities in the coming year is to enforce \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by working with states and \nadvocates to develop programs to enable people with disabilities to \nlive in community-based settings, as required by the Supreme Court's \nOlmstead decision. Just last year, in L.C. v. Olmstead, the Supreme \nCourt held that state Medicaid programs must comply with the ADA's \nintegration mandate. The Court held that under the ADA, people with \ndisabilities have the right to be included in our communities, not \nsegregated behind the closed doors of institutions and excluded from \nthe mainstream. This decision means that unjustified isolation now \nproperly is regarded as discrimination when it is based on disability.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has already taken steps \nto ensure that states comply with the Supreme Court's decision. The \nDepartment sent a letter to state Medicaid directors and others \nemphasizing the Court's suggestion that states develop a comprehensive \nplan for placing qualified individuals with disabilities in less \nrestrictive settings and ensure that their waiting lists for community-\nbased services move at a reasonable pace that is not controlled by the \nstate's endeavors to keep its institutions fully populated.\n  This so-called ``Olmstead Letter'' is a great first step. However, a \nlaw is only as effective as its enforcement, and that is why OCR is so \nimportant to the civil rights of people with disabilities. This new \nfunding will help OCR to ensure that as we approach the ADA's 10th \nanniversary next month, the ADA will continue to have a very real \neffect on the daily lives of people with disabilities and their ability \nto live and participate in their communities.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3716\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount of funds made available for activities \n       that improve the quality of infant and toddler child care)\n\n       On page 40, line 5, strike ``$60,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$100,000,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3717\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funding to provide assistance for poison \n  prevention and to stabilize the funding of regional poison control \n                                centers)\n\n       On page 54, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) In addition to amounts made available under \n     the heading ``Health Resources and Services Administration-\n     Health Resources and Services'' for poison prevention and \n     poison control center activities, there shall be available an \n     additional $20,000,000 to provide assistance for such \n     activities and to stabilize the funding of regional poison \n     control centers as provided for pursuant to the Poison \n     Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act (Public Law 106-\n     174).\n       (b) Amounts made available under this Act for the \n     administrative and related expenses of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the \n     Department of Education shall be reduced further on a pro \n     rata basis by $20,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Chairman of the \nLabor, Health, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nSpecter, and the Ranking Member, Senator Harkin, for their support of \nour Nation's poison control centers. Because of their help, the \nappropriations bill we pass will contain a sound investment in these \ncenters.\n  Mr. President, many of us--as parents--have experienced the \nterrifying situation when a child accidently swallows something \npotentially toxic. Fortunately, poison control centers are in place to \nfield poison-related phone calls and to offer parents and everyone \nvaluable medical advice when these types of emergencies arise. \nAdditionally, the professionals at the centers provide education and \ntraining to the public to help prevent poisonings. Without a doubt, \npoison control centers offer vital health services.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation that I sponsored along \nwith 34 of my colleagues--and the President signed it into law--which \nauthorizes $27.6 million to be used to fund a national toll-free number \nto ensure access to poison control center services; a nationwide media \ncampaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison \nprevention; and a grant program to: (1) Help certified regional poison \ncontrol centers achieve financial stability; (2) Prevent poisonings; \n(3) Provide treatment recommendations for poisonings; and (4) Improve \npoison control center services.\n  Last year, I worked with Senator Specter, to include $3 million in \nFY2000 for the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to initiate planning \nfor the national toll-free number and to begin assisting the local \npoison control centers' other efforts. Because of that initial \ninvestment, the national toll-free number will be fully operational by \nSeptember 30th of this year. The new toll-free number will provide easy \naccess to poison control services no matter where you are in the \ncountry by directing calls to the local poison control center closest \nto you.\n  To ensure that the local centers can maintain current operations and \nhandle increases in calls resulting from the new toll-free number, the \ncenters must be funded at an adequate level. The investment this bill \nmakes will help poison control centers continue providing essential \nservices to parents and to the public now and in the future.\n  Investing in poison control centers just makes good economic sense. \nDo you realize that for every dollar spent on poison control center \nservices, we can save $7 dollars in medical costs? The average cost of \na poisoning exposure call to a poison control center is $31.28. The \naverage cost of using other health care system options, like emergency \nroom services, for example, is $932 dollars.\n  Each year, the Central Ohio Poison Center handles more than 66,000 \ncalls, and the Cincinnati Poison Center handles about 78,000 calls. \nAccording to Dr. Marcel Casavant--medical director for the Central Ohio \nPoison Center and emergency department physician at Columbus Children's \nHospital--the Central Ohio Poison Center refers callers to their \ndoctors or to an emergency department about 10 percent of the time. The \nother 90 percent of cases don't usually require a trip to the emergency \nroom and can be treated and monitored right at home with treatment \nadvice provided by poison control professionals. Poison control centers \nsave lives and save money by offering immediate treatment advice. They \nhelp keep patients from calling 911 or going to emergency rooms \nunnecessarily, while offering immediate treatment advice to callers.\n  Throughout the United States each year, more than two million \npoisonings are reported to poison control centers. More than 90 percent \nof these poisonings happen in the home, and over 50 percent of \npoisoning victims are children younger than six years of age. My own \npersonal experience with poison control centers occurred two years ago, \nwhen our granddaughter, Isabelle, who was two years old at the time, \nfell into a bucket of bubble solution as we were wrapping up our annual \nIce Cream Social at our home in Cedarville, Ohio. We feared that \nIsabelle may have swallowed some of the solution, since she was covered \nwith it from head to toe.\n  My sister-in-law, who is a nurse, immediately called the poison \ncontrol center to determine whether Isabelle had swallowed a poisonous \nsubstance. We were very lucky. The professional at the local poison \ncontrol center told us immediately what to do and explained that we \nneeded to rinse Isabelle off and have her drink several glasses of \nwater to flush the solution through her system. But for the quick \nresponse of that local poison control center, we would probably have \nended up taking Isabelle to the emergency room needlessly.\n  My friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham, also had his \nown personal experience with a poison center. In 1999, he and his wife \nwere at home and spotted their toddler son, Spencer, with an open \nbottle of allergy medicine. They immediately called the poison center. \nThe Abrahams, too, were very lucky. As it turned out, little Spencer \nhadn't swallowed more than an ounce, so the poison center staff \nrecommended that his parents just monitor him at home through the \nnight.\n  While poisonings very often affect children, adults also face \nsituations necessitating information and help from\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\npoison control centers. The centers provide services for adults who \nhave been exposed to potentially poisonous or toxic substances. Take \nthe example of what occurred in Marysville, Ohio. Thirty workers in a \nmanufacturing plant in Marysville were victims of gas exposure. Twenty \nof these workers went to Union Memorial Hospital. The hospital \ncontacted the poison center, after which these patients were given \noxygen and later discharged that same day. Ten others went to a \ndifferent hospital which did not call a poison center. These patients \nwere not released until the next day, even though their symptoms did \nnot differ from the other 20 workers.\n  Because the local poison centers cover a lot of area and handle a \nlarge number of exposure cases, they can help identify trends and \npatterns of exposure which might not otherwise be recognized by \nindividual health care providers. The organized network of poison \ncenters facilitates instant communication of public health concerns, as \nwell as effective methods of treatment. For example, in 1993, an Oregon \nPoison Center staff member noticed a cluster of symptomatic callers who \nhad all used an aerosol leather protector. Subsequent investigation \nrevealed similar cases in the preceding four days. Immediate \nnotification of other centers confirmed cases in other states. Contact \nwith the manufacturer and subsequent product removal occurred within \nonly four hours.\n  Here's another example: On January 28, 1998, there was a nationwide \nrecall of a popular snack cake due to possible asbestos contamination. \nThis recall resulted in about 1000 calls to one poison center in Ohio, \nwith similar numbers of calls to poison centers in Illinois, Indiana, \nand Missouri. The poison centers were able to reassure callers about \nthe low toxicity of small oral ingestion of asbestos and referred \ncallers to the company's customer service number.\n  Despite their obvious value, poison control centers have been \nseriously under-funded. The centers have been financed through unstable \narrangements from a variety of public and private sources. Over the \nlast two decades, there has been a steady decline in the number of \npoison control centers in the United States. In 1978, there were more \nthan 600 poison control centers nationwide. Today, there are fewer than \n75--of which, only 53 are certified. Since 1991, six centers in Ohio \nhave closed, leaving only three in current operation.\n  This trend has jeopardized the ability of the remaining poison \ncontrol centers nationwide to provide immediate, around-the-clock \nservice to all Americans. As a result, more emergency rooms are likely \nto be visited by anxious parents who fear their children were \naccidentally poisoned. This is a trend that is increasing the total \ncost of treating poisonings and increasing the risk of accidental \ninjury or death.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleagues have agreed to take \nthings to the next level and are providing a substantial investment in \nthese centers. This investment will help bring stability to our \nnation's poison control centers and bring peace of mind to parents.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3718\n\n    (Purpose: To increase funds for the National Program of Cancer \n                              Registries)\n\n       On page 27, line 24, before the period insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That in addition to amounts \n     made available under this heading for the National Program of \n     Cancer Registries, an additional $15,000,000 shall be made \n     available for such Program and special emphasis in carrying \n     out such Program shall be given to States with the highest \n     number of the leading causes of cancer mortality: Provided \n     further, That amounts made available under this Act for the \n     administrative and related expenses of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention shall be reduced by \n     $15,000,000''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3719\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the rights of residents of certain health care \n                              facilities)\n\n       On page 92, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Anyone \nwho has ever visited one has seen the overcrowding and the poor \ncondition of the facilities; crumbling foundations, leaky roofs, \nexposed wiring, and many other safety hazards were in fact recently \nestimated to require $120 million in repairs.\n  The $5,000,000 supplemental to the Title III Strengthening Tribal \nColleges and Universities funding recommended by the committee will \nprovide some relief to the inadequate and unsafe conditions at many of \nthe Tribal Colleges and Universities and hopefully will help the \ninstitutions leverage additional private funds. However, we know the \nneeds are extremely great, and hope that the Congress will sustain and \nexpand this commitment of federal resources to aid these schools which \nplay such a key role in the education of our Native American \npopulations.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3725\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the impacts of \n                    the Balanced Budget Act of 1997)\n\n       On page 54, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

While Congress intended to cut approximately \n     $100,000,000,000 from the medicare program over 5 years, \n     recent estimates put the actual cut at over $200,000,000,000.\n       (2) A recent study on home health care found that nearly 70 \n     percent of hospital discharge planners surveyed reported a \n     greater difficulty obtaining home health services for \n     medicare beneficiaries as a result of the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997.\n       (3) According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \n     rural hospitals were disproportionately affected by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, dropping the inpatient margins \n     of such hospitals over 4 percentage points in 1998.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress and the President should act expeditiously to \n     alleviate the adverse impacts of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 on beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act and health care providers \n     participating in such program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3726\n\n(Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate regarding funds for programs \nfor early detection and treatment regarding childhood lead poisoning at \n               sites providing Early Head Start programs)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, I come today to the floor of this \nChamber, which is so rich with history, which has been the setting of \nsome of the most determinative moments for our democracy, to talk about \nthe state of our civic memory.\n  Thomas Jefferson once famously said, ``If a nation expects to be \nignorant and free, it expects what never was and never will be.'' I am \nsaddened to say that this Nation, the guardian of the Jeffersonian \nethic, seems well on the way today to testing his proposition.\n  Or so the findings of a recent survey of America's college graduates \nwould suggest. That survey reveals that our next generation of leaders \nand citizens is leaving college with a stunning lack of knowledge of \ntheir heritage and the democratic values that have long sustained our \ncountry.\n  The University of Connecticut's Roper Center found that 81 percent of \nseniors from America's elite institutions of higher education received \na grade of D or F on history questions drawn from a basic high school \nexamination. Many seniors could not identify Valley Forge, words from \nthe Gettysburg Address, or even the basic principles of the U.S. \nConstitution. By comparison, 99 percent of them knew who Beavis and \nButthead were and 98 percent knew who the rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg was.\n  The Roper survey also shows that most major colleges no longer \nrequire their students to study history, which helps to explain why \nhistorical illiteracy is growing in this country. Students can now \ngraduate from 100 percent of the top colleges and universities without \ntaking a single course in American history. And students at 78 percent \nof those institutions are not required to take any form of history at \nall.\n  The American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a nonprofit group \ndedicated to the pursuit of academic freedom, has compiled and analyzed \nthese findings in a provocative report entitled ``Losing America's \nMemory: Historical Illiteracy in the 21st Century.'' I would encourage \nmy colleagues to examine this report, a copy of which has been sent to \nevery Member's office. I ask unanimous consent to have the report \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I do so because I believe all of us--elected \nofficials, educators, parents, the whole of our citizenry--should be \nalarmed by findings, by the Nation's growing ignorance of our past and \nwhat it implies for America's future. When we lose the memory of our \npast, when we lose our understanding of the remarkable individuals, \nevents, and values that have shaped this Nation, we are losing much of \nwhat it means to be an American. We are losing touch with the civic \nglue that binds our diverse Nation into a single people with a common \npurpose. And, I fear, we are losing sight of the lessons our history \nteaches us and the fundamental responsibilities we share as citizens in \na free democracy.\n  Earlier this week I had the privilege of joining with my colleague \nfrom Washington, Senator Gorton, Congressman Tom Petri of Wisconsin, \nthe leaders of the ACTA, and assemblage of distinguished historians at \na press conference to underscore the import of this report. With the \nFourth of July in the offing, we wanted to seize the opportunity of \nthis moment of patriotism to in a sense play Paul Revere, and to begin \nringing the alarm bells about the growing ignorance of the \ncontributions that Revere and many other great men and women made to \nthis Nation.\n  Among the scholars who attended were: Gordon Wood, Professor of \nHistory at Brown University; John Patrick Diggins, Distinguished \nProfessor of History, The Graduate Center, City University of New York; \nJames Rees, Director of George Washington's Mount Vernon; Jeffrey \nWallin, president, American Academy for Liberal Education; and Paul \nReber, Executive Director of Decatur House, National Trust for Historic \nPreservation. With us, in spirit if not in body, were David McCullough, \nthe prize-winning author of the illuminative biography of Harry Truman, \nand the great Oscar Handlin, Professor Emeritus at Harvard.\n\n  Each of these historians, as well as several others, issued \nstatements expressing their concerns about the consequences of losing \nAmerica's memory. I ask unanimous consent to have a collection of these \nstatements printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will read a few excerpts, because I think they \nuniquely speak to the ramifications of the problem.\n  Gordon Wood explained: ``We Americans have a special need to \nunderstand our history, for our history is what makes us a nation and \ngives us our sense of nationality. A people like us, made up of every \nconceivable race, ethnicity, and religion in the world, can never be a \nnation in the usual sense of the term. . . . Up until recently almost \nevery American, even those who were new immigrants possessed some sense \nof America's past, however rudimentary and unsophisticated. Without\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\nsome such sense of history, the citizens of the United States can \nscarcely long exist as a united people.''\n  Theodore Rabb, Professor of History at Princeton, and Chairman of the \nNational Council for History Education, quoting historian Kenneth T. \nJackson, added: `` `Our binding heritage is a democratic vision of \nliberty, equality, and justice. If Americans are to preserve that \nheritage and bring it to daily practice, it is imperative that all \ncitizens understand how it was shaped in the past . . .' Indeed, the \noffice of citizen cannot be properly filled in today's democratic \nsociety without an understanding of American history.''\n  Stephen H. Balch, President of the National Association of Scholars, \nconcluded: ``More than most nations, America is defined by shared \nmemories. Great deeds, stirring moments, inspiring heroes, hard-won \nvictories, occasional defeats, and, most significantly, lofty ideals--\ndeclared, attacked, and ultimately vindicated--map our collective \nidentity. ACTA's study, `Losing America's Memory,' thus strongly \nsuggests that were also in danger of losing America itself. Its \nfindings should be a wake-up call for our educators who have been \nclearly shirking their responsibilities.''\n  And David McCullough issued this succinct condemnation: ``The place \ngiven to history in our schools is a disgrace, and the dreadful truth \nis very few of those responsible for curriculum seem to care, even at \nthe highest level of education.''\n  These wise men have more than convinced me that this is a national \nproblem deserving national attention. In that spirit, Senator Gorton \nand I today are introducing a resolution that we hope will help call \npublic attention to America's growing historical illiteracy and ideally \nbegin to mobilize a national response. This bipartisan resolution, \nwhich is cosponsored by Senators Byrd, Gordon Smith, and Cleland, \nreaffirms the value we place on our truly exceptional history and makes \nan appeal to begin work immediately on rebuilding our historical \nliteracy.\n  Our call goes out primarily to America's colleges and universities to \nrecommit themselves to the teaching of history, particularly America's \nnational history. Specifically, it urges college trustees, \nadministrators, and State higher education officials around the country \nto review their curricula and reinstate requirements in U.S. history. \nIt also encourages students to select colleges with history \nrequirements and to take college courses in history whether required or \nnot.\n  We also cannot ignore the role of our public schools in contributing \nto this historical ignorance, so we must ask educators at all levels to \nredouble their efforts to bolster our children's knowledge of U.S. \nhistory and help us restore the vitality of our civic memory. This \npoint was reinforced at our press conference by Mount Vernon Director \nJames Rees, who noted with despair that George Washington's presence in \nelementary school curricula has been gradually disappearing. As an \nexample, he related that the textbook being used today at the \nelementary school he attended contained 10 times fewer references to \nthe father of our country than the textbook he used in his youth.\n  Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting and \nadopting this resolution and making an unequivocal statement. As we \nprepare to celebrate the Fourth, I can think of no finer birthday \npresent to the Nation, no better way to honor the anniversary of \nAmerica's independence, than for us first to remember what moved that \ndetermined band of patriots to lay down all for liberty, what has \nsustained our democracy for these many years, and for us to act so that \nour children and those who follow them will never forget.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Losing America's Memory--Historical Illiteracy in the 21st Century\n\n  [Issued for Presidents' Day, February 21, 2000--Prepared by Anne D. \n   Neal and Jerry L. Martin, American Council of Trustees and Alumni]\n\n       ``If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects \n     what never was and never will be.''--Thomas Jefferson.\n       ``[W]e cannot escape history.''--Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Who are we? What is our past? Upon what principles was \n     American democracy founded? And how can we sustain them?--\n     These are the questions that have inspired, motivated, \n     perplexed since the beginning. And they are questions which \n     still elude our full understanding. Yet they underscore a \n     belief that a shared understanding, a shared knowledge, of \n     the nation's past unifies a people and ensures a common civic \n     identity. Indeed, the American system is uniquely premised on \n     the need for an educated citizenry. Embarking on the \n     experiment of a democratic republic, the founders viewed \n     public education as central to the ability to sustain a \n     participatory form of government. ``If a nation expects to be \n     ignorant and free,'' Thomas Jefferson said, ``it expects what \n     never was and never will be.''\n       But the importance of a shared memory appears to have lost \n     its foothold in American higher education. As we move forward \n     into the 21st century, our future leaders are graduating with \n     an alarming ignorance of their heritage--a kind of collective \n     amnesia--and a profound historical illiteracy which bodes ill \n     for the future of the republic.\n       There is a widespread, though unspoken assumption that, if \n     not all citizens, at least college graduates--certainly those \n     from the elite institutions--have a basic understanding of \n     this country's history and founding principles. Colleges \n     themselves rarely, if ever, test this assumption. The \n     American Council of trustees and Alumni (ACTA) decided to do \n     so. What do seniors at the nation's best colleges and \n     universities know and not know about the history of this \n     nation? What grade would they receive if tested?\n       ACTA commissioned the Roper organization--The Center for \n     Survey Research and Analysis at the University of \n     Connecticut--to survey college seniors from the nation's best \n     colleges and universities as identified by the U.S. News & \n     World Reports annual college rankings. The top 55 liberal \n     arts colleges and research universities were sampled during \n     December 1999. (For a list, see Appendix A.)\n       The questions were drawn from a basic high school \n     curriculum. In fact, many of the questions had been used in \n     the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests \n     given to high school students.\n       How did seniors from our nation's top colleges and \n     universities do? They flunked. Four out of five--18%--of \n     seniors from the top 55 colleges and universities in the \n     United States received a grade of D or F. they could not \n     identify Valley Forge, or words from the Gettysburg Address, \n     or even the basic principles of the U.S. Constitution.\n       Scarcely more than half knew general information about \n     American democracy and the Constitution.\n       Only 34% of the students surveyed could identify George \n     Washington as an American general at the battle of Yorktown, \n     the culminating battle of the American Revolution.\n       Only 42% were able to identify George Washington as ``First \n     in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his \n     countrymen.''\n       Less than one quarter (23%) correctly identified James \n     Madison as the ``father of the Constitution.''\n       Even fewer--22% of the college seniors--were able to \n     identify ``Government of the people, by the people, and for \n     the people'' as a line from the Gettysburg Address--arguably \n     one of the three most important documents underlying the \n     American system of government.\n       Over one-third were unable to identify the U.S. \n     Constitution as establishing the division of power in \n     American government.\n       Little more than half (52%) knew George Washington's \n     Farewell Address warned against permanent alliances with \n     foreign governments.\n       What do they know? They get an A+ in contemporary popular \n     culture.\n       99% know who the cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead \n     are.\n       98% can identify the rap singer Snoop Doggy Dogg.\n       Beavis and Butthead instead of Washington and Madison; \n     Snoop Doggy Dogg instead of Lincoln? How did it come to this? \n     Students and parents are paying $30,000 a year at elite \n     institutions. For what?\n     What Happened to American History?\n       To find out what our nation's top colleges and universities \n     demand of students in the area of American history, ACTCA \n     conducted a study of graduation requirements at the same 55 \n     colleges and  universities surveyed by the Roper \n     organization. These are the institutions, such as Harvard \n     and Amherst, which set the standard for all the rest. (See \n     Appendix B.)\n       For each school, the most recent undergraduate course \n     catalog or Internet course listing was used to define the \n     graduation requirements and to determine what history or \n     American history courses are required of students before they \n     graduate.\n       The results are worse than could have been imagined. \n     Students can now graduate from 100% of the top colleges \n     without taking a single course in American history.\n       Novelist Milan Kundera once said that, if you want to \n     destroy a country, destroy its memory. If a hostile power \n     wanted to erase America's civic heritage, it could hardly do \n     a better job--short of actually prohibiting the study of \n     American history--than America's elite colleges and \n     universities are doing.\n       More shocking still is that, at 78% of the institutions, \n     students are not required to take any history at all. The \n     best that can be said is that they are permitted to take \n     history to satisfy other requirements in such\n\n[[Page S6202]]\n\n     areas as social sciences or diversity. Only the fact that \n     many students find history useful and interesting saves the \n     subject from extinction.\n       It is not surprising that college seniors know little \n     American history. Few students leave high school with an \n     adequate knowledge of American history and even the best \n     colleges and universities do nothing to close the ``knowledge \n     gap.''\n       The abandonment of history requirements is part of a \n     national trend. In 1988, the National Endowment for the \n     Humanities publicized the first troubling indication that \n     America was losing its historic memory. NEH issued a report \n     concluding that more than 80% of colleges and universities \n     permitted students to graduate without taking a course in \n     American history while 37% of those institutions allowed \n     students to avoid history altogether. Now, thirteen years \n     later, as outlined in Appendix B, standards have fallen \n     further--100% do not require American history, and 78% \n     require no history at all.\n       The problem is not limited to history. In 1996, the \n     National Association of Scholars issued another seminal \n     report, The Dissolution of General Education, which concluded \n     that, during the last thirty years, the commitment of \n     American higher education to providing students with a broad \n     and rigorous exposure to major areas of knowledge has \n     virtually vanished. In its stead, students pick and choose \n     from a smorgasbord of courses that are too often on narrow, \n     specialized topics. As the widely-acclaimed study by the \n     Association of American Colleges, Integrity in the College \n     Curriculum, concluded in 1990: ``As far as what passes as \n     college curriculum, almost anything goes.'' Is it any wonder \n     that students end up with an understanding that is equally \n     narrow, fragmented, and less than the sum of its parts?\n       In the country that gave birth to Jefferson's conception of \n     an educated citizenry, colleges and universities are failing \n     to provide the kind of general education that is needed for \n     graduates to be involved and educated citizens.\n     Why Does American History Matter?\n       Other than our schools, no institutions bear greater \n     responsibility for the transmission of our heritage than \n     colleges and universities. They educate almost two-thirds of \n     our citizens, including all our school teachers, lawyers, \n     doctors, journalists, and public leaders. They set the \n     admissions and curricular requirements that signal to \n     students, teachers, parents, and the public what every \n     educated citizen in a democracy must know.\n       What happens in higher education thus relates directly to \n     what happens in K-12. If colleges and universities no longer \n     require their students to have a basic knowledge of American \n     civilization and its heritage, we are all in danger of losing \n     a common frame of reference that has sustained our free \n     society for so many generations.\n       As ACTA chairman and former NEH chairman Lynne V. Cheney \n     observes, in Telling the Truth, ``[I]t is from our colleges \n     and universities that messages radiate--or fail to radiate to \n     schools, to legal institutions, to popular culture, and to \n     politics about the importance of reason, of trying to \n     overcome bias, of seeking truth through evidence and \n     verification.'' If our graduates leave school without knowing \n     the foundations of American society, children they teach will \n     certainly do no better.\n       It is sometimes said that historical facts do not matter. \n     But citizens who fail to know basic landmarks of history and \n     civics are unlikely to be able to reflect on their meaning. \n     They fail to recognize the unique nature of our society, and \n     the importance of preserving it. They lack an understanding \n     of the very principles which bind our society--namely, \n     liberty, justice, government by the consent of the governed, \n     and equality under the law.\n       As Lynne Cheney has also written, ``Knowledge of the ideas \n     that have molded us and the ideals that have mattered to us \n     functions as a kind of civic glue. Our history and literature \n     give us symbols to share; they help us all, no matter how \n     diverse our backgrounds, feel part of a common undertaking.''\n     What Should Be Done?\n       Immediate steps must be taken to ensure that the memory of \n     our great nation and its remarkable past is passed on to the \n     next generation. The following actions should be taken by \n     colleges and universities, students and their families, \n     alumni and donors, state and federal governments, and \n     accrediting agencies.\n       By colleges and universities\n       Colleges and universities should make improving students' \n     historical memory and civic competence an urgent priority. \n     Boards of trustees and state agencies with higher education \n     oversight should take steps to ensure that institutions of \n     higher education have adequate requirements in American \n     history and history in general. Faculty, whose personal \n     interest often draws them to specialized topics, should teach \n     what students need to know, not what faculty desire to teach.\n       The most direct solution is a strong core curriculum, with \n     a broad-based, rigorous course on American history required \n     of all students. The course should include the breadth of \n     American history from the colonial period to the present, and \n     the long struggle to defend liberty against all foes domestic \n     and foreign and to expand democratic rights at home and \n     abroad. Students should be required to study the great civic \n     documents of the nation, beginning with the Declaration of \n     Independence, Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the \n     Federalist papers, and the Gettysburg Address. Such a course \n     gives students a sense not only of where the country has \n     been, but what it has meant.\n       By students and their families\n       The first challenge for students and their families is \n     selecting a college. Some colleges have strong core curricula \n     that ensure that every graduate will be well-grounded in the \n     full range of basic subjects, including American history. \n     Most have loose cafeteria-style requirements that let the \n     students choose for themselves. Some no longer even offer \n     traditional, broad-based courses in American history.\n       Before selecting a college, students and their families \n     should look at catalogues, examining requirements and course \n     descriptions and ideally accessing course syllabi on the web. \n     College is a big investment, and it deserves as much research \n     as any other major purchase. A hot reputation and fancy \n     student center are no guarantee of a solid academic program.\n       Students who are already attending a college can make up \n     for colleges' deficiencies by selecting for themselves those \n     courses, including American history, that will prepare them \n     for successful participation in our civic as well as economic \n     life. Parents should help their students understand that \n     trendy courses that may strike their short-term fancy will \n     not well serve their long-term needs.\n       By alumni and donors\n       Alumni should take an active interest in whether their alma \n     maters have strong requirements in American history and other \n     basic subjects. They should not allow their degrees to be \n     devalued by a decline in college standards.\n       Those who give can be especially helpful, since it is \n     possible to target gifts to outstanding programs and projects \n     in American history and civic understanding. The American \n     Council of Trustees and Alumni has established a program, the \n     Fund for Academic Renewal (FAR), that assists donors, free of \n     charge, in identifying outstanding programs and directing \n     their gifts to support them.\n       By State and Federal Governments and accrediting agencies\n       Consumers in the higher education market cannot make wise \n     choices if they have no information. Most college guides and \n     rankings give little or no information about the curriculum. \n     The U.S. Department of Education--and state government for \n     institutions in their states--should publish and disseminate \n     a national report on collegiate standards, listing which \n     colleges require such basic subjects as English, history, \n     mathematics, and science, and which do not.\n       Federal and state governments should target some of the \n     funds from existing grant programs to support outstanding \n     core curricula that include American history and civics.\n       Accrediting agencies, which have so often neglected issues \n     of academic quality, should include adequate requirements in \n     American history and other basic disciplines among their \n     criteria for assessing colleges and universities.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       On this Presidents' Day 2000, it is indeed ironic that \n     many--if not most--of our college seniors are unfamiliar with \n     and ignorant about the individuals we celebrate. The time is \n     ripe for citizens, parents, families and policymakers to \n     demand a renewed exploration and examination of our history. \n     It is not too late to restore America's memory.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n   statements submitted in conjunction with the congressional press \n     conference on historical illiteracy in america--june 27, 2000\n\n     David McCullough, Historian, West Tisbury, MA:\n       The place given to history in our schools is a disgrace, \n     and the dreadful truth is very few of those responsible for \n     curriculum seem to care, even at the highest level of \n     education. Anyone who doubts that we are raising a generation \n     of young Americans who are historically illiterate needs only \n     to read Losing America's Memory.\n\n     Oscar Handlin, University Professor Emeritus, Harvard \n     University:\n       History is a discipline in decline. There is a profound \n     ignorance not only among students but among their teachers as \n     well. This study [Losing America's Memory] confirms that.\n\n     Lynne V. Cheney, Former Chairman, National Endowment for the \n     Humanities:\n       It is regrettable that over the last decade we have seen a \n     continuing decline in emphasis at the college level on core \n     subjects such as literature, math, and history. ACTA's recent \n     report, ``Losing America's Memory: Historical Illiteracy in \n     the 21st Century,'' confirms this disturbing trend and \n     underscores a profound historical illiteracy amongst our \n     future leaders that bodes ill for the future of the Republic. \n     Sen. Lieberman and Cong. Petri deserve our praise for raising \n     this important issue. We must begin to restore America's \n     memory. If our best and brightest are graduating without a \n     grounding in the past, we are on our way to losing the \n     understanding that makes us all feel part of a\n\n[[Page S6203]]\n\n     common undertaking, no matter how diverse our backgrounds.\n\n     John Patrick Diggins, Distinguished Professor of History, The \n     Graduate Center, City University of New York:\n       ``We cannot escape history,'' Abraham Lincoln warned \n     Americans more than a century ago. According to the American \n     Council of Trustees and Alumni report, students have escaped \n     it and remain happily ignorant of their own ignorance in an \n     educational establishment that has surrendered its mission to \n     popular culture.\n\n     Gordon Wood, Professor of History, Brown University:\n       We Americans have a special need to understand our history, \n     for our history is what makes us a nation and gives us our \n     sense of nationality. A people like us, made up of every \n     conceivable race, ethnicity, and religion in the world, can \n     never be a nation in the usual sense of the term. Instead, we \n     have only our history to hold us together; McDonald's can \n     never do it. It's our history, our heritage, that makes us a \n     single people. Up until recently almost every American, even \n     those who were new immigrants, possessed some sense of \n     America's past, however rudimentary and unsophisticated. \n     Without some such sense of history, the citizens of the \n     United States can scarcely long exist as a united people.\n\n     Theodore K. Rabb, Chairman, National Council for History \n     Education, Professor of History, Princeton University:\n       Since the focus of the National Council for History \n     Education (NCHE) is on the improvement of history education \n     in the schools--indeed, our one postsecondary initiative has \n     been to recommend that teachers of history be certified only \n     if they have a college major or at least a minor in the \n     subject--we are not in a position to comment on the findings \n     of Losing America's Memory except to add our voice to those \n     who are concerned about the growing problem of historical \n     illiteracy in the United States. We have long argued that \n     history should occupy a large and vital place in the \n     education of both the private person and the public citizen. \n     As historian Kenneth T. Jackson has written, ``Unlike many \n     people of other nations, Americans are not bound together by \n     a common religion or a common ethnicity. Instead, our binding \n     heritage is a democratic vision of liberty, equality and \n     justice. If Americans are to preserve that vision and bring \n     it to daily practice, it is imperative that all citizens \n     understand how it was shaped in the past, what events and \n     forces either helped or obstructed it, and how it has evolved \n     down to the circumstances and political discourse of our \n     time.'' Indeed, the office of citizen cannot be filled \n     property in today's democratic society without an \n     understanding of American history, nor can students afford to \n     go into the twenty-first century ignorant of the history and \n     culture of other nations.\n\n     Eugene W. Hickock, Secretary of Education, Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania:\n       ACTA's recent study, Losing America's Memory, is deeply \n     troubling for many reasons.  The findings suggest to me that \n     the teaching of our nation's history has taken a back seat \n     in our elementary and secondary schools, likely replaced \n     by failed fads or trends that have permeated our education \n     system for decades. But, we cannot expect K-12 education \n     to take full responsibility; our higher education \n     institutions often have replaced the study of our American \n     culture with watered down programs and curricula that \n     focus more on our popular culture. It is time for \n     Americans from all walks of life--parents, educators, \n     students, and local, state, and national leaders--to step \n     up their efforts to reverse this disturbing trend and to \n     make sure our nation's history is a key part of the \n     curriculum at every level. I applaud Senator Lieberman and \n     Congressman Petri for their strong commitment and bold \n     efforts to reverse this trend and to make sure every \n     student knows and appreciates our Republic's rich history.\n\n     James C. Rees, Executive Director, Historic Mount Vernon:\n       With each year that passes, it becomes more and more \n     evident that the people entering our gates at Mount Vernon \n     know next to nothing about the real George Washington. They \n     usually recognize his image from the dollar bill, and \n     sometimes they're familiar with the age-old myths about the \n     cherry tree and the silver dollar toss across the \n     Rappahannock River. But when it comes to even the most \n     rudimentary facts--what war he was in and when he was \n     president--it is incredible how many people draw a blank. And \n     it's not just the kids in grade school who have somehow lost \n     touch with George Washington. It is their parents as well. \n     This most recent survey of college students confirms our \n     worst fear: that the next generation of parents will continue \n     this trend of ignorance. To put it as simply as possible, it \n     would be naive to think that George Washington could be first \n     in the hearts of this generation, because it simply doesn't \n     know and appreciate his remarkable leadership and character.\n\n     Walter A. McDougall, Pulitzer prize-winning professor of \n     history, University of Pennsylvania:\n       The findings of this excellent ACTA report are deemed \n     ``shocking.'' In fact, they are all too predictable, which is \n     why they deserve the widest dissemination. Americans simply \n     cannot expect rigorous history instruction in their K-12 \n     schools so long as the nation's elite colleges and \n     universities delete history from their curricula.\n\n     Thomas Egan, Chairman of the Board, State University of New \n     York:\n       ACTA's recent report ``Losing America's Memory,'' is \n     alarming proof that our graduates are failing to receive a \n     strong grounding in their past. At SUNY, we are pleased to be \n     among the vanguard of university boards to require U.S. \n     history as part of a core curriculum demanded of our \n     graduates. Congressional action today confirms what we  have \n     already concluded: students must be familiar with their \n     history in order to be engaged participants in the civic \n     life of our nation.\n\n     Stepeh H. Balch, President, National Association of Scholars:\n       More than most nations, America is defined by shared \n     memories. Great deeds, stirring moments, inspiring heroes, \n     hard-won victories, occasional defeats, and, most \n     significantly, lofty ideals--declared, attacked, and \n     ultimately vindicated--map our collective identity. ACTA's \n     study, ``Losing America's Memory,'' thus strongly suggests \n     that we are also in danger of losing America itself. Its \n     findings should be a wake-up call for our educators who have \n     been clearly shirking their responsibilities.\n\n     Candace de Russy, Member of the Board, Chairman, Academic \n     Standards Committee, State University of New York:\n       As part of their duty to ensure the academic excellence of \n     their institutions, the nation's higher-education governing \n     boards are beginning to promote U.S. history requirements. We \n     trustees of the State University of New York have \n     accomplished this by mandating the study of American history \n     as part of a larger core curriculum which all SUNY \n     undergraduates must now pursue. This mandate is consonant \n     with our determination to raise academic standards. It also \n     reflects our commitment to help ground students in the \n     fundamental norms and ideals we as citizens need to hold in \n     common in order that this free society endures.\n\n     Dr. Balint Vazsonyi, Founder and Director, Center for the \n     American Founding:\n       Having grown up in Hungary, in turn under German National \n     Socialist and Russian International Socialist terror, I have \n     learned the absolute need of socialists to erase the national \n     memory as a precondition for disseminating their own \n     fictitious history. The so-called National Standards for U.S. \n     History demonstrate that the second stage of this process is \n     already under way. Alone clear identification of the ideology \n     that mandates the erasure of national memory can provide a \n     meaningful response to the crisis. It is then up to the \n     advocates of that ideology whether they desire continued \n     identification with it. Incorporating more of the current, \n     mostly fraudulent histories in the curriculum only serves \n     those who have created the crisis in the first place.\n\n     Marc Berley, President, Foundation for Academic Standards & \n     Tradition:\n       While students may not know as much as they should about \n     American history, they do know what they're missing. And they \n     want their colleges to do exactly what Senator Joseph I. \n     Lieberman and Congressman Thomas E. Petri are urging. In \n     ``Student Life,'' a national survey of 1005 randomly selected \n     college students conducted by Zogby International and \n     released last week by the Foundation for Academic Standards \n     and Tradition, 8 out of 10 college students said their \n     schools need to ``do a better job teaching students the basic \n     principles of freedom in America.''\n\n     Michael C. Quinn, Executive Director, James Madison's \n     Montpelier:\n       America is forgetting its heritage, and it does matter. The \n     American Council of Trustees and Alumni has recently taken a \n     survey of college seniors, and has exposed the failure of our \n     universities to teach our nation's history. Only 23 percent \n     of the college seniors surveyed could correctly identify \n     James Madison as the ``Father of the Constitution.'' Why does \n     this matter? It matters because the American nation exists \n     through its heritage. Americans have only one thing that \n     unites them as citizens: a shared vision of democracy. \n     Citizens of almost every other country are united by a shared \n     language, a shared religion, a shared geography, or a shared \n     ethnicity. In America, we join together as a people because \n     of nothing more than an idea. Yet the idea we share as a \n     people--the constitutional democracy pioneered by James \n     Madison and other founding fathers--is one of the most \n     powerful ideas on earth. No other form of government has \n     guaranteed so much individual liberty and economic \n     opportunity to its citizens. The failure to teach American \n     history, with its lessons of struggle and idealism, of \n     inspiring leaders like James Madison, is failing our nation. \n     Each generation has an obligation to instill the shared idea \n     of democracy into the next generation. And American history--\n     the story of the birth and success of that vision of \n     democracy--makes our shared idea a lasting, meaningful part \n     of every new citizen's life.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the managers' \namendments Nos. 3700 through 3731.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3700 through 3731), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if there is any issue about the pendency \nof the Baucus amendment, I think it is in the managers' package. I ask \nunanimous consent to vitiate the request for\n\n[[Page S6204]]\n\nthe yeas and nays on the Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Are we now ready \nfor third reading?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I renew my point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas raises his point of \norder. The point of order is sustained.\n\n\n     training needs for appropriate use of seclusion and restraint\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Chairman of the Labor Health and Human \nServices Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be pleased to yield for a question from the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. First, I want to compliment the chairman and the \nranking member, Mr. Harkin for bringing this bill to the Senate in a \nvery timely way and for the committee's attention to the several health \nprograms funded by this Bill that very broadly benefit the entire \nNation.\n  I also want to compliment the chairman and the ranking member for the \ncommittee's report language from last year that urged the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to address the inappropriate use of seclusion \nand restraint in mental health facilities across the Nation that has \nresulted in tragic and unnecessary deaths and injuries. The committee's \nlanguage has helped focus attention on this matter and progress has \nbeen made. For example, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \nhas issued interim ``conditions of participation'' rules governing the \nuse of restraints and seclusion in facilities receiving Medicare and \nMedicaid reimbursement. I thank the committee for its assistance in \nmaking progress on this matter.\n  Mr. President, what we have learned from the National Mental Health \nAssociation, the Child Welfare League, and my own states Klingberg \nCenter is that a significant obstacle to making further progress is the \nhigh turnover rate in many of the mental health facilities across the \ncountry and the recurring need to provide training to new personnel in \nthese facilities on the appropriate use of seclusion and restraint. To \naddress this national problem, would the Chairman support funding a \ndemonstration project for model training and education programs for the \nappropriate use of restraints?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank both Senators Dodd and Lieberman for their work \nin bringing this matter to our attention and I would certainly support \nsuch a demonstration.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chairman for his continuing leadership on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to also thank the Chairman and the Ranking \nMember for their assistance on this issue which has been of particular \nconcern in my state. In fact, I worked to develop legislation last \nyear, S. 976, the Compassionate Care Act, cosponsored by Senator \nLieberman, that recognizes the critical need for adequate training in \nrestraint use and alternatives to their use. The Compassionate Care Act \nwas passed by the Senate unanimously last year as part of the \nreauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA) legislation and it is my hope that the House of \nRepresentatives will soon act on this important legislation.\n  Meanwhile, however, it would appear to me that there are nationally \nbased consumer organizations that could make an important contribution \nto the development of model training and education programs that could \neffectively serve to lessen the inappropriate use of restraint and \nseclusion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes. It seems to me that such groups would be strong \ncompetitors for an education and training demonstration grant.\n\n\n                      medicare contractor funding\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am concerned about the funding level for Medicare \ncontractors. The Senate committee mark reduces the FY 2001 funding \nlevel by $57 million below the President's Budget recommendation. I \nbelieve that this funding reduction will adversely impact fee-for-\nservice claims processing activities and the ability of contractors to \nprovide critical beneficiary and providers services.\n  In the recent past, we have seen the effect inadequate funding levels \ncan have on services. In 1998 payments were slowed down, and \nbeneficiaries and providers were forced to deal with more voice mail \nrather than human beings when they called their contractors with \nquestions about claims. We need to fund this program adequately to \nensure beneficiaries get the service they deserve.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to make it clear that funding to assure the timely \nand accurate processing of Medicare claims also is a high priority for \nme and the beneficiaries in my state.\n  I am concerned that HCFA projects a 3.5 percent increase in claims \nvolume next year and yet our budget flatlined funding for Medicare \ncontractors. However, I am even more concerned that the House has cut \nthe Medicare contractor budget by $79 million from current levels. The \nSenate, at the very least, must assure that this important program is \nnot cut. Additionally, I would like to work with Senator Craig to \nsecure additional funding for the Medicare contractors, if funds become \navailable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the issues both Senators are raising and \nthe importance of adequately funding the Medicare contractor program. I \nwill work with my two colleagues to try to keep the Senate funding \nlevel is kept intact and that no funding cut is made to the Medicare \ncontractor program.\n\n\n                          hcfa coverage change\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of \nimportance to the people of South Carolina with my colleagues from \nPennsylvania and Iowa.\n  In January of 1999, South Carolina enhanced its Medicaid drug program \nto provide eligible adults with four prescriptions a month instead of \nthree. This was a much needed change that HCFA had encouraged South \nCarolina to make over a number of years. Unfortunately, South Carolina \nimproperly notified HCFA of the coverage change. Instead of filing a \nState Plan amendment, South Carolina distributed a Medicaid Bulletin to \nrelevant parties--including three officials at HCFA's Atlanta regional \noffice, believing that to be sufficient. The South Carolina Department \nof Health and Human Services brought their oversight to HCFA's \nattention. South Carolina and HCFA are currently involved in \ndiscussions regarding whether South Carolina should receive federal \nfunds for 4th prescription expenditures that occurred between January \n1, 1999 and September 30, 1999.\n  At this time, a legislative remedy does not appear necessary to allow \nHCFA to impose suitable fines on states that provide notice of Medicaid \ncoverage changes but do not properly file State Plan amendments. I am \nencouraged by the response officials in South Carolina have received \nfrom HCFA and hopeful that a resolution can be reached in a manner \nagreeable to all parties. Nevertheless, I wanted to bring this matter \nto the attention of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee and inform them that I may revisit this issue at a \nlater date if necessary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from South Carolina for bringing \nthis matter to my attention. I too hope that South Carolina and HCFA \ncan resolve their difference, but would be willing to discuss the \nmatter in the future if an agreement cannot be reached.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the comments of the chairman.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nof the subcommittee for their attention to this matter and will keep \nthem appraised of future developments.\n\n\n                       medicare integrity program\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am very concerned about the proposed $50 million \nfunding cut to the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) approved by the \nHouse Appropriations LHHS Subcommittee. The Senate has recommended that \nMIP be funded at $680 million, the amount authorized in HIPAA.\n  In 1999, Medicare contractors saved the Medicare Trust Funds nearly \n$10 billion in inappropriate payments--about $18 for every dollar \ninvested. Any funding cut to MIP is tantamount to the government \nthrowing money out a window. In fact, I believe, because of the \ntremendous need to reduce an estimated $14 billion in Medicare waste, \nwe\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\nshould increase MIP funding. Therefore, I will work hard to ensure that \nthe Senate funding level for this important program is not compromised. \nIt should be higher, not lower.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I've long been committed to the effective and efficient \nmanagement of the Medicare program, specifically the detection of fraud \nand abuse. I supported the creation of the MIP program, established \nunder HIPAA, to provide a stable and increasing funding source for \nfraud and abuse detection efforts. Prior to MIP, Medicare contractor \nfunding for anti-fraud and abuse activities was often reduced because \nof other spending priorities in the annual appropriations process. MIP \nwas created to prevent that from happening again. The House \nAppropriations Committee recommendation is in clear disregard of \ncongressional intent.\n  Additionally, I am concerned about the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee recommendation to flatline the Medicare contractor budget. \nHCFA requested a $57 million increase to the Medicare contractor \nbudget, in part to ensure implementation of certain balanced budget \namendment provisions. Without this money, I am told by HCFA, that the \nfinal provisions of BBA will not be implemented. It doesn't make much \nsense to pass laws, if we don't provide the funding to ensure their \nimplementation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Please rest assured that during conference, I will try \nto keep MIP funding at the Senate recommended level of $680 million. I \nunderstand the importance of the MIP program to the integrity of the \nMedicare Trust Funds and will work with my colleagues to ensure full \nfunding of this program.\n  Regarding the Medicare contractor budget, I am committed to the \nSenate Appropriations Committee funding recommendation of $1.244 \nbillion and will work in conference to keep the Senate's funding level.\n\n\n                           outreach services\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Aging Subcommittee I \nwould like to take this opportunity to compliment the Chairman of the \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Specter, for his efforts to address the needs of \nAmerica's aging population. At this time, I would like to engage the \ndistinguished chairman in a colloquy.\n  Mr. President, there is a lack of understanding of what constitutes \nthe best outreach and professional services for our elderly population. \nI am pleased to report that Ohio is taking the lead in providing \nquality health care professionals to the provider community. In \nparticular, the Geriatric Nursing Program at the University of Akron \nhas been recognized as the top such program in the United States. They \nare most interested in identifying and developing best practices in \nelder care that can be disseminated nationally for use by other \ninstitutions and health care providers. Would you agree that such a \nprogram would help improve the overall quality of care of our elderly \npopulation?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nOhio for his kind remarks and his dedication on this most important \nmatter. I, too, would agree that such an initiative would be most \nvaluable.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania and would ask that the Chair support the \nprogram in the upcoming conference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I consider the interests of older \nAmericans, particularly the issue of ensuring quality health care, to \nbe among the most important matters that come before the subcommittee. \nThe gentleman from Ohio has my commitment to support the project in \nconference.\n\n\n                          huntington's disease\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today with the Chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education to discuss a fatal brain disorder \ncalled Huntington's disease. This genetic ailment, which has no cure, \nhas afflicted approximately 30,000 Americans, and over 150,000 more \npeople in our country are at risk. In my state alone, it is estimated \nthat over 500 people have Huntington's, and another 4,742 are at risk. \nAlso known as ``HD,'' the illness is like a cross between Alzheimer's \ndisease and Parkinson's disease. Everybody with the defective gene will \nbecome ill, slowly losing the ability to walk, talk, eat, and reason \nand eventually dying from choking, infection, or heart failure. HD \nstrikes both sexes, all ethnicities, and sometimes even children. In \naddition, each child of a parent with HD has a 50/50 chance of \ninheriting the gene.\n  One family that has been struck by the terrible realities of \nHuntington's disease is the Mason family of Baltimore, Maryland. Troy \nMason was once the agile quarterback on his high school football team. \nToday at age 36, Mr. Mason uses a wheelchair and can only walk a bit \nand speak some words. His wife, Rosemary, is his full time caregiver. \nTroy and Rosemary's two children have a 50/50 chance of inheriting the \nHD gene. Not only does Mrs. Mason care for her husband, but she also \ncares for her mother who suffers from HD. This means that Mrs. Mason \nalso has a 50/50 chance of inheriting the HD gene. Mrs. Mason not only \nhas to face the incredible daily stresses and strains of caregiving, \nbut must also face the possibility that she and her children may \nsomeday have Huntington's disease themselves. This Baltimore family is \ncourageously fighting Huntington's disease, but they need our help.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am familiar with the horrible effects of Huntington's \ndisease. In my state, 1,200 people are affected. But I am optimistic \nabout a cure. HD research is advancing rapidly and could be the Rosetta \nstone to treatments for Alzheimer's Parkinson's, and other \nneurodegenerative disorders that together strike millions of people and \ntheir families.\n  I am also hopeful that through public and private medical research \nfunding, we will soon approach a better understanding of, and perhaps \neven a cure for, this terrible disease. Researchers at the University \nof Pennsylvania are part of this effort. The federal government clearly \nhas a significant role to play in this struggle. In Fiscal Year 1999, \nthe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) dedicated $62.5 million to \nHuntington's Disease research. Also commendable is the commitment of \nthe Huntington's Disease Society of America (HDSA), which this year \nwill allocate an estimated $2.8 million to research in this area.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The people of Maryland appreciate this support by the \nNIH and laud your and Senator Harkin's leadership in doubling the NIH \nbudget over five years. I am very pleased to join you in this worthy \nendeavor. We are proud to have an HDSA Center of Excellence in \nMaryland, at Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Hospital. Johns \nHopkins also receives funding from NIH to conduct Huntington's disease \nresearch. However, I believe additional resources are needed to fund \nimportant HD research. I am concerned that the current health \nappropriations bill does not provide guidance to the NIH on HD funding \nand research priorities.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the Senator's concerns. The Committee has \nincluded nearly $1.2 billion in this year's appropriations bill for the \nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS. This is \na significant increase over the FY00 level. I believe that the NINDS, \nand the NIH generally, devote additional resources to Huntington's \ndisease research in FY 2001. I also believe that the NINDS could \nincrease support for the centers of excellence and other programs \ndeveloped by the Huntington's Disease Society for the care of HD \npatients.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chairman for his attention to Huntington's \ndisease. To eliminate this horrible illness and others like it we must \nbuild and strengthen the partnership between the federal government, \nacademia, and private organizations. I wish to thank the Distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania for his assistance. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         strategic plan for pkd\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wonder if my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior senator from Pennsylvania, would answer a few questions on \nfunding for research regarding polycystic kidney disease?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be happy to answer questions on this issue.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chairman. I know that you are very much\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\naware of the devastation caused by polycystic kidney disease, better \nknown as PKD. Our colleagues may be interested to know that this \ndisease afflicts over 600,000 Americans, which is more than the \ncombined total of cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, sickle cell \nanemia, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy and Down's syndrome. That \ntranslates into an average of almost 1400 sufferers in each \ncongressional district, or 12,000 in each state.\n  PKD is the most prevalent life-threatening genetic disease, and is \nthe third leading cause of kidney failure, resulting in almost $2 \nbillion spent every year to treat end-stage renal disease requiring \ndialysis or transplantation. End-Stage Renal Disease is the fastest \ngrowing part of Medicare, and I know we are all looking for ways to \nstrengthen that important program.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chairman if, in the context of \nthe funding provided to the National Institutes of Health in this bill, \ncould he tell us your intentions with regard to PKD research?\n  Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator knows, we are entering the third year of \na bipartisan effort to double funding for the NIH. Within that budget, \nwe have been able to provide significant increases in the budget for \nthe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n  It is my hope and intention that, with these additional funds, NIDDK \nwill fully implement the Strategic Plan for PKD put forward by a panel \nof blue-ribbon experts which they convened in 1998. These expert \nscientists and doctors have stated that, with a total PKD research \nbudget of $20 million, which we provide in this bill, they are \nconfident that a treatment for PKD can be achieved in the very near \nfuture. In fact, I am very heartened by recent reports indicating that \na drug currently used to treat cancer has been shown to actually stop \nthe progression of PKD in laboratory animals. This discovery, coupled \nwith statements from our leading genetic researchers to the effect that \nPKD is the most rapidly advancing area of genetic research, convinces \nme that the additional funds provided in this bill will allow NIDDK to \nproduce a treatment and eventual cure for this devastating disease.\n  May I say to my colleague that I intend to do everything in my power \nto ensure that NIDDK implements the Strategic Plan for PKD. This bill \nprovides the budgetary means to do that, and I will be following up \nwith NIDDK on the disposition of those funds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my esteemed colleague for his help in this \nmatter.\n\n\n                            ocular albinism\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise today to bring to the attention of the senate \nthe serious disease Ocular Albinism. Ocular Albinism is an x-linked \ngenetic disorder affecting 1 in 50,000 American children, mostly males. \nAffected patients show photophobia, nystagmus, strabimus, a loss of \nthree dimensional vision and a severe reduction in visual acuity, due \nto the abnormal development of the retina and optic pathways. There are \nfive diseases relating to Ocular Albinism including Fundus \nHypopigmentations, Macular Hypoplasia, Iris Transillumination, Visual \nPathway Misrouting and Nystagmus\n  Mr. SPECTER. Ocular Albinism is one of the many diseases being \nresearched by the NIH. This is why I have been pressing for a doubling \nof funding for NIH and have included a $2.7 billion increase in funding \nin this bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. In consideration of the severity of this disease and \nthe paucity of current NIH sponsored research I would certainly hope \nthat the NIH will develop and fund a research initiative in cooperation \nwith the National Eye Institute in to the causes of the treatments for \nOcular Albinism and related Disorders.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with my colleague and thank him for brining it \nto the attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee and commend \nhim for his understanding of the importance of this issue.\n\n\n                       federal family statistics\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief, but \nimportant colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Labor-HHs \nsubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Specter. I \nappreciate his willingness to engage in this colloquy, and his \ncommitment to ensuring that the federal government does the best \npossible job in gathering vital information on family structure and \nfunction.\n  It has been said that the family is the cornerstone of civilization. \nCertainly, the evidence we have suggests that family structure is one \nof the most fundamental indicators of child health and well-being. \nStrong families are positively linked to child physical, emotional and \npsychological health, social adjustment, academic competence, and \npositive behavior. In fact, the more we study family structure and \nfunction, the more information we glean about children's health risks, \nand challenges to their well-being and development.\n  Unfortunately, there is vital data that is not currently being \ngathered relating to family structure and function. This is not merely \nmy opinion, but the statement of the Federal Inter-Agency Forum on \nChild and Family Statistics, which declares that important information \non child living arrangements, family structure, and family interaction, \nis falling through the cracks, and recommends expanded and enhanced \ndata-gathering in these areas. Without such data, we are at a \ndisadvantage in determining the root causes of both youth well-being, \nand youth challenges, and addressing them effectively.\n  It is therefore vital that we encourage the National Center of Health \nStatistics, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development, \nAdministration for Children and Families, Maternal and Child Health \nBureau, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, \nand Bureau of Labor Statistics to enhance research in this area. \nAccording to the Inter-Agency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, of \nwhich all these agencies are a member of, regularly collected data are \nneeded that describe children's living arrangements, and interactions \nwith parents and guardians, including non-residential parents. In \naddition, regularly-collected data are needed on how many children live \nwith biological parents, step-parents, and adoptive parents, or with no \nparent or guardian.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Brownback, I appreciate the work that you have \nput into this, and look forward to working with you on appropriate \nlanguage which may be included in the Labor-HHS conference report.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the subcommittee chairman. Mr. Chairman, I \nshould add that there are many sources of information that only the \nfederal government has the means and resources to tap effectively. \nGathering this data may also prove helpful in reducing health care \ncosts, strengthening families, and improving the health and well-being \nof children.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Kansas for his work on this \nissue.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                         strengthen our sisters\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to ask the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill if they would consider a request I have concerning \nthe conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be happy to consider a request from by colleague \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I rise in support of Strengthen Our Sisters, a non-\nprofit, tax-exempt shelter in West Milford, New Jersey that has \nprovided homeless and battered women and children with safe shelter and \nsupportive services since 1988. The mission of Strengthen Our Sisters \nis to help women and children break the cycle of domestic violence and \nhomelessness, which, if unchecked, is passed from one generation to the \nnext. To date, Strengthen Our Sisters has experienced great success in \nfulfilling its mission as evidenced by its remarkable growth. While in \n1988, Strengthen Our Sisters started with an annual budget of less than \n$36,000, this year's budget stands at $1.3 million. Strengthen Our \nSister's continued growth is a result of their demonstrated expertise \nin management and dedicated and knowledgeable staff.\n  As a way to help more women, Strengthen Our Sisters would like to \nexpand the service their program offers for older women. In 1998, \nStrengthen Our Sisters served four women over age fifty-five, a number \nthat jumped to fourteen in the span of less than a\n\n[[Page S6207]]\n\nyear. The older women they serve often arrive with long histories of \nabuse that requires special services related to domestic violence, drug \nand alcohol addictions, unemployment and mental health. Indeed, the \nneed for assistance naturally increases as we grow older. And, adding \nlife changing circumstances such as abuse, homelessness and physical \nchallenges to the equation increases the need for assistance \nexponentially. Thus, Strengthen Our Sisters would like to expand the \nservices its program offers to address the needs of senior women in a \ncomprehensive and integrative manner that focuses on helping them \nattain appropriate shelter, resources and advocacy services.\n  The work of Strengthen Our Sisters is an appropriate focus for the \nCommittee because domestic violence is a national epidemic. Expanding \nthe Strengthen Our Sisters program to help senior women could be a \nmodel for shelters across the country that are confronting similar \nproblems and population trends.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the past, we have faced difficult choices in making a \ndetermination of funding priorities and this year promises to be no \nexception. We are aware of the request by Strengthen Our Sisters and \ncommend their efforts toward expanding its program to serve more women \nin need. In conference, we will keep in mind your request as well as \nthose with similar meritorious characteristics and goals.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my distinguished colleague for his assistance \nwith this matter. I am thankful for the Committee's acknowledgment of \nthe expertise and dedication that Strengthen Our Sisters brings to \nhelping our most vulnerable population and I hope that funding for this \nimportant organization can be found in conference.\n\n\n  comprehensive school reform funding in labor hhs appropriations bill\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Senator Lugar, I know you're aware of the tremendous \ngood that the Comprehensive School Reform program (CSRD) has introduced \nto many struggling schools with high proportions of disadvantaged \nstudents, and the potential that the program offers for the numerous \nschools that desire to implement comprehensive reform in their \nbuildings. While I recognize the considerable task of Chairman Spector \nand Ranking Member Harkin in accommodating the great number of \npriorities funded in the FY'01 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, \nit concerns me that the bill before us provides no funds for the CSRD--\na tremendously popular and effective program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree that few areas of our education funding can have a \nmore positive impact on education in America than the CSRD. This \nprogram is a key tool for helping struggling schools adopt important \nreforms. Good reform programs are a bargain for our schools and our \nchildren when we compare their costs to that of retention, special \neducation and illiteracy. In fact, I filed an amendment to S. 2, \nlegislation crafted to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, that would have more than doubled funding for this \nimportant program. Unfortunately, this bill has been set aside.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The notion of systematic, comprehensive reform is \ninherently appealing because rather than piecing together discordant or \nincompatible pieces of change, these approaches provide a holistic and \ncoordinated plan of action to improve student achievement and outcomes. \nI know that a number of research-based models of comprehensive school \nreform have been developed in recent years, and one that I am familiar \nwith and which has spurred great progress across New Mexico is the \nSuccess for All program.\n  Success for All is serving about 1550 elementary schools in 48 \nstates, and is also assisting related projects in five other countries. \nFifty schools in New Mexico have adopted this program with great \nresults.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Success for All is an exemplary research-based reform \nprogram. I have spent time with Dr. Slavin, who developed this program \nat Johns Hopkins, and I have been visiting Success for All schools in \nIndiana. The results in these schools are so promising that I have \nwritten to every superintendent in Indiana urging them to take a look \nat the program.\n  The discipline and accountability of Success for All greatly reduce \nthe possibility that students will fail. By teaching children to read \nin the early grades, our schools can avoid holding students back, \npromoting them with insufficient ability or transferring them out of \nthe normal curriculum to special education courses. Referrals to \nspecial education in Success for All schools have been shown to \ndecrease by approximately 50 percent. In schools where Success for All \nis taught, students learn to read by the end of the third grade. By the \nfifth grade, students in these schools are often testing a full grade \nlevel ahead of students in other schools.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It is clear that as we seek ways to assist resource-\npoor and failing schools, we should increase support for research-based \nproven programs like Success for All. The House bill included the \namount requested by the Administration--$240,000,000--for this program \nand I know that Senators Specter and Harkin are supporters of the \nprogram. So, I'd like to encourage the Senators to include funding for \nit as the bill moves to conference. Funding at this level would allow \napproximately 2,250 schools to receive new grants and continue support \nfor 1,025 schools currently using such funds to carry out research-\nbased school reforms. It is my hope that we can work together as the \nbill moves through the appropriations process to fund this successful \nprogram.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senators Lugar and Bingaman make some very valid points \nwith respect to the comprehensive school reform program. In conference \nwith the House, I will make every effort to work with the Conferees to \nprovide adequate resources for the CSRD.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree that the comprehensive school reform program has \nhad a positive impact in many of our schools. As the bill moves to \nconference, I will work with Chairman Specter to restore funding for \nthis program.\n\n\n   RELIEF FOR DISPLACED COAL WORKERS IN INDIANA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nwith Chairman Specter the plight of nearly 1,000 displaced coal workers \nin southwestern Pennsylvania. As Senator Specter is aware, these \nemployees of Consol Coal have recently lost their jobs and have sought \nfederal assistance to provide a wide variety of adjustment assistance \nservices including occupational skills training, career plan \ndevelopment, and job search assistance.\n  As my colleague knows, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had requested \nover $12 million in an emergency grant application that was submitted \nto the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to the services already \nmentioned, needs-related payments were requested in order to provide \nincome support to workers who participated in retraining activities. \nThese payments are essential as they provide a modest source of income \nfor the workers while they are pursuing additional skills and education \nin order to prepare for a new vocation. Unfortunately, the Department \nof Labor only funded a portion of the request, indicating that needs-\nrelated payments could not exceed 25 percent of the total application. \nHowever, in the past the Department has not held similar applications \nto the same standard. In fact, I have been made aware of a grant award \nfor mine workers who requested needs-related payments in excess of 70 \npercent of the total grant application.\n  Knowing of the need of these displaced coal workers and the \ninconsistency of the Department of Labor in awarding funds, I ask that \nChairman Specter work with me in the coming weeks to identify \nappropriate funds in the Department of Labor's budget to support these \nworkers as they prepare for new careers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, for his comments. He has been a tireless advocate of \nthe coal workers in Indiana County, and I applaud his efforts on their \nbehalf.\n  I, too, am well aware of the situation being faced by the former \nemployees of Consol Coal and wrote to the Department of Labor on \nJanuary 31, 2000 to urge that federal retraining funds be made \navailable. As my colleagues are aware, we face tight budget constraints \nin this legislation. I will continue working with my colleague from \nPennsylvania in the coming weeks in an effort to identify sources of \nfunding that may be available for this purpose.\n\n[[Page S6208]]\n\n                   graduate medical education program\n\n  Mr. MACK. Will the Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be pleased to yield to the Senator from Florida \nfor a question.\n  Mr. MACK. I was most pleased to see that the Senate report \naccompanying this bill urged the Department to act in a timely manner \nto issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to include psychology into \nthe Graduate Medical Education program. As you know, the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways & Means Committee have been working with \nthe Department of Health and Human Services on this matter since 1997. \nBoth the Conference Report on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Report \n105-217 issued on July 30, 1997) and the Conference Report on last \nyear's Omnibus bill (Report 106-479 issued on November 18, 1999) urged \nthe Department to act favorably on this matter. In fact last year's \nConference Report urged the Secretary to issue Notice of Rule Making to \naccomplish this modification before June 1, 2000.\n  Mr. President, we thank you for including language in your report--\nReport 106-292--to further support this effort. I am saddened to report \nthat the advice the Appropriations Committee has given the Secretary is \nbeing given little notice, just like all the previous requests to her \non this matter. Mr. President, at this point, I would request unanimous \nconsent that a letter I wrote to Secretary Shalala, along with Senator \nGraham, Congressman Shaw, and Congresswoman Thurman on April 27, 1998 \nbe published in the Record, following this colloquy.\n  Mr. President, many letters have been written to the Secretary and \nNancy Ann Min DeParle, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, on this subject. Language has been included in two \nFinance/Ways & Means Conference Reports on this subject. Language has \nbeen included in the L-HHS Report. Despite all of these urgings, the \ndesired result has not been produced. Would the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee consider including bill language in the final bill \nmandating this action if the Department has not issued the Notice of \nProposed Rule Making by the time the Subcommittee goes to Conference \nwith the House.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be pleased to look at this matter between now \nand the time of Conference.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I understand that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration has now cleared the NPRM, but there are other \nDepartmental Agencies who now have questions about issuing the NPRM. I \nalso concur with my colleague Senator Mack, that this issue has \nremained unresolved for too long, and I also believe it would be \nappropriate to include language to mandate this change.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his response to our inquiry.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 1998.\n     Hon. Donna Shalala,\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Shalala: The purpose of this letter is to \n     bring to your attention report language included in the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) and to request \n     implementation of the language at the earliest possible date. \n     The language stated: ``With regard to graduate medical \n     education payments, the Committee also notes that the \n     Secretary reimburses for the training of certain allied \n     health professionals, and urges the Secretary to include \n     physician assistants and psychologists under such \n     authority.''\n       The Graduate Medical Education (GME) program currently \n     supports the training of 13 allied health professions \n     including hospital administration, medical records, x-ray \n     technology, dietetic internships and inhalation therapy. We \n     believe the cost of including two additional health \n     professions in the GME program, as recommended by the Senate \n     Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, \n     would be small and offset by the additional benefits to \n     patient care.\n       In our view, including psychologists and physicians \n     assistants in the GME program would be of significant benefit \n     to Medicare patients. For example, there is an excellent \n     program at the University of Florida where clinical \n     psychologists, working in Shands Teaching Hospital, treat a \n     variety of individuals with medical and psychological \n     disorders. This program operated at and supported financially \n     by Shands University Hospital contributes significantly to \n     patient care and is the kind of program the Conference \n     Committee considered appropriate for GME reimbursement.\n       We look forward to hearing from you regarding early \n     implementation of the Conference language.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Hon. E. Clay Shaw,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Hon. Karen L. Thurman,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n\n child health institute of the university of medicine and dentistry of \n             new jersey-robert wood johnson medical school\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I rise for the purpose of engaging the Chairman, Mr. \nSpecter, in a colloquy.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I'd be happy to join my colleague from New Jersey in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I would like to take this opportunity to express my \nsupport for a very important initiative to both myself, the State of \nNew Jersey, and the Nation. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of \nNew Jersey (UMDNJ)-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has developed the \nChild Health Institute (CHI) of New Jersey--a comprehensive biomedical \nresearch center focused on the development, growth and maturation of \nchildren. The mission of the Institute is to improve the health and \nquality of life of children by fostering scientific research that will \nproduce new discoveries about the causes of many childhood diseases as \nwell as the treatments for these diseases. Researchers will direct \ntheir efforts toward the prevention and cure of environmental, genetic \nand cellular diseases of infants and children.\n  The hospitals in central New Jersey birth nearly 20,000 babies each \nyear. The founding of the Child Health Institute has created an \nextraordinary health care resource for these hospitals and the patients \nthey serve. The new Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson \nUniversity Hospital is scheduled to open in 2000 and the Child Health \nInstitute in 2001. Together these institutions will provide state of \nthe art clinical and scientific research and treatment complex to serve \nchildren and their families, not only in New Jersey, but throughout the \nnation with cutting edge care and the latest scientific developments.\n  At maturity, the Child Health Institute is also expected to attract \nbetween $7 and $9 million of new research funding annually with the \ntotal economic impact on the New Brunswick area estimated to be $50 to \n$60 million per year. This facility has also already attracted the \nprivate funding of two endowed professorships designed to allow \nrecruitment of world-class faculty.\n  Mr. President, funding for the University of Medicine and Dentistry's \nChild Health Institute in this bill would be entirely appropriate under \nthe Health Resources and Services Administration account. It would be \nmoney well spent. I ask the Chairman to consider providing $5 million \nfor the completion of the Child Health Institute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for his comments. We have received \nnumerous requests for funding of health facilities. In the past, we \nhave faced difficult choices in making a determination of funding \npriorities and this year promises to be no exception. We are aware of \nthe request by the Child Health Institute and commend their efforts \ntoward enhancing its research and service capacity. In Conference, we \nwill keep in mind your request as well as those with similar \nmeritorious characteristics and goals.\n\n\n                        antimicrobial resistance\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is my understanding that, in view of the pressing \nneed to deal with both infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistant \ndiseases, the Chairman will agree that in conference there will be a \ntotal of at least $25 million in new funds to deal with the problem of \nantimicrobial resistance and that the total to deal with other \ninfectious diseases will be at least at the level included in the \nSenate bill prior to the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend my colleagues, Senator Specter and Senator \nCochran, for their leadership in having reached agreement on this \nimportant issue. The resources provided under this agreement are an \nimportant first\n\n[[Page S6209]]\n\nstep in addressing the critical problem of antimicrobial resistance. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this important \nissue as the Senate considers the legislation on infectious diseases, \nantimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism that I have introduced with \nmy colleague, Senator Frist.\n\n\n                    least toxic pesticides policies\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last March, the Senate passed an \namendment I offered to the Education Savings Accounts bill that said \nschools receiving federal funds must notify parents prior to the \napplication of toxic pesticides on school buildings and grounds. It \nalso required the distribution of the Environmental Protection Agency's \nmanual that guides schools in establishing a least toxic pesticide \npolicy.\n  I offered that amendment for a simple reason. Toxic pesticides hurt \nour kids, and that hurts the education of our kids. The National \nAcademy of Sciences has found that up to 25 percent of childhood \nlearning disabilities may be attributable to a combination of exposure \nto toxic chemicals like pesticides and genetic factors. Yet, current \nEPA pesticide standards are not protective of children, and schools \nacross America--where our children spend 6 or 7 or more hours a day--\nroutinely use toxic pesticides. My amendment sought to lessen the \nimpact of toxic pesticides on our children by urging schools to use the \nkinds of products that will harm children the least and to let parents \nknow when toxic pesticides are going to be used.\n  Again, my amendment was added to the Education Savings Accounts bill. \nHowever, that bill has not gone anywhere since the Senate passed it on \nMarch 2. I could offer my amendment to the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act bill, but it, too, appears dead.\n  So, I drafted an amendment to the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill to \nprovide $100,000 for the Department of Education, in conjunction with \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, to encourage school districts \nacross the country to establish a least toxic pesticide policy--which \nis the policy in several school districts in California--and to notify \nparents prior to the use on school grounds of pesticides that the EPA \nhas identified as a known or probable carcinogen, a category I or II \nacute nerve toxin, or a pesticide of the organophosphate, carbamate, or \norganochlorine class.\n  At the suggestion of my friend from Iowa, the Ranking Member of the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I will not offer that amendment \nbecause I understand that the managers will work to add language in the \nconference report that would accomplish the same thing. May I ask the \nChairman and Ranking Member if that is correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nbringing this issue before the Senate. I support what she is trying to \ndo, and I think we can accomplish it through language in the conference \nreport rather than as an amendment to the bill itself. I assure her \nthat I will work to include such language in the report.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will also work to see that language is \nincluded in the conference report encouraging the Department of \nEducation to urge schools to adopt a least toxic pesticide policy and \nto provide the information and support necessary to do so.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my collegues.\n\n\n  employment and training grants for dislocated worker employment and \n                          training activities\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to raise the issue of how \nthe United States Department of Labor is administering Grants for \nDislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities.\n  Both the FY 1999 and 2000 Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill contained \nearmarks critically important to New Mexico's economic well-being. The \nearmarks were directed toward training workers for the State's rapidly \ngrowing technology-based call center industry.\n  In fact, the industry is generating in excess of 450 jobs per month \nthat pay approximately $11 per hour with substantial benefits in New \nMexico. These grants would allow for the continued expansion of this \nindustry by allowing the New Mexico Consortium to create a training \ncurriculum that will lead to employment in the call center industry \nwith an emphasis on the placement of hard-to-employ individuals.\n  However, the Department of Labor's actions regarding these earmarks \nhas left me deeply distressed by the ill treatment New Mexico has \nreceived, especially in light of the priority placed on this issue by \nnot only me but, the Committee as well.\n  It is also my understanding the current program year for the \nDepartment of Labor ends this Friday, June 30th and that there may be \nunobligated funds left over at that time. It is also my further \nunderstanding that in the event there are such unobligated funds the \nDepartment could provide some of these funds to a deserving program, \nlike the training program in New Mexico.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the concerns raised by the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico in ensuring the Department of Labor properly \nfunds the projects specified by this Committee.\n  I would concur with my colleague from New Mexico in the importance of \nfunding the program to train workers for the State's rapidly growing \ntechnology-based call center industry. In the event there are \nunobligated funds left over at the end of the Department's current \nprogram year, I would also urge the Secretary of Labor to consider \nallocating funding for the training program in New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his \nconsideration and support for this important matter.\n\n\n               low-income home energy assistance program\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I rise in hope that Chairman Specter and Ranking \nMember Harkin of the Labor-HHS Appropriation Subcommittee will engage \nin a colloquy with myself and Senator Jeffords, Chairman of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, on the importance of advance \nfunding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).\n  I had initially planned to offer an amendment, with Senators \nJeffords, Kohl, Lieberman, Levin, Schumer, Reed, Dodd, Kennedy, and \nLeahy, that would restore advance funding for this essential program. \nHowever, since it is my understanding that my colleagues will work in \nthe conference to ensure that the House provision for advance LIHEAP \nfunding is included in the final appropriation bill, I will withdraw my \namendment.\n  As my colleagues know, there is broad bipartisan, multi-regional \nsupport for LIHEAP. This year, 46 Senators signed a letter in support \nof the program. Specifically, we asked for $1.4 billion in regular \nLIHEAP funding, along with $300 million in emergency funding. In \naddition, we urged $1.5 billion in advance LIHEAP funding for fiscal \nyear 2002. It is the lack of this advance funding in the Senate Labor-\nHHS appropriation bill that causes me great concern.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Minnesota is often called the ice-box \nof the nation, where bitterly cold weather is the norm. In fact, \nMinnesota is the third coldest state, in terms of heating degree days, \nin the country, after Alaska and North Dakota. Especially in cold-\nweather states like Minnesota, funding for LIHEAP is critical to \nfamilies with children and vulnerable low-income elderly persons, who \nwithout it could be forced to choose between food and heat.\n  As we saw several years ago, when the Federal government shut down, \npiecemeal funding approved for LIHEAP had an extremely disruptive \neffect on the operation of the energy programs in the states. \nCongressional delay and enactment of appropriations bills after October \n1 severely hampers states abilities to effectively plan their energy \nassistance programs. States operating year-round programs or those that \nbegin in September are particularly threatened. Therefore, advance \nappropriations enable the creation of administrative systems for more \nefficient program management, allowing for orderly planning of state \nLIHEAP programs.\n  Will the Chairman work in conference to include this critical advance \nfunding appropriation in the final Labor-HHS appropriation bill?\n  Mr. SPECTER. As you know, this is a very difficult year for \nappropriators. The budget caps are very tight, and this bill contains \nmany valuable programs. I recognize and appreciate that the House-\npassed Labor-HHS bill provides $1.1 billion in FY2002 advance\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\nLIHEAP funding. I have been a strong supporter of the LIHEAP program, \nand will work in conference to attempt to include the House provision \nfor advance LIHEAP funding in the final appropriation bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First, Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for your hard \nwork on this appropriation bill, and your dedication to the LIHEAP \nprogram. Next, I would just like to emphasize the importance of the \nforward funding provision contained in the 1990 reauthorization \nstatute--the Augustus F. Hawkins Human Services Reauthorization Act.\n  This provision responds to the states' need to budget and plan their \nLIHEAP programs in advance of the fall/winter heating season, allowing \nthem to effectively meet their obligations under the law. Timely energy \nassistance in the form of consistent advance LIHEAP funding is critical \nto the success of LIHEAP. For planning purposes, the states have come \nto rely on the predictability that your advance funding mark provides \nthem.\n  Our Northeast-Midwest region has experienced extreme fuel price \nspikes during the last six months, highlighting the vulnerability of \nour low income energy consumers. With fuel prices projected to be even \nhigher this winter than last, we need an effective LIHEAP program more \nnow than ever. It is the most effective tool we have to ensure the \nsafety of our low income households during severe weather conditions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree that the importance of LIHEAP advance funding has \nbeen demonstrated this past year as many states have faced extreme \ntemperatures and high fuel costs. LIHEAP advance funding is an \neffective tool that allows states to determine eligibility, establish \nthe size of the benefits, determine the parameters of the crisis \nprograms and enable the states to properly budget for staffing needs. I \nwill work with Chairman Specter to attempt to include the House \nprovision for $1.1 billion in FY2002 advance LIHEAP funding in the \nfinal appropriation bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Harkin and \nSenator Jeffords. I appreciate your commitment to work in conference on \nbehalf of LIHEAP, and I withdraw the amendment.\n\n\n                     centers for independent living\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to thank the subcommittee chairman for \nincluding a $10 million increase for Centers for Independent Living, \npart C. However, because of the formula in current law, eighteen states \ndo not receive any increase in funding. I understand that many of the \nsmaller states have not received an increase since 1992. It is not my \nintention to change the funding formula in an appropriations bill, but \nI believe this problem needs to be addressed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the Senator bringing this to my attention, \nand am willing to hear the solution the Senator from Utah proposes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The National Council on Independent Living and \nindividuals in my own state of Utah, are concerned about individuals \nwith disabilities who reside in underserved areas. NCIL has proposed \nchanging the formula for Centers for Independent Living, part C. Under \ntheir proposal, fifty percent of funding will be distributed equally \namong the states, and fifty percent will be divided among the states \nbased on population.\n  Instead of amending the Rehabilitation Act in this bill to \npermanently change the formula on this appropriations bill, I propose \n$5 million of the $10 million increase included in H.R. 4577, be \ndivided equally among the states. The remaining $5 million would be \ndistributed based on current law. Thus every state will receive a \nfunding increase. In small states, this small amount translates to \nroughly $94,000. Based on letters and phone calls I have received, it \nappears that the coalition of Independent Living Centers across the \ncountry are amenable to this proposal--even the larger states.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator's \nsensitivity to changing authorizing language in this bill. I also share \nhis concerns about the needs of individuals with disabilities in \nunderserved areas, and I will address this issue as we proceed through \nthe appropriations process.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate the chairman's consideration. It is my hope \nthat we can reach an agreement that will increase the ability for \nCenters for Independent Living to serve the needs of individuals with \ndisabilities not only in large states, but in smaller, underserved \narea.\n\n\n                       vocational rehabilitation\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator \nSpecter and Senator Harkin for their leadership and continued funding \nof the Vocational Rehabilitation program, which is so important to the \ndisabled men and women in New York State and across the country.\n  I would like to take a moment to engage my colleague in a colloquy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his kind words and would be happy \nto engage in a colloquy with him.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In Fiscal Year 2000, Congress provided a 1.2 percent \ninflationary increase to the Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants \nprogram, which is distributed through a statutory formula using \npopulation and per capita income data. In October of 1999, the Bureau \nof Economic Analysis released new estimates of per capita income \nresulting in a drastic change in the funding allocation to states. \nUnder these comprehensive revisions, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado, \nMinnesota, Texas, and the District of Columbia lost funding to a level \nbelow that of their Fiscal Year 1999 funding. This shift was both \nunexpected and severe, leaving these states' agencies unable to assist \nhundreds of physically or mentally disabled men and women needing \nassistance toward gainful employment. In my own state of New York, we \nlost $1.6 million from our initially expected amount.\n  Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Harkin for committing to add \nreport language during the conference committee negotiations of the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Bill for \nFiscal Year 2001 that will enable the Department of Education to give \npriority status under Fiscal Year 2000 re-allotment funds to States who \nreceived less under the formula in Fiscal Year 2000 than in Fiscal Year \n1999, and who are able to meet the criteria outlined in Section \n110(b)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am pleased to help the Senator from New York and his \ncolleagues from the other affected states and the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from New York for his effort on this \nissue and will do my best to resolve this situation in conference.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       advanced placement funding\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Senators Specter and Harkin, I'd like to express my \nappreciation to you and your committee members for agreeing on the \nimportance of the Advanced Placement (AP) Incentive Program by \nrecommending that it be funded at $20,000,000--a $5,000,000 increase \nover last year's appropriation. As you know, the AP program provides \nrigorous instruction to high school students by teachers who have had \nadditional, intensive professional development. While historically it \nwas the well-to-do elite that had access to these courses--which not \nonly cover advanced material but enable students to gain college credit \nand advanced standing--today the AP program continues to expand its \nreach, so that over half of all high schools in the nation offer AP \ncourses in a variety of subject areas. The fact of the matter is that \nin this era of focus on high standards and improving student \nachievement, the AP program offers proven impact on student outcomes in \nhigh school, and there is even research that shows that regardless of \nthe grade attained, a student who has access to more rigorous course \nwork in high school is more likely to complete college.\n  As you know, the AP Incentive Program helps ensure that AP classes \nare within reach of low income students by subsidizing the cost of \ntaking the AP test. These tests cost about $100 and many low income \nstudents would have to pass up the opportunity to take it due to \nexpense. The program also supports activities designed to expand access \nto AP courses, particularly in low income areas. Many schools do not \nyet have AP programs and schools with large minority and low income \npopulations are less likely to offer AP courses. This can be tragic for \nmany students, as many colleges and universities consider whether a \nstudent has\n\n[[Page S6211]]\n\ntaken AP classes when making admissions decisions. Every student--\nregardless of socioeconomic background--should have the opportunity to \nattend college and to take challenging curriculum in high school. This \nprogram helps to ensure both.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree wholeheartedly with you on the importance of \nensuring that all students are exposed to challenging courses that lead \nthem on a positive track towards further education, and that teach \ncritical skills that can be practically applied even if the student \ndoes not continue their education immediately. While it is certainly \njust one piece of the puzzle when it comes to strengthening the \nacademic offerings and outcomes for all students, including \ndisadvantaged students, the AP program is something I think we should \nall be able to agree on supporting.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I also want to share my thanks for the Committee's \nattention to the benefits of Internet-based AP programs, particularly \nin rural and Native American areas of the country. As technological \ncapacities at schools increase, there is every reason to utilize such \ntools to deliver high-quality programs like AP courses through distance \nmethods, especially in schools where the student population is too \nsmall or location is too remote to sustain a great deal of variety on-\nsite. I look forward to working with you and the Administration to \nexpand support for these kinds of innovative means of advanced \ninstructional delivery to our rural and Native American schools.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree that Advanced Placement programs can be \nextremely valuable in raising standards in high schools and helping \nhigh school students to be better prepared for postsecondary education. \nI am glad that we were able to provide an increase in funding for this \nprogram and, in conference with the House, I will make every effort to \nwork with the Conferees to maintain funding for this program.\n\n\n smaller learning communities funding in labor hhs appropriations bill\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate \nmy hope that the conferees on the Appropriations Committee will \nconsider restoring funding for the Smaller Learning Communities program \nunder the Fund for the Improvement of Education. Last 7ear $45 million \nwas appropriated for what has been a very important initiative an the \nPresident has requested $120 million for FY2001. I strongly believe \nthat we must continue--and indeed increase--our support for this \nprogram. As this appropriations bill goes to conference, I hope that \nyou and your fellow committee members will decide to meet the \nPresident's request.\n  A number of research studies in recent years have documented the \nvalue of small schools and smaller learning communities, and the Bank \nStreet College of Education just last week release a new study called \n``Small Schools: Great Strides,'' which unequivocally confirms what we \nknew from earlier research--namely, that small schools help students \nsucceed. This particular study examined the 150 or so small schools \nthat were founded between 1990 and 1997 in Chicago, and tracks their \nprogress through 1999. In these elementary schools of fewer than 350 \nstudents and these high schools of fewer than 400 students, the \npositive trends encompass everything from diminished violence to higher \ngrade point averages and attendance rates. Of course, small size alone \ndoes not translate into these positive changes, but it certainly does \nfoster the atmosphere of closeness and community that is conducive to \nthe kinds of progress that our parents, teachers, and students are \nseeking.\n  Based on studies of high school violence, researchers have concluded \nthat the first step in ending school violence must be to break through \nthe impersonal atmosphere of large high schools by creating smaller \ncommunities of learning within larger structures, where teachers and \nstudents can come to know each other well. We really cannot wait for \nmore tragedies of students shooting students or teachers before we act \nto fix the situation.\n  And just as important, particularly in our search for what works to \nimprove student achievement, is that smaller school size also \npositively impacts learning. Research demonstrates that small schools \noutperform large schools on every measure of student outcomes, \nincluding grades, test scores, attendance, and graduation rates. In the \nBank Street study, nearly twice as many students enrolled in smaller \nlearning communities contained within larger high schools scored at or \nabove national norms in reading compared to their peers. This impact is \neven greater for ethnic minority and low-income students.\n  In addition, smaller learning communities enhance the school \nexperience for both teachers and students--research shows that smaller \nschools generate greater community and parental involvement, and a more \nengaged and enthusiastic staff. Research also shows that students at \nsmaller schools are more likely to participate in extracurricular \nactivities, and in a greater variety of activities--because everyone is \nneeded to fill out the teams, clubs, and offices, even shy and less \nable students are more likely to participate and develop a sense of \nbelonging.\n  Furthermore, contrary to what some may think, small schools can be \ncreated cost effectively. Larger schools can be more expensive because \ntheir sheer size requires more administrative support, and because \nsmall schools have higher graduation rates, the actual cost per \ngraduating student is lower than at large schools.\n  I certainly hope that we do not turn our backs on this initiative, \nwhich we already know from research is a worthwhile investment that has \nreal impact on school climate and student safety, as well as on student \nmorale and achievement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for sharing your knowledge on this \nresearch-proven method of educational reform. As we make the difficult \ndecisions about what should be funding priorities for the Federal \ngovernment in the vast expanse of options, we certainly do need to be \nacutely aware of what has been demonstrated as having measurable \npositive impact on real students. As we move to conference on this \nappropriations bill, I will encourage everyone to consider the good \nthat smaller learning communities can do for all students, including \nthose for whom just a little extra attention and sense of belonging can \nmean the difference between violent outbursts as a cry for help and \nsuccessful completion of high school with goals for the future.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Bingaman has made some very valid points with \nrespect to the research on small schools. In conference with the House, \nI will make every effort to work with the Conferees to provide adequate \nresources for the smaller learning communities program.\n\n\n                         rural healthcare needs\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to engage my colleagues from Pennsylvania and \nIowa on a couple of issues relating to the Fiscal Year 2001 Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. Access to \nhealthcare in Montana is often inadequate. I would like to focus on a \ncouple of projects that must be addressed in the state in order to \naddress some immediate rural healthcare needs. The first is a mobile \nhealth clinic. St. Vincent Hospital in Billings has partnered with \nRonald McDonald House Charities to operate a mobile health clinic in \nEastern Montana. They hope to begin operating this clinic later this \nyear. This mobile health clinic will focus on providing preventive \nhealth care to children at no cost in small rural communities. These \ncommunities are in dire need of medical services. Mr. Chairman, Mr. \nHarkin, this is no small matter--31 Montana counties are designated as \n``medically underserved'' by the Health Resources Services \nAdministration (HRSA). Twenty-three percent of Montanans lack access to \na primary health care provider.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the Senator's concerns and agree with him \nabout the unique healthcare needs and problems with access in rural \nareas.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As a Senator from Iowa, I understand quite well the \nchallenges to access to care posed in rural states.\n  Mr. BURNS. The second concern is the fact that there is a need for \nadditional dental hygienists, but Montana is the only state without a \ndental hygiene education program. There are currently 333 active \nlicensed dental hygienists in Montana. A survey of all Montana dentists \nand dental hygienists\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\nwas conducted late in 1996 which indicated a need for additional \nhygienists to fill current and future vacancies. The lack of a dental \nhygienist in a practice reduces the number of hours the dentist is \navailable to deliver care only he or she is able to perform. Licensure \nas a registered dental hygienist in Montana requires graduation from an \naccredited dental hygiene program of either two or four years. \nMontana's only dental hygiene education program was closed in 1989 at \nCarroll College. Since that time efforts to open a new program have \nbeen unsuccessful, but are ongoing. Montana students desiring hygiene \ndegrees must travel out of State. Of the current 28 students at \nSheridan Community College in Wyoming, half are from Montana. Montana \nhas fewer dentists per capita than the U.S. average. Many communities, \nespecially rural areas, are losing dentists (to retirements and other \nfactors). A large percentage of Montana dentists are expected to retire \nin the coming decade, while the number of available dental school \ngraduates has been declining. With two-thirds of Montana's active \ndentists age 45 years or older and more than a quarter over age 55, \nconcerns over the effect of retirement in coming years has grown. If a \ndental hygiene program were established in Montana, hygiene graduates \nwould be available to perform hygiene tasks which presently are being \nperformed by dentists. This would free the dentists to perform \ndiagnosis and treatment services which only the dentist is trained to \nprovide. The establishment of this program would be of vital importance \nto eliminating the strong prevalence of under-served areas in Montana.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have rural states in need of programs which improve \nboth access and quality of care. I believe these projects are worthy, \nand I will consider them during the conference agreement. I appreciate \nyour bringing these issues of my attention.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand the nature of the problem in Montana \nrequires attention. I thank the Senator for bringing these issues to my \nattention. Chairman Specter and I will give them consideration during \nconference.\n\n\n                              leap funding\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to engage Senators Specter and Harkin \nin a colloquy regarding funding for the Leveraging Educational \nAssistance Partnership (LEAP) program.\n  First, I want to commend Senators Specter and Harkin for numerous \neducation funding increases in the Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education Appropriations bill. There are tough budget pressures \nfacing Senators Specter and Harkin, and they have done tremendous work \non this bill. In particular, I am pleased that they have increased \nfunding for the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) \nprogram to $70 million.\n  LEAP, a federal-state partnership, is vital to our efforts to help \nneedy students attend and graduate from college. In fact, without this \nimportant federal incentive, many states would never have established \nor maintained their need-based financial aid programs.\n  Over the past three years, I have worked with Senator Collins and \nothers in the Senate to restore, revamp, and increase funding for LEAP. \nThis year, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations bill provides $70 million for LEAP. While this funding \nlevel is less than the bipartisan request that I submitted with 32 of \nmy colleagues, it is a significant increase over current funding and \nthe President's request. This would be the biggest boost for the \nprogram in some time, and, as such, I decided not to offer an amendment \nto further increase funding for LEAP.\n  However, I am concerned that during Conference with the House, which \nhas once again zero-funded the program, LEAP will not remain at the \nSenate's $70 million funding level. This concern is also shared by the \nhigher education community, which strongly supports the Senate's $70 \nmillion for LEAP. Would the Chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator. Does the Senator share my concern \nabout maintaining the Senate's $70 million for LEAP and is the \nSenator's intent to fight for this level in Conference?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I share the Senator's support for our Subcommittee's \nfunding level for LEAP and will work during Conference to preserve it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would also like to voice my support for preserving the \nSubcommittee's funding level for LEAP.\n  Mr. REED. I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n     the role of human factors research in reducing medical errors\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, will the Chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. First, I want to compliment the Chairman and the \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee on their hard work in producing this \nbill for the consideration of the Senate. I would also compliment the \nCommittee for addressing the medical errors issue. Medical errors \naccount for as many as 98,000 deaths each year making it the 5th \nleading cause of death in America. It is therefore appropriate that the \nCommittee has recommended an allocation of $50 million to the Agency \nfor Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to focus on ways to reduce \nmedical errors.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also want to express my support for the \nefforts outlined in this bill to reduce medical errors. It is my hope \nthat these measures will set us on the path of constructively \naddressing this troubling issue.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In hearings before the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee we heard expert testimony regarding the contribution \nto increased safety made by human factors research in industries such \nas defense and aviation. This field of research maximizes the \nefficiency and accuracy of the interface of humans with equipment, \ntechnology and the workplace environment.\n  Does the Chairman view human factors as a field of research that \ncould make an important contribution toward reducing medical errors?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nNevada for highlighting this matter. Yes, the field of human factors \nresearch clearly is a field that can make an important contribution \ntoward reducing medical errors. I am also aware that the National \nAcademy of Sciences has developed an expertise in this field and I \nwould urge the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to call on \nthe expertise of the National Academy of Sciences as it addresses the \nmedical errors issue.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chairman for his response.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know that Senators Specter and Harkin \nworked diligently to craft a bill that could gain broad support. But \nduring the floor debate, Republicans weakened this bill in critical \nways that shortchange children in their education, subject hundreds of \nthousands of American workers to ergonomic injuries, and promote a sham \npatients' bill of rights.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this bill, and I urge the President to \nveto it if it reaches his desk. America's schoolchildren, workers, \nseniors, and everyone with health needs deserve a much better bill.\n  Republicans' very first order of business in debating this bill was \nto delay the Department of Labor's proposed protections against \nergonomic injuries. Hundreds of thousands of American workers will \ncontinue to suffer these injuries if this bill is enacted. The \ncompanies that Republicans are helping in this bill have had years to \nstudy and respond to the overwhelming evidence that ergonomic standards \nimprove worker safety. Yet these special interests continue to oppose \nthese protections. This is unacceptable, and it alone warrants a veto \nof this bill.\n  Debate on many other parts of this bill fell into a regrettable \npattern. Time and again Democrats came to the floor with proposals to \nimprove schools, improve health care, or improve conditions in the \nworkplace. Republicans rejected the amendments, because the amendments \ndidn't allow room for the massive tax breaks they want, and the \namendments were defeated.\n  Republicans think they've already done enough for the health and \neducation of the American people. Democrats insist that more can be \ndone and\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\nshould be done. That is a fundamental difference between the two \nparties.\n  The amendments that Democrats proposed to this bill highlight the \nobvious needs that the nation should be meeting.\n  The health of senior citizens is needlessly at risk, because they \ndon't have affordable and dependable prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare.\n  Public schools across the country are literally falling apart. They \nneed help in repairing their crumbling facilities and modernizing their \nclassrooms.\n  One of every five children in the nation still lives in poverty. They \nlack educational opportunities at every step of the way from birth \nthrough college. They deserve a fair chance to do well in school--to go \nto college--to have a productive life and career.\n  The high-technology training needed to prepare the nation's workforce \nfor the future economy is out of reach for millions of Americans.\n  Democrats want to do more to solve these problems. But again and \nagain, our Republican colleagues refuse to act. Their refusal raises a \nfundamental question of priorities that the American people will decide \nin November if this impasse continues.\n  We have a budget surplus of $1.9 trillion over the next ten years. We \ncan afford more than token efforts to improve education, health care, \nand working conditions for the nation's families. We need major \nimprovements in current law--and we can afford them. They should be a \nhigh priority.\n  How long will we ignore the 20 percent of the nation's children who \nlive in poverty? How long will we ignore the third of senior citizens \nwho have no prescription drug coverage? How long will we send children \nto crumbling schools? How long will we refuse to address the hundreds \nof thousands of ergonomic injuries suffered by workers each year? Now \nis the time to deal with these festering problems.\n\n  In fiscal year 2001 alone, a $49 billion surplus is now projected. \nAll of the priorities I have described can be accommodated for a small \nfraction of this amount--and they should be accommodated. If we are \never going to make serious investments in the education of the nation's \nchildren, now is the time.\n  The record prosperity we are now enjoying also gives us an \nopportunity to save many more lives through better access to health \ncare. It gives us an opportunity to modernize Medicare by adding a \nlife-saving prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. It gives us \nan opportunity to provide many more children with a decent education \nand enable them to become full participants in the new economy. It \ngives us an opportunity to make every workplace safer, and to provide \nmillions of workers with the skills they need in this rapidly growing \nhigh tech economy.\n  We can do all this, and also provide responsible tax relief for the \nvast majority of our citizens. Democrats support targeted tax relief \nfor the nation's families, not the excessive and irresponsible tax \nbreaks for the wealthy that our Republican colleagues insist on.\n  The Republican estate tax relief bill alone would cost $105 billion \nin the first ten years, and $50 billion a year after that. It's the \nultimate tax break for the wealthy. Its relief goes to the wealthiest 2 \npercent of Americans--those who have prospered most in our record-\nbreaking economy--those who have no trouble affording education for \ntheir children, health care for their families, or the prescription \ndrugs they need.\n  Other Republican tax breaks now pending in the Senate would cost a \ntotal of $711 billion over the next ten years, exploding to even higher \ncosts in the following years. George W. Bush has proposed tax cuts that \nwould consume the entire $1.9 trillion budget surplus projected over \nthe next ten years.\n  If Republicans are willing to give even slightly less to those who \nalready have the most, we will have more than enough resources to \ndramatically improve education and health care for all Americans.\n  The American people should be very clear on this issue. The \nRepublican tax breaks are too extreme. They are keeping the nation from \nmeeting its high priority needs in education, heath care, the workplace \nand other vital areas. These needs can be met, if Congress has the will \nto meet them. As we head into the final weeks of this year's session, I \nurge my colleagues to do a better job of meeting these all-important \npriorities.\n  The anti-labor rider that Republicans attached to this bill on \nergonomics, combined with the failure to fund education priorities in \nclass size and school construction, would be enough alone for me to \nvote against this bill. But yesterday, Republicans added yet another \noffensive provision--a sham patients' bill of rights.\n  Republicans went on record in favor of weak health care protections \nfor Americans. And even those weak protections cover only a small \nfraction of the number of people who need protection. The Republican \nplan contains ineffective appeal procedures. These defects are the \nreason why the GOP plan is strongly opposed by all medical and nursing \norganizations and hundreds of patient groups and consumer groups across \nthe country. Only the insurance industry supports the Republican plan, \nbecause it's a plan that only an HMO could love.\n  This flawed bill should be defeated. The American people deserve far \nbetter than this.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to see the New-York \nHistorical Society mentioned in the Committee Report to the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations bill. The Society is a wonderful New York institution \nthat has outstanding collections and runs outstanding educational \nprograms. One such program would soon bring to the general public one \nof the nation's most extensive collections of Revolutionary War \nmaterials; documents, manuscripts, artifacts, and works of art. Tied to \nthe collection will be a program that will tie in with social studies \nand history classes across the nation.\n  The key components of this effort are digitization of primary \ndocuments and museum objects to make them available on the World Wide \nWeb and workshops for teachers to be held at the Historical Society to \nshow creative approaches to interpreting history using documents and \nartifacts. Video conferencing will make teacher workshops available \naround the country as well.\n  Published school curricula and resources kits based on the Society's \nRevolutionary collections will be available to teachers as well. There \nwill also be an interactive web site for teachers and students, a \nlinkage of the Society's library and museum collection databases, \nproviding one unified source of information on the collections. The \nSociety also hopes to develop a 30 minute interactive video in English \nand Spanish available in the Society headquarters and on the web. \nFinally, hand held scanners will give visitors instant electronic \naccess to information about the collections as they are viewed and \naccess to related websites.\n  Mr. President, the Historical Society has wonderful plans for its \nfuture. I hope we are able to assist with what is truly a project of \nnational scope when we finalize this bill during the coming \nmonths.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this appropriation bill contains funding \nfor many critical and quite frankly, essential programs benefitting \nmany segments of our society. This appropriation vehicle supplies \nimportant funding directly benefiting American families and senior \ncitizens while also providing important assistance to our most \nimportant resource, our children.\n  This appropriation bill provides funding for helping states and local \ncommunities educate our children. Additionally, it provides the \nnecessary funds for supporting our scientists dedicated to finding \ntreatments, if not cures, for many of the illnesses which plague our \nnation. This bill also provides funds for ensuring our nation's most \nvulnerable--our children, seniors and disabled have access to quality \nhealth care. In addition, it provides the monetary support for \nimportant programs assisting working families needing assistance with \nchild care, adult day care for elderly seniors and Meals on Wheels.\n  These are many important programs funded through this bill that help \nso many vulnerable citizens that I am even more frustrated to find this \nbill laden with directives and accounting gimmicks. I am particularly \ndisappointed that this bill redirects $1.9 billion from the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, to assist in funding other \nprograms and\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\nprojects. This is simply wrong and is nothing more than an accounting \ngimmick at the expense of the health of America's children. In \naddition, I am concerned about the significant reduction in Social \nServices Block Grant, SSBG.\n  I applaud the committee for including very few specific funding \nearmarks but am distressed about the extensive list of directives that \nhave been included. It is apparent that the plethora of directives and \nstrong committee language are intended to camouflage the number of \nspecific projects that are being provided special consideration and \nbypassing the appropriate competitive funding process. The list of set \nasides contained in this bill are so extensive that I will not burden \nthe chamber with listening to me list each one individually. Instead, I \nwill highlight just a few of the violations of the appropriate \nbudgetary review process. These include:\n\n  Language encouraging consideration of efforts by the University of \nPittsburgh Medical Center Health System, UPMC-HS, to implement a state-\nof-the-art Health System wide project to electronically store and \nprovide all clinical and administrative information in a secure and \nautomated manner.\n  Language encouraging additional funds for the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation in the southwestern corner of South Dakota which has a high \nincidence of alcohol addition.\n  Language encouraging consideration of a program at the Center Point, \nInc. which provides low-cost, comprehensive drug and alcohol services \nto high risk families and individuals in the San Francisco Bay area.\n  Language directing consideration of sufficient funds to continue West \nVirginia's Injury Control Training and Demonstration Center at the same \nlevel as last year.\n  Language directing consideration of the Lewis and Clark College's \nLife of the Mind Education initiative that develop an educational \nprogramming celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark \nexpedition and the Louisiana purchase.\n  The Committee is aware of the following projects that it encourages \nthe Department of Labor to consider supporting:\n  Workforce Training and Retraining for dislocated and incumbent \nworkers in real manufacturing environment--University of Albany, NY.\n  Workforce Development project to retain older incumbent workers for \nMontana workforce--Montana State University, Billings.\n  University of Alaska/Ketchikan Shipyards training program for \nshipyard workers.\n  State of New Mexico--telecommunications job training for dislocated \nworkers.\n  Clemson University, retraining of tobacco farmers.\n  While each of these programs may be just and deserving of funding it \nis appalable that these funds are specifically earmarked and not \nsubject to the appropriate competitive grant process. I am confident \nthat there are many facilities, health organizations, and educational \nsites around the nation needing financial assistance for their \nparticular programs who are not fortunate enough to have an advocate in \nthe Appropriation process to ensure that their funding is earmarked in \nthis funding bill. This is wrong and does a disservice to all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, so many important programs including those impacting \nthe health and education of our nation depends on the support provided \nthrough this bill and yet, we have diluted the positive impact of these \nprograms by siphoning away funds for specific projects or communities \nwhich are fortunate enough to have representation on the Appropriation \ncommittee.\n  We must find the courage to discard the spending gimmicks and \nearmarks contained in this bill during conference and provide the much \nneeded financial support for education, work training, children, health \ncare, research and senior programs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill is meant to address the needs of our nation's most \nprecious resource, our people. When a Labor, HHS bill is properly \nfunded, it ensures the health of our families, the education of our \nchildren and the safety of our workers. Unfortunately, the bill before \nus falls short and I will vote against it.\n  In March, I expressed my concerns that the Congressional Majority was \nnot sufficiently funding this part of the budget.\n  Today, in June, we can see specifically how those shortcomings will \nimpact the American people. While this bill does make some specific \ngains in key public health programs, the overall picture is lacking.\n  While I am pleased with some parts of this bill, I am voting against \nit because it does not make the necessary commitments to public health, \nworker safety, and reducing class sizes. We have a surplus and we can \ninvest in key programs like education, health care, job training, and \nwork place, but instead we are guided by a spending plan that places a \ngreater emphasis on irresponsible tax cuts.\n  Before I outline the specific reasons for my vote, I do want to thank \nthe Chairman for his hard work on this bill. He has been given an \nimpossible task, and he has still been able to make some key \ninvestments in vital health initiatives like the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, our efforts to reduce medical mistakes, and efforts to \nexpand medical services in rural areas through the use of telemedicine.\n  When it comes to funding the NIH, the additional $2.7 billion \nallocated in this bill is clearly a sound and wise investment. \nUnfortunately, we have not made the same investment in other important \nhealth care access and prevention programs, but I am committed to \nworking with the Chairman to maintain this level for NIH.\n  We also need to ensure that all public health agencies receive the \nsame level of commitment and support. Without the work and programs of \nCDC, HRSA, and FDA, research funded from NIH will never make it to \npatients.\n  We also need to show the same commitment to prevention programs and \nhealth care access programs that we have shown to NIH. What we \nsometimes forget is the number one killer in this country is \ncardiovascular disease, a disease that we can do more to prevent.\n  Another highlight of this bill is its support for innovative \nsolutions to prevent medical errors. The $50 million to fund new \nprojects to reduce medical mistakes is essential if we hope to \nimplement effective, constructive solutions. I believe this new funding \nwill provide support to hospitals and clinics to automate drug \ndispensing to reduce fatal errors from prescription drugs not \nadministered correctly. It will ensure that we utilize ``best \npractice'' standards when implementing automation into hospitals and \nwill allow the expansion of current efforts at the Veterans \nAdministration to reduce medical mistakes. The Institute of Medicine's \nreport on medical errors clearly illustrated what was wrong in our \nhealth care delivery system. Fortunately, this Appropriations bill \nprovides the funding to help us avoid medical mistakes.\n\n  I also want to thank the Chairman for his support of telemedicine \nefforts. For rural communities in Washington state, expanding and \nenhancing telemedicine is an important part of ensuring access to \nquality, affordable health care. I appreciate the Chairman's support of \nmy request for Children's Hospital in Seattle to support a telemedicine \nproject.\n  I would be remiss if I did not congratulate the Chairman and Ranking \nmember for their efforts on behalf of women's health care. The pending \nLHHS Appropriations bill does address many of the gender inequities in \nresearch and access. The Chairman has also provided an increase for the \nCDC Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act to expand the Wise Women \nprogram to additional states, including Washington state. This \nimportant screening program would allow for the screening of breast and \ncervical cancer as well as heart disease. It builds on the success of \nthe breast and cervical cancer screening program to offer greater \naccess for low income women.\n  Clearly, there are some good elements of this bill. Unfortunately, \nthe lack of overall investment in public health undermines these \nprovisions. The bottom line is that the overall commitment made to the \nLHHS and Education programs has been short changed in order to provide \nmassive tax cuts for the few. The priorities of\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\nthe FY01 Budget Resolution simply do not reflect the priorities of \nworking families.\n  Another problem with this bill is it does not protect America's \nworkers. Today, we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in our \nnation's post-war economy. We have jobs that cannot be filled, but we \nalso have workers who cannot find jobs because they lack the training \nand necessary skills. Dislocated workers are a resource we simply have \nnot tapped and the funding levels in this bill do not allow for the \nnecessary investment in these programs.\n  This bill also does not allow OSHA to issue an ergonomics standard, \neven though ergonomic injuries are the single-largest occupational \nhealth crisis faced by men and women in our work force today.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill does not fund the President's \nefforts to ensure pay equity. This bill does not give the Department of \nLabor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the tools it \nneeds to enforce wage discrimination rules.\n  In addition, this bill does not guarantee that classrooms across \nAmerica will be less crowded next year. While I appreciate the \nChairman's efforts, the funding level is not adequate to meet our goal \nof hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce classroom overcrowding. In \naddition, the structure of the funding does not guarantee that the \nfunds will be used to reduce classroom overcrowding.\n  This is a national priority, and we should direct this investment to \nreducing class size. If we do not continue to honor our commitment to \nclassroom overcrowding, we will have failed to give students the tools \nto learn the basics in disciplined environment.\n  I also am concerned that we have doomed this bill to failure if we \nreject the President's education agenda, which includes a targeted \nclass size reduction program. Not simply throwing more money at the \nproblem, but using limited resources to invest in our children. I will \ncontinue to work with the Chairman as I do believe he is trying to work \nwith difficult spending limitations, but we need to improve our \ncommitment to reducing class sizes. This bill does not get the job \ndone.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to express my strong opposition to the \nHelms Amendment, which would override the choices of thousands of \ncommunities and would endanger America's students.\n  Currently, 23 states allow minors access to confidential family \nplanning and contraceptives. The Helms amendment would override those \nlaws and--in effect--create a new federal parental consent law. Access \nto safe, confidential reproductive health care services for minors is a \nmajor health concern, and various communities have found their own ways \nto address it.\n  This is not just about preventing pregnancy. It's about preventing \nfatalities. AIDS and HIV threaten students today. Unfortunately, this \namendment jeopardizes a public health effort to protect these students.\n  I do want to mention that I was surprised to hear the sponsor of this \namendment talk about access to RU-486 in school-based clinics. I would \nremind my colleague that RU-486 has still not been approved for use in \nthis country. The real issue here is our ability to protect the health \nof students across America, and the Helms amendment stands in the way \nof that important priority.\n  When I look at the Labor, HHS bill, I see a bill that fails America's \nworkers and students. Because this bill does not make the necessary \ninvestments in public health, worker safety and education, I am voting \nagainst it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the Fiscal Year 2001 \nappropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, Education, and Related Agencies.\n  This measure increases funding for education programs by $4.6 billion \nfrom $37,924,569,000 to $42,594,646,000. This increase includes funds \nto provide for a $350 dollar increase in the maximum Pell Grant award, \nup to a maximum of $3,650 dollars. The bill also includes an increase \nof $1.3 billion for special education programs, raising the total \nappropriations for such purposes from $6,036,196,000 to $7,352,341,000. \nFurthermore, for the first time, this bill enables local education \nagencies to use Title VI funds for school modernization and class-size \nreduction efforts, if they so choose.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains over $40 million in funding for \nthe Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship program. As the only merit-based \nscholarship program funded by the Department of Education, this program \nawards scholarships to high school graduates who demonstrate \noutstanding academic achievement and have been accepted to attend an \ninstitution of higher learning.\n  The bill includes nearly a million dollars for the continuation of a \nprogram to identify and provide models of alcohol prevention and \neducation in higher education. Alcohol abuse is a devastating problem \non college campuses across America, and I hope that this program will \nprovide incentives and form the basis for colleges and universities to \nbetter address the problem of alcohol abuse on their campuses.\n  I note that the bill includes a $1.2 billion initiative to address \nthe problem of youth violence, which is also a major national concern. \nThis spring, at West Virginia University, I convened a Youth Summit on \nViolence that was designed to give young people an opportunity to put \nforth their ideas on how to reduce violence among their peers. In \nresponse to the question, ``What would best prevent violence in the \nschools?''--the number one response from these young people was to \ncreate safe places where they can gather for social activities after \nschool. In that regard, I am pleased that the bill includes $600 \nmillion for the 21st Century Learning Centers Program. That very \nimportant program supports grants to local education agencies for the \npurpose of establishing after-school programs.\n  The bill contains nearly $250 million for the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration, and an increase of $2.5 million above the President's \nrequest for the Mine Health and Safety Academy. This agency is vital \nwhen it comes to protecting the health and safety of our nation's \nminers. The measure also contains $6 million for black lung clinics, \nwhich play a critical role in providing medical treatment to coal \nminers suffering from black lung disease.\n  Further, the bill includes more than $200 million for the National \nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Important \nresearch conducted at NIOSH adds to our understanding of occupation-\nrelated ailments and diseases.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the \nChairman and Ranking Member, Senators Specter and Harkin, for their \nefforts in putting together this very important funding bill. These two \nSenators are vastly experienced and knowledgeable when it comes to \nmatters under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nand Education Subcommittee. They have worked on a bipartisan basis \nsplendidly, as is always the case, preparing this Fiscal Year 2001 \nappropriations bill.\n  I also wish to express my appreciation to Senators Specter and Harkin \nfor facilitating the inclusion of my amendment into the managers' \npackage. My amendment provides $50 million to the Secretary of \nEducation to award grants to states to develop, implement, and \nstrengthen programs that teach American history as a separate subject \nwithin school curricula. The importance of America history is too often \nundervalued in our nation's classrooms. Poll after poll in recent years \nhas alerted us to huge gaps in historical knowledge among our nation's \nschoolchildren. It is my hope that this amendment will encourage \nteachers and students to take a deeper look at the importance of our \nnation's past.\n  Again, I wish to compliment the two fine managers of the bill and the \nAppropriations staff who have assisted them with preparing the bill. I \nurge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of the FY \n2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill. Although I have concerns with the funding levels \nin some areas, I want to commend Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for \nagain working under difficult budget constraints to put together a good \nbill that addresses many of our nation's needs.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes significant increases for many \nvital\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\nhealth and education programs. We've invested in our youngest children, \nby increasing the Child Care & Development Block Grant by $817 million, \nand by increasing Head Start by $1 billion. The bill also provides \nmuch-needed increases for elementary and secondary education, including \nTitle I, Special Education, After-School programs, and Impact Aid. And \nthe bill ensures that more students will have the opportunity to go to \ncollege by increasing funding for Pell Grants, Work-Study, and TRIO \nprograms. It is my hope that when we go to conference, we can find more \nfunds to make an even stronger investment in our children's education.\n  I am also pleased that the bill makes great strides in ensuring \naccess to quality health care. The bill includes a $150 million \nincrease for Community Health Centers, which provide care to many low-\nincome, uninsured Americans. The bill includes a modest increase for \nnursing home inspections to ensure that elderly and disabled patients \nreceive the highest quality care. And clearly, all Americans will \nbenefit from the $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of \nHealth. This increase in funding for biomedical research will lead us \ndown the path to new treatments and cures for disease.\n  Despite these important provisions, I have several concerns with the \nbill that I believe must be addressed in conference. First, I am deeply \ntroubled by the cut in the Social Services Block Grant. My State and \ncounties rely on these funds to provide home care, services for the \ndisabled, and child welfare programs. In Wisconsin, the vast majority \nof SSBG money goes straight to the county level. Without SSBG funds, \nour counties have no guarantee they will receive enough money to \nprovide these critical services. I am heartened that Senator Stevens, \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee, has made a commitment to \nrestore these funds in conference, and I look forward to working with \nhim to make that happen.\n  Second, I believe we must make a stronger investment in programs that \nserve our nation's seniors. I am very concerned that programs under the \nOlder Americans Act--including Supportive Services and Centers and \nNutrition programs--are inadequately funded. I also support the \ninclusion of $125 million for the Family Caregiver Support Network, \nwhich provides support and respite to family members caring for a \nrelative in long-term care. In addition, we must include larger \nincreases for programs that utilize the unique talents of our nation's \nolder citizens, such as the Foster Grandparents and Senior Companions \nprograms. I hope that the conference committee will do what's right and \nmake the necessary investments in programs that serve the elderly.\n  Finally, I was also disappointed that a provision blocking OSHA from \npursuing a rule on ergonomics was included in the bill. This move to \ninclude legislative riders on appropriations bills has become a common \neffort to circumvent the rule making process. In this case, opponents \nwanted to stop the process before we had a chance to see what the final \nrule would look like. I believe this effort to halt the rule is \npremature. There are almost 1.8 million ergonomic injuries every year \nwith 300,000 resulting in lost work days. Workers are suffering through \npainful injuries every day, and we must do something. OSHA has been \nworking on this issue for ten years, and we should delay it no longer.\n  Overall, Mr. President, I believe the Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Appropriations Committee have done an outstanding job in putting \ntogether this bill under difficult circumstances. I am voting for the \nbill at this point, despite the concerns I have just outlined, because \nI believe we must move this bill through the Appropriations process. \nHowever, let me make clear that these concerns must be addressed before \nthe bill emerges from Conference. I look forward to working with all of \nmy colleagues to improve the bill as the process continues.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to raise a very important \nissue concerning the vital safety-net hospitals in my state of \nPennsylvania. As my colleagues are aware, the Medicare Disproportionate \nShare Hospital program consists of special supplemental payments made \nto hospitals to offset the costs for providing uncompensated care. I \nworked closely over the last few years with Pennsylvania hospitals and \nthe Health Care Financing Administration to resolve a dispute \nconcerning the inclusion of a State's General Assistance population as \na part of its Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment \ncalculation. In August 1998, HCFA asserted that Pennsylvania hospitals \nwere incorrectly including General Assistance (GA) days in their \nMedicare DSH calculation, and claimed that they should only have \nincluded Medicaid days. These payments represent a significant portion \nof many hospitals' revenues, and any proposed reduction puts the \nCommonwealth's neediest populations at risk.\n  The dispute raised further concerns about how HCFA interpreted its \nown rules and regulations. Medicare fiscal intermediaries had been \nreimbursing hospitals with the GA days included for the past twelve \nyears. Yet, beginning in mid-1998, HCFA reversed its own \nintermediaries' interpretation and began recouping the so-called \noverpayments for certain years, as far back as fiscal year 1993. The \nimpact to Pennsylvania's hospitals would have totaled in the hundreds \nof millions of dollars.\n  Indeed, I was encouraged when Secretary Shalala and Administrator \nDeParle were able to work out a retroactive solution regarding the DSH \ncalculations. As of October 1, 1998, Pennsylvania hospitals stopped \nincluding the GA days in their DSH calculations, but since the law was \nunclear enough for the fiscal intermediaries to have been confused for \ntwelve years, they did not have to give back any reimbursements. I \nunderstand that 35 other States had been including General Assistance \ndays in their Medicare DSH calculations, thus the resolution of this \ndispute was critical for many safety-net hospitals across the nation.\n  However, Mr. President, it now appears that Pennsylvania hospitals \nare once again at a disadvantage with regard to their Medicare DSH \nreimbursements, as HCFA is graying the regulatory area we thought had \nbeen clarified last year.\n  I understand from Pennsylvania hospitals that HCFA is unfairly \napplying the GA days and Medicare DSH calculation policy across States. \nBeginning in January of 2000, HCFA began allowing some States which \noperate under Medicaid Section 1115 waivers to include the GA \npopulation in the Medicare DSH calculation, thus significantly \nincreasing those States' DSH reimbursements. Since Pennsylvania \nhospitals operate under a Section 1915 waiver rather than Section 1115, \nit has been made clear to them that they cannot count GA populations in \ntheir calculations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in my commitment to ensure that HCFA \nclarifies once and for all how the GA population should be treated \nunder the Medicare DSH program, thus assuring that Pennsylvania and all \nStates will be treated fairly under one uniform and understandable \npolicy.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that \nSenator Specter and I have been working on with Pennsylvania hospitals \nand the Health Care Financing Administration. Since 1998, we have been \ntrying to resolve a dispute concerning the inclusion of a state's \nGeneral Assistance population as a part of its Medicare \nDisproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payment calculation. HCFA \nasserted in 1998 that Pennsylvania hospitals were including General \nAssistance (GA) days in their Medicare DSH calculation, when they \nshould only have included Medicaid days. This issue at the time was an \nenormous concern to the hospitals which provide care to the neediest \npopulations in my state, and this issue remains unresolved today.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of fairness and applying the rules \nand interpretations equally. Medicare fiscal intermediaries had been \nreimbursing hospitals with GA days included for the past twelve years. \nIn 1998, HCFA reversed its own intermediaries' interpretation and began \nrecouping the so-called overpayments as far back as fiscal year 1993. \nSince then, Pennsylvania hospitals stopped including the GA days in \ntheir DSH calculations.\n  I now understand that thirty-five other States had been including \nGeneral Assistance days in their Medicare DSH calculations, and that \nsince January of this year, HCFA began allowing some states which \noperate under Section 1115 Medicaid waivers to include\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\nthe GA population in the Medicare DSH calculation. Pennsylvania \nhospitals operate under a Section 1915 waiver, and it has been made \nclear to them that they cannot count GA populations in their \ncalculations.\n  Mr. President, HCFA appears to be unfairly applying GA days and \nMedicare DSH calculations across states. I am very concerned that \nhospitals in Pennsylvania remain at a disadvantage, and I remain \ncommitted to working with HCFA to clarify once and for all how the GA \npopulation should be treated under the Medicare DSH program.\n  I appreciate the diligence that my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, has shown on this matter, and I will continue to work \nwith him toward a satisfactory resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support advanced \nappropriations for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. \nSenator Wellstone's amendment continues the funding practice that has \nexisted for years in this program. It enables states to plan ahead for \nthe energy assistance they provide to needy families.\n  The bill as now written unfortunately ends this current practice. It \nintroduces needless uncertainty into the funding outlook for the \nfuture. At this time of high energy prices and budget surpluses, we \nshould strengthen the protection we provide low-income families, not \nweaken it.\n  A third of Massachusetts families rely on home heating oil, which \nnearly doubled in price last winter because inventories were too low to \nmeet the sudden surge in need for heating oil when unseasonably cold \nweather suddenly arrived. Many families could not deal with this \nexpense. But because heat is a basic necessity for families in New \nEngland, they had no choice but to make room in their limited budgets \nfor the soaring cost of heat.\n  This year, all indications are that once again, heating oil \ninventories are dangerously low throughout the Northeast. The coming \nwinter may bring price spikes that are even higher than last winter. \nNatural gas prices are unusually high this year as well, which may well \nincrease demand for heating oil.\n  We should do more to ensure that adequate inventories of heating oil \nare maintained in the Northeast. Early in this year, I introduced \nlegislation to do so. But the Energy Committee has not acted on this \nproposal, and the industry steadfastly refuses regulation as a means of \nprotecting families that rely on oil heat. So we need to focus on other \nways to address the problem.\n  The best defense for families that need reliable, economical heat to \nsurvive is to plan ahead to meet their needs. Secretary Richardson has \nurged consumers to fill their heating oil tanks this summer, while \nprices are stable, and I join him in strongly recommending this action.\n  State governments which distribute LIHEAP funds also need to plan \nahead, but they need an entire fiscal year to properly plan. They need \nto plan to set eligibility limits and to distribute benefits. They need \nto know what level of federal assistance will be available, so they can \nbudget their state assistance accordingly. They also need advance \nnotice so that they can do what most companies do when they buy \ncommodities that are subject to volatile prices--hedge against price \nsurges by purchasing options contracts.\n  The decision to include advanced appropriations in LIHEAP was made \nyears ago and has been faithfully followed. The current uncertainty in \nenergy markets is the wrong time to inject further uncertainty in \nLIHEAP funding. That is why I join my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in calling for advance appropriations for this program.\n  The support made available by this program is literally a matter of \nlife and death for millions of families in Massachusetts and New \nEngland. Congress should do everything possible to encourage planning \nthat avoids the supply and price problems that left so many families in \nthe cold last winter, and that threaten our region's economic health.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the critical \nimportance of mental health research.\n  The human brain is the organ of the mind and just like the other \norgans of our body, it is subject to illness. And just as illnesses to \nour other organs require treatment, so too do illnesses of the brain.\n  With this in mind, I think that it is appropriate to be discussing \nthe benefits of mental health research as we have just concluded the \n``Decade of the Brain.'' During this time we witnessed breakthrough \nachievements like new medications and brain imaging techniques that \nhave provided innumerable benefits for so many Americans.\n  Just last year, I dedicated the National Foundation for Functional \nBrain Imaging at the University of New Mexico. The Foundation's purpose \nis to advance the development of magneto-encephalography, or MEG, \ntechnology that provides real-time imagery of neurons as they operate \nwithin the human brain.\n  As we explore functions of ``normal'' brains, as well as brains of \nindividuals suffering from severe illnesses, we may well be on the \nbrink of exciting breakthroughs for mental illness treatment.\n  Moreover, one only needs to look at the amazing research being done \nby the National Institute of Mental Health to realize how far we have \nreally come over the past decade. And finally, the close of the decade \ngave us the first ever Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health \nentitled, ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General.''\n  However, even with these fabulous advances we must still maintain our \nvigilance and continue our support for research so even newer and \nbetter breakthroughs are made by our nation's researchers.\n  For instance, about 5 million individuals in the United State suffer \nfrom a severe and persistent mental illness. Nearly 7.5. million \nchildren and adolescents suffer from one or more types of mental \ndisorders.\n  There is a final area I would like to touch upon and that is \nchildren. While researchers have already made fantastic breakthroughs \nin the area of mental illness, research for children still remains \nincomplete.\n  We must continue the excellent work already being done, like studies \nseeking to understand the basic mechanisms of brain development and \ncomparisons of effective treatments for specific illnesses.\n  Additionally, scientists have already established preventive steps \nthat can be taken that are effective: Genes are identified to see if a \nchild has a predisposition to a certain illness and if so monitoring \nbegins. In conjunction with that, a calm environment is sought for the \nchild and early stage drugs are administered if appropriate.\n  I would submit the key for not only children, but adults is the \ncontinuation of research that will allow us to realize even greater \nbreakthroughs that will enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses of a \nmental illness. And I firmly believe the key to ensuring continued \ndiscoveries through our research is to continue providing our nation's \nresearchers with adequate funding.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate is voting on final passage \nof the FY2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations bill, H.R. 4577.\n  This measure includes funding for many good and worthwhile programs: \nmedical research conducted by the National Institutes of Health, a \ndrug-demand reduction initiative, efforts to combat bioterrorism, Pell \nGrants, Impact Aid, and services for older Americans, to name a few.\n  The amount of funding allocated to this bill is very generous: $97.8 \nbillion in discretionary appropriations, or about 12 percent over last \nyear's level.\n  There are very substantial increases provided for particular \nprograms. For example, there is a 12 percent increase for the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, a 13 percent increase \nfor the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund, a 15 percent increase for the \nNational Institutes of Health, a 19 percent increase for Head Start, \nand a 13 percent increase for education.\n  I believe the OSHA increase, for one, is something that can and \nshould be cut back in conference. If we want to maintain the other \nlarge increases, though, we need to find other programs, of lesser \npriority, to cut in order to moderate the total cost of the bill.\n  My concern is, as we get to conference, there will be pressure to \nincrease spending even more. We are going to hear a lot, for example, \nabout the need for more funding for the Social Services Block Grant \nprogram. If\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\nthe amount in the bill for SSBG is going to be increased, we are going \nto have to find somewhere else to cut. I hope proponents of these \nincreases will keep that in mind as we proceed to conference.\n  The sky is not the limit here. I am going to support this bill today \nto get it to conference, but I am not inclined to support a dollar more \nin the conference report. We have got to do a better job of \nprioritizing, or we will soon find Congress once again raiding the \nSocial Security surpluses to pay for other government programs.\n  We just put a stop to that two years ago. We have to honor our \ncommitment to preserve Social Security surpluses for Social Security.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before moving to final passage, I thank \nmy distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for his cooperation, and \nour devoted staffs: Bettilou Taylor, Jim Sourwine, Mary Deitrich, Kevin \nJohnson, Mark Laisch, Jon Retzlaff, Ellen Murray, Lisa Bernhardt, and \nAllison DeKosky.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. \nLeahy) and the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nVermont (Mr. Leahy) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      {Rollcall Vote No. 171 Leg.}\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Helms\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Boxer\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Leahy\n     Moynihan\n  The bill (H.R. 4577), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to say a public thank you to our \nchairman, Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Chamber. \nConversations will please be taken to the back of the Chamber or to the \nCloakroom.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in all the years I have been on this \ncommittee and also on the subcommittee, which now numbers 16, this is \nthe earliest we have ever gotten this bill finished. If I am not \nmistaken, this may be the first time that this was not the last bill to \nbe acted on, whether it has been Republican leadership or Democratic \nleadership.\n  I thank Senator Specter for his great leadership. I thank him for \nworking in such an open and bipartisan fashion with us on this side. I \nhave never had a case where something was done on the Republican side \nthat I didn't know about and that we weren't consulted with every step \nof the way. I want Senator Specter to know how much we really \nappreciate that.\n  The working relationship has been great with our staff: Bettilou \nTaylor, Jim Sourwine, Mark Laisch, Mary Dietrich, Jon Retzlaff, Kevin \nJohnson, Ellen Murray, and Lisa Bernhardt. Our staff has a great \nworking relationship.\n  Again, as we now go into conference with the House, I make a \ncommitment to my chairman that we will continue to work in a bipartisan \nfashion, as we have always, to make sure we can bring back a strong \nbill.\n  I think we can be proud of the amount of money we have in education. \nWe have more money in this bill for education than asked for by \nPresident Clinton. I believe we are making moves in the right \ndirection. Maybe we vote and disagree here and there in little bits and \npieces, but, by and large, what is in the bill for education I think \nshould be a mark and a source of pride for all of us.\n  I thank Senator Specter for his leadership on that side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be glad to yield a minute to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIowa for those very generous comments. We have a close working \nrelationship. I learned a long time ago that if you want to get \nsomething done in this town, you have to be willing to cross party \nlines.\n  This bill involving education funding, health funding, and the \nDepartment of Labor with job training and worker safety is a good \nbipartisan result.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I was remiss. \nSomeone else we have to thank is the chairman of our committee, Senator \nStevens, who worked very hard to get the allocations. When we ran into \nsome problems, he was able to find ways so we could move ahead with \nthis bill, and disregarding some of the problems we had so we could get \nto conference.\n  I thank Senator Stevens for his support of this subcommittee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Stevens did an extraordinary job as we moved \nthrough this very tough process. Our distinguished ranking member of \nthe full committee, Senator Byrd, has been a strong stalwart throughout \nthe entire process.\n  Other Senators are waiting to speak. I have already enumerated the \ngreat work done by our staff. I pay special tribute to the staff. \nBettilou Taylor has been a very real stalwart.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin, on my own behalf, and I am sure I speak for Senator \nByrd also.\n  The Senate should know this is the largest health services bill in \nhistory. It represents a magnificent contribution and commitment to \nincreasing funding for medical research in particular, and so many \nother things in general. Both of these Senators have done tremendous \nwork in getting this bill where it is and getting it to the House. I \nthink they really deserve our total congratulations for keeping our \ncommitment to doubling the amount of money available for medical \nresearch within 5 years.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my regret that I was \nunable to support the Labor/HHS Appropriation bill that was passed by \nthe Senate today. I was initially prepared to offer my support when we \nbegan debate on this legislation, however the addition of a number of \ntroubling amendments during consideration of this bill compels me to \noppose this bill.\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\n  Before I discuss the provisions that caused me to vote against the \nlegislation, I would like to recognize Senators Specter and Harkin as \nwell as the rest of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, for their efforts to increase our nation's \ninvestments in a number of critical programs that serve our nation's \nchildren and families. First, this legislation includes an increase of \n$817 million for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, bringing \ntotal funding for this program to $2 billion and allowing an additional \n220,000 children to be served. In my opinion, this new investment in \nchild care represents a significant victory for American families and \nit is my sincere hope that this provision is retained in conference. I \nam also pleased that this legislation provides $4.9 billion for the \nHead Start program, as the President had requested. This funding \nrepresents a funding increase of $1 billion over FY 2000.\n  I also commend Senators Specter and Harkin for providing a $2.7 \nbillion increase for the National Institutes of Health, the largest \nincrease in history. This increase, coupled with a $2 billion increase \nlast year, put Congress on the path toward the goal of doubling our \nnation's investment in the search for medical breakthroughs over the \nnext five years.\n  I also applaud the Appropriations Committee's bipartisan education \nfunding increase of $4.6 billion, including a record $1.3 billion \nincrease for special education, as well as increases for Title I grants \nto schools, teacher technology training, Impact Aid, Reading \nExcellence, vocational education, school counseling, Pell grants, and \nother student financial aid programs.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this legislation \nincludes an initiative I worked to advance last year that will serve to \nprotect individuals with mental illnesses from the inappropriate use of \nseclusion and restraint. I first became aware of the problem \nsurrounding the misuse of seclusion and restraints in 1998 when the \nHartford Courant published a five-part investigative series outlining \nthe tragic practice. This series documented 142 deaths over the last \ndecade nationally that were determined to be directly attributable to \nthe inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion. Additionally, the \nHarvard Center for Risk Analysis estimates that between 50 and 150 \nrestraint-related deaths occur each year nationally, with more than 26 \npercent of those deaths occurring in children. This initiative will \nensure that physical restraints are no longer used for discipline or \nfor the convenience of mental health facility staff by extending to the \nmental health population a standard that has been shown to be effective \nin reducing the use of restraints and seclusion in nursing homes. \nFurther, this legislation will require that all restraint and seclusion \nrelated deaths be reported to an appropriate oversight agency. In \naddition, this legislation would require adequate staffing levels and \nappropriate training for staff of facilities that serve the mentally \nill. These safeguards will hopefully prevent further harm to \nindividuals who may be unable to protect themselves from abuse by those \nentrusted with their care.\n\n  Yet, while I recommend the overall increase in education funding, I \nam concerned about the elimination of funds for critical programs. For \ninstance, the bill ends the bipartisan commitment to reduce class size \nthat has now been funded for two years. S. 2553 transfers the class \nsize funds to Title VI, which eliminates any guarantee that the funds \nwill be used for this purpose, greatly diluting targeting to high \npoverty schools, and severely weakening accountability for how money is \nspent. I am also concerned that this bill fails to guarantee funds for \nthe critical area of school modernization. Instead, it increases the \nTitle VI program by $1.3 billion, adding renovation and construction of \nschool facilities as an allowable use of funds. I am pleased that the \nbill acknowledges the need for federal assistance in helping states and \nschools with their school modernization needs; however, this block \ngrant approach fails to guarantee that funds will be used for school \nmodernization, and fails to target funds to schools with the greatest \nneeds. I also believe this bill does not go far enough to fund Title \nI--an important program that provides supplemental programs to enable \neducationally disadvantaged children. This bill would only increase \nlast year's $8 billion appropriation by $400 million. It is estimated \nthat it would take $24 billion to fully fund this program.\n  Another area of this bill that is of some concern to me is the \ninvestment in after-school programs. The bill's funding level for 21st \nCentury Community Learning Centers is $400 million below the \nPresident's request denying 1.6 million children access to before- and \nafter-school programs in safe, drug-free environments. I am \ndisappointed that my amendment to increase spending on this crucial \narea to $1 billion was not adopted. It is time our funding reflects the \nimportance that parents place on this national priority. With 5 million \nchildren home alone each week, after-school programs must not be an \nafterthought.\n  I am also very troubled that this legislation now includes a patients \nbill of rights proposal that offers only the illusion of patient \nprotections. This amendment fails to cover all Americans with private \nhealth insurance and fails to offer patients a true right to seek legal \nredress when they are harmed by an HMO's refusal to provide care. I am \nalso disappointed that the majority refused to support an amendment \noffered by Senator Dorgan which would have required that any patient \nprotection legislation passed by the Senate cover all 191 million \nprivately insured Americans.\n  Lastly, I am disappointed that this legislation would delay a \nproposed ergonomics standard to protect workers from work-related \nmusculoskeletal disorders. Each year more than 600,000 workers suffer \nserious injuries, such as back injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and \ntendinitis as a result of ergonomic hazards. The proposed ergonomics \nrule promulgated by OSHA can go a long way toward keeping our workers \nproductive and our businesses profitable. I hope that common sense will \nprevail in conference, and that this and other counter-productive \nmeasures will be remedied.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during the debate on the Labor-Health & \nHuman Services-Education appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001, \nSenator Daschle offered an amendment relating to genetic testing and \nthe potential for genetics-based discrimination in the workplace.\n  I was thrilled at the recent announcement of the completion of the \nhuman genetic map, and with it, the possibility of the full \nidentification of the more than three billion nucleotide bases that \ncomprise the genome. This knowledge will bring with it limitless \npossibilities, vastly improving our quality of life and health.\n  Yet with this knowledge comes great responsibility. For all the good \nthis information can do for us, there is also the potential of great \nharm and misuse. One of the challenges that faces us even now, is to \nensure that genetic information about an individual is not used against \nhim or herself.\n  Despite my strong conviction that genetic information must never be \nused to discriminate against an individual, I was unable to support the \namendment offered by Senator Daschle relating to genetic discrimination \nin the workplace.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment is, in reality, much more than simply a \ntechnical amendment to an appropriations bill. It is a 5-page, far-\nreaching, broadly written, piece of legislation, which would create an \nentirely new class of discrimination law, creating inequalities and \nconflicting with existing law.\n  This legislation would usurp the jurisdiction of the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission and allow genetic discrimination suits to go \ndirectly to the court system. This is highly unusual for discrimination \nsuits and would afford this form of discrimination preferential \ntreatment over any other form of discrimination.\n  In addition, this bill comes into direct conflict with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, ADA. The ADA already captures genetic \ndiscrimination--this has been affirmed by the Secretary of the EEOC and \nthe Supreme Court. If we pass a separate bill that preempts the \nprotections already provided for in the ADA, we could potentially be \nundermining our support for the people covered by those protections. \nJust to highlight the possible inequalities--the Daschle amendment\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nwould give a genetic marker greater protection than a paraplegic.\n  Given the drastic and over-reaching changes which would be brought \nabout by the Daschle amendment, especially in a new area such as \ngenetic testing, consideration of this legislation must be deliberate \nand well-informed.\n  Yet, there has not been a single hearing on this legislation. In \nfact, the amendment language was not available for review until only an \nhour or so before the vote. I believe it would be wrong and even \nnegligent to pass legislation without knowing exactly how it would \naffect Americans' lives, now and far into the future.\n  The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has \nalready planned the first hearing on this matter in July. I am \nconfident, that with careful deliberation and thorough debate, we will \nsucceed in finding the most effective and appropriate way to ensure \nthat no one will have their genetic-information used against them. I am \nlooking forward to the challenge.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate passed H.R. 4577, \nthe Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act. I would like to \ncongratulate my colleagues, Senator Specter, Senator Stevens, and \nSenator Harkin for working together to pass one of the more contentious \nof the annual appropriations bills.\n  I appreciate the comity and courtesy displayed by the managers of \nthis bill. I realize that most of my colleagues have specific \npriorities they wish to highlight in this measure. I appreciate the \nmanagers' support of the Inhofe amendment regarding the Impact Aid \nprogram. As I have stated in the past, this is a vital program for \nUtah.\n  I also appreciate the fact that the subcommittee has once again \nincluded a provision which would allow school districts adversely \naffected by a recalculation of the census to keep their Title I \nconcentration funds.\n  According to Utahns who live and work and educate our children in \nthese districts, this cut would do a huge disservice to Title I \nstudents in these districts. These hardworking Utahns have informed me \nthat they believe that the census calculations do not adequately \nreflect the pockets of poverty that exist in these districts. Some of \nthe schools in these districts have a poverty rate, when calculated \nbased on school lunch data, at over 70 percent. I am pleased that the \nsubcommittee has accepted the recommendation to hold these districts \nharmless.\n  I intend to vote in favor of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations \nbill, but I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to note, \nonce again, that a crucial provision in the Title I formula remains \nunfunded. The Education Finance Incentive Grant Program was authorized \nin the 1994 Elementary and Secondary Education Act and is included in \nS. 2, the ESEA reauthorization, currently pending before the Congress.\n  I recently detailed the merits of this program when I spoke about my \nintention to offer an amendment to S. 2 that would make EFIG a \nmandatory component of Title I. I will briefly review those arguments \nhere:\n  EFIG has, as a principal component, an equity factor, which measures \nhow states distribute resources among school districts. As policy, \nequalizing resources among school districts has merit well documented \nin academic literature.\n  Moreover, many States are being compelled by the courts to equalize \nresources among school districts. Over 30 states have been taken to \ncourt on the basis of an unequal distribution of resources. My \namendment would provide some relief to states that are currently \nrequired by the courts to equalize resources among school districts by \nincreasing their share of Title I funds. My amendment would also \nprovide the incentive to equalize resources to states which may not \nhave already done so.\n  The Education Finance Incentive Grant program would be the only part \nof the Title I formula that does not use the per-pupil expenditure as a \nproxy for a state's commitment to education. There are many ways to \nmeasure a State's commitment to education--the per-pupil expenditure is \nmerely one. Indeed, one of the most damaging aspects of the Title I \nformula is that it is replicated as a means to distribute Federal money \nto the states in other programs that have no relation to Title I. The \ninsertion of another measure of a state's commitment to education is \nappropriate.\n  When EFIG is a factor in the Title I formula, more states do better \nthan under current law. This was a key factor in the debate over the \n1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and \nwhy it was the intent during the enactment of the 1994 reauthorization \nthat any additional funds directed to Title I go out through the EFIG. \nIndeed, it was the reason why a number of Senators voted for the \nconference report. It is my strongly held conviction that the intention \nof the 1994 act should be realized, and I will continue to pursue this \ngoal.\n  I do not believe that the Senate should authorize on an \nappropriations measure, which is why I did not offer my amendment \nduring consideration of this bill. However, I join with many of my \ncolleagues who have expressed concerns over the possibility that, for \nthe first time in nearly 30 years, the Congress will fail to \nreauthorize vital elementary and secondary education programs. I \nsincerely hope that those who have obstructed enactment of S. 2 will \nreconsider their position and allow the bill to go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized to speak as if in morning business.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6220-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6220-S6224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HAPPY FORESTS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about \na pending national disaster.\n  Mr. President, I want to discuss something that is unfortunately not \npart of this fire package. For over a month, I have been working \nintensely with other Members and the Clinton Administration trying to \nbegin to address a serious problem that in the West has been \nhighlighted in stark terms by the events that happened to the community \nof Los Alamos in my state, as just one example. What happened to the \nhomes and families of Los Alamos is unfortunately going to happen again \nunless we, as a Congress, can convince the Clinton Administration to \njoin us in bold and deliberate actions. Throughout the United States \nthere is an increasing amount of land in what natural resource \nscientists and firefighting experts call the ``wildland/urban \ninterface.'' With more people moving into the West, and more homes \nbeing built in communities surrounded by federal lands, neighborhoods \nlike those that burned in Los Alamos are becoming more numerous.\n  At the same time, as a consequence of decades of fire suppression as \nwell as years of increasing drought, many millions of acres--by the \nGeneral Accounting Office's estimate, 39 million or more acres--of \nnational forests are at high risk of wildfires. They are in this \nsituation because fuel loads have risen to dangerous levels and forest \nmanagement has been dramatically curtailed at the same time. The escape \nof the prescribed fire in Bandelier National Monument, and its \nsubsequent effect on the town of Los Alamos make it clear, as Secretary \nBabbitt has already conceded, that in many places prescribed fire is \nnot a viable management tool to reduce fuel loads. It is particularly \nrisky to use in the wildland/urban interface because of the presence of \nhomes and families.\n  Therefore, joined by others Members on both sides of the aisle, I \nworked over the last few weeks to provide the Administration with both \nthe resources and the tools to begin an accelerated program of fuel \nreduction in wildland/urban interface areas for communities that are at \nrisk throughout the West. We suggested a number of proposals that the \nAdministration found too hot to handle. For instance, we asked whether \nthe Council on Environmental Quality would designate this an emergency \nsituation and expedite NEPA compliance for hazard fuel reduction \nactivities in the wildland/urban interface. The Administration \nrepresentatives said no. They felt that this would be too controversial \nwith national environmental special interest groups. They pleaded with \nus not to pursue this option.\n  We asked whether they could suspend administrative appeals for these \nhazard fuel reduction projects. That would eliminate one source of \ndelay. Anyone who wanted to stop one of these\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\nprojects could still go directly to federal court. Here again, the \nAdministration said no. They urged us not to propose suspending appeals \nbecause it would be met with opposition by national environmental \nspecial interest groups.\n  We suggested the use of stewardship contracts to do fuel reduction \nwork. A stewardship contract is one where the government can trade the \nvalue of any merchantable material removed through a fuel reduction \nproject against the cost to the government of the fuel reduction \nactivity. This is an authority that would be very useful, but that the \nfederal government presently lacks. Here again, the Administration felt \nthat there was too much national environmental special interest group \nopposition to stewardship contracting. They urged us not to pursue this \noption.\n  Throughout this discussion we told the Administration that we would \nbe sensitive to their concerns, as long as they would commit to us that \nthey would not treat this crisis in a ``business as usual'' fashion. We \nweren't simply going to give them more money and say we had \nresolved the problem when we know that isn't true.\n\n  Finally, Senator Bingaman and I came to an agreement on the \nadditional tools and resources that we would provide the Administration \nwhile being sensitive to their concerns. We wanted to increase fuel \nreduction activity by $240 million. In the course of doing that, we \nwere going to direct the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture to \nuse all available contracting and hiring authorities under existing law \nto do this work. We were also going to provide the Secretaries with \nauthority which they now lack to do some of this work using grants and \ncooperative agreements. We asked the Secretaries, at their sole \ndiscretion, to do this work in a way that would provide jobs to local \npeople, opportunities to private, non-profit, or cooperating entities, \nsuch as youth conservation corps, and opportunities for small and micro \nbusinesses.\n  We must begin a serious dialogue throughout the West about the \nseverity of the problem that we face. In order to accomplish this, we \ndirected the Secretaries by September 30 of this year to produce a list \nof all of the urban/wildland interface communities, within the vicinity \nof federal lands that are at risk from wildfire. In that list, we asked \nthe Secretaries to identify those communities where hazard reduction \nactivities were already underway, or could be commenced by the end of \nthe calendar year. We further asked the Secretaries to describe by May \nof next year, the roadblocks to beginning hazardous fuel reduction work \nin the remaining communities on the list.\n  It was our view that this would provide an opportunity to commence a \nvery necessary dialogue: (1) among communities at risk, and (2) between \nthe affected communities and the federal land management agencies to \ngain some consensus on approaching this problem. That was the intent of \ndirecting the Secretaries to produce these lists.\n  It was also our hope that, as communities recognized the degree of \nrisk, they would match some of the federal contributions with their own \nmoney and effort. This would get the work done even more quickly.\n  Regrettably, I must inform the Senate, including Members from western \nstates who have communities at risk, and some burning now, that the \nAdministration rejected our proposal because they thought that ``it \nmight encourage logging.'' Now remember we weren't talking about \nwilderness areas. And we weren't talking about roadless areas either. \nNor were we talking about areas of special significance for ecological \nor wildlife values. We were just talking about the federal lands \nadjacent to communities. We were talking about the woods next to \nsubdivisions. We were talking about places like the city of Los Alamos, \nor people burned out of the Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico. We \ncould have easily have been talking about Santa Fe, New Mexico, or \nBend, Oregon, or Sedona, Arizona, or Missoula, Montana. We could have \nbeen talking about neighborhoods in each of those cities, and many \ndozen more scattered throughout the semi-arid, western states.\n  Even though we were talking about these kinds of areas, the \nAdministration was much too concerned with offending environmental \nspecial interest groups to move aggressively and effectively to reduce \nfire risks because it might involve encouraging logging.\n  Well this is a tragedy. And it's a tragedy that will be repeated as \nthe summer progresses. It is a tragedy that will probably occur each \nweek until the snow falls later this year.\n  I want to advise the Senate that when you next look at footage of \nforest fires on CNN, just remember that the Administration didn't want \nto address this problem because they were afraid it might encourage \nlogging. When you look at footage on CNN of burned out forests, dead \nand dying wildlife, and devastated watersheds, just remember that the \nAdministration didn't want to address this problem because they were \nafraid it might encourage logging. When you see footage on CNN of \nburned-out neighborhoods, destroyed homes, devastated families and \nruined lives, just remember that the Administration didn't want to \nprevent this problem because they were afraid that by doing so they \nmight encourage logging. And next winter, when you see the first CNN \nfootage of dramatic flash floods in watersheds that were burned-over \nthe previous summer, and you see homes buried in the mud, just remember \nthat the Administration didn't want to prevent that problem because \nthey were afraid it might encourage logging.\n  And finally, when you're forced to see it up close, when it affects a \ncommunity in your state, when you're not just watching it on TV, but \nactually meeting with the citizens of your state who have been burned \nout of their homes and their neighborhoods--just tell them that the \nAdministration didn't want to prevent the problem from occurring \nbecause they were afraid it might encourage too much logging. Just tell \nthem that the Administration didn't want to prevent the problem from \noccurring because they were afraid of the national environmental groups \nwho claim to want to save the environment. Maybe then the \nAdministration will realize that they should have been afraid of what \nwould happen if they did listen to the national environmental special \ninterest groups.\n  The publicly owned forests of America are not very happy today. I \nintended to put on the supplemental bill a provision that I was going \nto call ``happy forests.'' That is a strange name. But it is either \nhappy forests or it is what we have today. What we have today is a \nphilosophy that seems to say to the forests of our land: Burn, baby, \nburn. That is the theme.\n  The administration fears logging and it is frightened to death when \nanyone suggests something that might sound like ``logging.'' It is all \nright if they keep their policy not to cut anything going, but it is \nnot all right where the forests of America come in contact with \ncommunities. The interface between communities, buildings, churches, \nand the forests of America is just crying out while waiting for a \nforest fire that will devour communities and burn down buildings.\n  I have a city in my state called Santa Fe. Everybody knows of Santa \nFe because it is a great place to go. The mayor recently has taken many \npeople to see the forests around Santa Fe and the community. Santa Fe \nis frightened that their watershed is going to burn down. It is right \nup against the community and provides its water. That watershed will \nburn down while the U.S. Government sits in its ivory tower and says \ndon't do a thing that might look like logging, might smell like \nlogging.\n  Even on this bill that we have before the Senate, which provides \nemergency fire relief, the administration ended up rejecting, after \nnegotiating for weeks, language that would have helped thin forests to \nprotect communities. This was a small, but very necessary, program. \nBefore we are finished this year, the American people are going to have \nsuch a fear about the forests burning down they will support a policy \nacross this land of thinning these forests in the interface with \ncommunities and buildings.\n  We had a fire that cost the Government over $1 billion in Los Alamos, \naffecting our laboratory and the people that work there, because the \nInterior Department started a fire, a ``controlled burn'', on a \nnational monument\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nright next to Los Alamos. They didn't follow the right rules, didn't \nhave the right weather; they did everything wrong. The little fire got \nto be a big fire and the U.S. Government burned down 48,000 acres, put \n400-plus families out of their homes by burning them to the ground. The \nCerro Grande fire burned almost $200 million worth of Los Alamos \nscientific buildings. We are lucky that the whole community didn't burn \nto the ground.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to have to get serious and pass the \nkind of legislation which would have been on this bill. The \nadministration called it a rider. The distinguished newspaper, the \nWashington Post, today argues against riders on this pending bill. They \nsaid one of riders removed encouraged ``timbering.'' I ask the editors \nto read the language. It did not encourage timbering. It said thin the \ndangerous forests where communities are at risk, and it provided great \nlimitations. It encourages the use of locals in rural communities, and \ngive jobs to their young people, to clean out the forests in the \nsummer.\n  This committee of appropriations is willing to get it the program \nstarted. This administration said we will veto this whole bill, even as \nfar as defense of our Nation goes, if you put something in that changes \nthe way we are doing things on federal land.\n  A panel of experts recently visited the watershed of Santa Fe, NM. \nThey made a statement. They are frightened that watershed will burn \ndown because the area hasn't been thinned and nothing is being done to \nthe forest land to keep it from turning into a tinderbox.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nfrom the Washington Post and an article from the Santa Fe New Mexican.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 30, 2000]\n\n                          A Dirty Water Rider\n\n       Senior congressional Republicans slid a provision into the \n     supplemental appropriations bill late Wednesday night that \n     would have the effect of blocking a major new clean water \n     regulation. The notion was that the president would have to \n     accept the provision, since the alternative would be to veto \n     a long-delayed bill that he badly wants. The supplemental \n     request, which he sent to Congress last winter, includes the \n     administration's proposed aid to Colombia, support for the \n     military operation in Kosovo and a backlog of domestic \n     disaster relief, including help for victims of Hurricane \n     Floyd, which occurred a year ago.\n       But our sense is that, if the offending language can't be \n     removed--discussions were continuing last night--the \n     president should veto the bill. Let the onus for the delay in \n     these funds--for support of U.S. troops abroad, for people \n     who have been waiting in line for up to a year for disaster \n     aid--be placed where it belongs, at the doorstep of members \n     of Congress who would hold the money hostage to a furtive \n     cause. The president can make that speech--and should. The \n     administration made a big thing last year of the clean water \n     step it was taking, and it's the right step. In recent days, \n     administration negotiators have knocked four other retrograde \n     environmental riders out of the supplemental bill, having to \n     do with hard-rock mining, timbering, reform of the Corps of \n     Engineers and the opening of a wildlife refuge to \n     development. Four for four is nifty. Make it five.\n       The regulation in question involves something called total \n     maximum daily loads, or TMDLs. The Clean Water Act has mainly \n     been enforced over the years through a permit system that has \n     reduced pollution from particular major sources--factories, \n     sewage treatment plants, etc. The permitting effort has been \n     a success, but many bodies of water in the country are still \n     dirty--too dirty to fish or swim in, for example. They either \n     have too many sources of pollution nearby or are afflicted by \n     generalized urban and agricultural runoff, which up to now \n     the government has done little to regulate and which is said \n     to account for the majority of remaining pollution.\n       Where bodies of water are still too dirty, states would be \n     instructed to determine the maximum daily loads they can \n     tolerate and develop plans to ratchet down pollution \n     accordingly. The process would be gradual, and indeed, until \n     recently, some environmental groups were fighting the \n     proposed regulation on grounds it was too weak. Democrats on \n     the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee sent a \n     letter to Senate leaders of both parties yesterday, \n     protesting the late-night insertion of the rider and urging \n     instead an open debate ``in clear public view.'' That's just \n     what ought to happen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Sante Fe New Mexican, June 28, 2000]\n\n     Experts Urge Immediate Action To Ease Fire Threat in Watershed\n\n                              (Ben Neary)\n\n       The federal government should act fast to try to avert \n     catastrophic fire on the watershed that provides nearly half \n     of Santa Fe's city's water supply, a panel of experts \n     reported on Tuesday.\n       ``We've got the fuels, we've got the topography and we've \n     got the ignition sources. It's just a matter of them coming \n     together at the same time,'' Bill Armstrong of the Santa Fe \n     National Forest told a packed auditorium at the State Land \n     Office on Tuesday night.\n       Armstrong escorted a panel of watershed experts to inspect \n     the 18,000-acre watershed Tuesday. The group ten reported \n     their findings.\n       ``There's nothing like a couple of large clouds of smoke to \n     make everyone scurry around,'' Armstrong said. ``I feel like \n     a rodent on amphetamines here.''\n       Armstrong had just finished preparing an environmental \n     study calling for thinning the forest in the Jemez Mountains \n     before the catastrophic Cerro Grande fire burned through the \n     area last month and went on to destroy hundreds of homes in \n     Los Alamos.\n       The Cerro Grande fire was followed closely by the Viveash \n     fire, which narrowly missed burning the Gallinas River \n     watershed, which supplies the city of Las Vegas, N.M., with \n     the bulk of its water supply.\n       Those fires, with their huge smoke columns visible from \n     Santa Fe, have sparked both city and Forest Service officials \n     to try to step up action on a plan to reduce the danger of \n     fire destroying the Santa Fe watershed.\n       The Forest Service and the city are working together on a \n     study of how thinning work should proceed.\n       Actual thinning of trees probably couldn't start until next \n     year at the earliest and likely will continue for five to 10 \n     years, Armstrong said.\n       Thomas W. Swetnam, director of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring \n     Research at the University of Arizona, was among those who \n     toured the watershed.\n       Studies of three rings over the past 400 years or so show \n     that fires of low intensity used to burn every 10 years or \n     so. With flames only a few feet high, such fires burned away \n     the grass and underbrush without harming the large trees.\n       In the 20th century, however, Swetnam said, a new pattern \n     emerged. Heavy grazing by domesticated animals reduced the \n     grass cover in the forests so low-intensity fires no longer \n     were common.\n       The Santa Fe watershed probably hasn't burned in the past \n     150 to 200 years, Swetnam said. Such lack of fire has led to \n     unnaturally heavy buildup of dead trees and other material in \n     the forest.\n       When such an overgrown forest burns--such as in the Cerro \n     Grande fire--the huge flames travel through the tops of the \n     trees, killing them and leaving the landscape denuded.\n       ``The Santa Fe watershed may not burn up tomorrow, or next \n     year or the next five years or so,'' Swetnam said. ``But the \n     Santa Fe watershed is one of the places on the landscape of \n     the Southwest where there is a fairly high urgency.''\n       Daniel Neary, a soil scientist with the U.S. Forest \n     Service, said catastrophic fire results in soil that for the \n     first year or so won't absorb water. This causes heavy runoff \n     and erosion--both of which would likely hurt the city's water \n     supply and possibly threaten flooding downstream.\n       Mark Dubois, an assistant professor of Forestry and \n     Wildlife Sciences at Auburn University, said conditions in \n     the Santa Fe watershed are such that it will take a combined \n     approach of carefully controlled burns, thinning and other \n     means to try to reduce the fire danger.\n       ``The central observation I walked away with today is there \n     is not one-size-fits-all,'' Dubois said of the watershed.\n       Regis Cassidy of the Sante Fe National Forest said there \n     would probably be enough work in thinning the watershed to \n     keep contractors employed for five to 10 years. He said there \n     are perhaps 600 acres where trees could be easily cut, \n     another 2,000 acres where extremely steep terrain would make \n     work difficult and perhaps another 4,500 acres where the \n     terrain is too steep to cut at all.\n       Some local environmental groups have said they intend to \n     fight the Forest Service plan to thin the watershed, saying \n     they believe the plan amounts to an inappropriate plan to log \n     in sensitive areas along the river. No representative from \n     such groups spoke at Tuesday's meeting, although officials \n     said they had been invited.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank Senator Domenici for spelling out so clearly the \ncrisis on the Nation's public lands today.\n  Yesterday, I held a hearing and I had two regional foresters: A \nregional forester that largely is in charge of all the forests in \nMontana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington; the other forester in charge of \nall the forests along the Sierra Nevada in California. They admitted \nyesterday that this President's roadless policy is going to jeopardize \n21 million acres of forested lands that are now at high risk to \ncatastrophic wildfires, the very thing the Senator is talking about. \nYet this President's policy is to lock it up, walk away, and hope it \ndoesn't burn.\n  We are talking, as the Senator so clearly spelled out, about thinning \nand\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\ncleaning--not extensive logging--but clearly changing the environment \nin a way that fire would not be as destructive as it has been at Los \nAlamos.\n  I cannot forget the picture on television, the DA Cat rolling along \nthe fire line in the forests of New Mexico, rolling along the dirt, \nright down through a riparian area. Why? To put out the fire.\n  Now, if the proper action had happened the way the Senator spelled it \nout, that would never have occurred at Los Alamos, with 21 million \nacres now at risk of catastrophic wildfires as a result of this \nPresident's policy.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, want to comment briefly on the \ncomments of the Senator from New Mexico. We will have a lot more to say \nabout this in the future because this is a national crisis.\n  For today, let me simply acknowledge that what Senator Domenici and \nSenator Craig have said represents a huge challenge to this Nation. \nAccording to the GAO, 38 million acres of forests in the United States \nare in jeopardy of either dying or burning unless they are quickly \ntreated. We have less than 20 years to accomplish this treatment. It is \nnot only the risk of catastrophic forest fires, including the danger to \ncommunities around which these forests are located, but also the \nprospect that they will die of disease or malnutrition because they are \nso crowded together that they are competing for the nutrients and the \nwater which, at least in the Southwest, are so scarce.\n  In the area of Arizona where there has been research into this--now \nat least half a dozen years of experience--we find that when the areas \nare thinned and then prescribed burning is introduced, you don't get \nthe catastrophic fire. You do get much better tree growth, more pitch \ncontent, so that they are not subject to the beetle infestation, for \nexample, and higher protein content so the grasses can grow on the \nfloor. This brings in more mammals and birds into the area. And the \nforest returns to the park-like condition that existed at the turn of \nthe century.\n  There have been a lot of bad policies since then, and a century of \nactivity which resulted in the destruction of the national forests of \nthis country.\n  The task is huge. We need to get started. I will be supporting the \nefforts of the Senator from New Mexico and others in trying to ensure \nthat we can literally save our beautiful national forests.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from New Mexico is not only speaking about \nthe forests, but people forget that the forests contaminate the private \nlands nearby. We warned the Forest Service about the beetle infestation \nin Alaska and urged that the areas be sprayed and be thinned to prevent \nthat from spreading. I regret to tell the Senate just yesterday I had \nto have people come and cut down two of our beautiful spruce trees on \nthe little lot I own because I and my neighbors, who are adjacent to \nthe national forest, are totally infested--the trees are totally \ninvested by beetles. The beetles are killing the trees.\n\n  All of this could have been prevented. This is the same as wildfires. \nIn fact, beetle kill is worse than wildfires because it totally \nconsumes the future, and it is very difficult to remove these trees.\n  I commend the Senator. I hope he will reinitiate his proposal. He is \ncorrect. Because of the basic problem, all the editorial backlash that \nwas built up against his legislation, we were unable to include that in \nthis bill. But I look forward to working with him this year on this \nsubject to try to force this administration to recognize their \nresponsibility in protecting these national forests and, in doing so, \nto protect the private property owners nearby.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to have printed in the Record the \nstatutory language Senator Bingaman and I worked on that we wanted to \nincorporate here to get started, which language was denied by threat of \nthe veto. I am not suggesting Senator Bingaman agrees with every \nstatement I made on the floor, but one can read the proposed \nlegislation and see that it is very reasonable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Fuels Reduction\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECTING COMMUNITIES FROM RISK OF WILDLAND FIRE.\n\n       (a) In expending the emergency funds provided in any Act \n     with respect to any fiscal year for hazardous fuels \n     reduction, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture may hereafter conduct fuel reduction treatments \n     on Federal lands using all contracting and hiring authorities \n     available to the Secretaries. Notwithstanding Federal \n     government procurement and contracting laws, the Secretaries \n     may conduct fuel reduction treatments on Federal lands using \n     grants and cooperative agreements. Notwithstanding Federal \n     government procurement and contracting laws, in order to \n     provide employment and training opportunities to people in \n     rural communities, the Secretaries may hereafter, at their \n     sole discretion, limit competition for any contracts, with \n     respect to any fiscal year, including contracts for \n     monitoring activities, to:\n       (1) local private, non-profit, or cooperative entities;\n       (2) Youth Conservation Corps crews or related partnerships \n     with state, local, and non-profit youth groups;\n       (3) Small or micro-businesses; or\n       (4) other entities that will hire or train a significant \n     percentage of local people to complete such contracts.\n       (b) Prior to September 30, 2000, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior shall jointly \n     publish in the Federal Register a list of all urban wildland \n     interface communities, as defined by the Secretaries, within \n     the vicinity of Federal lands that are at risk from wildfire. \n     This list shall include:\n       (1) an identification of communities around which hazardous \n     fuel reduction treatments are ongoing; and\n       (2) an identification of communities around which the \n     Secretaries are preparing to begin treatments in calendar \n     year 2000.\n       (c) Prior to May 1, 2001, the Secretary of Agriculture and \n     the Secretary of the Interior shall jointly publish in the \n     Federal Register a list of all urban wildland interface \n     communities, as defined by the Secretaries, within the \n     vicinity of Federal lands and at risk from wildfire that are \n     included in the list published pursuant to subsection (b) but \n     that are not included in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), along \n     with an identification of reasons, not limited to lack of \n     available funds, why there are not treatments ongoing or \n     being prepared for these communities.\n       (d) Within 30 days after enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall publish in the Federal \n     Register the Forest Service's Cohesive Strategy for \n     Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire-Adapted \n     Ecosystems, and an explanation of any differences between the \n     Cohesive Strategy and other related ongoing policymaking \n     activities including: proposed regulations revising the \n     National Forest System transportation policy; proposed \n     roadless area protection regulations; the Interior Columbia \n     Basin Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement; and \n     the Sierra Nevada Framework/Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement. The Secretary shall also \n     provide 30 days for public comment on the Cohesive Strategy \n     and the accompanying explanation.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friends who have spoken to \nthis, there is a novel position in this legislation I think you will \nlike. I am not sure it was not what brought certain environmentalists \nto the White House, along with some others. There are so many people \nsuch as mayors and councilmen in communities who ask us: Look. Right \nover there are all these dead trees, thousands of dead trees. They say: \nWhy do we leave them there dead? The longer we leave them in that \nposition, they are going to turn more and more into additional fodder \nfor fires. What good do we get out of dead trees, just sitting there?\n  Actually, what we are going to say when we finally get around to \npassing this is that the U.S. Government, which owns that property has \nto, in writing, tell that community why they cannot thin that forest, \nand what is holding up action. It is going to be interesting. This \nshould become law because, sooner or later, I am going to ask the \nSenate to vote on it. We ask something that is very understandable and \nmakes common sense.\n  But you see, if you are holding fuel reduction up for a year and a \nhalf for a NEPA statement on land that just has dead trees on it, \nsomebody is going to say: Why don't we hurry up? Why does it take so \nlong?\n  Getting that information is going to be part of this process of \ntrying to get action. We should be saying to our forests and the \ncommunities abutting\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\nthem: We want you to live together. We don't want one to burn the other \none out. And you cannot promise them that if you do not thin those \nforests.\n  With that, I am finished, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum in the \nabsence of a leader. He has asked for a quorum until he returns. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded so I may simply make a statement as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded so that I may speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, we have talked a great deal about the need \nto find a way to consider the China trade bill and also to consider the \nproblem of China nuclear weapons proliferation. Senator Thompson has \ndone a lot of work in this area, as have others. He has a bill that he \nwould like to have considered and has agreed for it to be considered \nfreestanding, separate from the China PNTR legislation, and that he \nwould not feel a need--if I could speak for him just momentarily--to \noffer it as an amendment to the China bill, if we can get it considered \nfreestanding.\n  So we have worked through that. I have discussed this with a number \nof interested parties, including Senator Daschle, and other members on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, July 10, at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with \nthe minority leader, that the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 583, S. 2645, the China Nonproliferation Act. I further \nask consent that the bill be limited to relevant amendments. I finally \nask consent that not later than 12:30 on Tuesday, July 11, the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  Before the Chair rules, I would like to announce that it is my \nintention, as I have reiterated to the Armed Services Committee, that I \nwill give them the opportunity to consider and, hopefully, conclude the \nDOD authorization bill. In fact, I am going to try to do a unanimous \nconsent request on that next. We will try to get that Department of \nDefense authorization bill done--a very important bill--before the \nAugust recess.\n  We are now working on a consent that was outlined last night by the \nchairman and ranking member. It is my hope that we could get an \nagreement on that time. If there is a problem with it, we will continue \nto work to find an agreement where we can remove the nongermane \namendments, deal with the Defense amendments, and complete that very \nimportant legislation.\n  So that is my request that I propound at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will have to object until Senator Baucus \narrives. He is on his way. Hopefully, this matter can be resolved very \nquickly.\n  He has just walked in the Chamber. Senator Baucus is here. He can \nspeak for himself. So until Senator Baucus has a chance to----\n  Mr. LOTT. Others might seek to be recognized on this on their \nreservation.\n  Mr. REID. I have my reservation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, might I ask the leader a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the majority leader, you said something about a \nfreestanding nonproliferation bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in answer to the question of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, this is legislation that has been developed by Senator \nThompson. It is the China Nonproliferation Act. Perhaps under the \nSenator's reservation, he would like to yield to Senator Thompson so he \ncould give a brief response to that question.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, if I might please respond to my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I say to Senator Domenici, this is a piece of \nlegislation that is in response to the continuing array of reports and \ninformation that we have concerning the continued proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction in which the Chinese are engaged.\n  As you know, we are in the process of having an extensive national \nmissile defense system debate in this country. Much of the reason for \nthat need is what the rogue nations are doing. Much of what the rogue \nnations are being supplied with is coming from the Chinese Government \nand Chinese governmental entities.\n  What this bill does is provide for an annual assessment. It is China \nspecific. It is an annual assessment as to their level of proliferation \nactivities. If any entities are engaged in those activities, there are \ncertain responses in which our country engages to cut off those \nentities with regard to dual-use trade, munitions trade, access to our \ncapital market. There is an array of things the President has to choose \nfrom to respond to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the majority leader, I have no objection. I \nwithdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have a reservation that maybe the \nmajority leader can clarify, if he will yield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield under the Senator's \nreservation and respond to the question.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Does this only relate to bringing up the Thompson bill \nand nothing else?\n  Mr. LOTT. This unanimous consent request only deals with the bill S. \n2645, the China Nonproliferation Act. No other issue, no other bill is \nincluded in it.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I have no objection.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I arrived on the floor a little late.\n  What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A unanimous consent request by the majority \nleader is pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my concern \nis that we are setting the July schedule, albeit part of the July \nschedule, but without inclusion of a date or time for PNTR. I am very \nconcerned that as we start taking up matters in July--even though it is \nthe Thompson amendment--who knows what might intervene. You have \nreconciliation; you have appropriations bills, and whatnot. Because we \ndo not have a date certain on the request for PNTR, it could very \neasily slip into September or even a later date.\n  I know it is very much the intention of the majority leader to bring \nup the PNTR in July. He has said that many times. And I very much \nappreciate that. But as I have said personally to the majority leader, \nI am not so certain that, despite his best intentions, he can totally \ncontrol whether or not PNTR actually does come up in July.\n\n  In addition, the merits of the bill that would otherwise be scheduled \nto come up after the July recess is very dangerous. I do not think \nSenators have really had the time to look at the\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\nprovisions of that bill, to think through the implications of that \nbill. It has unilateral sanctions, mandatory--not discretionary--\nsanctions against China. It is very overdrawn. American companies doing \nbusiness in China could be sanctioned. It has extraterritorial \nprovisions which are way beyond the ordinary rules of international \nlaw. I think it would cause a tremendous strain in the context of PNTR.\n  My concern is that we are setting the schedule for July, albeit just \na part of July, that does not include probably the most important vote \nthat this Senate is going to take up this Congress; that is, passage of \nPNTR. And until there is a date set for PNTR, I must respectfully \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we will continue to work with both sides of \nthe aisle to see if this matter can be dealt with in an acceptable way, \naside from it being offered as an amendment to the China PNTR bill. I \nthink that would be potentially a large problem because if it were \nadopted, certainly then that legislation would have to go back to the \nHouse, and there is a lot of concern about that.\n  As far as a time to consider the major bill, the China PNTR, this is \nan important part of the process in a move in that direction. And until \nwe get this resolved, then it is going to be very hard to focus on \nexactly what date we could get a vote on the bill.\n  I must also add that it is true we have a lot of important work to do \nin July. We have to deal with the very unfair death penalty. We have to \ndeal with eliminating the marriage penalty tax. We have to pass the \nagriculture appropriations bill. We have to pass the Interior \nappropriations bill. We have to pass the Housing and Veterans Affairs \nappropriations bill. We have to pass the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. We have to pass the Treasury-Postal Service \nappropriations bill. We have a lot of work to do, and none of it is \ninsignificant.\n  The people's business needs to be taken care of. This is just a part \nof that process. But I understand the Senator's objection. We will keep \nworking to see if we can find a time and a way to do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6225-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

We are not quite there. I have been talking with one of my \ncolleagues in regard to that particular request. We are not there yet. \nUnfortunately, I will object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before the Senator objects, in the spirit of cooperation \nthat we are working under, I would like to withdraw the request so we \ncan keep working and see if we can get this agreed to today.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That would be preferable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is precisely what I and Senator Levin \nand Senator Reid and others have been working on. On our side, as best \nI can assess, there is one remaining understandable discussion that \nmust take place between Chairman Roth of the Finance Committee and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. I believe \nother indications on our side have been fulfilled. I have worked \nthrough the morning. I believe they are fulfilled. So if that one \nremaining issue can hopefully be resolved, we might be able to \nreaddress this today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it looks as if we are going to be here for \nquite some time. I believe we will have an opportunity later on in the \nday to try again. We will certainly do our very best to get this agreed \nto. It is an important issue.

Mr. President, if I could turn to the military construction \nappropriations conference report, that is a very good bill that passed \nway back in May, I think it was May 18. This important military \nconstruction conference report passed the Senate under the leadership \nof Senator Conrad Burns, but from the very beginning, it was a bill \nthat did have some emergency provisions attached to it. We did have the \nfunds for the costs, the money that has been already spent for the \ndefense for Kosovo, and some additional funds for costs associated with \nthat.\n  Over a period now of almost 6 weeks, there has been a process \nunderway between the House and the Senate on both sides of the aisle to \nget an agreement on this conference report that included a title II \nthat had the emergency funds for the Kosovo situation, for the Colombia \ndrug war, and also for emergencies associated with Hurricane Floyd, the \nfires, and other issues.\n  During the process of the conference, other issues were added. Some \nissues that were in were taken out. That is the way a conference works. \nI must confess that I didn't get a look at the final product myself \nuntil this morning. I think we actually had access to it last night. We \ndid get access to it. Senators had an opportunity to review that. If \npoints of order need to be made, they can be made. But this is for \nmilitary construction and for emergencies. We need to get this done. It \nis already late. There are a lot of people, there are a lot of \ndifferent reasons for how that happened, but here we are. As majority \nleader, I have a responsibility to try to bring it to a conclusion and \ntake whatever time that requires.\n  I will shortly ask unanimous consent that the military construction \nappropriations conference report come up. I need to inform all Members \nthat if the agreement is not agreed to or a similar version to this \nthat can--if we cannot come up with something that could be entered \ninto by the full Senate, then it would be my intention to call up the \nconference report and Senators McCain and Gramm will ask, as I \nunderstand it, that it be read. If that is done, it would take some 6 \nhours, I am told by the staff, to read the conference report. I still \nhope we can avoid that. If there are problems with the conference \nreport, let's talk about it. If points of order are going to be made, \nlet's do them. We will have time to understand exactly what is in the \nbill.\n  I am sure we will hear from Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd and \nothers who are familiar with the details. That is what it is all about. \nI realize it is Friday afternoon, but Members have been told for weeks \nthat we would be in session on this Friday and would be having votes.\n  This is an important vote. All we can do is try to come up with a way \nthat we can have a good debate, but if there is objection to proceeding \nand insistence that it be read, then we will have to do that. After \nthat there could be a series of votes on points of order and hopefully \non final passage.\n  I want to outline the situation as it now stands. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate now proceed to the conference report and it be \nconsidered as having been read. I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing 10 minutes for debate between the two managers, and the \nchairman and ranking member, Senator Gramm be recognized to raise a \npoint of order. I further ask unanimous consent Senators Stevens and \nByrd be immediately recognized to make a motion to waive and, following \n10 minutes equally divided on the motion to waive, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on that motion with or without any intervening action or \ndebate. By the way, if we need more time\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\nfor debate, I would be glad to accommodate that.\n\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that if the motion to waive is \nagreed to, the Senate proceed to an immediate vote on the conference \nreport without any intervening action, motion, or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the conference report before us, I am \nunhappy to say, makes a mockery out of the budget. In fact, if we adopt \nthis conference report, I think there is no need that we should ever \nadopt another budget.\n  This conference report violates every tenet of the budget we adopted. \nThis conference report has two major phony spending shifts where we \nshift payments from the fiscal year we are appropriating for backwards \ninto year 2000 so that we can spend an additional $4 billion in clear \nviolation of the budget. I am sure you will hear Senator Stevens saying \nthat the defense of the Nation will be imperiled if we don't pass this \nbill. Yet while we are providing money to defense through this bill on \nan emergency basis, this bill takes $2 billion out of defense and gives \nit to nondefense, a total violation of the budget agreement that we \nstruck.\n  It is Friday. My wife is waiting at the corner of First and C. But if \nwe look the other way on this bill, then there is no budget, and we are \ngoing to totally lose control of spending.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, the greatest argument I have heard for \nbringing this to conclusion is the fact that the Senator's lovely wife \nis waiting for his presence to join him in other activities. I am \ngenuinely concerned about that. If we have to read this bill, I would \nlike to urge the Senator to stay here; I will go see Mrs. Gramm. That \nis the corner of First and C Streets, I believe? I will meet her, and I \nwill provide her with a very lovely lunch in the Senate dining room.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I appreciate that. If my wife were a liberal, I would \nreally be nervous.\n  When she figures out that I am here doing God's work, she is going to \nfigure that the time is better spent than with her.\n  Mr. LOTT. Speaking of the Lord's work, I suggest that the Lord's work \nhere would be to analyze this legislation. Let's engage in discussion; \nlet's point out where there are problems, if any. Let's hear the other \nside. If necessary, let's vote. To spend 6 hours reading the bill is \nnot going to advance the cause. I am glad for the Senator to engage in \nthis.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the majority leader to yield to me for a comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A unanimous consent agreement is pending. Is \nthe Senator from Arizona reserving the right to object?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to respond to a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, we are now \ndoing what we usually do when a pork barrel bill is before us; that is, \nthat national defense and national security are at risk; we will have \nto withdraw from Kosovo; it will be the end of Western civilization as \nwe know it. We already have something from the Pentagon that says we \nwill have to shut down unit training during the month of September, \nblah, blah, blah.\n  So even though in this bill we have, for example, under Kosovo and \nother national security, Olympic Games support; and even though in the \nname of ``emergency'' we have a Coast Guard acquisition of a $45 \nmillion Gulfstream for the Commandant of the Coast Guard--and I would \nbe glad to pay for his first-class airfare while he awaits that \nemergency, to help him ride out the emergency situation, even though we \nhave $10 million for the Bering Sea crab disaster, $10 million for a \nNortheast fishery, $7 million for a Hawaii fishery, and $5 million for \nan Alaska Sea Life Center. We have covered a good part of those for \nsenior members of the Appropriations Committee who have a coastline.\n  These are all done in the name of an emergency. I will ask unanimous \nconsent that we take up and pass without objection all of those, \nincluding this ``dire emergency'' concerning the Olympic Games support \nand what is contained in the Kosovo and other national security \nportions of this bill--I would agree to a unanimous consent agreement \nthat it be taken up and passed, and that the rest of this bill, which \nis incredibly full of unnecessary, unwanted, unauthorized, unmitigated \npork be debated.\n  There are 47 points of order that can be lodged under this \nappropriations bill. What do we want to do? We want to take a $19 \nbillion appropriations bill and pass it by voice vote just because we \nwant to go home for the Fourth of July.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we take the fiscal year 2000 \nappropriations title I on Kosovo and other national security defense \nand pass it, and that we take up the rest of this bill for debate on \npoints of order when we return after the recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a unanimous consent agreement \npending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. At the appropriate parliamentary point, I will propound \nthat request.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will be \nbrief. If we weren't at the end of the session with people on the way \nto the airport, I think we could have a debate on this issue and we \ncould begin to raise 47 points of order against this bill.\n  The problem is that people would come in wanting to leave for the \nrecess and basically understand that if they vote to override the \npoints of order, they could go home for a week. Whereas, if they \nsustain the point of order, they could end up being here for further \ndebate. So I urge my colleagues to allow us to agree that we will allow \nthe bill to come up, waive all of our rights to have it read, and to \ndelay it by other motions, have it come up the day we get back and we \nwill have a debate. If we stay here and ruin everybody's week, we are \ngoing to harden hearts. When we get back to this bill--and it will not \npass today. This bill is not going to pass today. If we harden hearts, \nwe are going to come back here and spend a week when we might have a \nchance to work some of these things out, basically, in a strong-worded \ndebate that will serve no interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to let us step aside, let the bill be brought \nup, waive reading it, but have it be brought up on Monday when we come \nback so we have an opportunity to legitimately make our case. If these \nwere little trivial matters, then I would look the other way, swallow \nhard, and let it go. But these are not trivial matters. This is \nbasically eliminating the entire budget that we adopted. I think if we \ndo that, we are making a mockery out of the whole process. I am not \ngoing to do it. So I object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have two things. There is one clarification I wish to \nmake on what Senator Gramm said. If one of the points of order should \nbe sustained, or if a major one was made and sustained, we would not \nnecessarily have to continue this. This bill then would go back to the \nHouse when they return. They would have to take it up and consider it \nfurther. I realize there may be multiple points of order. If one were \nsustained, there might be others.\n  Look, I understand what Senator Gramm is saying. I certainly feel \nvery strongly that our budget process should be protected and, if it is \nviolated, there should be an opportunity to address those points of \norder. I have no problem with that. All I say is I think to read the \nbill doesn't help anybody's cause. I think we would be better off if we \nget into a discussion and talk about what is in the bill.\n  So, again, I am sympathetic with all sides concerned, and I would \nlike to get out from the middle of the crossfire of the ammunition \nbeing employed here. At this point, since there is objection, I have \nno----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, am I proceeding under leader time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret deeply that there is a dispute \nover these items. It is true that there is some money in the bill, and \nall of the items the Senator from Arizona mentioned, but one, were in \nthe Senate-\n\n[[Page S6227]]\n\npassed bill. The Sea Life Center is the only new one. It is a provision \nto pay a rent for a Sea Life Center, which will close in August \nunless that can be done. It is a Sea Life Center that has Federal money \nin it that opened it. If somebody doesn't believe that is an emergency, \nthe right thing is to allow us to vote on it. I am perfectly prepared \nto muster up 60 votes for that Sea Life Center. I am proud of that Sea \nLife Center.\n\n  I say this to the Members of the Senate. There is not one amendment \nin this bill that was not presented by a Member who is here. I assume \nthe Members are prepared to vote for the items they told us were \nemergencies. The Senator from Arizona is well known to be the watchdog \nof the Treasury and I admire that. I believe we should get on with this \nbusiness and let's test the votes.\n  The Senator is right. If there are not 60 votes to establish the \nemergency designation on this bill, it will be returned to the Senate. \nBut that is going to be the same, whether it is now or 6 hours from \nnow.\n  I remember so well when one of my former colleagues killed a bill, \nwhich we worked on for 7 years, in the last few minutes of a Congress \nby asking that the bill be read. I have always thought that bills don't \nhave to be read if they are available to Members of the Senate. That \nused to be the understanding, that they would be read if the bill was \nnot physically on the Members' desks. I will be pleased to put it on \nevery Member's desk now. It has been available since last night. But to \nhave us now go into a reading of the bill--the Senator from Texas says \nhis wife is waiting on the corner. My wife is already in Alaska. I am \ndue there tonight. But the sad thing is that the last plane I could \ntake to make it left at 10 o'clock. I am prepared to stay here all \nweek, if it is necessary.\n  I have put before the Members of the Senate--and I will ask unanimous \nconsent to print this in the Record. It is not fake or a manufactured \nthing. We have been telling the Senate for days and months that this \nmoney had been taken from the operation and maintenance account--the \nPresident's action employing troops in Kosovo. He has the right to do \nthat under the act. And the money runs out. On July 5, this new order \nmust go into effect that reduces the actions of our people during the \nperiod of maximum training in the summertime. It is not fake. I don't \nknow why anyone would question the statements of the Chief of Staff of \nthe Army.\n  The bill may not pass today, but it is going to pass before July 5. \nThat is my commitment. If the Senator wants to make a commitment that \nit doesn't pass today, I will make a commitment that it passes by July \n5. I believe we have the capacity to do that. It is the desire to have \nthis bill passed and to have the people of the armed services know the \nSenate is behind the people in the armed services. It is still a \nmilitary construction bill, an emergency bill to replace money spent \nfor the operation and maintenance account.\n  It is a must-pass bill before July 5.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move that the Senate turn to the \nconference report to accompany the military construction appropriations \nconference report.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask that the bill be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I make a point of order that I don't \nthink the bill has to be read. The bill is available to all Members of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not sustained.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the ruling of the Chair \nbe upheld?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas has raised a \nquestion about the pay shifts that are assumed in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The appeal of the ruling of the Chair is not \ndebatable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw my appeal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed is not debatable.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nmake a statement at this point and that the Senator from Texas be able \nto speak prior to taking action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas has asked that we \nremove from the bill the pay shifts which we assumed were available to \nour committee in order to increase the amount of budget authority and \noutlays that would be used by our committee. The Senator can name them \nand make sure we are naming them correctly.\n  Mr. GRAMM. An SSI pay shift of $2.4 billion; a VA compensation pay \nshift for $1.9 billion; and the third item is moving the defense \nfirewall, which would transfer $2 billion from defense to nondefense.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at a later date I will explain in full \nwhat that means.\n  But I make the commitment to the Senator from Texas that on the first \navailable vehicle to the Appropriations Committee we will rescind the \naction that is in this bill adjusting those pay shifts and taking them \ninto account for future use. They were mechanisms to make available \nfunds that would be used in the 2001 bill, and we can and we will have \nto make adjustments in other ways in the future. But these shifts have \nbeen objected to, and they will not be used this year. I can't say they \nwon't be available in another year. They will not be used in connection \nwith fiscal year 2001.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe conference report be dispensed with and that a vote occur on \nadoption of the conference report immediately.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I obviously am disturbed about much that was put into this \nlegislation. But I see a $6 billion savings here. So I think it is a \nreasonable compromise. I intend to put in the Record as well as on my \nweb site and many other places some of the really egregious projects \nthat are in this bill. At the same time, this significant savings I \nthink is a very important move.\n  I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4425) ``making appropriations for military construction, \n     family housing, and base realignment and closure for the \n     Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September \n     30, 2001, and for other purposes,'' having met, after full \n     and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses as follows:\n       That the House recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the Senate, and agree to the same with an \n     amendment and the Senate agree to the same. Signed by all of \n     the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report\n  The conference report is printed in the Record of Thursday, June 29, \n2000.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nMilitary Construction Conference Report for fiscal year 2001.\n  The Senate and the House went into conference with very different \nrecommendations for projects and unfortunately, not enough money to go \naround.\n  We have worked hard with our House colleagues to bring the Military \nConstruction Conference to a successful conclusion.\n  This agreement represents a tremendous amount of work and great deal \nof cooperation between the House and Senate.\n  Mr. President, the military construction portion of this bill has \nsome points I want to highlight.\n\n[[Page S6228]]\n\n  We have sought to recommend a balanced bill that addresses key, \nmilitary construction requirements for readiness, family housing, \nbarracks, quality of life and funding for the reserve components.\n  In the final conference agreement relating to military construction, \nwe met our goals of protecting quality of life and enhancing mission \nreadiness throughout the Department of Defense.\n  It provides a total of $8.8 billion in spending, an increase of $200 \nmillion over the levels recommended by both the House and Senate, and \nan increase of $800 million over the President's budget request.\n  It is my hope that we can move this bill forward very quickly and \nsend it to the President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, late Thursday, the conference concluded \non H.R. 4425, the Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction Appropriations \nAct.\n  When the appropriations committee in the Senate reported that bill, \nwe included a second division, Division B, that provided a series of \nemergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense, \nthe Coast Guard, and other national defense related activities.\n  The conferees on this bill, led by the subcommittee chairman, Senator \nBurns, addressed both the underlying military construction bill, and an \nexpanded range of emergency supplementary needs.\n  Upon completing work on the military construction portion, an \namendment was offered by myself, Senator Byrd, the House committee \nchairman, Bill Young, and the House ranking Member, David Obey.\n  The amendment addressed fiscal year 2000 funding needs for the \nDepartment of Defense, the Coast Guard, wildfire fighting, recovery \nfrom hurricanes Floyd and Irene, the Cerro Grande fire in New Mexico, \nLiheap, and Plain Colombia.\n  At several critical points, the personal involvement of the Speaker \non the House and the Majority Leader in the Senate were invaluable to \nbreaking through disagreements, and achieving completion of our work.\n  While Senator Burns will address the military construction portion of \nthe bill, I want to highlight the defense emergency needs addressed in \nthis conference report.\n  Once again, the President mortgaged the readiness of our Armed Forces \nby committing troops abroad, without the prior authorization and \nfunding from Congress.\n  If this bill did not pass this week, the Army faced a genuine \ncalamity, as training, base operations and other critical functions \nwould have ground to a halt.\n  These funds, provided to sustain the Army through the remainder of \nthis fiscal year, will prevent any interruption or degradation of our \nArmed Forces.\n  In addition, the conferees, under the leadership of Representative \nJerry Lewis, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nresponded to several vital defense needs.\n  The amendment, offered by the four Members I named, provides a total \nof $11.23 billion in emergency spending for fiscal year 2000.\n  The amendment also makes several technical changes, pursuant to the \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 2001 adopted earlier this year, \nconcerning changes to pay days, delayed obligations, progress payments, \nprompt payment, and other matters.\n  In addition, the amendment permits the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to allocate the full amount provided in the 302(a) allocation \nfor discretionary spending in the budget resolution. This is the same \namount now available to the House Committee.\n  The amendment also adjusts the Function 050 outlay firewall included \nin the budget resolution to reflect the actual outlay levels in the \nFunction 050 related bills reported by the House and Senate committees.\n  I want to especially commend the Chairman of the House Military \nConstruction Subcommittee, Representative Hobson, and the Chairman of \nthe House Committee, Bill Young, for their cooperation and leadership \nin presenting this conference report to the House and Senate.\n  Critical funding shortfalls for fuel, medical care, contract \nliabilities for Tricare, depot maintenance and intelligence were \naddressed in the House passed version of the supplemental, and included \nin this conference report.\n  Chairman Lewis' initiative ensured that the readiness and quality of \nlife for our military personnel will be truly enhanced by these \ninitiatives, and provide the right starting point for our work on the \nconference for the FY 2001 Defense Appropriations Bill when we return \nfrom the July 4th recess.\n  A second important need met in this conference report is for Western \nwildfire fighting. As we meet here in Washington, fires are burning in \nseveral Western States, especially Washington State and my own State of \nAlaska.\n  The $350 million provided in this conference report will ensure the \nBureau of Land Management and the Forest Service will be able to \nrespond to any challenges we face during what promises to be a dry and \nhot summer--a truly dangerous situation.\n  Last month, at the request of the senior Senator from New Mexico, I \ntraveled to the Los Alamos National Laboratories during the terrible \nfire that afflicted that area.\n  I saw firsthand the devastation to that community, and the federal \nfacilities, caused by that fire.\n  Senator Domenici has included in this bill a comprehensive \nauthorization bill that provides a claims settlement mechanism for the \nfamilies and businesses who lost so much in that tragedy.\n  In addition, this conference report provides $661 million to initiate \nthe claims settlement process and restoration of the federal \nfacilities. These provisions brought to the conference by Senator \nDomenici will start the long recovery process, reflecting the Federal \nGovernment's liability for this disaster.\n  In this conference report, there are also several matters of great \nimportance to my State. I appreciate the willingness of the conferees \nto consider these items.\n  Finally, I want to again thank the distinguished Ranking Member of \nour Committee, Senator Byrd, for his work to complete work on this \nbill. All the conferees met and worked in a spirit of bipartisan \ncompromise, which is reflected in the conference report before the \nSenate.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this conference report today, so that it \ncan go immediately to the President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon take up the FY 2001 \nMilitary Construction Conference Report. In addition to meeting the \nmilitary construction needs of the nation, Divisions B & C contain \nemergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2000 totaling some $11.2 \nbillion.\n  The supplemental portion of the bill funds a broad array of urgently \nneeded programs. More than $6 billion is provided for the emergency \nneeds of the military. Of that amount, some $2 billion is to cover the \ncost of our peacekeeping operations in Kosovo; $1.6 billion is to \nrecover increased fuel costs to the military; and $1.3 billion is for \nhealth benefits for the military. For the victims of natural disasters, \nparticularly those who suffered the ravages of Hurricane Floyd, some \n$300 million is provided. And, $350 million is provided in emergency \nfunds to replenish the fire management accounts of the Department of \nthe Interior and U.S. Forest Service. Those firefighting accounts are \ntotally depleted and must be replenished immediately. The bill also \nprovides $600 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance grants, and \nmore than $600 million is provided to address the costs related to the \ndisastrous fire at Los Alamos, New Mexico.\n  One of the biggest pieces of the supplemental package is $1.3 billion \nto fully fund the President's request in support of Plan Colombia. The \nPresident's anti-drug initiative is an ambitious effort in support of \nPlan Colombia, a massive undertaking by the Colombian government to \nfight the alarming rise of heroin and cocaine production and \ntrafficking in Colombia.\n  The intent of the President's aid package to Colombia is laudable; \nbut at this point, there remain more questions than answers as to what \nthe impact of this assistance will be. Our efforts in the past have \ndone little, if anything, to deter Colombia's drug lords. The \nproduction of cocaine and heroin has skyrocketed. Some analysts are \nconcerned that increased U.S. involvement in Colombia's drug wars will\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nfuel an all-out civil war in a country already ravaged by guerrilla \nwarfare and paramilitary abuses.\n  For those reasons, I am pleased that this conference report preserves \na provision that I originally added in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to place restrictions on future funding for U.S. assistance \nto Plan Colombia, and to limit the number of U.S. military personnel \nand U.S. civilian contractors that can be deployed in Colombia to \nsupport the counter-narcotics effort.\n  The Byrd provision requires the Administration to seek and receive \ncongressional authorization before spending any money on U.S. support \nfor Plan Colombia beyond the funding contained in this supplemental \npackage and other relevant funding bills. The President's request for \nPlan Colombia is fully funded. This provision simply ensures that, if \nadditional funding is requested to prolong or expand U.S. involvement \nin Colombia's anti-drug campaign, Congress will have the opportunity to \nreview and evaluate the entire program before green-lighting more \nmoney.\n  The goal of my provision is to prevent an incremental and possibly \nunintended escalation of U.S. involvement in Colombia's war on drugs to \nthe point that the United States, over time, finds itself entangled \nbeyond extraction in the internal politics of Colombia. We cannot \nignore the fact that Colombia is embroiled in a civil war, and that \nnarco-guerrillas, who are better-trained, better-financed, and better-\nequipped than the Colombian army, control much of the country. The \ngovernment of Colombia is fighting a just, but uphill battle. The \nUnited States, in this funding package, is making a major commitment to \nhelp Colombia. With the Byrd provision, we are also making a commitment \nto the people of the United States that Congress will stand guard \nagainst this nation's being unwittingly drawn too deeply into \nColombia's internal problems.\n  Mr. President, this Administration has, in the past, registered \nstrong opposition to the Byrd provision. I assure the Senate that we \nhave listened to the concerns expressed by the Administration, and have \naddressed them. We doubled the cap on U.S. military personnel to 500, \nas requested by the Pentagon, and tripled the allowable number of U.S. \ncivilian contractors to 300. We exempted funding for on-going counter-\nnarcotics programs covered in other appropriations bills, as requested \nby the Administration. We addressed virtually every issue raised by the \nAdministration, and I hope that the President is ready to endorse this \nlanguage.\n  It is my opinion that the Administration should welcome the spotlight \nthat this provision will shine on the level of U.S. participation in \nPlan Colombia. The Administration should also welcome the additional \nsafeguards that this language provides to reduce the possibility of \nunbridled mission creep and unforeseen consequences.\n  There are some who have expressed concern that this language is too \nrestrictive, and that it will impose too difficult a process to allow \nthe United States to continue its efforts to fight drug production and \ndrug trafficking in Colombia and throughout the region. I believe the \nprocess should be restrictive. I do not believe that U.S. assistance to \nPlan Colombia should be handled on a business-as-usual basis. The \npolitical situation in Colombia is too unstable, and the risks to \nAmerican citizens involved in the counter-narcotics campaign are too \nhigh.\n  That said, my provision is not intended to slam the door on future \ncounter-narcotics assistance to Colombia or to other countries in the \nregion, if such assistance is needed and warranted. The war on drugs \nmust be waged aggressively, both at home and abroad. At this point, the \nPresident has requested a specific level of funding, $1.3 billion, to \nfinance a specific program. Congress is providing that funding in this \nappropriations measure. If this President, or a future President, seeks \nmore money, or seeks to broaden or prolong U.S. involvement in Plan \nColombia, we merely ask him to present that request to Congress, and to \ngive Congress the opportunity to review, assess, and authorize the \nentire program. What we do not want to see is U.S. assistance to Plan \nColombia quietly ramped up through regular or supplemental funding \nbills until we suddenly reach the point of having thousands of U.S. \ncitizens deployed to Colombia, and billions of U.S. tax dollars \ninvested in Colombia's drug war, and no way to extricate the United \nStates from Colombia.\n  Mr. President, Congress has a responsibility to exercise oversight \nover programs such as U.S. participation in Plan Colombia. This \nprovision ensures that we will have the opportunity to exercise that \noversight, and to make an informed and deliberate decision on future \nfunding for Plan Colombia. It is a wise precaution to include in a \npackage that will underwrite a costly, complicated, and unprecedented \nassault on a dangerous and determined enemy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the bill before us provides over $1 \nbillion in assistance to Colombia and represents a major increase in \nour political and financial commitment to the Colombian Government and \nthe Colombian Armed Forces.\n  Many of us have been deeply concerned about the potential impact of \nthis substantial increase in U.S. military assistance on human rights \nin Colombia. We have worked with the Senate Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee to include human rights conditions on the \naid. I commend Senators McConnell and Leahy for their leadership on \nthis issue and for preserving the human rights conditions in the final \nversion of the bill. The conditions are fully consistent with the laws \nand stated policies of the Colombian Government. They are also vital to \nensuring that U.S. military aid does not contribute to human rights \nabuses in Colombia. We look forward to working with the Administration \nto achieve the Colombian Government's compliance with them.\n  The first condition requires that armed forces personnel alleged to \nhave committed gross violations of human rights be suspended from duty \nand brought to justice in the civilian courts, in accordance with the \n1997 ruling of Colombia's Constitutional Court. The Colombian Ministry \nof National Defense has stated that, ``the Commander General of the \nMilitary Forces will separate from active service, by discretionary \ndecision, members of the various Military Forces for inefficiency or \nfor unsatisfactory performance in the fight against illegal armed \ngroups.'' Unfortunately, this policy has not been implemented, and \nthere is no automatic process for suspending a member of the Colombian \nArmed Forces alleged to have violated human rights.\n  The Colombian Ministry of National Defense has expressed its support \nfor the 1997 ruling of the Constitutional Court. In its March 2000 \npublication entitled ``Public Force and Human Rights in Colombia,'' the \nColombian Ministry of National Defense stated that, ``Colombia has \ntaken very important steps in limiting the jurisdiction of the military \njustice system. In effect, in 1997 the Constitutional Court concluded \nthat crimes against humanity do not fall under its jurisdiction because \nit does not relate to the service provided by the Public Force. Such \ncrimes constitute a serious violation of human rights and transgress \nthe duties of armed services. Consequently, the Constitutional Court \ndecided that such crimes be heard by the Ordinary Criminal Courts.''\n  Unfortunately, the Colombian Armed Forces have grossly misrepresented \ntheir record of compliance with this Constitutional Court ruling. They \nhave claimed that 576 human rights cases involving Armed Forces \npersonnel were transferred to civilian courts when, in fact, only 39 \ncases of human rights violations were transferred--and those cases \ninvolved low level officials.\n  The human rights conditions contained in the bill also require the \nColombian Government to prosecute in the civilian courts the leaders \nand members of paramilitary groups and armed forces personnel who aid \nor abet them. This provision is also fully consistent with the stated \npolicies of the Colombian Government. In its publication entitled \n``Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Policies,'' the \nColombian Ministry of National Defense stated that illegal self-defense \ngroups ``are one of the main offenders of human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law.'' In its publication entitled ``Public \nForce and Human Rights in Colombia,'' the Ministry further stated that \nthe Public Force confronts and combats guerrilla and illegal self-\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\ndefense groups ``with the same rigor.'' President Pastrana's ``Plan \nColombia'' is quite clear on this issue, stating that ``the Government \nwill not tolerate ties of any kind between any member of the military \nforces or the police and any illegal armed group or force.''\n  Regrettably, the State Department, the United Nations, and human \nrights groups have documented continuing links between the Colombian \nArmed Forces and paramilitary groups. The State Department Human Rights \nReport for 1999 stated that the Armed Forces and National Police \nsometimes ``tacitly tolerated'' or ``aided and abetted'' the activities \nof paramilitary groups. According to the report, ``in some instances, \nindividual members of the security forces actively collaborated with \nmembers of paramilitary groups by passing them through roadblocks, \nsharing intelligence, and providing them with ammunition. Paramilitary \nforces find a ready support base within the military and police.'' The \nreport also concluded that ``security forces regularly failed to \nconfront paramilitary groups.'' Human Rights Watch has documented links \nbetween military and paramilitary groups, not only in isolated, rural \nareas but in Colombia's principal cities, and these links involve half \nof Colombia's 18 brigade-level units.\n  The Colombian Armed Forces have resisted investigating these links. \nInstead of investigating a credible allegation of military \ncollaboration with paramilitary groups in a civilian massacre that \noccurred in the town of San Jose de Apartado on February 19, the \nCommander of the 17th Brigade filed suit against the non-governmental \norganization that made these allegations, charging that it had \n``impugned'' the honor of the military.\n  The human rights conditions contained in the bill reflect the \nColombian Government's laws and policies and underscore the importance \nof human rights as a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy. \nCompliance with these conditions is essential if we are to ensure that \nU.S. military aid does not contribute to human rights abuses in \nColombia.\n  I am disappointed that the conference agreement permits the President \nto waive the conditions in the interest of national security. However, \nthe inclusion of this waiver authority does not exempt the \nAdministration from responsibility for seeking the Colombian \nGovernment's compliance with these human rights conditions. Nor is the \nwaiver an excuse for the Colombian Government not to address the \ncontinuing human rights problems in Colombia. I look forward to the \ngood faith application of these important human rights provisions in \nthe implementation of this legislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues on \nthe Appropriations Committee who have worked with me, the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell; the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham; \nthe Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley; and so many others on the \nemergency supplemental provisions contained in the Conference Report to \nthe Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction Appropriations bill. I am \nespecially pleased that the Conference Report contains essential funds \nto begin correcting resource and funding shortfalls in the U.S. Coast \nGuard, and vital assistance needed to reverse the deteriorating \nsituation in Colombia--a situation I would like to discuss in just a \nfew minutes.\n  First, though, let me say a few words about the Coast Guard's \ncurrent--and precarious--budget situation and how this Conference \nReport will help keep it afloat--at least for the remainder of this \nfiscal year. The reality is that our Coast Guard has been forced to cut \nback on its current services this year and could be forced to cut back \neven more next year. These reductions make it far more difficult for \nthe Coast Guard to meet its many missions. They put at risk the \nsustainability of valuable fish stocks in the North Atlantic and \nPacific Northwest. They reduce the Coast Guard's capability to stem the \nflow of illicit drugs and illegal immigration into the United States. \nAnd they can work against the Coast Guard's ability to respond quickly \nto search and rescue situations, which often in fishing grounds and \nhigh traffic migrant areas.\n  As early as last February, the Coast Guard began reducing its \noperating hours in the air and at sea. In some parts of the country, \noperating hours have been reduced as much as 20 to 30 percent.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, the Conference Report we passed today \nwill carry the Coast Guard through the current fiscal year. In total, \nmore than $700 million is provided to help restore the Coast Guard's \naircraft and vessel spare parts supply; cover the cost of rising fuel \nprices; pay for rising health care costs and quality of life \nimprovements for Coast Guard personnel; and increase by six its fleet \nof C-130 aircraft--assets critical to the Coast Guard's counter-drug \nand search and rescue capabilities.\n  Additionally, the Conference Report includes funding for the \nreplacement of the Great Lakes Ice Breaking vessel--the Mackinaw. As my \ncolleagues from the Great Lakes region know, this replacement vessel is \ninvaluable to avoid disruption of winter-time commerce on the Great \nLakes.\n  This legislation is a step in the right direction, but it is only a \nstep. Our Coast Guard still remains seriously underfunded. We must \nstill address the overall funding problems facing the Coast Guard, \nwhich is the task that awaits the conferees to the Transportation \nAppropriations bill. Unless we address this funding crisis, our Coast \nGuard will be in the exact same boat--no pun intended--year after year. \nUltimately, unless we put the Coast Guard under a far more sound \nfinancial footing, we risk compromising the entire Coast Guard \napparatus, its routine and emergency operations, training and \nmaintenance functions, and even its safety and commercial missions \nalong our coasts and Great Lakes.\n\n  Not long ago, the Senate approved a Transportation Appropriations \nbill for the next fiscal year that would fund the Coast Guard's \noperating expenses at a level $159 million less than what it needs to \nconduct its missions. Mr. President, I understand the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Transportation Subcommittee had to make some \ntough choices. They had a smaller budget to work with than their \ncounterparts in the House. In fact, the House had $1.6 billion more in \nits allocation for the Transportation Appropriations Bill than the \nSenate. This funding disparity needs to be resolved in the upcoming \nconference.\n  Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues about the unique \nimportance of the Coast Guard. They are called ``the rescue experts,'' \nand for good reason. Each year, the Coast Guard responds to 40,000 \nsearch and rescue cases and saves 3,800 lives. During the devastation \nof Hurricane Floyd, the Coast Guard conducted search and rescue \nmissions and delivered drinking water and critical supplies to citizens \nalong the Eastern seaboard. And, following the dramatic floods in North \nCarolina that resulted from the hurricane, Coast Guard helicopters came \nin right behind the storm and pulled stranded survivors from rooftops \nand trees surrounded by the swollen rivers.\n  The Coast Guard's rescue and response missions are often front page \nnews, but often the untold stories are the emergencies prevented by the \nCoast Guard. Few people realize that before any cruise ship ever \ntouches the ocean, Coast Guard ship inspectors from its Marine Safety \nOffices inspect each ship to ensure they are built not just for beauty \nand recreation, but for safety as well. That's good news for the \napproximately seven million Americans who embark on cruise ships every \nyear. In fact, the Coast Guard doesn't just inspect cruise ships--the \nCoast Guard inspects all commercial ships, including cargo ships and \ntankers.\n  Of course, I have spoken on the Senate floor on several occasions to \nhighlight the Coast Guard's extraordinary contributions to keep illegal \ndrugs from ever reaching our shores. The scourge of drugs is the \nprimary security threat within this hemisphere. It is a cancer that \ndestroys civil institutions and erodes the sovereignty of nations in \nthe Caribbean and South and Central America.\n  That is why a number of us here in the Senate and the House worked to \nprovide additional funding in 1998 for the Coast Guard's counter-drug \nefforts, and that investment has paid off. The following year, the \nCoast Guard seized 57 tons of cocaine with a street value of $4 \nbillion--that's more than the total operating cost of the Coast Guard.\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\n  The Coast Guard's law enforcement skills extends as far as the Middle \nEast, where Coast Guard cutters and tactical law enforcement teams \nenforce the continuing U.N. embargo against Iraq.\n  Perhaps one of the Coast Guard's toughest jobs is the day to day \nenforcement of U.S. immigration law. It is an emotional and gut \nwrenching mission. It challenges Coast Guard men and women daily to \ncarry out their responsibilities with due regard for the law, human \ndignity and, above all, safety of human life. It is a tough job. But, \nday in and day out, the Coast Guard continues to carry out its duties \nwith professionalism and a never-ending commitment to the people it \nserves.\n  These are just some of the vital missions that would be undermined if \nthe Coast Guard is not given the resources to sustain its daily \noperations. In some respects, we have passed that point already. The \nCoast Guard is at a point that it is essentially cannibalizing \nequipment for parts, deferring maintenance, and working their people \novertime--and this is just to sustain daily operations. This doesn't \neven take into account the rapidly rising fuel costs, which are \nexacerbating problems this fiscal year.\n  At the same time, the Coast Guard has to invest in its future. When \ncompared to 41 other maritime agencies around the world, the ships that \nmake up our Coast Guard fleet of cutters are the 38th oldest. Over the \npast four years, the Coast Guard has had to spend twice as much money \nto fix equipment and hull problems. This is not surprising because the \nolder the equipment becomes, the harder it is to maintain. As the need \nfor equipment maintenance increases, so too does the cost of \noperations. This is a problem that is not the result of mismanagement, \nbut from insufficient funding. And that fact is reflected by this \nCongress having to use emergency supplemental funding for the Coast \nGuard two straight years just to sustain normal operations. I think you \nwould agree, Mr. President, that this kind of stop-gap funding process \nis not the best way to keep an organization running--particularly one \nof such vital importance to our nation.\n  I urge the conferees to the Transportation Appropriations bill, in \nboth the House and Senate, to keep these facts in mind as they proceed \nto conference. Again, the bill we have passed today is a good first \nstep, but it is only that--a step.\n  Today, the United States Congress took a very important and necessary \nstep toward bringing stability to countries in our hemisphere, and \ncommunities in our own country that are caught in the death grip of \ndrug trafficking.\n  Today, we are sending to the President more than just an assistance \npackage to Colombia--we are sending a blueprint of a partnership with \nColombia and other countries in the hemisphere to reduce illegal drug \nproduction and distribution. This is partnership among democracies in \nour hemisphere.\n  No one denies that an emergency exists in Colombia. The country is \nembroiled in a destabilizing and brutal civil war--a civil war that has \ngone on for decades with a death toll estimated at 35,000. The once \npromising democracy is now a war zone. Human rights abuses abound and \nrule of law is practically non-existent.\n  The situation in Colombia today bears little resemblance to a nation \nonce considered to be a democratic success story. But today, the drug \ntrade has threatened the sovereignty of the Colombian democracy and the \ncontinued prosperity and security of our entire hemisphere. And, \ntragically, America's drug habit is what's fueling this threat in our \nhemisphere. It is our own country's drug use that is causing the \ninstability and violence in Colombia and in the Andean region. When \ndrug deals are made on the streets of our country, they represent a \ncontribution to continued violence in Colombia and in the Andean \nregion.\n  The sad fact is that the cultivation of coca in Colombia has doubled \nfrom over 126,000 acres in 1995 to 300,000 in 1999. Not surprisingly, \nas drug availability has increased in the United States, drug use among \nadolescents also has increased. To make matters worse, the Colombian \ninsurgents see the drug traffickers as a financial partner who will \nsustain their illicit cause, which only makes the FARC and the ELN grow \nstronger.\n  A synergistic relationship has evolved between the drug dealers and \nthe guerrillas--a relationship bonded by the money made selling drugs \nhere in the United States. Each one benefits from the other. Each one \ntakes care of the other. This is not a crisis internal to Colombia. It \nis a crisis driven by those who consume drugs in our country, and a \ncrisis that directly impacts all of us right here in the United States.\n  It is a crisis that has flourished in part because the current \nAdministration made a significant and unwise policy change in its drug \ncontrol strategy in 1993. When President George Bush left the White \nHouse, we were spending approximately one-quarter of our total federal \nanti-drug budget on international drug interdiction--spending it either \non law enforcement in other countries, on Customs, on the DEA, on crop \neradication--basically on stopping drugs from ever reaching our shores.\n  After six years of the Clinton presidency, that one-quarter was \nreduced to approximately 13 to 14 percent, a dramatic reduction in the \npercentage of money we were spending on international drug \ninterdiction.\n  Fortunately, in the last few years, Congress has had the foresight to \nrecognize the escalating threats in Colombia, and has worked to restore \nour drug fighting capability outside our borders. In 1998, Congress \npassed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act (WHDEA), which not \nonly has begun to restore our international eradication, interdiction \nand crop alternative development capabilities, it contained the first \nsubstantial investment in Colombia for counter-narcotics activities in \nalmost a decade.\n  Today, we are building on that effort with a more focused plan to \neliminate drugs at the source and to reduce the financial influence of \ndrug trafficking organizations on the paramilitaries and insurgents \nwithin Colombia. In short, Mr. President, we are reversing the \ndirection of our drug policy for the better. Congress saw what the \nAdministration was doing. We said the policy has to change; we need to \nput more money into interdiction and source country programs; and \nthat's exactly what we did.\n  We must not lose sight of why we are providing this assistance. The \nbottom line is this: The assistance package we put together because \nColombia is our neighbor--and what affects our neighbors affects us \ntoo. We have a very real interest in stabilizing Colombia and keeping \nit democratic and keeping it as a trading partner, and keeping its \ndrugs off our streets.\n  As we consider the great human tragedy that Colombia is today, we \nmust not lose sight of the fact that the resources we are providing to \nColombia now are an effort to stop drugs from ever coming into our \ncountry in the future. And ultimately, the emergency aid package is in \nthe best interest of the Colombia-Andean region. It is in the best \ninterest of the United States. And, it is clearly something we had to \ndo.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks \nof the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who has \ntaken a strong, personal interest in the human rights conditions in the \nColombia aid portion of this bill.\n  Senator Kennedy and I, with the support of other Senators, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, including some strong supporters of this \nColombia aid package, wrote these conditions which passed the Senate on \nJune 22. The Senate version, which passed overwhelmingly, did not \ncontain the presidential waiver that was included by the conferees. \nThere was virtually no meaningful opportunity for most Senators, \nespecially Democrats, to participate in the Conference on the Colombia \naid package, and I am disappointed that the waiver was included.\n  If the Administration had a history of giving the protection of human \nrights in Colombia the attention it deserves there would be no need for \nthese conditions. Unfortunately, the Administration, as well as the \nColombian Government, have consistently misrepresented, and overstated, \nthe Colombian Government's efforts to punish human rights violators. \nThis causes me great concern. There is no need for\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\nthe waiver and no justification for waiving these conditions.\n  Senator Kennedy has described the situation in detail so I will not \nrepeat what he has said. However, I do want to respond to a couple of \nthe State Department's claims:\n  The State Department has said that ``dramatic steps have been taken \n[by the Colombian Government] to deal with the legacy of human rights \nabuses.'' It cites a change in Colombian law, such that ``military \nofficers responsible for human rights violations are tried in civilian \ncourts.'' That is a gross misrepresentation of what actually occurs. \nThe Colombian Armed Forces have systematically, and successfully, \nsought to avoid civilian court jurisdiction of human rights crimes by \nmany of its members.\n  The State Department has also said that ``President Pastrana has \nstated repeatedly that he will not tolerate collaboration, by \ncommission or omission, between security force members and \nparamilitaries.'' I am sure President Pastrana, who I greatly admire, \nhas said that. But the reality is that this collaboration has existed \nfor years, and virtually nothing has been done about it. In fact, it is \nonly recently, when pressed, that the Administration and the Colombian \nGovernment even acknowledged that it was going on. To date, little has \nbeen done to stop it.\n  This is not to say that the Colombian Government has done nothing to \naddress the human rights problems. It has, and I want to recognize \nthat. But that is no argument for waiving these conditions. Far more \nneeds to be done, especially to punish those who violate human rights.\n  There is no doubt that the Administration believes that supporting \n``Plan Colombia'' is in our national security interests. However, the \nAdministration has also said, repeatedly, that promoting human rights \nis a key goal of ``Plan Colombia.'' The Colombian Government has said \nthe same thing. If those pronouncements means anything, they mean that \nit is not in our national interests to provide assistance to the \nColombian Armed Forces if the basic human rights conditions in this \nbill are not met, particularly when the Colombian Government has said \nthese conditions are fully consistent with its own policies. This is \nnot asking too much. These are not unreasonable conditions. To the \ncontrary, they are the minimum that should be done to ensure that our \naid does not go to forces that violate human rights. There is no reason \nwhatsoever that the Administration cannot use the leverage of this aid \npackage to ensure that these conditions are met, and I fully expect the \nAdministration to do so.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nchanges that were made to ``Plan Colombia'' in the military \nconstruction conference report. As if this body did not originally give \nenough to the military ``Push into Southern Colombia'' with $250 \nmillion, this conference report increases that amount by $140 million, \nto fund a 390 million dollar first-time offensive military action in \nsouthern Colombia.\n  ``Plan Colombia'' has been added to this conference report as an \nemergency supplemental. We are moving it through this Congress quickly \nunder the guise of a ``drug emergency.'' But, if there is truly a drug \nemergency in this country, and I believe there is, why are there no \nresources in this plan targeted to where they will do the most good: \nproviding funding for drug treatment programs at home? And, honestly, \nif the purpose of this military aid is to stop the supply of drugs, \nshouldn't some of that aid target the North as well? Something strange \nand dishonest is going on here.\n  During our debate over ``Plan Colombia'' I heard over and over again \nnot only how much the Colombian government needed this assistance, but \nalso how urgently it had to have it. I heard over and over again how if \nColombia did not get this money now all hope for democracy would be \nlost, not only in Colombia but also for many other Latin and South \nAmerican countries as well. This, my colleagues, is a far cry from \nstopping the flow of drugs into the United States. This, my colleagues, \nis choosing sides in a civil war that has raged for more than thirty \nyears. And I think the American people deserve to know this.\n  This massive increase in counternarcotics aid for Colombia this year \nputs the U.S. at a crossroads--do we back a major escalation in \nmilitary aid to Colombia that may worsen a civil war that has already \nraged for decades, or do we pursue a more effective policy of \nstabilizing Colombia by promoting sustainable development, \nstrengthening civilian democratic institutions, and attacking the drug \nmarket by investing in prevention and treatment at home? I see today \nthat we have chosen the former.\n  We are choosing to align ourselves with a military that is known to \nhave close contacts with paramilitary organizations. Paramilitary \ngroups operating with acquiescence or open support of the military \naccount for most of the political violence in Colombia today. In its \nannual report for 1999, Human Rights Watch reports: ``in 1999 \nparamilitary were considered responsible for 78% of the total number of \nhuman rights and international humanitarian law violations'' in \nColombia. Our own 1999 State Department Country Reports on Human Rights \nnotes that ``at times the security forces collaborated with \nparamilitary groups that committed abuses.''\n  We should support Colombia during this crisis. Being tough on drugs \nis important, but we need to be smart about the tactics we employ. This \nconference report decreases by $29 million the aid this Chamber gave to \nsupport alternative development programs in Colombia. It cuts by $21 \nmillion support for human rights and judicial reform. It also cuts \nsupport for interdiction by $3.1 million. Yet, it increases by $140 \nmillion funding for the military ``Push into Southern Colombia.'' What \nare we doing here? Guns never have and never will solve Colombia's \nills, nor will they address our drug problem here in the United States.\n  I reiterate how unbalanced ``Plan Colombia'' is in this conference \nreport. It cuts the good and increases the bad. A more sensible \napproach would have been to permit extensive assistance to Colombia in \nthe form of promoting sustainable development and strengthening \ncivilian democratic institutions. This would have safeguarded U.S. \ninterests in avoiding entanglement in a decades-old civil conflict, and \npartnership with an army implicated in severe human rights abuses. \nInstead, we are funding a military offensive into southern Colombia and \ndenying resources where they would be the most effective: drug \ntreatment programs at home. I am appalled at this strategy.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I oppose the billions of dollars of \nemergency Fiscal Year 2000 supplemental funding included in the Fiscal \nYear 2001 Military Construction bill to continue our involvement in \nKosovo, and to dramatically escalate our military's involvement in \nColombia. While I support the Military Construction provisions in the \nbill, particularly the worthy Washington state projects specified in \nthe bill, I cannot vote for passage of this measure.\n  I did not support the President's decision to intervene in the 600-\nyear-old civil war in the Republic of Yugoslavia, and do not support \nthe spending of another $2 billion on this open-ended commitment of our \nnation's armed forces and taxpayer dollars.\n  Last week, I actively opposed the President's effort to entangle us \nin yet another civil war, this time in Colombia. I unsuccessfully \nsought to reduce the proposed $934 million in funding to $200 million, \nwhich would amount to a four-fold increase in spending on our fight \nagainst drug-trafficking between Colombia and the United States. This \nsupplemental spending bill now includes even more for Colombia, a total \nof $1.3 billion. I am afraid this is a mere down payment on the \nbillions more we will be asked to spend in coming years. I refuse to \nsupport this launching of yet another never-ending commitment--\nespecially one that the President can neither justify nor guarantee \nwill have even the slightest positive impact on drug trafficking.\n  The billions included in this bill for Kosovo and Colombia are not \nonly an irresponsible waste of taxpayer funds, they are a dangerous \ngamble that we will exit involvement in these civil wars with less \ndamage to our fighting men and women, and national dignity than we have \nin the past.\n\n\n                              eb-52 option\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as my colleagues may be aware, in recent\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\nyears there has been discussion within the military about modifying or \nequipping B-52 aircraft with advanced electronic jamming equipment that \nwould allow them to perform a dedicated electronic warfare, or EW, \nmission. I joined Senator Dorgan in filing amendments calling for a \nthorough study of an ``EB-52'' option.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think it should be noted that operation Allied Force \ndemonstrated that our nation is short jamming assets for even one major \nwar. An ``EB'' version of the B-52 would be a cost-effective solution \nto the problem, since the aircraft are already paid for. As a matter of \nfact, I understand that during Operation Allied Force, General Wesley \nClark asked if any other platforms could be equipped with offensive \nelectronic gear to augment the over-tasked EA-6Bs against Serbia's air \ndefense system, and that an ``EB-52'' variant was under consideration. \nThat concept warrants full consideration, as a supplement to the EA-6B \naircraft now in service with the Navy.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wonder if the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member \nshare our interest in the idea of an EW mission for the B-52 and belief \nthat it should be carefully studied?\n  Mr. WARNER. I certainly do. Our Nation requires additional dedicated \nEW assets and the B-52 offers great potential in this area. I would \nbring to the attention of my colleagues that the Defense Authorization \nAct for fiscal year 2000 called for a study of potential additional EW \nplatforms to supplement the EA-6B. The B-52 warrants careful and \nthorough analysis, and I have been assured by the Defense Department \nthat it is, in fact, being studied. Senator Levin, would you care to \ncomment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the interest of my friends from North Dakota \nin the EB-52 and share the sentiments of the distinguished Chairman on \nthis matter. The B-52 is a viable candidate for the EW mission in light \nof its large payload, intercontinental range, reliability, and airframe \nmaintainability beyond 2040. It is my understanding that it is being \nstudied as a dedicated EW platform candidate and must receive full \nconsideration.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I greatly appreciate the comments of the Armed Services \nCommittee's distinguished leadership. I am willing to withdraw my \namendment in light of assurances that the study is underway and will \ncontinue to accord the B-52 full, fair, and thorough consideration as a \npotential dedicated EW platform.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I also thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking \nMember for their attention to this important matter. In light of their \nassurances, I, too, will withdraw my amendment, and look forward to \nworking with them to ensure that the B-52 is given a close look for the \nEW mission during the ongoing study.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, with the passage of the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, I want to talk about an important \nissue to all of my constituents in Arkansas and to private property \nowners across this country. I thank the appropriators for including \nlanguage in the bill that will prohibit the Environmental Protection \nAgency from promulgating or implementing its proposed Total Maximum \nDaily Load regulations.\n  In issuing its August 1999 Total Maximum Daily Load regulation, the \nEPA overstepped its congressionally mandated authority. Congress \nauthorized the EPA to regulate point sources and left it up to the \nstates to regulate non-point sources and develop and implement TMDL \nplans. In its proposed TMDL regulation, the EPA granted itself \nauthority to regulate these specific items and clearly overstepped its \nregulatory authority. These changes, while seemingly innocuous, \nrepresent a major shift in Clean Water Act authority from the States to \nthe Federal Government at the hands of the Environmental Protection \nAgency. Congress has the authority to set clean water laws of this \ncountry, not the EPA.\n  I reiterate something I have been saying as often as anyone will \nlisten--these new regulations can easily be summed up in two words--\nunreasonable and unnecessary.\n  I understand some of my distinguished colleagues' objections to what \nseems like legislating on an appropriations bill, but I want to let my \ncolleagues know that I have attempted to use all other avenues to fix \nthis regulation. I completely agree with the EPA's objective of \ncleaning up our Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams, but firmly believe \nthat this regulation oversteps congressional mandated authority and \nintent for the implementation of the Clean Water Act.\n  I assure my colleagues that I have done all that I could to encourage \nthe EPA to back down before we got to this point. I have personally met \nwith the President. I have personally met with EPA Administrator Carol \nBrowner. I have introduced legislation to reassert congressional intent \nregarding the Clean Water Act. My colleagues and I have held ten \ncongressional Committee hearings, introduced six pieces of legislation \non this matter, and held over 20 public meetings around the country \nthat were attended by thousands of property owners.\n  In Arkansas alone, we have held three public meetings and two \ncongressional field hearings. In El Dorado over 1,000 attended; in \nTexarkana over 4,000 attended; in Fayetteville over 2,000 attended; and \nover 1,000 attended in Hot Springs and in Lonoke to learn how this new \nTMDL regulation would affect their private property and to protest the \nreach of the EPA into traditional non-point source activities.\n  We have attempted all available avenues to right this wrong. It was \nnever congressional intent for the EPA to regulate non-point sources or \nto interfere with States' implementation of TMDLs on its rivers, lakes, \nand streams.\n  After all of our efforts to curb this regulation and bring it back \ninto line with congressional intent have failed, we have been left with \nno other recourse but to restrict the EPA's funding for this TMDL \nregulation.\n  This emergency supplemental appropriations bill is a good bill, and \nit rightly delays implementation of any new, unnecessary and \nunreasonable EPA regulations until Congress and the States have \nadequate time to address this issue properly and completely. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for \nvoting for final passage of H.R. 4425 and for supporting the funding \nfor the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act contained in this bill. By \nworking together with Senator Domenici and his staff, we were able to \nquickly put together a piece of legislation that will compensate the \nmany New Mexicans injured by the Cerro Grande fire that raged through \nLos Alamos and the surrounding forests in early May. Because of the \nfederal government's role in setting what began as a controlled burn in \nthe Bandelier National Park, this legislation was a necessary response \nfrom the federal government.\n  The intensity of the Cerro Grande fire resulted in extraordinary \nlosses for both the residents of Los Alamos and the surrounding \npueblos. I am pleased that a compensation fund will now be available \nfor those who lost their homes in the fire, those who were forced to \nclose down their business and those who provided emergency relief to \nthe threatened community. The compensation fund will also be made \navailable for those who suffered other kinds of losses as a result of \nthe fire. This would include aid to the Santa Clara Pueblo to help them \nrestore the thousands of acres they lost to the Cerro Grande blaze. It \nwould also include assistance to the members of the San Ildefonso \nPueblo who have suffered economically due to the fire closing down the \nroads and cutting off the tourist traffic that frequents the pueblo. \nI'm also glad that we were able to provide funding for the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory so it can begin to address the damages it sustained \nas a result of the Cerro Grande fire.\n  I am very pleased that the Cerro Grande compensation fund will be \navailable shortly so people can get on with their lives and start \nrebuilding their communities. Once this legislation is signed by the \nPresident, FEMA will have 45 days to draft regulations that govern this \nclaims process. I would like to thank FEMA, and especially Director \nJames Lee Witt, for taking on this very large responsibility of \nhandling the fire claims process. He has worked tirelessly to aid \ndisaster victims across this country and I know he will devote the \nresources necessary to aid the victims of the Cerro Grande\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\nfire. We hope that the regulations governing the claims process will be \nin place shortly and the victims of the fire can begin settling their \nclaims with the federal government by late summer.\n  As I thank my colleagues for their support, I would like to \nparticularly thank Senator Domenici for his hard work in fighting for \nthis money in the appropriations process. The initial appropriation of \n$455 million for this compensation fund will hopefully address most, if \nnot all, of the damage caused by the Cerro Grande fire. The amount \nappropriated is a significant commitment by the federal government and \nby passing this legislation today, Congress has committed itself to \ncompensating the victims of the Cerro Grande fire for the losses they \nincurred.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased and relieved that after \nweeks of uncertainty we have finally reached this point, and that we \nare ready to act on the Military Construction Bill.\n  As always, I thank Senator Burns, the Chairman of the Military \nConstruction Subcommittee for his leadership and bipartisan \ncooperation. I also want to thank Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd for \ntheir work in producing this bill. They set an excellent example for \nall of us to follow.\n  The FY 2001 Military Construction Appropriations Bill provides $8.8 \nbillion dollars in spending. This agreement also represents a \ntremendous amount of work and a great deal of cooperation between the \nHouse and Senate.\n  We went into conference with very different recommendations for \nprojects, and simply not enough money to go around. We came out with a \nbipartisan package that is fair and balanced and, most importantly, \naddresses some of our most pressing military construction needs. I wish \nwe could have done more because the needs are so significant.\n  As our nation continues to tally up ever-larger budget surpluses, I \nhope that the Defense Department will channel more resources into \nmilitary construction. We simply cannot continue to balance the best \nmilitary in the world on the back of a crumbling infrastructure. We ask \ntremendous sacrifices from our military families, and this bill is an \nopportunity to address their pressing needs.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to acknowledge the excellent \ncontributions of the Military Construction Subcommittee staff for their \nmany hours of hard work in crafting this agreement.\n  I also want to make a few brief comments regarding the supplemental \nappropriations that have been attached to this legislation. I will vote \nfor the conference report but I do so with serious reservations about \nnumerous provisions in the supplemental. It is important to note that \nthe package before the Senate today does not represent the work of the \nentire conference committee. The conference committee did not meet to \nconsider the supplemental items.\n  This has not been an ideal process. While this bill provides funding \nfor needed projects and disaster relief, many needs were left \nunaddressed. Other projects were added that were not part of either the \nPresident's supplemental request or the Senate's supplemental \nprovisions.\n  I am particularly disappointed that this conference report does not \ninclude the Senate's language to provide Seattle and other local \ngovernments in Washington state with the needed reimbursement funding \nfor last year's WTO meeting. The federal government has not been a true \npartner is sharing the costs for this event.\n  I am particularly disappointed with the Congressional Majority, which \npromised to include this language. Unfortunately, when they met behind \nclosed doors, they chose to neglect our obligation to Seattle. I will \ndemand that the Senate act on this matter before we adjourn this year.\n  In addition, I continue to have serious reservations about the \nassistance package to Columbia for counter narcotics activities. I have \nworked with Senator Leahy to strengthen the human rights provisions \nwithin the bill, and I did vote for both amendments to limit funding to \nColumbia during the Senate's consideration of the issue. If the \nColumbia funding were attached to a bill other than Military \nConstruction where I serve as ranking member, I would give serious \nconsideration to voting against the bill.\n  I also want to note for my colleagues that this legislation provides \nsignificant disaster assistance for New Mexico to aid the Los Alamos \narea in dealing with the recent devastating fire. Senator Domenici and \nSenator Bingaman have been very diligent in working with the Senate on \nthis issue.\n  At this moment, fire crews in Washington state have finally gotten \ncontrol of another significant fire near one of our country's nuclear \nweapons facilities. More than 200,000 acres were destroyed by a fast-\nmoving fire on and around the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.\n  Secretary Richardson is at Hanford today to assess the damage. I have \nbeen in contact with Governor Gary Locke and various federal officials \nto follow the fire developments. While it is too soon to know the \nextent of the damage, I do want my colleagues to be aware of this \nserious situation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that the supplemental \nappropriations contained in this Military Construction Appropriations \nconference report (accompanying H.R. 4425) do not provide for essential \nfunding for SBA's popular 7(a) guaranteed business loan program.\n  For nearly 50 years, SBA's 7(a) loan program has provided loans to \nstart and grow small business across the country when they could not \naccess financing in the commercial marketplace. SBA provides this \nassistance in the form of guaranties for loans made by a network of \nmore than 5,000 private sector lenders. Currently, SBA's 7(a) portfolio \nincludes nearly $40 billion in 7(a) loans representing as many as \n150,000 small businesses that might not be in business today were it \nnot for their SBA guaranteed loans. The 7(a) program is funded by user \nfees and a modest appropriation intended to offset any potential losses \non the SBA guaranteed loans. For fiscal year 2000, the taxpayers' cost \nfor a 7(a) loan is only $1.16 for every $1000 guaranteed. And for each \n$10,000 loaned, at least one job is created.\n  Despite the tremendous benefits provided by the 7(a) loan program, \nhowever, this year the available program level will not be adequate to \nmeet the needs of the eligible, credit-worthy small businesses that \nwill seek assistance from SBA. This means that by the end of the fiscal \nyear the Agency will have to turn away some of the small entrepreneurs \nthat are relying on SBA-guaranteed loans to finance the growth of their \nbusinesses. In an environment where small business is responsible for \nmuch of the growth in the American economy and most of the new job \nopportunities, this is penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n  SBA has funds available that could be transferred to the 7(a) program \nto help to make sure that every eligible, credit-worthy small business \nthat seeks SBA's loan assistance is able to access the loans that they \nneed. The simple request would allow SBA to use funds that have been \npreviously appropriated to it for the 7(a) program. If any of us were \nasked whether we support the small businesses in our States--in our \ndistricts, we would answer with a resounding ``yes.'' By including \nlanguage to allow SBA to use existing funds for 7(a) program loans, we \nwill be demonstrating in a very tangible way that our local small \nbusinesses can really count on this support.\n  I don't understand why we, the Congress, continue to deny this simple \nrequest that means so much to so many and costs so little. This is \nnothing unanticipated or given to the Congress at the last minute:\n  In SBA's FY 2000 request, SBA asked for a program level of $10.5 \nbillion for this program. The SBA only received a program level of \n$9.75 billion.\n  The President's supplemental request letter of February 25, 2000 \nincluded SBA's request for authority to transfer money to the 7(a) \nprogram to raise the program level to the requested $10.5 billion.\n  When the Administrator testified on the FY 2001 budget in March of \nthis year, she stated that SBA would need the $10.5 billion program \nlevel for FY 2000 at the then current demand level.\n  On May 22, SBA Administrator Alvarez sent letters to Chairmen Stevens \nand Gregg expressing her concern that the transfer was not included in \nS. 2536.\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\n  In a letter from Jacob Lew, director of OMB, to Chairman Young, \nDirector Lew mentioned the concern by the Administration of the \ntransfer ability.\n  Now I am expressing my concern that it is not in H.R. 4425.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering the \nconference report to accompany the FY2001 military construction \nappropriations bill, H.R. 4425. The bill includes funding for military \nfacilities and infrastructure, including base improvements, operation \nand training facilities, barracks and family housing, and environmental \ncompliance.\n  Attached to the military construction bill is a supplemental spending \npackage for FY2000 that includes funding for anti-drug efforts, \nincluding in Colombia, funds to replenish defense accounts that have \nbeen drawn down by the Clinton administration to pay for military \noperations in Kosovo and Bosnia, and funds for disaster assistance, \nwildland firefighting activities, and administrative expenses \nassociated with repeal of the Social Security earnings limitation \nearlier this year.\n  I am pleased that the total cost of the supplemental package was \nreduced from the original $13 billion proposed by the House to about \n$11 billion. I want to commend the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and \nthe Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for \nworking to limit the cost of the supplemental package.\n  I think we could have gone further, though. The bill includes about \n$600 million for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I \nquestion the need to include that money here. There is $7 million for \npeanut assessments. There is language in the bill that lifts the \nfirewall that would prevent defense funds from being diverted to \ncertain domestic programs. These are things I would omit from the bill, \nif I could.\n  The fact is, though, that the bulk of the supplemental spending is \nurgently needed, even though some provisions of questionable merit have \nbeen included. More than half of the supplemental--$6.5 billion--is \nrequired to replenish defense operations and maintenance accounts that \nPresident Clinton has tapped to cover the cost of unauthorized military \nmissions around the globe, including in Bosnia and Kosovo. Because O \naccounts have been seriously depleted, we find that we are now on the \nbrink of serious readiness problems in our military if we do not \nreplenish these accounts, and do so quickly.\n  Mr. President, the firefighting money in this bill--$350 million--\nlike the defense money--is an urgent matter. The Los Alamos, New \nMexico, fires have dominated the news, but wildfires this year have \nconsumed more than 25,000 acres in Arizona, as well. Nationwide, over \none million acres have burned this year, and we still have several \nmonths remaining in our fire season. The money in this bill will \nreimburse the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service for \ncosts incurred in connection with firefighting efforts on the Grand \nCanyon rim and elsewhere around the country. The firefighting funds \nhave to be allocated.\n  The bill allots $1.3 billion for counternarcotics activities, \nincluding Plan Colombia. That is a start, but we are likely going to \nhave to do even more to help gain control of drug production and \ndistribution from Colombia.\n  There are several items of particular importance to the state of \nArizona that I would like to highlight at this point. First and \nforemost is language to prevent the Secretary of the Interior from \nmoving forward with a unilateral reallocation of Central Arizona \nProject (CAP) water. This language is defensive in nature--that is, it \nis intended only to counter a threat by the Interior Secretary to \nreallocate CAP water by the end of the calendar year contrary to the \nterms of Indian water settlements now being negotiated. Water is a \nprecious and scarce resource, and the allocation of CAP water is one of \nthe most important decisions affecting the future of my state. Arizona \nsimply cannot allow the Secretary to reallocate its water merely \nbecause he is about to leave office.\n  The bill includes a $12 million one-time appropriation to be split \nequally between Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico to help \ncover the overwhelming costs associated with processing criminal \nillegal immigrants and the significant number of border-related drug \ncases.\n  It also includes a one-time, $2 million appropriation for Arizona to \nassist Cochise County and other affected jurisdictions along the U.S.-\nMexican border that are incurring significant costs for local law \nenforcement and criminal justice processing because of record-breaking \nlevels of illegal immigration and smuggling of drugs and people into \nthe state.\n  Dr. Tanis Salant, a professor at the University of Arizona, is close \nto completing a study on unreimbursed costs that occur as a result of \nincreased illegal immigration in the area. He estimates that Arizona's \nborder counties collectively spend $15.5 million to bring criminal \nillegal aliens to justice. Cochise County spends 33 percent of its \noverall local criminal justice budget to process criminal illegal \nimmigrants. This does not even include incarceration costs, which are \nalso severe.\n  Finally, the bill funds important military construction projects in \nthe state:\n  $2.265 million to improve the readiness center at the Army National \nGuard's Papago Military Reservation;\n  $1.598 million for the readiness center at the Guard's Yuma \ninstallation; and\n  $3.35 million for the child-development center at Fort Huachuca.\n  These were projects that were not identified in the President's \nbudget, but which are important priorities in the state.\n  As I said early on, there are some things in this bill that I do not \nsupport. There is questionable need for some of the military \nconstruction projects that are funded. The LIHEAP money should not be \nincluded here. Peanut assessments. The breaching of the defense \nfirewall. But it seems to me that the good in the bill outweighs the \nbad.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for this bill. We have no choice but to \nreplenish our defense accounts and pay for emergency items, like \nfirefighting and disaster relief.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues my views on several items contained within this conference \nreport.\n  Shortly after becoming a Senator, I was named chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. One of the most \nimportant matters before our subcommittee this year is the \nAdministration's proposed anti-drug aid package for Colombia. The \nconference report before the Senate today includes $1.3 billion for \nthis plan.\n  On February 25, I called the first hearing of my subcommittee to \nconsider the many facets of this package. I must say that at first, I \nwas quite skeptical of providing such a dramatic increase in anti-drug \nmilitary aid to Colombia. My concerns centered on whether the United \nStates had a comprehensive long-term strategy for this plan, whether \nthis swift and dramatic infusion of military hardware would result in a \nworsening of the human rights record of the Colombian military, and \nwhether there were assurances that these funds would not be wasted due \nto corruption.\n  At our hearing, our subcommittee explored a number of questions about \nthis plan. Key among our witnesses was Jose Miguel Vivanco, Executive \nDirector of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. Mr. Vivanco \noutlined a report he had just authored documenting the continued links \nbetween the Colombian military to the paramilitaries that have been \nimplicated in countless human rights abuses in Colombia. He also \ntouched on the lack of progress in prosecution in Colombia's civilian \ncourts of military personnel accused of human rights abuses.\n  Two months later, I chaired a meeting of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee with the President of Colombia, Andres Pastrana. At this \nmeeting, several members of the Committee and other interested Senators \nwere able to discuss in depth with Mr. Pastrana our concerns about this \nplan. I came away from our meeting fully convinced that President \nPastrana is a courageous, reform-minded leader who is committed not \nonly to ending drug trafficking in Colombia, but also to bringing \nstability, ending violence, and promoting human rights there as well.\n  I am gratified that concerns such as those raised at our subcommittee \nhearing and our meeting with President\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\nPastrana received attention as the House and Senate have considered the \nAdministration's plan. In that regard, the conference report before the \nSenate today includes several stringent requirements, including a \nseries of conditions on the progress of Colombia's military in \naddressing human rights abuses; $29 million more than the President's \nrequest for human rights and justice programs; a requirement that the \nU.S. President develop a comprehensive strategy with benchmarks; and \nadditional anti-drug funding to neighboring nations so that this \nproblem is not simply exported out of Colombia.\n  Although there remain numerous critics who do not support this plan, \nI would attest that the provisions in this bill are far better than \nsimply appropriating the funds without condition. With these strong \nprovisions included, I support passage of this anti-drug package for \nColombia.\n  However, let's be clear that passage of this plan today is not the \nend of Congress' consideration of this critical issue. As chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, I will closely monitor \nimplementation of this aid package to ensure that the conditions \nenacted by Congress today are carried out responsibly and thoroughly by \nthe Administration.\n  I would also like to mention a rider inserted by the Conference \nCommittee that would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from \nfinishing work on a proposed rule revising the Total Maximum Daily Load \n(TMDL) program under the Clean Water Act. The TMDL issue is an \nimportant policy matter, one with significant consequences for public \nuse of our Nation's surface waters and for many businesses, farmers and \nothers who will be affected by the rule. No doubt, this issue is \ncontroversial and merits careful consideration and debate. However, the \nTMDL provision inserted into the Military Construction and Supplemental \nAppropriations bill inappropriately transfers the decision regarding \nthe TMDL rule from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Senate \nand House Appropriations Committees.\n  This rider is not germane to the underlying bill, was inserted into \nthe Conference Report without any public debate, and cannot be amended. \nIn my view, important decisions regarding environmental policy should \nnot be made behind closed doors and out of public view. This type of \nbackdoor legislating circumvents the legislative process of debate and \namendment, and abuses the public trust. By including this language in a \nconference report that cannot be amended, Senators must either accept \nthe offensive provision, or vote down an appropriations bill containing \nimportant funds for disaster relief, humanitarian aid, and national \ndefense.\n  Since the bill provides critical assistance to people that need help, \nI reluctantly support its passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address \nthe Senate once again on the subject of military construction projects \nadded to an appropriations bill that were not requested by the \nDepartment of Defense. This bill contains more than $1.5 billion in \nunrequested military construction projects. More importantly, I would \nlike to spend a few minutes discussing the thorough perversion of the \nbudget process by Congress in its relentless pursuit of the other white \nmeat. There is $4.5 billion in pork-barrel spending in this bill, $3.3 \nbillion of that total in the so-called ``emergency supplemental.''\n  Webster's, Mr. President, defines ``emergency'' as ``a sudden, \ngenerally unexpected occurrence or set of circumstances demanding \nimmediate action.'' What we have here is the antithesis of that \nconcept. It is ironic that the emergency spending bill before us today \nincludes $20 million for abstinence education, because the taxpayers \nare really getting screwed. For months the leadership of this body made \na deliberate decision not to act quickly and deliberately with regard \nto legitimate spending issues involving military readiness and the \ncrisis in Colombia. The decision was made not to treat these essential \nand time-sensitive activities as expeditiously as possible. Now, after \nmany months and a legislative trail more complicated and illogical than \nany Rube Goldberg contraption, we are presented with an $11 billion \nbill replete with earmarks that under no credible criteria should be \ncategorized as ``emergency''--and this is in addition to the over $1.5 \nbillion added to the underlying military construction appropriations \nbill for strictly parochial reasons.\n  Mr. President, as everyone here is aware, I regularly review spending \nbills for items that were not requested by the Administration, \nconstitute earmarks designed to benefit specific projects or \nlocalities, and did not go through a competitive, merit-based selection \nprocess. I submit lists of such items to the Congressional Record, \ngenerally prior to final passage of the spending bill in question. In \nthe case of the Military Construction bill for fiscal year 2001, I \nsubmitted such a list, along with a statement critical of the process \nby which that bill was put together, particularly the over $700 million \nworth of military construction projects added to that bill that were \nnot requested by the Department of Defense--an amount, I reiterate, \nthat was doubled in conference with the rarely fiscally responsible \nother Body.\n  This is an institution that has proven itself incapable of passing \nlegislation on an expedited basis that genuinely warrants the \ncategorization of ``emergency.'' Funding for ongoing military \noperations that strains readiness accounts is a case in point. The one \nthing, Mr. President, we can pass without hesitation and consideration \nis money for pork-barrel projects. Just prior to final passage back in \nMay of the Military Construction appropriations bill, the \nAppropriations Committee pushed through $460 million for six new C-130J \naircraft for the Coast Guard--the very aircraft that we throw money at \nwith wanton abandon as though our very existence as an institution is \ndependent upon the continued acquisition of that aircraft.\n  That funding and those aircraft are in the bill that emerged from \nconference with the House. A consensus exists, apparently, that we must \nhave six more C-l3OJs in addition to the ones added to the defense \nappropriations bill despite a surplus in the Department of Defense of \nC-130 airframes that should see us through to the next millennium and \nbeyond. Message to parents saving up for little junior's college \neducation: invest in the stock of the company that makes C-130s; the \nUnited States Congress will ensure your offsprinq never need student \nloans.\n  Compared to the $460 million for the C-130s, it hardly seems worth it \nto mention the $25 million added to this emergency spending measure for \nyet another Gulfstream jet, other than to point out that it is \nmanufactured in the same state as the C-130s.\n  It was reassuring that a compromise was reached on the issue of \nhelicopters for Colombia. It is extremely unfortunate, however, that an \nissue of life and death for Colombian soldiers being sent into combat \nto fight well-armed drug traffickers and the 15,000-strong guerrilla \narmy that protects them was predicated upon parochial considerations. \nValid operational reasons existed for the decision by the Department of \nDefense and the Colombian Government to request Blackhawk helicopters, \nand the Senate's decision to substitute those Blackhawks for Huey IIs \nwas among the more morally reprehensible actions I have witnessed \nwithin the narrow realm of budgetary decision-making by Congress.\n  Specific to the Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal \nYear 2001, it continues to strain credibility to peruse this \nlegislation and believe that considerations other than pork were at \nplay. How else to explain the millions of dollars added to this bill \nfor National Guard Armories, which, in a typically Orwellian gesture, \nare now referred to as ``Readiness Centers?'' Whether the $6.4 million \nadded for a new dining facility at Sheppard Air Force Base: the $12 \nmillion for a new fitness center at Langley Air Force Base; the $5.8 \nmillion for a joint personnel training center at Fairchild Air Force \nBase, Alaska; the $3.5 million added for an indoor rifle range and $1.8 \nmillion for a religious ministry facility at the Naval Reserve Station \nin Fort Worth, Texas; the $4 million added for the New Hampshire Air \nNational Guard Pease International Trade Port; the $4 million for a \nKentucky National Guard parking structure; and the $14 million added \nfor New York National Guard facilities all constitute vital spending \ninitiatives is highly questionable.\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\n  Mr. President, there are one-and-a-half billion dollars worth of \nprojects added to this bill at member request. Not all of them, in \nparticular family housing projects warrant criticism or skepticism. \nThere are important quality of life issues involved here. The public \nshould be under no illusions, however, that over a billion dollars was \nadded to this bill solely as a manifestation of Congress' naked pursuit \nof pork.\n  As mentioned, far more disturbing than the pork added to the military \nconstruction bill is the damage done to the integrity of the budget \nprocess by the abuse of the concept of emergency spending. Permit me to \nquote from the opening sentence from the Washington Post of June 29 \nwith regard to this bill: ``Republicans are trying to grease the skids \nfor passage of a large emergency spending bill for Colombia and Kosovo \nwith $200 million of 'special projects' for members, and one of the \nbiggest winners is a renegade Democrat being courted by the GOP.''\n  That, Mr. President, summarizes the process pretty well. Military \nreadiness and the situation in Colombia are not in and of themselves \nimportant enough to warrant support for this spending bill; we must \nhave our pork. We must have our $25 million for a Customs Service \ntraining facility at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, a site most \ncertainly chosen for its bucolic charm and operational attributes \nrather than for parochial reasons. We must have our $225,000 for the \nNebraska State Patrol Digital Distance Learning project. We must have \nover $3 million earmarked for anti-doping activities at the 2002 \nOlympics, in addition to the $8 million for Defense Department support \nof these essential national security activities on the ski slopes of \nUtah. We must have $300,000 for Indian tribes in North Dakota, South \nDakota, Montana and Minnesota.\n  Those of us who had the misfortune of witnessing one of the most \ndisgraceful and blatant explosions of pork-barrel spending in the \nannals of modern American parliamentary history, the ISTEA bill of \n1998, should be astounded to see the projects funded in this emergency \nspending bill:\n  $1.2 million for the Paso Del Norte International Bridge in Texas;\n  $9 million for the US 82 Mississippi River Bridge in Mississippi;\n  $2 million for the Union Village/Cambridge Junction bridges in \nVermont;\n  $5 million for the Naheola Bridge in Alabama;\n  $3 million for the Hoover Dam Bypass in Arizona and Nevada;\n  $3 million for the Witt-Penn Bridge in New Jersey; and\n  $12 million for the Florida Memorial Bridge in Florida.\n  These, Mr. President, are but a tip of the iceberg--an iceberg that \nshall not stand in the way of the icebreaker added to this bill, albeit \nfor more credible reasons than the vast majority of member-adds.\n  As I stated earlier, tracking the process by which this bill comes \nbefore us today has been a truly Byzantine experience. The addition of \n$600,000 for the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System in South Dakota \nserves as sort of a tribute to the unusual path down which this \nlegislation has traveled. The most skilled legislative adventurers \nwould be hard pressed to follow the trail this bill followed before \narriving at its destination here today.\n  I cannot emphasize the significance of piling billions of dollars in \npork and unrequested earmarks into a bill that we have categorized for \nbudgetary purposes as ``emergency.'' Consider the distinction between \nemergency spending essential for the preservation of liberty and to \ndeal with genuine emergencies that cannot wait for the usual annual \nappropriations process, and the manner in which Congress abuses that \nconcept and undermines the integrity of the budgeting process. When I \nreview an emergency spending measure and read earmarks like $2.2 \nmillion for the Anchorage, Alaska Senior Center; $500,000 for the Shedd \nAquarium/Brookfield Zoo for science education programs for local school \nstudents; $1 million for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health \nSystem in Long Island, New York; $1 million for the Center for Research \non Aging at Rush-Presbyterian--St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago; \nand $8 million for the City of Libby in Montana, plus another $3.5 \nmillion for the Saint John's Lutheran Hospital in Libby, I am more than \na little perplexed about the propriety of our actions here.\n  Is the American public expected to believe that what the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee calls a ``must-pass bill'' essential for \nnational security should include emergency funding for Dungeness \nfishing vessel crew members, U.S. fish processors in Alaska, and the \nBuy N Pack Seafoods--how do you, Mr. President, even write that bill \nlanguage with a straight face--processor in Hoonah, Alaska, research \nand education relating to the North Pacific marine ecosystem, and the \nlease, operation and upgrading of facilities at the Alaska SeaLife \nCenter, and the $7 million for observer coverage for the Hawaiian long-\nline fishery and to study interaction with sea turtles in the North \nPacific. Finally, and not to belabor the point, is the $1 million for \nthe State of Alaska to develop a cooperative research plan to restore \nthe crab fishery truly a national security imperative?\n  My friend and colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, has referred to \nthe sadly typical smoke and mirrors budgeting gimmickrey pervasive in \nthis bill. I am disturbed by these budgeting gimmicks designed to \nprevent Congress from complying with the revenue and spending levels \nagreed to in the Budget Resolution. This bill is a betrayal of our \nresponsibility to spend the taxpayers' dollars responsibly and enact \nlaws and policies that reflect the best interests of all Americans.\n  For example, this bill waives the budget caps to allow for more \ndiscretionary spending. This bill also waived the firewall in the \nbudget resolution between defense and nondefense spending on outlays. \nThe end result is that this gives the Senate Appropriations Committee \nthe freedom to move the $2.6 billion the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee did not spend on much-needed readiness into non-defense \nspending.\n  This bill further changes current law and shifts the payment date for \nSSI, the Supplemental Security Income program, from October back to \nSeptember. What that does is shift money into fiscal year 2000. In the \nprocess, it allows $2.4 billion more be spent in fiscal year 2001 by \nspending that same amount of money in the previous year. This bill also \nuses the gimmick of moving the pay date for veterans' compensation and \npensions from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2000. Both of these \nprovisions are further examples of the irresponsible budget gimmickry \nthat allows the Congress to spend more without any accountability.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, this bill is a travesty, a thorough slap \nin the face of all Americans concerned about fiscal responsibility, \nnational security, the scourge of drugs on our streets, and the \nintegrity of the representation they send to Congress. We should be \nashamed of ourselves for passing this bill--a bill that members of the \nSenate had no time to review despite misleading statements to the \ncontrary voiced on the floor of the Senate. Unfortunately, shame \ncontinues to elude us, and the country is poorer for that flaw in our \ncollective character.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe list of unrequested items.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nH.R. 4225 FY01 conference MILCON and supplemental add-ons, increases & \n                                earmarks\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nM1A2 Tank Upgrades................................................163.7\nPatriot Missile Program.............................................125\nWalking Shield Program..............................................0.3\n2002 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games............................  8\nSale of a Navy Drydock to Bender Shipbuilding, Mobile, AL.\nCorps of Engineers Flood Protection, Devils Lake, North Dakota......  2\nCorps of Engineers Flood Protection, Princeville, North Carolina....1.5\nCorps of Engineers improvements, Johnson Creek, Arlington, TX.......  3\nCorps of Engineers dredging, Saxon Harbor, Wisconsin................0.2\nDoE Oak Ridge, Tennessee............................................ 25\nDoE Kansas City Plant, Missouri..................................... 11\nDoE Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas.................................7.5\nDoE Los Alamos, NM..................................................  5\nDoE Sandia Lab, NM.................................................. 14\nDoE Transportation/Fleet Upgrades................................... 10\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\nDoE Savannah River Site.............................................1.5\nDoE Nevada Test Site U1h Shaft improvements.........................2.5\nDoE Office of Security Staffing.....................................  3\nDoE Worker Health Concerns Paducah, KY & Portsmouth, OH............. 10\nDoE Uranium Enrichment Decontam. and Decommission.

Any military construction projects, including \n     architect and engineer contracts, estimated to exceed more \n     than $500,000 to be accomplished in Japan, in any NATO \n     country, or in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf are to be \n     awarded to United States firms or U.S. firms in joint venture \n     with host nation firms.\n       Section 112. Any military construction project in U.S. \n     territories and possessions in the Pacific and on Kwajalein \n     Atoll, or in the Arabian Gulf, estimated to exceed $1 million \n     may be awarded to a foreign contractor only if the foreign \n     contractor bid exceeds a U.S. contractor bid by 20% or more. \n     Furthermore, for contract awards for military construction on \n     the Kwajalein Atoll this requirement is suspended for \n     Marshallese contractors.\n       Section 124. Department of Defense funds may be transferred \n     for the purpose of funding programs of the Demonstration \n     Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C.) \n     to pay for expenses associated with the Homeowners Assistance \n     Program.\n       Section 130. Critical military construction funds may be \n     transferred from the Naval Reserve account to the Active Duty \n     Navy account for funding an elevated water storage tank at \n     the Naval Support Activity Midsouth, Millington, Tennessee.\n       Section 131. Department of Defense military construction \n     funding may be used for the light rail connector located at \n     Fort Campbell, Kentucky and if funds become available, the \n     Secretary of the Army may later accept funds from the Federal \n     Highway Administration or the State of Kentucky.\n       Section 133. Directs the Secretary of Defense to prioritize \n     military housing projects in San Diego over military housing \n     projects in cities in other communities where there are \n     bases.\n       Section 134. $170 million is provided for the purposes of \n     dredging and foundation repairs for the Woodrow Wilson \n     Memorial Bridge in Virginia.\n       Section 135. Provides $0.5 million in funds for the \n     Secretary of the Navy to improve and repair Marine Corps \n     Officer Quarters Number 6 belonging to the Commandant of the \n     Marine Corps, at the 8th and I Barracks, in Washington, D.C. \n     This is odd especially since elsewhere in this bill there is \n     restrictive language that prohibits more than $25,000 per \n     unit may be spent annually for maintenance and repair of ANY \n     general or flag officer quarters.\n       Section 136. Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to \n     conduct a logistics, maintenance, and military construction \n     demonstration project at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas.\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\n       Section 137. Directs the Secretary of Defense to provide \n     not less than $1 million for the design of an elementary \n     school for the Central Kitsap School District in Bangor, \n     Washington. Putting this funding requirement in the emergency \n     supplemental bill is an end run around the normal \n     authorization and appropriations process. Now that design \n     work is obligated, then next year funding will become \n     available for the construction of the school through the \n     military construction authorization and appropriation bills. \n     Both Committees turned down this project because the \n     Department of Defense had not put any design money funding in \n     their budget.\n     Chapter 1--Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide\n       Provides $40 million in emergency funding to Vieques, \n     Puerto Rico for the study of health or Vieques residents, \n     airport fire-fighting equipment, pier improvements at a \n     commercial ferry pier and terminal, construction of an \n     artificial reef and reef conservation, special payments for \n     Vieques commercial fisherman for lost days of fishing because \n     Navy training, roadways and bridge improvements in Puerto \n     Rico, adult training and reeducation programs, natural \n     resources preservation, protection and conservation, and \n     economic development programs.\n     Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Army\n       Provides $5.7 million for the purchase of Tactical High \n     Energy Laser (THEL) for the Army.\n       Section 103. Provides $90 million for the purchase of F-15 \n     Eagles for the Air Force.\n       Section 104. Provides $163.7 million for the purchase of \n     Abrams tank M1A2 SEP Upgrades for the Army.\n       Section 111. Provides $27 million for the purchase of \n     engines for the CH-46 and $25.8 million for the purchase of \n     EP-3 sensor improvement modifications for the Navy. Provides \n     $212.7 million for the purchase of U-2 reconnaissance \n     aircraft sensor improvements and flight simulators for the \n     Air Force.

The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I use my leader time to make some \nannouncements about the schedule.\n  I, too, commend Senator Burns from Montana, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Military Construction Subcommittee, and his ranking \nmember, Senator Murray of Washington State, for their work on this \nlegislation. It is important. It has a lot of projects that are very \nimportant for our defense and the underlying military construction \nappropriations bill. I also extended to them my sympathy and \nappreciation for the fact that their bill had to carry a title II which \nbrought a lot of emergency legislation, but it needed to be done. Their \nbill became the catalyst to move this emergency legislation through. It \nwas not easy for them to have to deal with all the conflicting problems \nnot in their jurisdiction. I thank them for what they did on this \nlegislation.\n  I thank Senator Gramm, Senator McCain, Senator Stevens, and Senator \nByrd for their usual brilliance and innovation. What looked like 6 \nhours of readings, multiple votes on points of order, and a contested \nfinal passage sometime tonight, Saturday, or Sunday, was resolved in a \nmatter of minutes. It is a miracle.\n  I know there will be objections to various parts and a lot of \nspeeches will be made. That is great. There will be time for that \nlater. I appreciate the help of Senator Daschle and all involved. We \nneeded this bill. We needed this emergency legislation.\n  Senator Stevens did the right thing. I thank him. I wanted to express \nmy appreciation to all.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I also express my congratulations to Senator Stevens and \nSenator Byrd for their masterful effort in getting the Senate to this \npoint, and for the managers of the bill itself. As Senator Lott has \nindicated, this was not an easy task. All the way to the very last \nmoment it looked as if this could have been derailed. It wasn't, in \npart because of leadership and in part because of cooperation.\n  I think we have done a good thing today, an important thing. It is \nimportant we finish this work prior to the time we leave. This bill \nwill now go to the President, as it should. I know he will sign it. I \nthink we are ending the way we should have ended, on a high note with a \ngood deal accomplished.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, having been the Senate Democratic leader, I \nknow that there comes a moment in time when leaders have to step in and \nact. Our two leaders did that at the critical moment. It is through \ntheir leadership that we have reached an understanding in this matter. \nI thank both leaders. I congratulate them on having done a great \nservice. I say this: Every Senator is in their debt.\n  I also thank my colleague and friend, Senator Stevens, for the \nleadership he has shown in these appropriations matters.\n  I hope that both of our leaders, in particular, and all of our \ncolleagues will have a very safe and enjoyable Fourth of July.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Senator Byrd, for your comments and for your \ninspiration and for talking about the history of this great country and \nthis special celebration of the Fourth of July, 2000, with family and \nfriends. It is a special time for our country and in our lives. I look \nforward to it.\n\n  Senator Byrd, I will have the presence of my very fine grandson that \nyou spoke so beautifully about just 2 years ago on his birth date. I \nlook forward to that moment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Please tell your handsome grandson, who has been blessed \nwith a multitude of talents, I am sure, that this year is not the \nbeginning of the 21st century. Tell him it is not the beginning of the \nthird millennium. This is the last year of the 20th century. Regardless \nof what the media say and many politicians say, this is the last year \nof the 20th century and the last year of the second millennium.\n  Let him know that, so that he will be raised in truth and will always \nseek truth.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, again.\n  Senator Byrd, I want to note, when you enter my young grandson's \nroom, on the wall to the left, in a beautifully framed device is the \nfantastic speech that you gave on the floor. It will always be there. \nWhat you had to say was so beautiful to say about our grandchildren, \nand about his birth, and quotes from the Bible, quotes from history.\n  Anybody who thinks there is not a bipartisan spirit around here needs \nto know that there is no quote from the Republican majority leader in \nmy grandson's room. The only speech in his room is the speech from that \ngreat Democrat of West Virginia, Robert Byrd.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Having listened and watched what went on and having served \nin government most of my adult life, it is not often we see such \nleadership in action close up. We have seen it here today. This is \nremarkable.\n  I want to publicly express my appreciation for the work done by our \nleader. The burdens he bears I see close up. I see your burdens, Mr. \nMajority Leader, but not as up close and personal as\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\nI see Senator Daschle's. What he does for us, the minority, is \nextraordinary, as evidenced by the very quick, instantaneous decisions \nhe made in conjunction with you today. You are both to be applauded. \nThis is democracy in action. It is what is good about government.\n  I also extend accolades to the two of you. I have no military service \nin my background, but with the love and appreciation and dedication \nthat Senators Stevens and Inouye have for the military, and Senator \nWarner and others who work for the defense of this country, they see it \nfrom a little different perspective than a lot of us because they have \nseen military action. I think they deserve a great deal of credit.\n  Senator Inouye has been ill and has not been here this week, but his \nspirit has been here. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nHe and Senator Stevens have guided the military of this country for the \nlast decade as no one in the history of this country, in my opinion. I \nexpress appreciation for everyone on our side of the aisle for what \nthese two men do for the military. Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye \nhave personally felt the need for this military construction bill, and \nevery word they speak indicates that.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \na provision, which has been included in the military construction \nconference report, that prevents EPA from using any funds to implement \na new rule to clean up our nation's streams, rivers, and lakes.\n  Let me explain why this rule is important.\n  Since 1972, when the Clean Water Act became law, we've made a lot of \nprogress in cleaning up our water, especially with respect to so-called \n``point sources'' like sewage treatment plants and industrial plants; \nthe pipe that come out of plants and go into lakes and streams.\n  But we still are far from reaching our goal of fishable, swimmable \nwaters. That is the standard in the act.\n  That's where the new rule comes in. It relates to something called \n``total maximum daily loads,'' or TMDLS. It is a long, technical-\nsounding label. But it's a pretty simple concept. A TMDL is really a \npollution budget for a watershed. It's like the Clean Water Act version \nof a State implementation plan under the Clean Air Act.\n  The TMDL program was actually enacted as part of the original Clean \nWater Act, way back in 1972. For a long time, it was dormant. But, in \nrecent years, environmental groups have lawsuits requiring EPA and \nstates to implement the program. In virtually every single case, they \nhave won.\n  In light of this, EPA decided to revise its rules for the TMDL \nprogram, to bring them up to date. To begin with, it convened a group \nof stakeholders, who worked for two years to make recommendations. \nThen, last August, EPA proposed new rules.\n  Make no mistake about it. These rules have been controversial.\n  Like many others, I have been particularly concerned about the \nproposal to require many forestry operations to get Clean Water Act \npermits. I thought EPA was taking a long, winding road that didn't end \nup in the right place.\n  But EPA has been listening. In response to Congressional hearings and \npublic comments, it has made changes. For example, it dropped the \nforestry proposal and made other parts of the rule more workable.\n  As I understand it, the rule has gone to OMB for review, and should \nbe published, in final form, soon.\n  But then we get this conference report. Out of the blue, it provides \nthat none of the funds appropriated to EPA for 2000 and 2001 can be \nused to implement the new rule.\n  I have two major problems with this provision. The first problem is \nthe process by which the provision has been included in the conference \nreport. The process is, in a word, outrageous. Clearly, there are \ndifferences of opinion about the TMDL rule. But there are several \nopportunities for those differences to be debated.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee is considering a bill, \nintroduced by Subcommittee Chairman Crapo and Committee Chairman Smith, \nthat would, among other things, delay the final rule. The House HUD/VA/\nIndependent Agencies Appropriations bill contains a provision that also \nwould delay the rule.\n  Of course, there is the regulatory review process we enacted in 1996, \nthat allows Congress to disapprove a final rule.\n  In each case, we would have a debate. The merits would be discussed. \nSenators could explain why they believe that the rule should be \ndelayed; others could respond. Then we would have a vote, and the \npublic could judge our actions.\n  That's not what's going on here. Instead, opponents of the rule have \nslipped the provision into an unrelated conference report that cannot \nbe amended--no debate, no sunshine, no public knowledge of what is \ngoing on. And they have done it on a bill that provides emergency \nfunding for many urgent national needs, so that the President is under \nstrong pressure to sign the bill.\n  Frankly, I wonder why they have taken this approach. Why not debate, \nin clear public view? What are they afraid of?\n  Another thing, by using conference reports this way, we further \nweaken the bonds that bind this institution together, and reduce public \nconfidence in our deliberative process. This is no way to run a \nrailroad.\n  The second problem with the provision is substantive. Despite \nsignificant progress since 1972, too many of our rivers, streams, and \nlakes do not meet water quality standards.\n  EPA's proposed rule makes some important improvements. At the heart \nof it, the rule clarifies the operation of the TMDL program and \nrequires implementation plans, so that the program becomes more than a \npaperwork exercise. At the same time, the rule gives States more time \nto complete their lists, allocations, and plans--a lot more time.\n  That is a pretty good tradeoff.\n  By blocking the rule, we will simply delay the tough decisions about \nhow to\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\nmake the program work.

Mr. President, for most of the 1990s, the average gasoline \nprices in Honolulu hovered at roughly 25 cents to 50 cents above the \nnational average. In June 1999, only 1 year ago, Hawaii's price of \n$1.51 per gallon ranked above Oregon's at $1.44 and the national \naverage of $1.14.\n  As late as last month, according to the Automobile Association of \nAmerica, Hawaii topped the Nation with an average per gallon price of \n$1.85, compared to the next highest state, Nevada, at $1.67 and a U.S. \naverage of $1.51.\n  This month, according to AAA, Hawaii ranked fourth highest with an \naverage price for regular unleaded of $1.86 per gallon. That fell below \nIllinois with an average of $1.98, Michigan at $1.96, and Wisconsin at \n$1.91. Still, Hawaii's price was well above the U.S. average of $1.63.\n  It is no pleasure to say that Hawaii has lost this dubious \ndistinction as the State with the Nation's highest gasoline prices. The \npocketbooks of Americans are hurting all over the country.\n  There has been no shortage of blame--short supplies, pipeline \nproblems, cleaner gasoline requirements, too much driving and gas \nguzzlers, oil company manipulations, even an esoteric patent dispute, \nto name a few. So far, the initial examination of the causes of the \ndramatic increase of prices in some areas of the Midwest has provided \nno clear picture. The Clinton administration has asked the Federal \nTrade Commission to investigate if there were any illegal price \nmanipulations in the Midwest leading to such dramatic price increases.\n  This problem of dependence on imported oil has been in the making for \nmany years. Our import dependence has been rising for the past 2 \ndecades. The combination of lower domestic production and increased \ndemand has led to imports making up a larger share of total oil \nconsumed in the United States. In 1992, crude oil imports accounted for \napproximately 45 percent of our domestic demand. Last year crude oil \nimports accounted for 58 percent. The Energy Information \nAdministration's Short-Term Outlook forecasts that oil imports will \nexceed 60 percent of total demand this year. EIA's long-term forecasts \nhave oil imports constituting 66 percent of U.S. supply by 2010, and \nmore than 71 percent by 2020.\n  Continued reliance on such large quantities of imported oil will \nfrustrate our efforts to develop a national energy policy and set the \nstage for energy emergencies in the future.\n  For months now, we have watched the price of gasoline and fuel oil \nrise at breakneck speed. All across America, families have suffered \never-escalating prices.\n  We have not had a coherent and comprehensive energy policy for a long \ntime. Additionally, we have not had a commitment to address our \ndependence on foreign sources of oil. Absence of an effective policy \nand a visible commitment to addressing our energy dependence have made \nus hostage to OPEC's production decision. It has also encouraged \nMexico, our NAFTA partner, to join OPEC in limiting oil supplies.\n  We all understand that there is no overnight solution to America's \nenergy problems. We can't turn this trend around overnight. Tax repeals \nand other such short-term actions may appear appealing, given the \npolitical climate, and may even provide limited relief in the short \nrun, but they do not provide a solution to our energy problem. They do \nnot provide a sound basis for a national energy policy. Their \nunintended consequences may be other problems such as deficits in \nhighway and transit funds.\n  The only way to reverse our energy problem is to have a multifaceted \nenergy strategy and remain committed to that strategy. In my judgment, \nyou need both of these in equal portions. This will send a clear \nmessage to OPEC and their partners about America's resolve.\n  The way to improve our energy outlook is to adopt energy \nconservation, encourage energy efficiency, and support renewable energy \nprograms. Above all, we must develop energy resources that diversify \nour energy mix and strengthen our energy security. Natural gas appears \nto be the most attractive fuel to form the cornerstone of our energy \npolicy. It is the right fuel to bridge the energy and environmental \nissues facing us.\n  If we are to have a comprehensive energy policy that strengthens our \neconomy and serves the real needs of Americans, then we need to \ndismantle our dependence on foreign oil as soon as possible. And the \nway to do this is to begin using more natural gas--a domestically \nabundant fuel--that is safe and reliable to deliver, more \nenvironmentally friendly than oil, and over three times as energy-\nefficient as electricity from the point of origin to point of use.\n  Let me state those facts again: Natural gas is plentiful, efficient, \nenvironmentally friendly, and it is a domestic fuel source.\n  Natural gas offers itself as a good choice for the fuel of the \nfuture. It offers us many advantages that other fuels do not. About 85 \npercent of the natural gas consumed in America each year is produced \ndomestically. The balance is imported almost entirely from Canada. We \nhave a large domestic natural gas resource base and advances in \nexploration and production technologies are allowing increased \nproduction. We also have potentially vast resources in the form of \nmethane hydrates. This resource base is yet to be explored.\n\n  Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel. Wider use of natural gas \nwill be more benign to the environment compared to some other fuel \nsources. Natural gas would emit reduced levels of greenhouse gas \nemissions, and would not contribute to acid rain, smog, solid waste, or \nwater pollution.\n  We must invest in technologies that help facilitate wider application \nof natural gas. New technologies such as micro turbines, fuel cells, \nand other on-site power systems are environmentally attractive. Wider \nuse of these technologies in the private and public sectors must be \nfacilitated. All Federal research and development programs should be \nreevaluated to provide them with a clear direction. We must boost \nsupport for those programs that help replace imported oil.\n  Transportation demands on imported oil remain as strong as ever. \nSince the oil shock of the 1970s, all major energy consuming sectors of \nour economy with the exception of transportation have significantly \nreduced their dependence on oil. The transportation sector remains \nalmost totally dependent on oil-based motor fuels. The fuel efficiency \nof our vehicles needs to be improved. At the same time, we must make a \nconcerted effort to encourage development and use of alternative \nvehicle fuels. Natural gas vehicles should be made an integral part of \nour transportation sector.\n  If coal was the energy source of the nineteenth century, and oil was \nthe energy source of the twentieth century, then I submit natural gas \ncan and should be America's source of energy for the twenty-first \ncentury.\n  Americans are demanding an energy system that will guarantee adequate \nenergy for future needs, protect the environment, and protect consumers \nfrom exploitation.\n  We are facing numerous problems related to energy such as runaway \nprices, shortages, increases in pollution, self-sufficiency, and the \neffect of energy on our economy. While not a panacea, it is clear to \nthis Senator that increased use\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nof natural gas must be the center of America's energy strategy.\n  The American people deserve better than the status quo. Natural gas \nis America's energy solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6245-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6245-S6247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING THE SACRIFICES MADE FOR FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, too often we take our independence for \ngranted, forgetting that countless individuals paid high prices for the \nprivilege of living in a free Nation. Many lost their lives and their \nfamilies, not to mention their way of life. Recently I received some \ninformation from Major George Fisher, Georgia National Guard, regarding \nthe men who signed the Declaration of Independence. Upon having the \nCongressional Research Service obtain the entire article, I was \ninformed that it had previously been entered in the Record by \nCongressman William L. Springer, Illinois, in July of 1965. The \noriginal article was written by T. R. Fehrenbach, an American \nhistorian.\n  In light of the upcoming anniversary of the signing of the \nDeclaration of Independence, I believe that this article is worthy of \nprinting again as a reminder of the sacrifices made for our freedom.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, ``What \nHappened to the Men Who Signed the Declaration of Independence.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Congressional Research Service]\n\n  What Happened to the Men Who Signed the Declaration of Independence?\n\n                         (By T. R. Fehrenbach)\n\n       On the 7th of June 1776, a slender, keen-eyed Virginia \n     aristocrat named Richard Henry Lee rose to place a resolution \n     before the Second Continental Congress of the United Colonies \n     of North America, meeting in State House off Chestnut Street, \n     in Philadelphia. Lee had his instructions from the Virginia \n     Assembly, and he would fulfill them, but this was one of the \n     hardest days of his life. The 13 British Colonies of America \n     were already far gone in rebellion against what they \n     considered the tyranny of the English Parliament. The shots \n     heard round the world had been fired at Lexington and \n     Concord; blood had flowed at Breed's Hill in Boston.\n       Lee still believed there was time to compromise with the \n     British Government. But, acting on instructions of his State, \n     he stood and proposed: ``That these United Colonies are, and \n     of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they \n     are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and \n     that all political connection between them and the state of \n     Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.''\n       This was no longer opposition to Parliament. It was \n     revolution against the Crown.\n       American histories sometimes gloss over the fact that \n     passage of the Declaration of Independence was by no means \n     assured. Many of the men assembled in Philadelphia were at \n     best reluctant rebels. There were many moderates among them, \n     men desperately aware of, and fearful of, the fruits of war. \n     Immediately after Lee made his proposal, a majority of the \n     Congress stood against it. It took 4 days of the passion and \n     brilliance of the Adamses of Massachusetts and other patriots \n     such as Virginian Thomas Jefferson to secure a bare majority \n     of one--and then, on a South Carolina resolution, the matter \n     was postponed until the 1st of July.\n       Many men hoped it had been postponed forever. But John \n     Adams shrewdly gave Thomas Jefferson--unquestionably the best \n     writer in Congress, and perhaps the man with the fewest \n     political enemies--the task of drafting a declaration of \n     independence, and, meanwhile with his fellow Massachusetts \n     man, John Hancock, set to work. What happened between then \n     and the evening of July 4, 1776, when a vote for adoption of \n     one of the world's great documents was carried unanimously, \n     has filled many books. Some of the story--the quarrels, \n     compromises, controversies, and backroom conferences--as \n     Adams admitted, would never be told.\n       What happened was that in the course of human events the \n     hour had grown later than many of the gentlemen sitting in \n     Philadelphia had realized. State after State instructed \n     delegates to stand for independence, even though some States \n     held back to the last, and finally four delegates resigned \n     rather than approve such a move.\n       After 4 world-shaking days in July, Thomas Jefferson's \n     shining document was adopted without a dissenting vote, and \n     on July 4 John Hancock signed it as President of Congress, \n     Charles Thomson, Secretary, attesting. Four days later, July \n     8, ``freedom was proclaimed throughout the land.''\n       The Declaration of Independence was ordered engrossed on \n     parchment, and August 2, 1776, was set for its formal signing \n     by the 56 Members of Congress. The actual signing of such a \n     document, under British or any other law of the time, was a \n     formal act of treason against the Crown. But every Member \n     eventually--some were absent on August 2--signed.\n       What sort of men were these, who pledged their ``lives, \n     fortunes, and sacred honor,'' with a British fleet already at \n     anchor in New York Harbor?\n       For rebels, they were a strange breed. Almost all of them \n     had a great deal of all three things they pledged. Ben \n     Franklin was the only really old man among them; 18 were \n     still under 40, and three still in their twenties. Twenty-\n     four were jurists or lawyers. Eleven were merchants, and nine \n     were landowners or rich farmers. The rest were doctors, \n     ministers, or politicians. With only a very few exceptions, \n     like Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, whom well-wishers \n     furnished a new suit so he might be presentable in Congress, \n     they were men of substantial property. All but two had \n     families, and the vast majority were men of education and \n     standing. In general, each came from what would now be called \n     the ``power structure'' of his home State. They had security \n     as few men had it in the 18th century.\n       Each man had far more to lose from revolution than he had \n     to gain from it--except where principle and honor were \n     concerned. It was principle, not property, that brought these \n     men to Philadelphia. In no other light can the American \n     Revolution be understood.\n       John Hancock, who had inherited a great fortune and who \n     already had a price of 500 pounds on his head, signed in \n     enormous letters, so ``that His Majesty could now read his \n     name without glasses, and could now double the reward.'' \n     There was more than one reference to gallows humor that \n     day in August.\n       Ben Franklin said, ``Indeed we must all hang together. \n     Otherwise we shall most assuredly hang separately.''\n       And fat Benjamin Harrison, of Virginia, told tiny Elbridge \n     Gerry of Massachusetts, ``With me it will all be over in a \n     minute. But you, you'll be dancing on air an hour after I'm \n     gone.'' These men knew what they risked. The penalty for \n     treason was death by hanging.\n       William Ellery, of Rhode Island, was curious to see the \n     signers' faces as they committed this supreme act of courage. \n     He inched his way close to the secretary who held the \n     parchment and watched intently. He saw some men sign quickly, \n     to get it done with, and others dramatically draw the moment \n     out. But in no face, as he said, was he able to discern real \n     fear. Stephen Hopkins, Ellery's colleague from Rhode Island, \n     was a man past 60 and signed with a shaking hand. But he \n     snapped, ``My hand trembles, but my heart does not.''\n       These men were all human, and therefore fallible. The \n     regionalism, backbiting, worries, nepotism, and controversies \n     among this Congress have all had their chroniclers. Perhaps, \n     as Charles Thomson once admitted, the new nation was ``wholly \n     indebted to the agency at Providence for its successful \n     issue.'' But whether America was made by Providence or men, \n     these 56, each in his own way, represented the genius of the \n     American people, already making something new upon this \n     continent.\n       Whatever else they did, they formalized what had been a \n     brush-popping revolt and gave it life and meaning, and \n     created a new nation, through one supreme act of courage. \n     Everyone knows what came of the Nation they set in motion \n     that day. Ironically, not many Americans know what became of \n     these men, or even who they were.\n       Some prospered. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams went on to \n     become Presidents. Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Josiah \n     Bartlett, Oliver Wolcott, Edward Rutledge, Benjamin Harrison \n     and Elbridge Gerry lived to become State Governors. Gerry \n     died in office as Monroe's Vice President. Charles Carroll, \n     of Carrollton, Md., who was the richest man in Congress in \n     1776, and who risked the most, founded the Baltimore & Ohio \n     Railroad in 1828. Most Americans have heard these names.\n       Other signers were not so fortunate.\n       The British even before the list was published, marked down \n     all Members of Congress suspected of having put their names \n     to treason. They all became the objects of vicious manhunts. \n     Some were taken; some, like Jefferson, had narrow escapes. \n     All of those who had families or property in areas where \n     British power flowed during the war which followed, suffered.\n       None actually was hanged. There were too many Britons, like \n     William Pitt, the old Earl of Chatham, who even during a \n     vicious and brutal war would not have stood for that. But in \n     1776, the war had almost 8 grueling years to run, and the \n     signers suffered. Their fortunes were caught up in the \n     fortunes of war.\n       The four delegates from New York State were all men of vast \n     property, and they signed the Declaration with a British \n     fleet standing only miles from their homes. By August 2, \n     1776, the government of New York had already evacuated New \n     York City for White Plains. When they put their names to the \n     Declaration, the four from New York must have known that they \n     were in effect signing their property away.\n       The British landed three divisions on Long Island on August \n     27. In a bloody battle, Washington's untrained militia \n     was driven back to Harlem Heights. British and Hessian \n     soldiers now plundered the mansion of signer Francis Lewis \n     at Whitestone; they set it afire and carried his wife way. \n     Mrs. Lewis was treated with great brutality. Though she \n     was exchanged for two British prisoners through the \n     efforts of Congress, she died\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\n     from the effects of what had been done to her.\n       British troops next occupied the extensive estate of \n     William Floyd, though his wife and children were able to \n     escape across Long Island Sound to Connecticut. Here they \n     lived as refugees for 7 years. Without income, and eventually \n     came home to find a devastated ruin ``despoiled of almost \n     everything but the naked soil.''\n       Signer Philip Livingston came from a baronial New York \n     family, and Livingston himself had built up an immensely \n     lucrative import business. All his business property in New \n     York City was seized as Washington retreated south to Jersey, \n     and Livingston's town house on Duke street and his country \n     estate on Brooklyn Heights were confiscated. Livingston's \n     family was driven out, becoming homeless refugees, while he \n     himself continued to sell off his remaining property in an \n     effort to maintain the United States credit. Livingstone died \n     in 1778, still working in Congress for the cause.\n       The fourth New Yorker, Lewis Morris, of Westchester County, \n     saw all his timber, crops and livestock taken, and he was \n     barred from his home for 7 years. He continued fighting as a \n     brigadier general in the New York militia.\n       As Washington's men commenced their painful retreat across \n     New Jersey, it began to seem that the Revolution would fall. \n     Now American Tories or Loyalists to the Crown began to make \n     themselves known, helping the advancing British and Hessians \n     to ferret out the property and families of the Jersey \n     signers. When John Hart of Trenton risked coming to the \n     bedside of his dying wife, he was betrayed.\n       Hessians rode after Hart. He escaped into the woods, but \n     the soldiers rampaged over his large farm, tearing down his \n     grist mills, wrecking his house, while Mrs. Hart lay on her \n     deathbed. Hart, a man of 65, was hunted down across the \n     countryside and slept in caves and woods, accompanied only by \n     a dog.\n       At last, emaciated by hardship and worry, he was able to \n     sneak home. He found his wife long-buried. His 13 children \n     had been taken away. A broken man, John Hart died in 1779 \n     without ever finding his family.\n       Another New Jersey signer, Abraham Clark, a self-made man, \n     gave two officer sons to the Revolutionary Army. They were \n     captured and sent to the British prison hulk in New York \n     Harbor--the hellship Jersey, where 11,000 American captives \n     were to die. The younger Clarks were treated with especial \n     brutality because of their father. One was put in solitary \n     and given no food. The British authorities offered the elder \n     Clark their lives if he would recant and come out for King \n     and Parliament. Over the dry dust of two centuries, Abraham \n     Clark's anguish can only be guessed at as he refused.\n       When they occupied Princeton, N.J., the British billeted \n     troops in the College of New Jersey's Nassau Hall. Signer Dr. \n     John Witherspoon was president of the college, later called \n     Princeton. The soldiers trampled and burned Witherspoon's \n     fine college library, much of which had been brought from \n     Scotland.\n       But Witherspoon's good friend, signer Richard Stockton, \n     suffered far worse. Stockton, a State supreme court justice, \n     had rushed back to his estate, Morven, near Princeton, in an \n     effort to evacuate his wife and children. The Stockton family \n     found refuge with friends--but a Tory sympathizer betrayed \n     them. Judge Stockton was pulled from bed in the night and \n     brutally beaten by the arresting soldiers. Then he was thrown \n     into a common jail, where he was deliberately starved.\n       A horrified Congress finally arranged for Stockton's \n     parole, but not before his health was ruined. Finally the \n     judge was released as an invalid who could no longer harm the \n     British cause. He went back to Morven. He found the estate \n     looted, his furniture and all his personal possessions \n     burned, his library, the finest private library in America, \n     destroyed. His horses had been stolen, and even the hiding \n     place of the family silver had been bullied out of the \n     servants. The house itself still stood; eventually it was to \n     become the official residence of New Jersey's Governors.\n       Richard Stockton did not live to see the triumph of the \n     Revolution. He soon died, and his family was forced to live \n     off charity.\n       About this same time, the British sent a party to the home \n     of New Jersey signer Francis Hopkinson at Bordentown, and \n     looted it, also.\n       By December 1776, Washington's dwindling band of patriots \n     had been pushed across the Delaware, into Pennsylvania. The \n     Revolution had entered its first great period of crisis. One \n     by one, the important people of Philadelphia were mouthing \n     Loyalist sentiments, or concocting private ways of making \n     their peace with the Crown. But signer Robert Morris, the \n     merchant prince of Philadelphia, was not among these. Morris, \n     who had honestly and sincerely opposed the Declaration of \n     Independence because he felt the colonies were unready but \n     who had signed in the end, was working his heart and his \n     credit out for the Revolution. Washington's troops were \n     unprovisioned and unpaid; the United Colonies' credit, such \n     as it was, had collapsed.\n       Morris used all his great personal wealth and prestige to \n     keep the finances of the Revolution going. More than once he \n     was to be almost solely responsible for keeping Washington in \n     the field, and in December 1776, Morris raised the arms and \n     provisions which made it possible for Washington to cross the \n     Delaware and surprise the Hessian Colonel Rall at Trenton. \n     This first victory, and Washington's subsequent success at \n     Princeton, were probably all that kept the colonies in \n     business.\n       Morris was to meet Washington's appeals and pleas year \n     after year. In the process, he was to lose 150 ships at sea, \n     and bleed his own fortune and credit almost dry.\n       In the summer of 1777 the British, who were seemingly \n     always near the point of victory and yet were seemingly \n     always dilatory, landed troops south of Philadelphia, on \n     Chesapeake Bay. These marched north, to defeat Washington at \n     Brandywine and again at Germantown. Congress fled to \n     Baltimore, and Lord Howe took Philadelphia on September 27. \n     On the way, his men despoiled the home of Pennsylvania signer \n     George Clymer in Chester County, Clymer and his family, \n     however, made good their escape.\n       The family of another signer, Dr. Benjamin Rush, was also \n     forced to flee to Maryland, though Rush himself stayed on as \n     a surgeon with the Army. Rush had several narrow escapes.\n       Signer John Morton who had long been a Tory in his views, \n     lived in a strongly Loyalist area of the State. When Morton \n     had come out for independence, it turned his neighbors, most \n     of his friends, and even his relatives against him, and these \n     people, who were closest to Morton, ostracized him. He was a \n     sensitive, troubled man, and many observers believed this \n     action killed him. John Morton died in 1777. His last words \n     to his tormentors were, ``Tell them that they will live to \n     see the hour when they shall acknowledge it [the signing] to \n     have been the most glorious service that I ever rendered to \n     my country.''\n       On the same day Washington retook Trenton, the British \n     captured Newport, R.I. Here, they wantonly destroyed all of \n     Signer William Ellery's property and burned his fine home \n     to the ground.\n       The grand scheme to separate New England by General \n     Burgoyne's march from Canada was foiled at Saratoga in 1777; \n     this victory eventually brought the French into the war on \n     the American side. But after desultory fighting here and \n     there, by 1779 the British seemed to have the war well in \n     hand. Washington had held a small, professional Continental \n     Army intact, and with European instructors like von Steuben \n     and Lafayette it was being drilled into a compact, \n     disciplined force. Washington was seemingly too weak, \n     however, openly to challenge the heavily armed British forces \n     again. The seaports were captured or blockaded, and American \n     shipping driven from the seas. The northern colonies seemed \n     neutralized, and the British turned their main effort south.\n       Like the men from New York, the South Carolina signers were \n     all landed aristocrats. They had, as a body, reflected \n     Carolina's luke-warm attitude toward independence. The \n     Carolinians were all young--average age, 29--and all had \n     studied in England. But in the end they had joined the \n     majority in the interest of solidarity, and after signing \n     they had all entered military service.\n       While serving as a company commander, Thomas Lynch, Jr.'s \n     health broke from privation and exposure. His doctors ordered \n     him to seek a cure in Europe, and on the voyage he and his \n     young wife were drowned at sea.\n       The other three South Carolina signers, Edward Rutledge, \n     Arthur Middleton, and Thomas Heyward, Jr., were taken by the \n     British in the siege of Charleston. They were carried as \n     prisoners of war to St. Augustine, Fla., and here they were \n     singled out for indignities until they were exchanged at the \n     end of the war. Meanwhile, the British roaming through the \n     southern countryside had made a point of devastating the vast \n     properties and plantations of the Rutledge and Middleton \n     families.\n       The 2 years beginning in 1779 were the ugliest period of \n     the war. There was sharp fighting in the South, which \n     sometimes devolved into skirmishes and mutual atrocities \n     between Americans for independence and Americans who still \n     stood with the Crown. There had always been strong Loyalist \n     sentiment in the South, as in the Middle Atlantic States; \n     plantations and homes on either side were raided and burned, \n     and women, children, and even slaves were driven into the \n     woods or swamps to die.\n       The British soon conquered all the thin coastal strip which \n     was 18th century Georgia. Signer Button Gwinnett was killed \n     in a duel in 1777, and Col George Walton, fighting for \n     Savannah, was severely wounded and captured when that city \n     fell. The home of the third Georgia signer, Lyman Hall, was \n     burned and his rice plantation confiscated in the name of the \n     Crown.\n       One of the North Carolina signers, Joseph Howes, died in \n     Philadelphia while still in Congress, some said from worry \n     and overwork. The home of another, William Hooper, was \n     occupied by the enemy, and his family was driven into hiding.\n       By 1780 the fortunes of war had begun to change. Local \n     American militia forces defeated the King's men at King's \n     Mountain. Realizing that the war was to be decided in the \n     South, Washington sent Nathanael) Greene dance, as the saying \n     went, with Lt. Gen. Lord Cornwallis, the British commander. \n     Cornwallis did not like the dance at all, and slowly \n     retreated northward toward the Chesapeake. At Yorktown, a \n     Virginia village surrounded on three sides by water, \n     Cornwallis established what he thought was an impregnable \n     base. No matter what happened on land, Cornwallis felt he \n     could always be supplied and rescued, if need be, by sea. It \n     never occurred to the British staff that Britannia might not \n     always rule the waves.\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\n       Now began the crucial action of the war, the time \n     Washington had been waiting for with exquisite patience. A \n     powerful French squadron under Admiral de Grasse arrived at \n     the mouth of the Chesapeake from Haiti and gained temporary \n     naval superiority off the Virginia coast. Under carefully \n     coordinated plans, Washington and the French General \n     Rochambeau marched south from New York to Annapolis, where De \n     Grasse transported the allied army across Chesapeake Bay. At \n     the same time, General the Marquis de Lafayette was ordered \n     to march upon Yorktown from his position at Richmond.\n       By September 1781, Cornwallis and the main British forces \n     in North America found themselves in a trap. French warships \n     were at their rear. Regular forces--not the badly armed and \n     untrained militia the British had pushed around on the \n     battlefield for years--closed in on them from the front. By \n     October 9, Washington's and Rochambeau's armies had dug \n     extensive siege works all around Yorktown, so there could be \n     no escape. Now the bombardment began. The greatest guerrilla \n     war in history was coming to a classic close.\n       Murderous fire from 70 heavy guns began to destroy \n     Yorktown, piece by piece.\n       As the bombardment commenced, signer Thomas Nelson of \n     Virginia was at the front in command of the Virginia militia \n     forces. In 1776 Nelson had been an immensely wealthy tobacco \n     planter and merchant in partnership with a man named \n     Reynolds. His home, a stately Georgian mansion, was in \n     Yorktown. As the Revolution began, Nelson said, ``I am a \n     merchant of Yorktown, but I am a Virginian first. Let my \n     trade perish. I call God to witness that if any British \n     troops are landed in the County of York, of which I am \n     lieutenant, I will wait for no orders, but will summon the \n     militia and drive the invaders into the seas.'' Nelson \n     succeeded Thomas Jefferson as Governor of Virginia, and was \n     still Governor in 1781.\n       Lord Cornwallis and his staff had moved their headquarters \n     into Nelson's home. This was reported by a relative who was \n     allowed to pass through the lines. And while American cannon \n     balls were making a shambles of the town, leaving the mangled \n     bodies of British grenadiers and horses lying bleeding in the \n     streets, the house of Governor Nelson remained untouched.\n       Nelson asked the gunners: ``Why do you spare my house?''\n       ``Sir, out of respect to you,'' a gunner replied.\n       ``Give me the cannon,'' Nelson roared. At his insistence, \n     the cannon fired on his magnificent house and smashed it.\n       After 8 days of horrendous bombardment, a British drummer \n     boy and an officer in scarlet coats appeared behind a flag of \n     truce on the British breastplates. The drum began to beat \n     ``The Parley.''\n       Cornwallis was asking General Washington's terms.\n       On October 19, the British regulars marched out of \n     Yorktown, their fifes wailing ``The World Turned Upside \n     Down.'' They marched through a mile-long column of French and \n     Americans, stacked their arms, and marched on. It was, as \n     Lord North was to say in England when he heard the news, all \n     over.\n       But for Thomas Nelson the sacrifice was not quite over. He \n     had raised $2 million for the Revolutionary cause by pledging \n     his own estates. The loans came due; a newer peace-time \n     Congress refused to honor them, and Nelson's property was \n     forfeit. He was never reimbursed.\n       He died a few years later at the age of 50 living with his \n     large family in a small and modest house.\n       Another Virginia signer, Carter Braxton, was also ruined. \n     His property, mainly consisting of sailing ships, was seized \n     and never recovered.\n       These were the men who were later to be called \n     ``reluctant'' rebels. Most of them had not wanted trouble \n     with the Crown. But when they were caught up in it, they had \n     willingly pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their \n     sacred honor for the sake of their country.\n       It was no idle pledge. Of the 56 who signed the Declaration \n     of Independence, 9 died of wounds or hardships during the war\n       Five were captured and imprisoned, in each case with brutal \n     treatment.\n       Several lost wives, sons, or family. One lost his thirteen \n     children. All were, at one time or another, the victims of \n     manhunts, and driven from their homes.\n       Twelve signers had their houses burned. Seventeen lost \n     everything they owned.\n       Not one defected or went back on his pledged word.\n       There honor and the Nation they did so much to create, is \n     still intact.\n       But freedom, on that first Fourth of July, came high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6247-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ELECTIONS IN ZIMBABWE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the people of \nZimbabwe on their participation in the historic elections that took \nplace over the weekend. So often, events in Africa are only mentioned \non this floor and in the press only in the event of crisis or tragedy. \nBut only days ago, the people of Zimbabwe seized control of their \ncollective destiny and gave the international community a reason to \ncelebrate rather than lament conditions in Africa.\n  For twenty years, politics in Zimbabwe had been dominated by one \nparty and indeed one man. President Mugabe had the support of all but \nthree members of the 150-seat Parliament. Changes to Zimbabwe's \nconstitution, even when rejected by voters as they were in February, \ncould still be passed through this compliant legislature, enabling the \nexecutive to continue to shore up power and ignore the growing chorus \nof protest from citizens disgusted by corruption and distressed by \nmismanagement. But this week, the tide turned in Zimbabwe. Without \naccess to the state-run media and without significant financing, \nopposition candidates still managed to win fifty-eight parliamentary \nseats and end the ruling party's stranglehold on the state.\n  Mr. President, the world's attention was focused on Zimbabwe over the \nweekend because of the disturbing events that led up to the balloting. \nOpposition candidates and supporters have been intimidated, beaten, and \neven, in more than 25 cases, killed. International assessment teams \nhave indicated that given this violent preface, these elections were \nnot free and fair.\n  But as we acknowledge these flaws, even as we recognize the poisoned \nenvironment in which citizens of Zimbabwe were called upon to make \ntheir choice, we must also appreciate the courage of the voters and the \nhistoric changes they have brought to their country. Zimbabwe is still, \nwithout question, a country in crisis. But the people of Zimbabwe \nthemselves have taken a decisive step toward resolving that crisis. In \nthe face of violence and intimidation, a remarkable number of voters \nchose a peaceful and rule-governed expression of their will, and the \npower in their statement has fundamentally changed the nature of \ngovernance in Zimbabwe and silenced the pessimists who claimed that \nZimbabwe was already hopeless and lost.\n  In the wake of these elections, many challenges remain in Zimbabwe. \nThe next round of presidential elections must be conducted in a free, \nfair, and democratic manner. Genuine, rule-governed land reform must \nmove forward. The economy must be repaired, step by step. Zimbabwe, \nalong with the other African states that have troops in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, must extricate itself from the costly conflict. \nAnd perhaps most importantly, government and civil society alike must \naddress the devastating AIDS crisis head-on.\n  International support and assistance will be critical to these \nefforts. The Zimbabwe Democracy Act, a bill introduced by Senator Frist \nand of which I was an original co-sponsor, recognizes both the obvious \nneed for more progress toward democracy and the rule of law in \nZimbabwe, and the need for international support. I hope that the \nconditions laid out in that bill for resumption of a complete program \nof bilateral assistance will be met expeditiously. And I am glad that, \nin the meantime, the bill ensures that U.S. assistance will continue to \nbolster democratic governance and the rule of law, humanitarian \nefforts, and land reform programs being conducted outside the auspices \nof the government of Zimbabwe. This bill has passed the Senate, and I \nhope that the House will pass it soon, as it contains particularly \ntimely provisions which will assist individuals and institutions who \naccrue costs of penalties in the pursuit of elective office or \ndemocratic reforms.\n  So again, I extend my congratulations to the people of Zimbabwe on \ntheir historic vote, and I urge my colleagues to take note of the \npotential for real change and real progress that exists within \nZimbabwean society and indeed within many of the countries of Africa. \nAfrica is not a hopeless continent. One cannot paint the entire region \nin the same depressing and fatalistic shades. And Mr. President, I \nintend to come to this floor to highlight the promise and the \nachievements of the diverse region in the remaining weeks of this \nsession, in an effort to counter the lazy, misguided analysis that \nsuggests we should wash our hands of engagement with this remarkable \npart of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6247-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6247-S6248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE MICROSOFT CASE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Judge Learned Hand once observed: ``The \nsuccessful competitor, having been urged\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\nto compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.''\n  For Microsoft and the rest of our domestic high-tech industry, it may \nbe too late to heed Judge Hand's warning.\n  Whatever justification the Justice Department used for its actions \nagainst Microsoft, the real measure of success in the Microsoft case is \nhow it affects American consumers and the American economy.\n  From their perspective, the verdict is clear: The Justice \nDepartment's suit against Microsoft is bad for consumers, bad for high-\ntech markets, and bad for the country.\n  Mr. President, our anti-trust laws are unlike health and safety \nregulations. Their purpose isn't to protect the physical well being of \ncitizens, but rather their pocketbooks.\n  Like other forms of economic regulation, a successful effort requires \ntwo conditions. First, there must exist a market failure. Second, the \ngovernment must be in a position to fix that market failure.\n  The case against Microsoft fails both conditions. Our domestic \ncomputer markets are working just fine. For thirty years, they have \nbeen characterized by falling prices, rising performance, and increased \nchoice:\n  According to the Commerce Department, quality-adjusted prices for \ncomputer memory chips have declined 20 percent per year since 1985;\n  A chip that sold for $1778 in 1974 cost just 47 cents in 1996; and \naccording to the CBO, software prices have been falling between 3 and \n15 percent per year on average.\n  Meanwhile, new products are being introduced every day. There are \ncurrently over 25,000 applications designed to run on Windows, yet the \nfastest growing segment of the market includes so-called ``Microsoft-\nFree'' applications.\n  Mr. President, I am one of the most computer illiterate members of \nthe United States Senate, but I can pull airline flight information off \nthe internet faster than anybody here. I use my Palm Pilot to do it. \nThe Palm Pilot doesn't have any Microsoft products in it. You can \nbrowse the internet with your cell phone too. Again, no Microsoft.\n  And just recently, Linux-based software writer Red Hat announced a \npartnership with Dell Computer to accelerate the commercial adoption of \nthe Linux operating system. This new system would compete directly with \nWindows-based computers.\n  Lower prices, better performance, increased choice--Mr. President, \nthere is no market failure in our domestic computer industry. To \nsuggest otherwise doesn't pass the laugh test.\n  Nor does the suggestion that consumers are better off following Judge \nJackson's ruling. All the evidence suggests just the opposite.\n  One unique aspect of today's economy is that America's consumers are \nalso America's owners. Fully one-half of American families own stock in \nAmerican companies. Those families have been hurt by the Microsoft \ncase.\n  On April 3, Judge Jackson issued his finding of law. That day, the \nNasdaq stock index crashed. It fell a record 349 points. That's a loss \nto Americans of about $450 billion--or about 5 percent of our national \nincome.\n  Gone, in one day.\n  Mr. President, a basic premise of anti-trust action is to defend \nconsumers. We want to protect competition, not competitors.\n  Yet, in the Microsoft case, it was the competition that pointed the \nfinger. Actual consumers were notably absent. So how did the markets \ntreat Microsoft's competition following Judge Jackson's ruling? Poorly.\n  Of the companies that testified against Microsoft--Intel, IBM, \nCompaq, Oracle, AOL, Sun Microsystems, Intuit, Apple, and Gateway--only \none saw its stock rise in the month following the Judge's ruling. Every \nother stock had dropped, some by as much as 30 percent.\n  This decline is no coincidence. According to a study recently \npublished in the Journal of Financial Economics, whenever the \ngovernment's antitrust suit has scored a victory against Microsoft, an \nindex of non-Microsoft computer stocks falls. When Microsoft wins a \nround, those computer stocks rise.\n  Judge Jackson may have ruled against Microsoft, but the markets have \nruled against government interference in the New Economy.\n  Mr. President, the only monopoly consumers need to worry about in the \nMicrosoft case is the monopoly government regulation has over private \nindustry.\n  Having stood on the sidelines while American's high-tech community \nled the American economy into the twenty-first century, the government \nis now stepping in and telling those same corporations how to run their \nbusiness.\n  Economic regulation used to be popular in Washington, DC. At one \npoint in the late 1970s, the federal government controlled the pricing \nand market access of all our transportation industries--trucking, \nairlines, rail, and pipeline--as well as the energy industry.\n  Today, those regulations are gone, and we are all better off. The \nlast twenty years of economic growth and prosperity demonstrates that \nthose regulations did the economy more harm than good.\n  In many ways, our anti-trust laws are the last toe-hold of economic \nregulation in the federal code.\n  Unfortunately, it's a growing toe-hold. The number of investigations \nby the Justice Department under our anti-trust laws has exploded in \nrecent years, rising from 134 in 1995 to 276 in 1997.\n  Which begs the question, who's next?\n  Now that the Justice Department has been turned loose, who are the \nother innovative companies that might want to ensure that their \nlawyer's retainers are fully paid?\n  Intel: With a market share of 80 percent, Intel is by far the leader \nin sales of the microprocessor market for PCs. While this lead seems \nreasonable, since Intel invented the first microprocessor in 1971, \ninnovation isn't a defense in anti-trust law. Intel's profit margins \nhave exceeded 20 percent for the past five years.\n  AOL: With almost 25 million online subscribers, AOL is the clear \nworldwide leader in online services. Investor Research says: ``The \nservice has continued to make significant gains in the number of \ncustomers, despite charging a monthly fee of $21.95 that is higher than \nthe industry's standard fee of $19.95.'' Do higher fees indicate \nmonopoly rents?\n  Cisco: Cisco Systems is the world's largest supplier of high \nperformance computer internetworking systems. It supplies the majority \nof networking gear used for the internet. According to Investor \nResearch: ``Demand for switches is being driven by a need for greater \nbandwidth by corporate users: Cisco dominates this market.'' Mr. \nPresident, the term dominates is bad in the anti-trust world.\n  EBAY: EBAY operates the world's largest person-to-person online \ntrading community, with more than 10 million registered users and 3 \nmillion items listed for sale. You can purchase antiques, coins, \ncollectibles, computers, memorabilia, stamps, and toys on EBAY from \nother individuals. Profit Margins: 70 percent plus. Seven Zero.\n  One irony in the Microsoft case is that Netscape, the frequently \ncited ``victim'' in the case against Microsoft, was in 1996 clearly a \nmonopoly player in its own right, with over 80 percent of the browser \nmarket. Now, Netscape is owned by AOL, another monopoly-sized player.\n  America's high tech community used to shun government interference. \nThey would be smart to continue to do so. The companies that encouraged \nthe Microsoft lawsuit made a Faustian bargain. Now that the government \nhas focused on this industry, it may be difficult to turn its attention \nelsewhere.\n  That's too bad. The case against Microsoft has hurt the high tech \ncommunity where it counts--in its pocketbook. But the full cost of this \nill-advised attack remains to be seen. Right now, America stands alone \natop the New Economy. Increased government intervention is a good way \nto ensure that dominance doesn't last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6248-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6248-S6249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE TRUTHFULNESS, RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by several of my \ncolleagues in support of the Truthfulness, Responsibility and \nAccountability in Contracting Act, or the TRAC Act. We look forward to \ndropping our bill when the Senate returns from the July 4th recess.\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\n  The TRAC Act simply stated, seeks the best value for the federal \ndollar. Its main objectives are instituting public-private competition \nand tracking costs. My colleagues and I agree that improvements to \nservice contracting should be made, and this bill is one way to achieve \nthat.\n  Our bill directs federal agency certification before entering into \nnew contracts. These standards include establishing agency-wide \nreporting systems to report contracting efforts; requiring public-\nprivate competition; and reviewing contractor work and recompeting that \nwork if appropriate.\n  Why the new standards? So we can better ascertain what the federal \ngovernment is spending for government services. David Walker, \nComptroller General for the General Accounting Office, stated recently \nin a June 1st Washington Post piece by David Broder that ``. . . it is \nnot clear that the remaining federal employees are capable of \nmonitoring the cost and quality of the outsourced activities.'' The \nability to monitor costs is essential if the Congress is to exercise \nproper oversight of federal funds spent to carry out services by either \ncontractors or federal employees.\n  We also want to ensure an even playing field between contractors and \nfederal employees when competing for work. The public-private \ncompetitions required by the TRAC Act will determine how best the \nfederal government can save money on its many critical services. Our \nbill doesn't guarantee any pre-determined outcome in a public-private \ncompetition, but rather ensures that these competitions occur.\n  Contractors have historically played a role in delivering government \nservices and will continue to do so. Therefore, our bill will allow the \nfederal agencies to see who completes work most effectively, regardless \nof who delivers the service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6249-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6249-S6250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXPIRATION OF CHAPTER 12 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at this time, I am seeking recognition \nin order to call to my colleagues' attention something that will happen \ntoday. At midnight today, bankruptcy protections for family farmers \nwill disappear. Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code will expire. And \nAmerica's family farming operation will be exposed to foreclosure and \npossible forced auctions. I think this will be a clear failure on the \npart of the Congress and the President to do their duty. How did we get \nhere? After all, the Senate and House have passed bankruptcy reform \nbills which made chapter 12 permanent. But a small minority of Senators \nwho oppose bankruptcy reform have apparently decided that they would \nrather see America's family farmers with no last-ditch safety net than \nlet the House and Senate even convene a conference committee in order \nto get the two bills reconciled.\n  But even with these stall tactics, the House and Senate have met \ninformally to resolve the bankruptcy bills. The informal agreement, of \ncourse, will make chapter 12 permanent. If we were allowed to pass this \nbill, America's family farmers would never again face the prospect of \nhaving no bankruptcy protections.\n  That's right Mr. President, we have the power right now to give \nfamily farmers last-ditch protection against foreclosures and forced \nsales. But, some of our more liberal friends won't let that happen. \nSome members of this body have just decided to play political chess \ngames with bankruptcy reform, and they're willing to use family farmers \nas pawns to be expended in pursuit of some larger goal.\n  Mr. President, with the sluggishness we have in the farm sector, I \nthink it's just plain wrong to play games with family farmers. Senator \nLott and the Republican leadership have tried to move the bankruptcy \nbill repeatedly and have been stymied every step of the way. We need to \nhelp our family farmers, not play games with their futures. The \nopponents of bankruptcy reform have resorted to tactics which are \nmorally bankrupt.\n  Mr. President, back in the mid-1980's when Iowa was in the midst of \nanother devastating farm crisis, I wrote chapter 12 to make sure that \nfamily farmers would receive a fair shake when dealing with the banks \nand the Federal Government. At that time, I didn't know if chapter 12 \nwas going to work or not, so it was only enacted on a temporary basis.\n  Chapter 12 has been an unmitigated success. As a result of chapter \n12, many farmers who once faced total financial ruin are still farming \nand contributing to America's economy. As was the case in the dark days \nof the mid-1980s, some are again predicting that farming operations \nshould be consolidated and we should turn to corporate farming to \nsupply our food and agricultural products. As with the 1980s, some \npeople seem to think that family farms are inefficient relics which \nshould be allowed to go out of business. This would mean the end of an \nimportant part of our Nation's heritage. And it would put many hard \nworking American families--those who farm and those whose jobs depend \non a healthy agricultural sector--out of work.\n\n  But the family farm didn't disappear in the 1980s, and I believe that \nchapter 12 is a major reason for the survival of many financially \ntroubled family farms. An Iowa State University study prepared by \nprofessor Neil Harl found that 85 percent of the Iowa farmers who used \nchapter 12 were able to continue farming. That's real jobs for all \nsorts of Iowans in agriculture and in industries which depend on \nagriculture. According to the same study, 63 percent of the farmers who \nused chapter 12 found it helpful in getting them back on their feet. In \nshort, I think it's fair to say that chapter 12 worked in the mid \n1980s, and it should be made permanent so that family farmers in \ntrouble today can get breathing room and a fresh start if that's what \nthey need to make it. It's shameful that some Senators who know better \nare continuing to play politics and deny a fresh start to family \nfarmers.\n  But the bankruptcy reform bill doesn't just make chapter 12 \npermanent. Instead, the bill makes improvements to chapter 12 so it \nwill be more accessible and helpful for farmers. First, the definition \nof family farmers is widened so that more farmers can qualify for \nchapter 12 bankruptcy protections. Second, and perhaps most \nimportantly, the House and Senate agreed to reduce the priority of \ncapital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as a part of a \nchapter 12 reorganization plan. This will have the beneficial effect of \nallowing cash-strapped farmers to sell livestock, grain and other farm \nassets to generate cash flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining \na farming operation. Together, these reforms will make chapter 12 even \nmore effective in protecting America's family farms during this \ndifficult period.\n  Mr. President, it's imperative that we keep chapter 12 alive. Before \nwe had chapter 12, banks held a veto over reorganization plans. They \nwouldn't negotiate with farmers, and the farmer would be forced to \nauction off the farm, even if the farm had been in the family for \ngenerations. Now, because of chapter 12, the banks are willing to come \nto terms. We must pass the bankruptcy reform bill to make sure that \nAmerica's family farms have a fighting chance to reorganize their \nfinancial affairs.\n\n\n                Disclosure by Section 527 Organizations\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, throughout the rancorous campaign \nfinance reform debate I have consistently argued that the only \nreasonable solution rests in increased disclosure and the active \nenforcement of current laws. For this reason, I voted in support of \nH.R. 4762--legislation requiring 527 organizations to disclose their \npolitical activities and supporters.\n  I want to unequivocally state, however, that I believe this bill is \nonly the first step towards complete disclosure and accountability in \ncampaign financing. Financing laws must be fair, and they must be \nuniversal. Disclosure requirements must be extended to other tax-free \norganizations as well, namely Internal Revenue Code 501(c) groups that \nhave actively participated in local and national elections.\n  What is the benefit of disclosure laws if they do not apply to all? I \nsuggest that unbalanced and incomplete restrictions will only enhance \nefforts to manipulate campaign financing laws. 527 groups will, \nessentially, be encouraged to pack up shop and re-emerge as 501(c) \ngroups. Quickly, they will be able to continue their efforts to \ninfluence elections with limited disclosure requirements. Clearly, more \nreform must be done.\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\n  For this reason, I urge this body to move forward and extend \ndisclosure requirements to 501(c) organizations. I doubt anyone would \nsuggest that 501(c)(4) civic groups have not made efforts to express a \npolitical message. Earlier this year, one 501(c)(5) labor union openly \nprofessed its intention to spend tens of millions of dollars to \ninfluence House elections. And our nation's media has been awash with \nefforts by 501(c)(6) corporations to convey their political messages. \nYet, our financing system fails to require these groups to provide \nexpenditure and donor information. This is wrong.\n  Recently, I cast a vote that would seem to be in conflict with my \nsupport of H.R. 4762. I voted against similar language in an amendment \nto the Department of Defense Authorization bill. It is important to \nnote, however, that my vote was on a constitutional point of order. If \nthe Section 527 amendment was included in the Defense bill, it would \nhave converted the bill into a revenue measure originating in the \nSenate and caused the defense authorization bill to be blue-slipped--\nessentially killed--when it is sent to the House. This is not a matter \nof mere semantics, it is mandated by the Constitution. Regardless of \nthe legislation's merits, as a senator I must uphold the Constitution. \nMy vote reflects this duty.\n  But with H.R. 4762, the procedural obstructions were removed. I \nsupport active disclosure in our campaign financing system. By making \ncontributions public, the American people can decide for themselves who \nthey want to support. When issue ads from supposedly public interest \ngroups are aired, the American public can now find out who is funding \nthese ads. For example, we may now be able to learn whether ads for so-\ncalled environmental causes are actually being financed by members of \nOPEC who want to maintain their monopoly and prevent us from exploring \nfor oil in the U.S.\n  I hope that we will soon extend the disclosure requirements to other \norganizations so that the American public can truly know who finances \nthe public relations campaigns that influence our modern elections.\n  Mr. President, a word of caution is in order. I am sensitive to the \nlegitimate needs of private citizens to criticize government without \nfear of retaliation. We must never forget that we are the nation of \nAlexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison. The very men who wrote \nunder the anonymous name of ``Publius,'' shaping our government through \nthe Federalist Papers. Would such thought and expression have survived \nif the cloak of anonymity was removed? Political speech is free speech, \nand private citizens who have not sought preferred tax status should \nnot be limited in their rights of expression, their freedom to \nassociate, or their right to privacy.\n  Somewhere, the proper balance between complete disclosure and the \nright to free expression resides. I believe H.R. 4762 is a good first \nstep in striking this balance. Clearly, those who expect tax preferred \nstatus to advocate their political message are within the grasp of \ndisclosure laws. I reiterate my support for full disclosure, and once \nagain call for quick action upon more comprehensive disclosure \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6250-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6250-S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF DONALD MANCUSO\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \ntell my colleagues why I oppose the nomination of Mr. Donald Mancuso.\n  I would like my colleagues to understand why I have placed a hold on \nMr. Mancuso's nomination.\n  Mr. Mancuso has been nominated to be the Inspector General (IG) at \nthe Department of Defense (DOD).\n  Mr. President, over the years, I have made a habit out of watching \nthe watchdogs. I have tried hard to make sure the IG's do their job. I \nwant the IG's to be a bunch of junk yard dogs when it comes to \noverseeing their respective departments.\n  In doing this oversight work, I have learned one important lesson: \nthe IG's must be beyond reproach.\n  Now that Mr. Mancuso's nomination has been submitted to the Senate \nfor confirmation, this is the question we--in this body--must wrestle \nwith:\n  Does Mr. Mancuso meet that standard?\n  Is Mr. Mancuso beyond reproach?\n  That's the question now before the Senate.\n  I have to ask myself that question because of something that happened \na year ago.\n  In June 1999, a former agent from the Defense Criminal Investigative \nService or DCIS walked into my office. He made a number of very serious \nallegations of misconduct about senior DCIS officials, including Mr. \nMancuso.\n  And he had a huge bag full of documents to back them up.\n  Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS from 1988 until 1997 when he \nbecame the Deputy DOD IG.\n  Mr. Mancuso was the Pentagon's top cop. He was in charge of the DOD \nIG's criminal investigative bureau. He was a senior federal law \nenforcement officer.\n  The allegations were very serious.\n  Many concerned Mr. Mancuso's internal affairs unit.\n  It was alleged that an agent assigned to the internal affairs unit \nhad a history of falsifying reports to damage the reputation of fellow \nagents.\n  It was further alleged that Mr. Mancuso was aware of this problem yet \nfailed to take appropriate corrective action.\n  It was alleged that Mr. Mancuso personally approved a series actions \nto protect a senior deputy who was under investigation for passport \nfraud.\n  It was alleged that Mr. Mancuso and the senior deputy were close \npersonal friends.\n  The senior deputy happened to be in charge of the internal affairs \nunit. While head of that unit, this person is suspected of committing \nabout 12 overt acts of fraud. He was eventually convicted and sent to \njail.\n  Mr. Mancuso allegedly took extraordinary measures to shield this \nindividual from the full weight of the law and departmental \nregulations.\n  It was also alleged that Mr. Mancuso engaged in retaliation and other \nprohibited personnel practices.\n  The Majority Staff on my Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts conducted a very careful examination of the \nallegations.\n  The results of this investigation were presented in a Majority Staff \nReport issued in October 1999.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor on November 2, 1999 to discuss the \ncontents of the report.\n  All supporting documentation--and there was a mountain of material--\nwas simultaneously placed on the Judiciary Committee's web site.\n  The Majority Staff Report substantiated some of the allegations \ninvolving DCIS officials, including Mr. Mancuso.\n  I also sent a copy of the report and supporting documentation to \nSecretary of Defense Cohen.\n  Mr. President, I also wanted to be certain that my friend, Senator \nWarner, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and my friend Senator \nThompson, Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, were up to \nspeed on this issue.\n  I have continued sending them material as the case has developed.\n  I want them to be informed about what I am doing and where I am \nheaded with Mr. Mancuso's nomination.\n  Mr. President, after the staff report was issued, my office was \ninundated with phone calls from current and former DCIS agents with new \nallegations of misconduct by Mr. Mancuso and others.\n  The Majority Staff has investigated some of the new allegations, as \nwell. Some have been substantiated and some have not.\n  The new findings have been summarized in letter reports.\n  Those have been shared with Secretary Cohen.\n  And I met with the new Deputy Secretary, Mr. Rudy de Leon, on May \n24th to express my concerns about the allegations involving Mr. \nMancuso.\n  Mr. President, I am not alone in raising questions about Mr. \nMancuso's conduct.\n  At least six other government entities believe that the allegations \nare serious enough to warrant further investigation. These include:\n\n       Chief of the Criminal Division, Eastern District of \n     Virginia\n       Integrity Committee of the President's Council on Integrity \n     and Efficiency\n       Public Integrity Section at the Justice Department\n       Inspector General, Department of the Treasury\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\n       U.S. Office of Special Counsel\n       Inspector General, General Services Administration\n\n  Most of these investigations are ongoing. However, at least one has \nbeen completed.\n  The Inspector General at the Treasury Department has corroborated \nsome of the facts and conclusions in the Majority Staff Report.\n  I also know that the U.S. Attorney, who prosecuted Mr. Mancuso's \nsenior deputy for passport fraud, is very unhappy with Mr. Mancuso's \nconduct in that case.\n  The U.S. Attorney has characterized Mr. Mancuso's conduct in that \ncase as: ``egregious and unethical.''\n  Mr. President, at this point, there are just too many unanswered and \nunresolved questions bearing on the allegations.\n  I think it would be accurate to say the case against Mr. Mancuso \nwould not stand up in a court of law.\n  Successfully meeting that test, however, does not mean that Mr. \nMancuso is ready to be the Pentagon's Inspector General.\n  The IG's must meet a much higher standard.\n  The IG must be beyond reproach.\n  Having questions about judgment and appearance--like in Mr. Mancuso's \ncase--is not beyond reproach.\n  Mr. President, I will have much more to say about this at a later \ndate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6251-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE MINNESOTA FLOODS OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the devastating \nstorms of last week that are affecting much of northwestern Minnesota. \nWe are experiencing some of the worst flash flooding in over 100 years. \nThese storms dumped more than 7 inches of rain in the Moorhead, \nMinnesota and Fargo, North Dakota area in an eight-hour period, \nswamping hundreds of basements, and streets, and acres of farm land.\n  This past weekend, I had the opportunity to see first hand the \neffects of the storm when I visited the communities of Ada, Borup, \nPerley, Hendrum, and Moorhead. Actually, I had originally planned \nbefore the storm on being in the area to celebrate the grand opening of \nthe Ada Hospital following its destruction during the Floods of 1997. \nJust three short years ago, Ada was hit with the worst flooding in 500 \nyears. They are still recovering from that flood.\n  How do you explain floods like these? They don't just happen once in \na while contrary to reports of 100 or even 500-year floods, they've \nbeen happening every year in northwestern Minnesota. Last year, Ada \nexperienced severe hail storms and a Labor Day flood. In 1998, there \nwere three floods in February, May and June. In 1997, of course, there \nwas the huge flood in the Red River Valley.\n  Swollen from the heavy rains, the Wild Rice River became a huge pool \nof water 25 miles wide and 30 miles long that flowed steadily overland \nthrough northwestern Minnesota, drowning millions of dollars worth of \ncrops in its path. The pool developed as heavy runoff collected at \nhigher elevations in Becker and Mahnomen counties, then flowed into the \nRed River Valley toward Ada. You have to realize that this land is very \nflat, dropping only about one foot per mile, so the water moves slowly, \nbut causes severe crop damage. Several rivers converge and flood \nprevention measures have failed to funnel excess water into the Red \nRiver. I intend to work with representatives from the watershed \ndistricts, and the Army Corps of Engineers to see whether past flood \ncontrol measures have resulted in what has become constant flooding in \nthis area of northwest Minnesota and what can be done to alleviate this \nproblem in the future. I saw fields with three or four feet of water \nthat had been planted with wheat, soybeans, and sugar beets earlier \nthis year. Now, these crops are all destroyed, and the stench of \nrotting crops has begun.\n  Earlier this week, Governor Ventura declared this area a state of \nemergency so that federal, state and local emergency management \nofficials can work together to assess the damage and see whether \nfederal assistance will be required. As if this wasn't enough, eight \ncounties in southeastern Minnesota were declared emergency areas and \nGovernor Ventura has asked the federal government for money to help \nwith their recovery following rainstorms of May 17th. I was happy to \nsupport the Governor's request and to learn that President Clinton has \ndeclared this region a disaster so that they are eligible for federal \nfunding. This region of Minnesota received 5 to 7 inches of rain on May \n17th, followed by another heavy storm May 31. Since then, even small \nrainfalls have resulted in overflows and drainage problems.\n  It's too early to tell the extent of the damage in northwestern \nMinnesota. Preliminary estimates include damage to 430 houses, \nprimarily in the Moorhead area, and $10 million damage to crops in \nBecker and Mahnomen counties.\n  But losses will go much higher. The greatest crop damage appears to \nbe in Clay and Norman counties. There, crops have been damaged or \ndestroyed on more than 500 square miles of land, according to county \nofficials. That could mean $50 million in lost crops, and half that \nagain in out-of-pocket planting costs.\n  Flooding remains a serious blow to farmers in Minnesota. There are \nabout 300 commercial farmers left in Norman County in northwestern \nMinnesota. They've been losing 20 or 30 farms every year recently. It's \ntoo late to plant any cash crops in that part of the state. Some \nfarmers will plant a ``cover crop'' to control erosion; others simply \nwill try to control weeds and start planning for next year.\n  As in every disaster that my state has faced, I've been inspired once \nagain by the people of Minnesota, who rally together for their \ncommunities when tragedy strikes. It's during critical times such as \nthese that we finally understand the importance of neighbor helping \nneighbor. At a time when we all too often fail to make the effort to \nget to know and appreciate our neighbors, Minnesotans in a great many \nof our communities have formed lasting bonds over this past week and \nfound their civic spirit has been restored.\n  Mr. President, I intend to work with Governor Ventura to examine the \nneed for federal funding to help those Minnesotans devastated by this \nmost recent flooding. I also want to work with the Governor, the Farm \nServices Administration, and the Department of Agriculture in \nanticipation of federal funding needs for farmers who have had severe \ncrop losses. I stand together with my colleagues in the Minnesota \ndelegation, and with our colleagues from North Dakota who are facing \ndestruction in their states equal to our own. When disaster strikes, we \nare not Republicans or Democrats. We are representatives of the people, \nand we will do whatever we must to protect our citizens when their \nlives, homes and property are threatened.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6251-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6251-S6253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PRESIDENT'S ROADLESS INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate \nthis week as the Forest Service has launched a series of meetings in my \nstate and around the country to solicit comments on the \nAdministration's proposed roadless initiative. I want to encourage \nOregonians to send in their comments and attend these meetings to make \ntheir voices heard.\n  I am concerned that so many of my constituents will not take part in \nthis comment period in part because they believe that this roadless \npolicy is a foregone conclusion. Frankly, I don't think the Forest \nService did much to change those feelings by including language in its \ndraft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which characterized \nloggers, mill workers, and people in the timber products industry in \ngeneral as uneducated, opportunistic, and unable to adapt to change. \nMany Oregonians, not just those in resource industries, were offended \nby this.\n  I understand that the Administration has subsequently apologized, but \nI am afraid this incident only added to the feeling held by many \nOregonians that the decisions about this roadless plan have already \nbeen made. So I want to take this opportunity today to outline some of \nmy concerns about this roadless initiative and to encourage other \nOregonians to take advantage of the remaining weeks of this public \ncomment period to do the same.\n  Mr. President, the management of the roadless areas in our National \nForest System has been the subject of debate for many years. We had the \nRARE I (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation) process in the early 1970s \nleading\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\nto inventories and analysis of the large roadless areas in our National \nForests. Then we had RARE II under the Carter Administration.\n  That process was followed by a number of state-specific bills, such \nas the Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984, where roadless areas that were \nsuitable for wilderness protection were so designated and other \nroadless areas were to be released for multiple uses. Despite the \ngrowth of the wilderness system in this country, the management of \nother roadless areas has remained controversial.\n  Now this Administration has proposed a roadless initiative that would \npermanently ban road construction from some 43 million acres of \ninventoried roadless areas. In addition, this draft EIS calls for each \nForest, upon its periodic Forest Plan revision, to protect additional \nroadless areas, often referred to as uninventoried roadless areas. No \none, not even the Forest Service, seems to know how many millions of \nacres that may ultimately be. So the President is proposing setting \naside an additional 45 to 60 million acres of the National Forest \nsystem on top of the 35 million acres that are already designated as \nwilderness areas. Let me remind my colleagues that the entire National \nForest System is 192 million acres and that there are numerous riparian \nareas and wildlife buffer zones that are also off limits to road \nconstruction. So we may well have more than half of our National Forest \nSystem permanently set aside and inaccessible to most of the public by \nthe time this Administration is through.\n  What is even more alarming to me is the position of the Vice \nPresident on this issue. In a speech to the League of Conservation \nVoters last month, Al Gore said the Administration's preferred \nalternative does not go far enough. Perhaps Mr. Gore's ``Progress and \nProsperity'' tour should make a few stops in rural Oregon so he can see \nfirst-hand the results of eight years of passive management of our \nfederal lands--double digit unemployment and four day school weeks. As \npart of the Administration that is writing this rule and is supposedly \nkeeping an open mind while taking comments from the public this month, \nit seems a bit premature for the Vice President to speak so favorably \nof an alternative that is ostensibly still being reviewed. I know the \nChairman of the Senate Energy Committee and the Chairman of the House \nResources Committee have requested the Vice President recuse himself \nfrom the rest of this rule-making process. I agree with the Chairmen \nand hope the Vice President will try to restore the public's confidence \nthat this rule-making is not predetermined and that it is open, as \nrequired by law, to the comments and suggestions of the public.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues may ask why new roads may be \nneeded in the National Forest System. There are many reasons, but \nperhaps the most urgent purpose is forest health.\n  A century of fire suppression followed by years of inactive forest \nmanagement under this Administration have left our National Forest \nSystem overstocked with underbrush and unnaturally dense tree stands \nthat are now at risk of catastrophic wildfire. The GAO recently found \nthat at least 39 million acres of the National Forest System are at \nhigh risk for catastrophic fire. According to the Forest Service, 26 \nmillion acres are at risk from insects and disease infestations as \nwell. The built up fuel loads in these forests create abnormally hot \nwildfires that are extremely difficult to control. This year's fires in \nNew Mexico have given us a preview of what is to come throughout our \nNational Forest System if we continue this Administration's policy of \npassive forest management.\n  To prevent catastrophic fire and widespread insect infestation and \ndisease outbreaks, these forests need to be treated. The underbrush \nneeds to be removed. The forests must be thinned to allow the remaining \ntrees to grow more rapidly and more naturally. While some of this work \ncan be done without roads, roads are many times required in order to \ncarry out this necessary work. Yet this Administration apparently wants \nto make it more difficult to address these problems, more difficult to \nstop fires like those in New Mexico before they start. And the Vice \nPresident wants to go even further than that.\n  Why else are roads needed in the National Forest System? Forest roads \nprovide millions of Americans with access to the National Forests for \nrecreational purposes. With the Forest Service predicting tremendous \nincreases in recreational visits to the National Forest System in the \ncoming years, shouldn't there at least be a thorough examination of how \nthis roadless plan will affect the remaining areas of our National \nForests, which will apparently have to absorb most of these new \nvisitors? And what about the needs of seniors and disabled visitors? \nCompounding the problem, this Administration will be decommissioning \nmany roads currently used by recreational visitors. In its rush to \ncomplete this sweeping rule, this Administration does not seem to have \nthe time to examine seriously the impacts of steering more and more \nrecreational visitors to a smaller percentage of the Forest System.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about how this roadless initiative \nis supposed to interact with the Northwest Forest Plan. Last year, I \ncame to the floor of the Senate and I expressed concerns about this \nAdministration's forestry policies and its weak implementation of its \nown plan that was supposed to lay the groundwork for a cooperative \nresolution to the timber disputes of the early 1990s. Unfortunately, as \nour federal agencies scour the forests to survey for mosses, we \ncontinue to have gridlock in the Northwest, with none of the promised \nsustainable and predictable timber harvests in sight. So how much \nconfidence does this Administration have in its own Northwest Forest \nPlan? By reading its roadless proposal, the answer is ``not much.'' \nClinton's Northwest Forest Plan has thorough standards and guidelines \nfor activities in the forests covered by the plan, including \nroadbuilding. This Administration had previously exempted the Northwest \nForest Plan forests from its road building moratoriums because it was \nstill clinging to the notion that its plan was the model for forestry \npolicy in the future. Unlike those temporary moratoria, however, the \nAdministration's roadless initiative makes no exception for the forests \ncovered by the Northwest Forest Plan. To me, this suggests that even \nthis Administration is acknowledging what many in the Northwest have \nsaid for some time: The Clinton Forest Plan is a failure. Rural Oregon \nalready knew that. Now with this roadless proposal, this Administration \nwill only make it harder for any future Administration to keep its \npromises under the Northwest Forest Plan. This fact is most obvious in \nthe town of Klamath Falls in southern Oregon. Like many towns in the \nNorthwest surrounded by federal lands, Klamath Falls was encouraged by \nthis Administration to create jobs and economic growth through \nrecreation and eco-tourism in order to compensate for the loss of the \ntimber jobs. Of course, it is difficult to find substitutes for the \nfamily wage jobs that the timber industry once provided for these \ntowns. Nevertheless, rural Oregon has tried to diversify its economy.\n\n  More than three years ago, developers and community leaders in \nKlamath Falls embarked upon the arduous process of obtaining a special \nuse permit to launch a winter recreation area at Pelican Butte in the \nnearby Winema National Forest. Millions of dollars were spent and \ncountless hours were invested by everyone from the local forest \nservice, to the developers, to the local government and the community \nas a whole. A final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of \nDecision are due next year. Now, due to the fact that Pelican Butte \nwill require three miles of road in a currently inventoried roadless \narea, the Administration's roadless initiative will effectively kill \nthe plan. In its zeal to complete this plan before leaving office, this \nAdministration apparently does not want to take the time to make \nreasonable accommodations for proposals that have been in the pipeline \nfor years. Never mind the fact that the Pelican Butte project will \nresult in a net decrease in road mileage on National Forest lands. \nNever mind the fact that Oregonians were told by this Administration to \ngo and find other means to develop their economy outside of timber. The \nmessage to Oregonians is clear: If the roadless plan is to be concluded \nbefore President Clinton leaves office, there is\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nno time to spare to consider the effort and good will invested by the \npeople of Klamath Falls in the Pelican Butte proposal. The fact is that \nthis Administration doesn't care how many rural communities are left in \nthe dust by this regulatory juggernaut.\n  Mr. President, all of this is very discouraging for Oregonians who \nhave a sense this Administration has already made up its mind on this \nroadless initiative. It is my understanding that many of my \nconstituents have just received copies of this draft EIS in the last \nfew days--with half of the brief comment period already expired. \nNevertheless, from the floor of the Senate today, I am pleading with my \nconstituents to get out there during this comment period and make their \nvoices heard. This rulemaking is too significant for Oregonians to be \nsilent.\n  Mr. President, I agree with this Administration that we need a long-\nterm resolution to the management of our roadless areas. But common \nsense tells us that what is needed and appropriate for one area may not \nbe sound stewardship for another. With this roadless initiative, this \nAdministration is talking about setting aside in one broad stroke \nmillions of acres that are supposed to be held in trust for all \nAmericans. Even worse, this plan is being rushed through a truncated \npublic comment process in order to accommodate an artificial political \ndeadline. This isn't the way to manage our precious natural resources \nand this isn't the way to treat our rural communities. The management \nof these roadless areas is a complicated question, and it deserves more \nthan the simple answer being force-fed to us by this Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6253-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \nissue that has become increasingly important to many in Congress. As an \nearly sponsor of legislation to provide prescription drug coverage \nunder Medicare, I am pleased there has been progress in reaching an \nagreement among many proposals to provide prescription drug benefits to \nseniors.\n  Medicare recently celebrated its 35th anniversary. As with most \nthings in life this program is now starting to show its age. Still \nbeing administered under a model developed in 1965, Medicare is quickly \nbecoming antiquated and blind to the many advances in modern medicine. \nWe all know prescription drugs play an increasingly important role in \nthe health of our nation.\n  There are countless examples of drugs which now allow us to live \nlonger, more productive lives. Drugs to control blood pressure, lower \ncholesterol, or mitigate the effects of a stroke are a few which \ndemonstrate the measurable impact research and development can have on \nimproving our lives. Unfortunately, the Medicare program has not \nprogressed as rapidly as medicine.\n  To that end, I introduced the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs \nfor Seniors Act, or MEDS. My bill was an early attempt to heighten the \ndebate surrounding prescription drugs, and at the same time provide a \nplan that would address the needs of the nearly one third of senior \ncitizens in this country who currently lack any form of prescription \ncoverage. We have all heard the frightening stories of the choices that \nmany seniors are forced to make when it comes to paying for \nprescription drugs. Unfortunately, many of these stories have been \npoliticized and used to stir the political cauldron over the past \nseveral months. But the reality is that decisions between food, \nshelter, and medicine are all too common among our neediest seniors. \nMEDS was introduced to help these people.\n  My plan would add a prescription benefit under the already existing \nPart B of Medicare, without creating or adding any new overly \nbureaucratic component to the Medicare program. It works like this: The \npart B beneficiary would have the opportunity to access the benefit as \nlong as they were Medicare eligible. Those with incomes below 135 \npercent of the nation's poverty level would be provided the benefit \nwithout a deductible and would only be responsible for a 25 percent co-\npayment for all approved medications.\n  My bill also provides relief for seniors above the 135 percent income \nthreshold who may face overwhelming drug costs because of the number of \nprescriptions they take or the relative costs of them, by paying for 75 \npercent of the costs after a $150 monthly deductible is met. Most \nimportantly, this voluntary benefit does not have a treatment cap. \nUnlike both the President's plan and others currently being debated in \nCongress, MEDS covers all participating beneficiaries no matter what \nlevel of monthly or annual drug expenditure they incur and does not \nabandon seniors when they need help the most.\n  The House of Representatives narrowly passed a prescription drug bill \nthat subsidizes the insurance industry and attempts to ensure coverage \nin all areas of the country--a difficult if not impossible task. The \nbiggest problem with this approach is that the insurance industry has \nstated that it wouldn't be able or willing to provide these types of \n``stand alone'' policies no matter how much of a subsidy they receive. \nTrying to establish an enormously expensive and administratively \ndifficult plan built on the mere hope that the insurance industry will \nchange its mind, is simply too big a risk to take when it comes to our \nnations seniors.\n  The House bill would establish a new outside agency through the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to administer the plan. Not \nonly will this compound the problem of administration, implementation \nand increasing federal bureaucracy, but it also actually delays \nbenefits that will help our seniors today. There is no way a major new \nbureaucracy can be created and become effective in time to provide the \nhelp our seniors need now. At a minimum, based on similar initiatives \nin the past, it would take two years to gear up this kind of new \ngovernment agency, which again, only duplicates existing federal \nbureaucracy and slows progress toward meaningful reform.\n  It's important these facts are understood as we continue discussing \nemerging plans for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. How a \nplan is structured could have dramatic consequences for future \ninnovations in treatments which can enhance quality of life and in some \ncases save lives. If done right, we'll enable all senior citizens to \naccess the best health care system in the world and receive the latest \ntechnology and treatment for their conditions--and do it in a way that \nis both responsible and expedient. MEDS accomplishes both of these \ngoals.\n  In closing Mr. President, let me say, as I have in the past, the \nchallenge before us today is to enable Medicare to shape and adapt \nitself to reflect the realities of an ever changing health care system. \nAfter 35 years of endless tinkering, we have a real opportunity to make \nit more responsive, more helpful, and more attuned to the needs of \ncurrent and future retirees and disabled persons in this country \nthrough the provision of a prescription drug benefit. This is a goal to \nwhich I am wholly committed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6253-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6253-S6254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD ACT\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate approved S. 148, \nthe Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. I would like to thank \nSenator Abraham and Senator Smith for their work on this important \nenvironmental issue, and also offer my family's appreciation for \nSenator Abraham's kind words regarding my father. Senator John Chafee \nwas a strong proponent of this legislation, and I am proud to follow \nhis lead in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Now, what is a neotropical migratory bird? Simply put, it's a bird \nthat breeds in North America, and migrates each year to tropical \nhabitats in Central and South America. While the name sounds technical \nand complicated, many of these birds are well-known and well-loved by \nAmericans. Plovers, sandpipers, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, orioles, \nblackbirds, and many species of raptor and songbird are all neotropical \nmigratory birds. Some of these birds, such as the Ruby-throated \nHummingbird and the Killdeer, cover amazing distances as they travel \nbetween their summer and winter habitats.\n  In Rhode Island, we are fortunate to be visited by many neotropical \nmigrants including one species of hummingbird, over ten species of \nraptor,\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\nover 30 species of shorebirds, eight species of flycatcher, six species \nof thrush, and 35 species of warblers. Rhode Island's location makes it \na key stopover spot for many neotropical migrants to refuel and \nrehydrate.\n  In addition to an excellent location, Rhode Island has important \nhabitat for migratory birds. Its combination of fruit-bearing shrubs \nand forest provide ample cover and food for these birds to take a break \nduring their migration. The many wetlands found in the state also \nprovide excellent areas to rehydrate, one of the most important needs \non a bird's trip north or south.\n  Even with high quality habitat still available in parts of the United \nStates, tragically, many of these species are in real danger. The \ngreatest human threat to neotropical migratory birds is the loss of \nhabitat, particularly in the Caribbean and Latin America. Many \nneotropical migratory birds stop to rest and feed at several relatively \nsmall patches of habitat along their long migrations between \ncontinents. Destruction of these stopover areas can have a devastating \nimpact on a species. In addition, overharvesting of timber, loss of \nwetlands and heavy use of pesticides exact a heavy toll on the habitats \non which neotropical migrants depend. As noted in the Committee Report, \n90 species of migratory birds are listed as threatened or endangered \nunder the Endangered Species Act, and approximately 210 species in the \nUnited States are in serious decline.\n  The challenge of protecting migratory birds is complicated by the \nreality that many of the most effective conservation measures must be \nimplemented overseas. Migratory birds cross oceans, time zones, and \nnational boundaries. Preservation of these species must involve close \npartnerships and cooperation with our Caribbean and South American \nneighbors.\n  Senator Abraham's bill will help address the multitude of threats \nfacing migratory birds by encouraging partnerships between private and \npublic entities and across international boundaries to help protect and \nrestore habitat of neotropical migrants. Importantly, there are ongoing \nefforts aimed at stopping the decline in migratory bird species; \nhowever, these efforts could be enhanced through better coordination \nand increased funding. S. 148 furthers both goals. Under the bill, the \nSecretary of the Interior is directed to facilitate the exchange of \ninformation among the various groups, and to coordinate existing \nconservation efforts. The bill also authorizes $25 million over five \nyears in grants for projects to conserve neotropical migratory bird \npopulations. Three-quarters of this funding must be used for projects \nin other countries to ensure that scarce resources will be focused \nwhere they are needed most.\n  In closing, I would like to relate a story that my father used to \ntell about a family friend traveling in China. This fellow noticed that \nhis surroundings there were strangely silent. Upon reflection, he \nattributed the ominous quiet to the total lack of birds in the \nenvironment. Apparently, in parts of China the destruction of habitat \nand the commercial bird market have resulted in the virtual elimination \nof songbirds. What a terrible loss. We must work together to prevent \nsuch tragedy from occurring in the Western Hemisphere. And, Senator \nAbraham's bill is a good step in the right direction. I applaud my \ncolleagues for supporting this measure to help prevent the further \ndecline in our neotropical migratory birds. And, I hope the President \nwill act swiftly to enact the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6254-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, this past week, culminating on \nSaturday, June 24th, the 2000 Paralympic Trials for track and field \nwere held on the campus of Connecticut College in New London, \nConnecticut.\n  Almost 150 athletes competed in a dozen events including the 100 \nmeter race, 10,000 meter race, shot put, long jump and high jump. \nSeventy-one athletes earned the right to represent the United States at \nthe 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games, which will be held October 18th-29th.\n  The Paralympic movement is relatively young, but in recent years it \nhas grown rapidly. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann staged the first \nInternational Wheelchair Games to coincide with the 1948 London Olympic \nGames. These first Games focused on World War II veterans with spinal \ncord-related injuries. Later, other disability groups established \ninternational sports organizations which arranged various competitions. \nAs time went by, multi-disability competitions developed. These events \nwere brought together for the first time under the banner of the \nParalympic Games in 1960 in Rome.\n  Since then, the games have grown in success and popularity. Always \nheld in tandem with the Olympic Games, the Paralympic athletes move \ninto the Olympic village shortly after the Olympic athletes move out \nand many times compete at the same venues as their Olympic \ncounterparts.\n  From Seoul to Barcelona and most recently in Atlanta, the Paralympic \nGames have blossomed into a major international sporting event. This \nyear's Games in Sydney will continue the momentum generated over the \nlast decade. In fact, more athletes will compete at the Sydney 2000 \nSummer Paralympics (4,000 athletes from 125 nations) than in the 1972 \nMunich Olympics.\n  To those who competed last week in Connecticut, I think I speak for \nall of our colleagues in applauding their efforts. Like all athletes, \nthey remind us of the timely and timeless virtues that sports teach \nus--virtues like self-reliance, discipline, cooperation, and modesty in \nvictory as well as defeat. In striving to do their best, they inspire \nothers to do their best, as well--be they disabled or not.\n  To those who will represent the United States in Sydney, we wish them \nluck. And we are confident that they will do our nation proud.\n  I ask that the names of these athletes be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n        Athletes Nominated to the 2000 Paralympic Athletics Team\n\n       Rodney Anderson, Daniel Andrews, Ken Bair, Bob Balk, Lisa \n     Banta, Jennifer Barrett, Cheri Beccerra, Thomas Becke, Trent \n     Blair, Cheri Blauwet, John Brewer, Ted Bridis, Shawn Brown, \n     Jeremy Burleson, Bert Burns, Lynne K.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the City of \nFargo, North Dakota, on its recent selection with neighboring Moorhead, \nMinnesota, as an All-American City by the National Civic League.\n  This is a prestigious but well deserved honor. The Fargo-Moorhead \nmetro area is one of the most vital and fastest growing in the Upper \nGreat Plains. The region is home to three highly respected colleges and \nuniversities. It is a major medical and commercial center. And in \nrecent years, the area has seen remarkable growth in high technology.\n  But modern infrastructure and economic vitality are only part of the \nstory of this award. Fargo was recently ranked the best medium-sized \ncity in America in which to raise children. It offers the sort of civil \nsociety with safe streets, strong families, and functioning and \nresponsive government that comes to mind when people all over this \ncountry think of what it means to live in America's heartland.\n  It was pleasant news but no surprise that Fargo-Moorhead was one of \n10 communities that were winners in the national All-America City \ncompetition, hosted by the National Civic League. The league could not \nhave chosen better.\n  As I have discussed on the Senate floor, recent storms dumped over \nseven inches of rain on Fargo in just over seven hours, inundating the \ncity and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. These \ntorrential rains have also meant something else, however--another \nchance for the area's residents to show their resilience, compassion, \nand community spirit. Already, Fargo-Moorhead is coming back, stronger \nthan ever.\n  Mr. President, I would like to pay special tribute to the cooperation \nbetween Fargo and its sister city to the east, Moorhead. Rather than a \nbasis for rivalry, the proximity and common experience of Fargo and \nMoorhead have proven compelling rationales for cooperation. The joint \naward to Fargo and Moorhead of All-America City honors recognizes the \ndaily cooperation and friendship that characterizes relations between \nthese neighboring communities.\n  Numerous volunteers invested thousands of hours of work in \npreparations for the recent competition, and deserve sincere thanks. \nLet me make special note of the efforts of Fargo Mayor Bruce Furness \nand Moorhead Mayor Morris Lanning for their leadership and vision. In \nhelping to make this award a reality, they are allowing the nation to \nsee what we in North Dakota and Minnesota have known for years--that \nFargo-Moorhead is shining example of the American dream made reality, a \ntruly All-America City.\n  Again, on behalf of the United States Senate, I offer my most sincere \ncongratulations to Fargo and Moorhead for being recognized as an All-\nAmerica City.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6255-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING ARDYCE HABEGER SAMP\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Rept. 106-15).\n\n   Text of the Committee Recommended Resolution of Advice and Consent\n\n                      Senate of the United States\n\n\n                          in executive session\n\n       Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That the Senate advise and consent to the \n     ratification of the Inter-American Convention Against \n     Corruption, adopted and opened for signature at the \n     Specialized Conference of the Organization of American States \n     (OAS) at Caracas, Venezuela, on March 29, 1996, (Treaty Doc. \n     105-39); referred to in this resolution of ratification as \n     ``The Convention'', subject to the understandings of \n     subsection (a), the declaration of subsection (b), and the \n     provisos of subsection (c).\n       (a) Understandings.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     is subject to the following understandings, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification of the Convention \n     and shall be binding on the President:\n       (1) Application of article i.--The United States of America \n     understands that the phrase ``at any level of its hierarchy'' \n     in the first and second subparagraphs of Article I of the \n     Convention refers, in the case of the United States, to all \n     levels of the hierarchy of the Federal Government of the \n     United States, and that the Convention does not impose \n     obligations with respect to the conduct of officials other \n     than Federal officials.\n       (2) Article vii (``domestic law'').--\n       (A) Article VII of the Convention sets forth an obligation \n     to adopt legislative measures to establish as criminal \n     offenses the acts of corruption described in Article VI(1). \n     There is an extensive network of laws already in place in the \n     United States that criminalize a wide range of corrupt acts. \n     Although United States laws may not in all cases be defined \n     in terms or elements identical to those used in the \n     Convention, it is the understanding of the United States, \n     with the caveat set forth in subparagraph (B), that the kinds \n     of official corruption which are intended under the \n     Convention to be criminalized would in fact be criminal \n     offenses under U.S. law. Accordingly, the United States does \n     not intend to enact new legislation to implement Article VII \n     of the Convention.\n       (B) There is no general ``attempt'' statute in U.S. federal \n     criminal law. Nevertheless, federal statues make ``attempts'' \n     criminal in connection with specific crimes. This is of \n     particular relevance with respect to Article VI(1)(c) of the \n     Convention, which by its literal terms would embrace a single \n     preparatory act done with the requisite ``purpose'' of \n     profiting illicitly at some future time, even though the \n     course of conduct is neither pursued, nor in any sense \n     consummated. The United States will not criminalize such \n     conduct per se, although significant acts of corruption in \n     this regard would be generally subject to prosecution in the \n     context of one or more other crimes.\n       (3) Transnational bribery.--Current United States law \n     provides criminal sanctions for transnational bribery. \n     Therefore, it is the understanding of the United States of \n     America that no additional legislation is needed for the \n     United States to comply with the obligation imposed in \n     Article VIII of the Convention.\n       (4) Illicit enrichment.--The United States of America \n     intends to assist and cooperate with other States Parties \n     pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the Convention to \n     the extent permitted by its domestic law. The United States \n     recognizes the importance of combating improper financial \n     gains by public officials, and has criminal statutes to deter \n     or punish such conduct. These statutes obligate senior-level \n     officials in the Federal Government to file truthful \n     financial disclosure statements, subject to criminal \n     penalties. They also permit prosecution of federal public \n     officials who evade taxes on wealth that is acquired \n     illicitly. The offense of illicit enrichment as set forth in \n     Article IX of the Convention, however, places the burden of \n     proof on the defendant, which is inconsistent with the United \n     States Constitution and fundamental principles of the United \n     States legal system. Therefore, the United States understands \n     that it is not obligated to establish a new crminal offense \n     of illicit enrichmnent under Article IX of the Convention.\n       (5) Extradition.--The United States of America shall not \n     consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition \n     to any country with which the United States has no bilateral \n     extradition treaty in force. In such cases where the United \n     States does have a bilateral extradition treaty shall serve \n     as the legal basis for extradition for offenses that are \n     extraditable in accordance with this Convention.\n       (a) Prohibition of assistance to the international criminal \n     court.--The United States of America shall exercise its \n     rights to limit the use of assistance it provides under the \n     Convention so that any assistance provided by the Government \n     of the United States shall not be transferred to or otherwise \n     used to assist the International Criminal Court agreed to in \n     Rome, Italy, on July 17, 1998, unless the treaty establishing \n     the Court has entered into force for the United States by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, as required by \n     Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Declaration.--The advice and consent of the Senate is \n     subject to the following declaration:\n       Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and Condition (8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the Document Agreed Among \n     the State Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces \n     in Europe, approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (c) Provisos.--The advice and consent of the Senate is \n     subject to the following provisos:\n       (1) Enforcement and monitoring.--Not later than April 1, \n     2001, and annually thereafter for five years, unless extended \n     by an Act of Congress, the President shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives, a report that sets out:\n       (A) Ratification.--A list of the countries that have \n     ratified the Convention, the dates of ratification and entry \n     into force for each country, and a detailed account of U.S. \n     efforts to encourage other nations that are signatories to \n     the Convention to ratify and implement it.\n       (B) Domestic legislation implementing the convention and \n     actions to advance its object and purpose.--A description of \n     the domestic laws enacted by each Party to the Convention \n     that implement commitments under the Convention and actions \n     taken by each Party during the previous year, including \n     domestic law enforcement measures, to advance the object and \n     purpose of the Convention.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n       (C) Progress at the organization of american states on a \n     monitoring process.--An assessment of progress in the \n     Organization of American States (OAS) toward creation of an \n     effective, transparent, and viable Convention compliance \n     monitoring process which includes input from the private \n     sector and non-governmental organizations.\n       (D) Future negotiations.--A description of the anticipated \n     future work of the Parties to the Convention to expand its \n     scope and assess other areas where the Convention could be \n     amended to decrease corrupt activities.\n       (2) Mutual legal assistance.--When the United States \n     receives a request for assistance under Article XIV of the \n     Convention from a country with which it has in force a \n     bilateral treaty for mutual legal assistance in criminal \n     matters, the bilateral treaty will provide the legal basis \n     for responding to that request. In any case of assistance \n     sought from the United States under Article XIV of the \n     Convention, the United States shall, consistent with U.S. \n     laws, relevant treaties and arrangements, deny assistance \n     where granting the assistance sought would prejudice its \n     essential public policy interest, including cases where the \n     Central Authority, after consultation with all appropriate \n     intelligence, anti-narcotic, and foreign policy agencies, has \n     specific information that a senior government official who \n     will have access to information to be provided under the \n     Convention is engaged in a felony, including the facilitation \n     of the production or distribution of illegal drugs.\n       (3) Supremacy of the constitution.--Nothing in the \n     Convention requires or authorizes legislation or other action \n     by the United States of America that is prohibited by the \n     Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6257-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. KYL:\n       S. 2834.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation, to convey property to the Greater \nYuma Port Authority of Yuma County, Arizona, for use as an \ninternational port of entry; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n   Legislation to Convey Land to the Greater Yuma Port Authority for \n  Construction of a Second Commercial Port of Entry for the Yuma Area\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I introduce a bill today to facilitate the \nconstruction of a secondary port of entry in Yuma County. I introduce \nthis measure in collaboration with Representative Ed Pastor, who has \ntaken the lead on this issue in the House of Representatives and has \nseen his bill H.R. 3023, through to passage just this week by a vote of \n404 to 1.\n  The identical bill I introduce today will convey to the Greater Yuma \nPort Authority an area of land currently controlled by the Bureau of \nReclamation for the purpose of constructing a commercial port of entry \non approximately 330 acres of land just east of the city of San Luis.\n  Anyone who has ever been to the U.S. port of entry in San Luis, \nArizona, knows that traffic congestion there causes such bad delays \nthat oftentimes individuals attempting to conduct cross-border trade \nthere, bring goods across the border, or simply visit relatives and \nfriends, are discouraged from crossing the border or are faced with \nspending two to four hours to cross. The port of entry at San Luis has \nbecome one of the busiest ports-of-crossing in the nation.\n  After months of negotiation, all of the local principals involved in \nthis effort, from the city of Yuma to Yuma County, the city of San Luis \nand Somerton and the Cocopah Indian Nation, and the Bureau of \nReclamation, now fully support this effort. The bill will facilitate \nthe construction of an additional commercial port of entry just east of \nSan Luis, to be conveyed to the Greater Yuma Port Authority (YMPO) for \nfair market value.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will make a difference to the people \nof Arizona, particularly to the people of Yuma and surrounding areas. \nIt will help increase cross-border trade in the area, and will help to \nspur economic development for an Arizona region in need. I urge \nexpeditious consideration of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2835. A bill to provide an appropriate transition from the interim \npayment system for home health services to the prospective payment \nsystem for such services under the medicare program; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n              medicare home health refinement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator Feingold of \nWisconsin in introducing the Medicare Home Health Refinement Act of \n2000. I want to thank my colleague for inviting me to join him in this \neffort to preserve our nation's home health providers.\n  In my work as Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, of \nwhich Senator Feingold is a member, I have been monitoring our nation's \ncritical home health care system closely. In 1997, we investigated \ndistressing examples of fraud and abuse among a few home health \nagencies (HHAs). In 1998, I chaired a hearing on the devastating \neffects of the Interim Payment System (IPS) for home health. \nUnfortunately, my legislative efforts to improve the payment system \nthat year were blocked. Last year, the Aging Committee held a hearing \non the new OASIS information collection instrument, and on the burden \nit imposed on home care providers.\n  At this point in 2000, the main challenge facing our system of home \ncare is the new Prospective Payment System (PPS), which will take \neffect on October 1 of this year. We've been working\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\ntoward this for many years, and I am gratified that it will finally \nhappen. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) published the \nfinal PPS rule on June 28, and I was pleased to hear that many home \nhealth providers consider it an improvement over the proposed rule. \nAfter the trauma of the Interim Payment System, I have high hopes that \nthe PPS will be great news for our Medicare beneficiaries who need home \ncare.\n  Even so, the new PPS will pose major transitional challenges for home \nhealth agencies, and this bill seeks to ease that transition so that \nthe PPS will succeed. The bill does the following:\n  1. Emergency cash flow assistance. The bill provides one-time advance \npayments to home health agencies during transition from IPS to PPS. \nEligible agencies either have low cash reserves, have negative cash \nflow under PPS as defined by the Secretary of HHS, or were eligible to \nreceive funds from the Periodic Interim Payment (PIP) system on \nSeptember 30, 2000. Payments equal the average total Medicare costs \nincurred by the agency in a three-month period as reported on the \nagency's most recently settled cost report. Payments would be available \nfor six months and repaid within twelve months.\n  Agencies would also receive 80 percent of the 60-day episode payment \nrate after notifying HCFA of admission, with the remaining 20 percent \ncoming after submission of final episode claim, instead of 60/40 under \nthe rule published on June 28, 2000. HCFA would also be prohibited from \nimposing conditions on a claim based on the status of an earlier claim \nfor the same beneficiary.\n  The rationale for this is that PIP, which largely serves nonprofit, \ncommunity-based agencies with minimal cash reserve, will be \ndiscontinued as of October 1. If PPS delays a substantial portion of \npayment until after termination of patient episode, providers will have \nsignificant cash flow problems. Many agencies are unable to secure \nlines of credit or other loans because of the effect of IPS on cash \nreserves.\n  2. Reimbursement for unfunded PPS-related costs. The bill reimburses \nagencies for technology costs required for PPS compliance, up to $10 \nper beneficiary. Payments would be authorized for Fiscal Years 2001 \nthrough 2003.\n  The rationale for this item: agencies have had to purchase new \nhardware, software, and other technology to comply with new rules. \nThese costs are not reimbursed by Medicare.\n  3. Reimbursement for OASIS labor costs. It reimburses agencies for \nlabor costs associated with OASIS assessments, up to $30 per \nbeneficiary annually. Payments are authorized for FY 2001-2003.\n  This is needed because the final rule provides for only a modest \npayment per episode, despite an estimated hour of time needed for a \nskilled clinician to collect information at admission, plus time for \ndata quality review and follow-up.\n  4. Creation of a fee schedule for non-routine medical supplies. The \nbill develops a separate fee schedule for medical supplies under \nprospective payment.\n  This is essential because PPS rates include the average medical \nsupply cost, but some agencies' patient populations have greater or \nlesser medical supply needs. The original rates would underpay agencies \nthat treat these vulnerable populations and overpay agencies that treat \npatients with low medical supply needs. This provision has no budget \nimpact.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that there are other issues that pose a \nmajor threat to our home care system, including the 15 percent cut \nscheduled for October 2001. This bill does not address that issue, \nthough it is obvious that Congress will have to do so. But this bill \nwill help make the new PPS a success, so home care providers can use \ntheir resources to see patients, which is what they do best. I will \nseek the inclusion of this bill in any Finance Committee Medicare \nprovider package we put together this year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley in \nintroducing the Medicare Home Health Refinement Act of 2000. This \nlegislation will provide a measure of financial relief for cost \nefficient home health agencies that are making the transition from the \nInterim Payment System to the soon to be implemented Prospective \nPayment System.\n  Since the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, many cost-\neffective home health agencies have experienced financial hardship, \nwhich has forced agencies to divert funds away from patient care.\n  We must ensure that home health care agencies can continue to provide \ntheir invaluable service to the elderly and the disabled.\n  As I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties each year, I have \nheard countless stories from home health agencies that a number of \nburdensome new regulations imposed by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration have hindered their ability to do what they do best--\nprovide quality care.\n  Our legislation addresses many of these concerns. In fact, a number \nof the provisions come directly from the providers in Wisconsin.\n  Our bill offers a combination of emergency cash flow assistance, \nreimbursement for transition costs, and a system to separate medical \nsupply costs from other home health expenses as home health agencies \nswitch to a new payment system.\n  Home health care provides compassionate, at-home care to seniors and \npeople with disabilities in cities and towns throughout Wisconsin. \nWithout it, many patients have no choice but to go to a nursing home, \nor even an emergency room, to get the care they need. For too many home \nhealth patients in Wisconsin, that day has arrived.\n  Home health agencies around my state have closed their doors due to \nmassive changes in Medicare, and seniors and the disabled have been \nforced to go elsewhere for care.\n\n\n                        The Balanced Budget Act\n\n  As my colleagues know, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained a \nnumber of measures that were intended to slow home health care \nspending. Congress targeted home health spending due to the fact that \nprior to the Balanced Budget Act, home health care had become the \nfastest growing component of Medicare spending.\n  Unfortunately, the cuts went deeper than anyone anticipated, and have \nleft many Medicare beneficiaries without access to the services they \nneed.\n  These unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have \nbeen severe indeed. Instead of the $100 billion in five-year savings \nthat we targeted, present projections indicate that actual Medicare \nreductions have been in the area of $200 billion. Home health care \nspending, which the Congressional Budget Office expected to rise by $2 \nbillion in the last two years even after factoring in the Balanced \nBudget Act cuts, has instead fallen by nearly 8 billion, or 45 percent.\n  These painful cuts have forced more than 40 home health care agencies \nin 22 Wisconsin counties to close their doors, in just two years.\n  Mr. President, I stand by my vote in favor of the Balanced Budget \nAct. And, like many of my colleagues, I believe that it contained \nmeaningful provisions to balance the budget. I want to emphasize that \nthe goal was to balance the budget--it was not to punish home health \nagencies, and certainly not to deny Medicare beneficiaries access to \nthe home health services they need.\n  The Balanced Budget Act also included a number of burdensome \nadministration changes, and a new reimbursement system for home health \ncare agencies. It required the creation of a Prospective Payment \nSystem, and, until that system was developed an interim payment system.\n  These new rules are forcing agencies to overhaul their computer \nsystems, purchase new software, and fill out more and more forms. Many \nof these agencies already face major cash-flow problems, and are \nrightly concerned that any delays in payments could hurt their ability \nto properly care for beneficiaries.\n\n  With all of the changes, Congress must ensure that these home health \nagencies, which have already been hit hard by payment cuts, have the \nresources they need to provide quality home care to the American public \nin a cost-effective manner.\n\n\n                   rdf's home health care legislation\n\n  My legislation provides for some common sense provisions to ease the \ntransition to the new PPS system.\n  Under the first provision, the Health Care Financing Administration \nwould\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nbe able to provide one-time advance payments to home health agencies \nwhich have been experiencing cash-flow problems. These payments are \ntemporary: agencies would be required to repay them within twelve \nmonths.\n  It also provides some relief to agencies for their compliance with \nthe new regulations and rules. Across the country, home health agencies \nhave had to spend millions of dollars buying new computers and software \nwhich can handle the new PPS. This provision also targets those small \nagencies with a lesser cash flow and are relatively more affected by \nthe burdensome regulations.\n  My bill also includes compensation for agencies who must perform \npatient outcome assessments under the new rules. We should recognize \nthat physicians' time is precious, and that we cannot expect them to \nprovide accurate, helpful data if every hour they spend filling out \nforms is an hour less treatment that the agency can afford to provide.\n  Finally, the bill carves out funding for non-routine medical supplies \nfrom the PPS, so that agencies who treat patients with complex medical \nneeds are not punished with low payments. We must ensure that all \nbeneficiaries have the choice to receive care at home, and not be \nturned down or shut out of the market because agencies are afraid that \nthey'll be too costly to assist.\n  These are sensible changes which go a long way to alleviate the \nburden that the change to the Prospective Payment System has imposed on \nthe agencies. These changes will allow agencies to focus their care on \nMedicare beneficiaries, and reduce their burden as they transition to \nPPS.\n\n\n                             access to care\n\n  In Wisconsin, over 46 Medicare home health providers have shut down \nsince the implementation of Interim Payment System. Still more have \nshrunken their service areas, stopped accepting Medicare patients, or \nrefused assignment for high cost patients because the payments are \nsimply too low.\n  So, what do these changes mean for Medicare beneficiaries? Well, \nquite frankly, in many parts of Wisconsin, beneficiaries in certain \nareas or with certain diagnoses simply don't have access to home health \ncare. The Interim Payment System has created disincentives to treat \npatients with expensive medical diagnoses. Few agencies, if any, can \nafford to care for patients with expensive medical diagnosis.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  I believe that Congress must take a serious look at what refinements \nneed to occur to ensure that our home bound elderly and disabled \nconstituents--among the frailest and most vulnerable people we serve--\ncan receive the services they need.\n  Without that fine-tuning, I am quite certain that more home health \nagencies in Wisconsin and across our country will close, leaving some \nof our frailest Medicare beneficiaries without the choice to receive \ncare at home. Again, I think Seniors need and deserve that choice, and \nI hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Con. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas the Parthenon was built on the hill of the \n     Acropolis at Athens, Greece in the mid-fifth century B.C. \n     under the direction of the Athenian statesman Pericles and \n     the design of the sculptor Phidias.\n       Whereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the \n     artistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the Greek \n     cultural heritage--its art, architecture, and democracy--and \n     of the contributions that modern Greeks and their forefathers \n     have made to civilization;\n       Whereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon's sculptures--now \n     known as the Parthenon Marbles--were removed from the \n     Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 1801 and \n     1816, while Greece was still under Ottoman rule;\n       Whereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including \n     their perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless \n     storage there for many years, greatly endangered the Marbles;\n       Whereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the \n     private home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles to \n     the British Museum only after severe personal economic \n     misfortunes;\n       Whereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an \n     integral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple; the \n     carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are not \n     merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are integral \n     parts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated if all \n     the Parthenon Marbles are reunified;\n       Whereas the Parthenon has served as a place of worship for \n     ancient Greeks, Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and \n     Muslims;\n       Whereas the Parthenon has been adopted by imitation by the \n     United States in many preeminent public buildings, including \n     the Lincoln Memorial;\n       Whereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, \n     democracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of \n     concern not only to Greece but to all the world;\n       Whereas, since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece has \n     sought the return of the Parthenon Marbles;\n       Whereas the return of the Parthenon Marbles would be a \n     profound demonstration by the United Kingdom of its \n     appreciation and respect for the Parthenon and classical art;\n       Whereas, even without considering the legal issues \n     surrounding the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, the United \n     Kingdom should return them in recognition that the Parthenon \n     is part of the cultural heritage of the entire world and, as \n     such, should be made whole;\n       Whereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Marbles \n     equal or superior to the care provided by the British Museum, \n     especially considering the irreparable harm caused by \n     attempts by the museum to remove the original color and \n     patina of the marbles with abrasive cleaners;\n       Whereas Greece is constructing a new, permanent museum to \n     house all the Marbles, protected from the elements and in \n     full view of the Acropolis;\n       Whereas Greece and various international committees have \n     pledged to work with the British government to negotiate \n     mutually agreeable conditions for the return of the Parthenon \n     Marbles;\n       Whereas the people of the United Kingdom do not have an \n     ancient bond to the Parthenon Marbles, given that the Marbles \n     have been in London for less than 200 years of the over 2,430 \n     year history of the Parthenon was built, and as evidenced by \n     a 1998 poll in which only 15 percent of the Britons polled \n     recalled having seen the Marbles in the British Museum;\n       Whereas the British people support the return of the \n     Parthenon Marbles, as reflected in several recent polls;\n       Whereas a resolution signed by a majority of members of the \n     European Parliament urged the British government to return \n     the Parthenon Marbles to their natural setting in Greece;\n       Whereas the British House of Commons Select Committee on \n     Culture, Media and Sport is to be commended for examining the \n     issue of the disposition of the Parthenon Marbles in hearings \n     held this year;\n       Whereas returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece would be \n     a gesture of good will on the part of the British Parliament, \n     and would in no way affect the disposition of other objects \n     in museums around the world;

Mr. President, today Senators Dodd, Leahy, Mack, and I \nare introducing a resolution on police reform in Northern Ireland.\n  Policing has long been a contentious issue in Northern Ireland. The \ndeep historical divisions in Northern Ireland have, according to the \nApril 19, 1998 Good Friday Agreement, made policing ``highly emotive, \nwith great hurt suffered and sacrifices made by many individuals and \ntheir families.''\n  The Good Friday Agreement presented an historic opportunity to create \na new police service that is accountable, impartial, representative, \nbased on respect for human rights, and that works in constructive \npartnership with the entire community. It provided for the \nestablishment of an Independent Commission on Policing to make \nrecommendations for Northern Ireland, including ways to encourage \nwidespread community support for the police. The Commission, chaired by \nSir Christopher Patten, concluded its work on September 9, 1999, and \nissued a final report with 175 recommendations to ensure a new \nbeginning for policing in Northern Ireland.\n  On May 5, a joint letter by the British Prime Minister and the Irish \nPrime Minister stated that ``legislation to implement the Patten report \nwill, subject to Parliament, be enacted by November 2000.'' On May 16, \nthe British Government published its proposed legislation to implement \nin law the Patten report.\n  Unfortunately, the draft bill does not live up to the letter or \nspirit of the Patten report. It dilutes or does not implement many of \nits key recommendations. Northern Ireland's main nationalist parties \nand representatives of the Catholic Church are deeply concerned about \nthe proposed legislation, and they have indicated that they will not \nparticipate or encourage participation in the new policing structures \nunless the Patten report is fully implemented. I ask unanimous consent \nthat documents outlining concerns with the draft legislation may be \nincluded in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, has \nrecognized that the bill ``will need fine\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\ntuning'' as it proceeds through the Parliament. On June 15, he said, \n``I remain absolutely determined to implement the Patten \nrecommendations and to achieve the effective and representative \npolicing service--accepted in every part of Northern Ireland--that his \nreport aimed to secure.''\n  The resolution we are introducing today expresses the Sense of the \nSenate that the full and speedy implementation of the recommendations \nof the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland holds \nthe best hope of ensuring that the police service in Northern Ireland \nwill gain the support of both nationalists and unionists and that \n``policing structures and arrangements are such that the police service \nis fair and impartial, free from partisan political control, \naccountable . . . to the community it serves, representative of the \nsociety that it polices . . . [and] complies with human rights norms,'' \nas mandated by the Good Friday Agreement. It calls upon the British \nGovernment to fully and faithfully implement the recommendations \ncontained in the Patten Commission report.\n  The Patten report explicitly ``warned in the strongest terms against \ncherry-picking from this report or trying to implement some major \nelements of it in isolation from others.'' Section 405 of the Foreign \nRelations Authorization Act (as enacted in the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act for FY2000, P.L. 106-113) requires President Clinton \nto certify that the British and Irish governments are committed to \nassisting in the full implementation of the Patten recommendations \nbefore the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other federal law \nenforcement agency can provide training for the Royal Ulster \nConstabulary. It would be extremely unfortunate if the shortcomings in \nthe policing bill prevent President Clinton from making this \ncertification.\n  Police reform is essential in Northern Ireland to ensure fairness and \nto strengthen the peace process. The Patten report has the potential to \ncreate a genuine new police service that will have and deserve the \ntrust of all the people in Northern Ireland. It would be a tragedy if \nthis opportunity to achieve a new beginning in policing is lost. I urge \nthe Senate to approve this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        What a Travesty--Police Bill Is Just a Parody of Patten\n\n                          (By Brendan O'Leary)\n\n       There are two ways in which the Police (Northern Ireland) \n     Bill before Parliament should be read. The first is to check \n     whether as promised by the Prime Minister, the Secretary of \n     State, and the accompanying Explanatory Notes issued by the \n     Northern Ireland Office it effectively implements the report \n     of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern \n     Ireland, and thereby is consistent with the terms of the \n     Belfast Agreement. The second is to assess whether the Bill \n     will provide policing arrangements that are appropriate to a \n     democratic state, and that will stabilize Northern Ireland.\n       My assessment is negative on both counts. The Bill \n     therefore requires radical amendment by the friends of the \n     Belfast Agreement in Parliament, and if these radical \n     amendments are not made I believe it is essential that \n     genuine supporters of the Agreement should vote against this \n     Bill becoming law. It does not implement the Patten Report: \n     What it implements is a slightly re-worked version of the \n     Police (Northern Ireland) Act of 1998, with half-hearted nods \n     in the direction of Patten. It is not just not good enough; \n     in some respects it is worse than the status quo.\n       The Patten Report, by contrast, met its terms of reference \n     under the Belfast Agreement. Eight criteria were either \n     explicitly or implicitly mandated for the commissioner, I \n     shall compare these directly with what is offered in the Bill \n     before Parliament.\n\n\n                              impartiality\n\n       The first term of reference for Patten and his \n     commissioners was to recommend how to create a widely \n     acceptable ``impartial'' service. The Commission chose to \n     avoid proposing an explicitly bi-national or bi-cultural \n     police. Instead it plumped for neutral impartiality between \n     unionism/localism and nationalism/republicanism. Its \n     preference, the Northern Ireland Police Service (NIPS), was a \n     neutral title, not least because nationalists in the 1998 \n     referendum, North and South, overwhelmingly accepted the \n     current status of Northern Ireland as part of the UK, as long \n     as a majority so determine. The RUC was not a neutral title, \n     so it was recommended to go, period. The codes of police \n     officers and their future training were to reflect a \n     commitment to impartiality and respect for democratic \n     unionism/loyalism and democratic nationalism/republicanism. \n     The display of the Union flag and the portrait of the Queen \n     at police stations were recommended to go to dissociate the \n     police from identification with the Union, the Crown and the \n     British nation. In Patten's words symbols should be ``free \n     from association with the British or Irish states''.\n       Patten's recommendations for a territory that is primarly \n     divided into two communities that are of almost equal size \n     but that have rival national allegiances were entirely \n     sensible. They flowed straightforwardly from the Belfast \n     Agreement's commitment to establishing ``parity of esteem'' \n     between the national traditions, and the British government's \n     commitment to ``rigorous impartiality'' in its \n     administration.\n       The Bill proposes that the Secretary of State be given the \n     power to decide on the issues of name and emblems at some \n     point in the future, not a stay of execution, but a stay of \n     decision. The Bill does not deal with these matters as Patten \n     recommended, and this must be corrected as the Bill makes its \n     way through Parliament. It would not be a recipe for re-\n     igniting conflict, and a gift to republican dissidents, if \n     the Secretary of State were to opt, when he makes his \n     decision, to retain the name of the RUC as part of the \n     reformed police's working title.\n       A title such as the ``Police Service of Northern Ireland \n     incorporating the RUC whose long-serving members are not \n     required to take the new oath of service'', would be a \n     mockery, replacing the virtues of political compromise with \n     surrender to blackmail.\n\n\n                   ``Representative'' Police service\n\n       Patten's second term of reference was to establish a \n     ``representative'' police service. The commissioners proposed \n     recruiting Catholics and non-Catholics in a 50:50 ratio from \n     the pool of qualified candidates for the next ten years. This \n     matches the population ratios in the younger age-cohorts. On \n     their model--given early and scheduled retirements of serving \n     officers--this policy would ensure that 30 percent of the \n     service would be of Catholic origin by year 10, and between \n     17 percent and 19 percent within four years (above the \n     critical mass of 15 percent that they claimed is necessary to \n     change the police's character). This is a significantly \n     slower pace of change than some of us advocated, but the \n     commissioners justified it because they wished to avoid a \n     service that would have non-Catholic Chiefs and Catholic \n     Indians. By intending to make each successive cohort \n     religiously representative now, and by ensuring that the \n     new service would be seen as impartial, the commissioners \n     had an arguable case. Steps would, of course, still need \n     to be taken to ensure that the new Catholics are broadly \n     representative of the Catholic community--i.e. mostly \n     nationalist or republican in political opinion. There \n     would also need to be sufficient secondments from the \n     Garda Siochana and elsewhere to ensure a representative \n     array of senior police of Catholic origin.\n       The Police Bill makes a mockery of these recommendations. \n     The period in which the police are to be recruited on a 50:50 \n     basis has been reduced to three years, with any extension \n     requiring a decision by the Secretary of State.\n       The Bill is completely silent on aggregation, the policy \n     proposed by Patten for dealing with years in which there \n     might be a shortfall in the recruitment of suitably qualified \n     cultural Catholics, and it is also dangerously silent on \n     targeting. The Bill does not even make clear whether the \n     Government will explicitly do what is necessary to meet the \n     ``critical mass'' identified by Patten.\n       As drafted it is a recipe for minute change, that on \n     current demographic trends will ensure that a shrinking \n     minority of men of unionist disposition will police a growing \n     minority of nationalist disposition.\n\n\n                  free from partisan political control\n\n       A third term of reference required Patten to propose \n     policing arrangements ``free from partisan control.''\n       The Commission's task was to ensure democratic \n     accountability of policing ``at all levels'' while preventing \n     any dominant political party from being able to direct the \n     police to their advantage. The proposed Policing Board was to \n     meet this objective. On Patten's model it would represent \n     members from political parties present in the Executive, \n     according to the d'Hondt rule of proportional allocation. The \n     District Policing Partnership Boards (DPPBs) should also have \n     met this objective--twenty out of twenty six local government \n     districts now have office-rotation or power-sharing \n     agreements.\n       Those seeking to amend the Bill should consider formally \n     extending the d'Hondt principle to party representatives on \n     the DPPBs a step entirely consistent with the Agreement.\n       The Bill thwarts Patten on the criterion of avoiding \n     partisan control. By introducing a requirement that the \n     Policing Board operate according to a weighted majority when \n     recommending an inquiry it effectively re-establishes \n     partisan unionist control. On Patten's model, ten members of \n     the Policing Board would come from the parties in the current \n     Executive--currently five nationalists and five unionists, \n     and the other nine would have been nominated by the First \n     Minister and Deputy First Ministers, which would likely and \n     reasonably imply a slight majority broadly of unionist \n     disposition--a reflection of Northern Ireland society. Under\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\n     the model proposed in the Bill, the nine appointed members \n     will, in the first instance, be appointed by the Secretary of \n     State, not foreseen by Patten. But even if this produces the \n     same outcomes as joint nominations from the First and Deputy \n     First Ministers the Bill's proposed weighted majority rule \n     will give unionists and unionist approved members a blocking \n     minority on matters as fundamental as pursuing reasonable \n     inquiries into allegations about police misconduct or \n     incompetence.\n       This is a direct violation of the terms of reference of the \n     Agreement.\n\n\n                    efficient and effective policing\n\n       A fourth criterion set for Patten was to promote \n     ``efficient and effective'' policing arrangements. Here the \n     commissioners scored highly. They deliberately avoided false \n     economies. Generous severance and early retirement packages \n     were to ease quite fast changes in the composition and ethos \n     of the current personnel. They reasoned that an over-sized \n     police service could fulfill the following tasks:\n       Begin a novel and far-reaching experiment in community \n     policing;\n       Deter hard-line paramilitaries opposed to the Agreement, \n     and those tempted to return to active combat;\n       Manage large-scale public order functions (mostly \n     occasioned by the Loyal Orders); and\n       Facilitate faster changes in the services' religious and \n     gender composition than might otherwise be possible.\n       The provisions enabling local governments to experiment and \n     out-source policing services were also designed to ``market-\n     test'' effectiveness, while the steps recommended to produce \n     greater ``civilianisation'' were to free personnel for \n     mainstream policing tasks and deliver long-run savings.\n       The Bill is multiply at odds with Patten on efficiency and \n     effectiveness. It fails to provide a clearly effective system \n     of accountability, which means that existing inefficiencies \n     will continue to flourish, and ineffectiveness will be \n     overlooked. The Secretary of State is, bizarrely, \n     empowered to prevent an inquiry by the Policing Board if \n     it is deemed not to be in the interests of efficiency and \n     the effectiveness of the police as if the prime activity \n     of a Board which requires a weighted majority to start an \n     enquiry will be to embark on wasteful investigations! The \n     Secretary of State, and not the Policing Board, is charged \n     with setting targets and performance indicators for the \n     police a recipe for producing an ineffective Board, `not \n     the strong independent and powerful Board' that Patten \n     recommended. The full-time reserve, which Patten \n     recommended should be disbanded, in the interests of \n     efficiency and promoting fast changes in composition, is, \n     so far as I can tell, left on a statutory basis in the \n     Bill. And the District Policing Partnership Boards have \n     been eviscerated because of propaganda about \n     paramilitaries on the rates. It is simply amazing that \n     grown-up people could accuse Christopher Patten, an \n     intelligent Tory, of signing a report to subsidize \n     paramilitarism; but it is perhaps more amazing that the \n     Government can present this Bill as a text to implement \n     the Patten Report.\n\n\n                          human rights culture\n\n       A fifth term of reference which Patten had to meet was \n     policing arrangements infused with a human rights culture. \n     Patten's commissioners did their job. It is proposed that new \n     and serving officers would have knowledge of human rights \n     built into their training and re-training (provided by non-\n     police personnel) and their codes of practice. The \n     astonishing absence of legal personnel within the RUC with \n     expertise in human rights was singled out for remedy. The \n     incorporation of the European Convention into UK public law, \n     and Northern Ireland's own forthcoming special provisions to \n     strengthen the rights of national, religious and cultural \n     minorities, were welcomed as likely to ensure that policing \n     and legal arrangements have to perform to higher standards \n     than in the past, but other international norms were also \n     held out as benchmarks: `compliance * * * with international \n     human rights standards and norms are * * * an important \n     safeguard both to the public and to police officers carrying \n     out their duties' (Patten, para: 5.17). Patten, para: 5.17). \n     Patten's proposed steps for normalizing the police dissolving \n     the special branch into criminal investigations, and \n     demilitarising the police in step with hoped-for \n     decommissioning, also met the human rights objectives of the \n     Agreement.\n       The Police Bill on this criterion, as in others is almost a \n     parody of the Patten Report. The Bill restricts the new oath, \n     which includes a commitment to human rights to new officers. \n     It incorporates no standards of rights protection higher than \n     that in the European Convention. It places responsibility for \n     a Code of Ethics not with the Policing Board, but with the \n     Chief Constable, who is not obligated to consult the new \n     Human Rights Commission on its content. The Bill explicitly \n     excludes Patten's proposed requirement that an oath of \n     service `respect the traditions and beliefs' of people. The \n     Policing Board cannot inquire into past police misconduct, \n     and the Secretary of State is empowered to prevent the \n     Ombudsman from so doing.\n       This was a sixth criterion that Patten had a meet; the \n     Commission's terms of reference included `at all levels'. \n     Accountable decentralisation was proposed through giving \n     directly elected local governments opportunities to influence \n     the policy formulation of the Policing Board though their own \n     District Policing Partnership Boards. The latter would not \n     merely have had the power to question police district \n     commanders but would have the ability to use their own \n     resources to `purchase additional services from the police or \n     statutory agencies, or from the private sector'.\n       The Patten Report sensibly also commended significant \n     internal decentralisation within the police, stripping away \n     redundant layers of management to free up district commanders \n     to deliver sensitive policing according to local needs. \n     Better still, Patten recommended matching police internal \n     management units to local government districts.\n       The Bill maintains centralisation in three ways. First, it \n     gives power to the Secretary of State that Patten intended \n     should be immediately devolved to the First and Deputy First \n     Ministers. Secondly, the Bill weakens Patten's \n     recommendations regarding decentralisation to district \n     councils and gives the Secretary of State the right to issue \n     instructions to the DPPBs.\n       Patten recommended that these be able to contribute up to \n     the `equivalent of a rate of 3p in the pound' to pay for \n     extra policing services to meet their distinctive needs. This \n     provision is not in the Bill. Thirdly, Patten was committed \n     to the establishment of neighborhood policing: that every \n     neighborhood should have a dedicated policing team, that its \n     officers have their names and the names of their neighborhood \n     displayed on their uniforms, and that they should serve 3-5 \n     years in the same neighborhood. The Bill contains no such \n     provisions.\n\n\n                       Democratic accountability\n\n       The seventh and perhaps the most important criterion that \n     Patten and his commissioners had to meet was `democratic \n     accountability'.\n       Patten's subject was `policing Northern Ireland' not `the \n     police in Northern Ireland'. Policing should not be the \n     monopoly of a police force, as it is called throughout this \n     Bill, or indeed of a service, as Patten commended. Policing \n     should be organized in a self-governing democratic society by \n     a plurality of agents and organizations, indeed by a network \n     of such organisations. It should not be exclusively the \n     responsibility of a monolithic, centralised, line-\n     hierarchy, detached and apart from the rest of society. \n     Ultimate responsibility for the security of persons and \n     property in society should remain with citizens and their \n     representatives. This logic was apparent in the title and \n     proposed organisation of the proposed `Policing Board' \n     that was recommended to replace the present entirely \n     unelected Police Authority which, despite its name, has no \n     authority and even less legitimacy. The Board, as \n     emphasised, was to bring together ten elected politicians \n     drawn in proportion to their representative strength in \n     seats, from the parties that comprise the new Executive \n     with nine appointed members, representative of a range of \n     sectors of civil society, `business, trade unions, \n     voluntary organisations, community groups and the legal \n     profession'.\n       The elected members cannot be ministerial office-holders. \n     The unelected members (under a devolved government) were to \n     be appointed by the First and Deputy Ministers.\n       The Board was therefore envisaged as broadly \n     representative, in both its elected and unelected members, \n     and at one remove from direct executive power so that it was \n     less likely to become the mere instrument of ministers.\n       A similar logic lay behind Patten's proposal to give the \n     Board responsibility for negotiating the annual policing \n     budget with the Northern Ireland Office, or with the \n     appropriate successor body after devolution'.\n       The Report, contrary to what scaremongers and the right-\n     wing press suggested, was not intended to destroy the \n     operational responsibility of the police, or indeed to party-\n     politicise its management. It was intended to let police \n     managers manage, but to hold them, post-factum, to account \n     for their implementation of the Policing Board's general \n     policing policy, and to enhance the audit and investigative \n     capacities of the Board in holding the police to account for \n     their implementation, financial and otherwise, of the Board's \n     policy.\n       In the Patten Report's vision the police should become \n     fully part of a self-governing democratic society, \n     transparently accountable to its representatives, rather than \n     a potentially self-serving, unaccountable group of budget \n     maximisers, mission-committed to their own conceptions of \n     good policing. The new service would have `operational \n     responsibility' but would have to justify its uses of its \n     managerial discretion.\n       What, by comparison with the Patten Report, is in the Bill? \n     Proposals to strengthen the Secretary of State, to strengthen \n     the powers of the Chief Constable, to weaken the new Policing \n     Board from its inception, and to return policing to the \n     police rather than have policing pressurised by and organized \n     by a network of mutually supportive agencies.\n       The Chief Constable has powers of refusal to respond to \n     reasonable requests by the Board. The Secretary of State, not \n     the Board, sets targets and performance indicators. The Board \n     cannot inquire into the past, and is more or less prevented \n     from making into inquiries into police misconduct or \n     incompetence in the future. The Board's role in budgetary \n     planning is, so far as I can tell, downgraded into that of \n     being a lobbying group for the Chief Constable.\n       The Board is in fact so weakened that the old Policing \n     Authority has quite correctly condemned the Bill--a response \n     no one would\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\n     have predicted when the Prime Minister and the Secretary of \n     State welcomed the Patten Report.\n       The Ombudsman, the Equality Commission and the Human Rights \n     Commission have no appropriate free-ranging rights of access \n     to policing documentation. The Chief Constable is not even \n     required as a measure of transparency to declare his staff's \n     individual participation in secret societies.\n\n\n                         meeting the agreement?\n\n       Lastly, the Patten Report and the Bill were supposed to be \n     consistent with the letter and the spirit of the Belfast \n     Agreement. Patten's Report definitely met its terms of \n     reference. The Bill does not. It is incompatible with `parity \n     of esteem', `rigorous impartiality' by the UK government, and \n     the objectives set for policing in the Agreement. The Bill \n     does not in its unamended form represent the promised `new \n     beginning'. It does not `recognise the full and equal \n     legitimacy and worth of the identities, senses of allegiance \n     and ethos of all sections of the community'. It will not \n     produce a `service [that] is effective and efficient, fair \n     and impartial, free from partisan political control; \n     accountable . . . representative of the society it polices . \n     . . which conforms with human rights norms'. It will not \n     encourage `widespread community support' (all quotations from \n     the text of the Agreement). It has been seen through and \n     condemned by the SDLP, the Women's Coalition, the Catholic \n     Church in Ireland, the Committee on the Administration of \n     Justice, the Ombudsman, the existing Police Authority, the \n     Irish Government, and President Clinton, as well as by Sinn \n     Fein. The Bill is a provocation, a fundamental breach of \n     faith, perfidious Britannia in caricature.\n       So what does the Bill represent? It represents Old Britain. \n     It has been drafted by the forces of conservatism, for the \n     forces of conservatism. It is a slightly smudged and fudged \n     facsimile of the 1998 Act. Unamended it will ensure that \n     neither the SDLP of Sinn Fein will sit on the Policing Board, \n     or recommend their constituents * * *\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Crucial Role for the Church on Policing\n\n                         (By Fr. Tim Bartlett)\n\n       The Catholic Church has a crucial role to play in the \n     debate about policing. On the one hand it represents the \n     religious tradition of those who are most under-represented \n     in the current provision of policing while at the same time, \n     as a specifically religious institution, it exists and \n     operates outside the confines of constitutional politics. As \n     the trustee of Catholic schools and of numerous youth \n     organisations it is also in a unique position to influence \n     that specific group which will have to be encouraged to join \n     the police service if the huge religious and cultural \n     imbalance within policing is to be redressed, that is--young \n     Catholics.\n       The Independent Commission on Policing openly acknowledged \n     this pivotal role of the Church in regard to recruitment. It \n     appealed directly to bishops, priests and school teachers to \n     . . . take steps to remove all discouragements to members of \n     their communities applying to join the police, and make it a \n     priority to encourage them to apply. (15.2)\n       While acknowledging that they did have a role to play, the \n     Catholic bishops were equally clear in their response. The \n     responsibility for removing those things which discourage \n     Catholics from joining the police service rests, first and \n     foremost, with the police service itself and not with the \n     Church or community leaders.\n       Drawing on their consultations with young Catholics in \n     schools, with school principals and clergy, with lay people \n     and legal professionals, the Catholic bishops were crystal \n     clear about what this would require--an end to the partisan \n     political and cultural domination of policing by one side of \n     the community, greater accountability and a clear commitment \n     to human rights in all aspects of policing. This in turn \n     would require the removal of all those things which are not \n     essential to effective, professional policing but which \n     continue to present a serious obstacle to recruitment among \n     the vast majority of young Catholics. This included those \n     aspects of current policing, such as the name and badge, \n     which require most young Catholics to forego their legitimate \n     political and cultural allegiances and to submit to an ethos \n     and a culture which is not only unfamiliar but also \n     frequently hostile. As one young Catholic put it, ``How would \n     a young Conservative in England feel if, in order to pursue a \n     career in the police, they had to join new Labour?''.\n       As a result of their consultations, the bishops concluded, \n     and made clear to the government, that the only way of \n     encouraging a sufficient number of young Catholics to join \n     the police service was to implement the Patten Report in \n     full.\n       Many people who wanted no change to the cultural domination \n     of policing by unionism were quick to accuse the bishops of \n     promoting `green agenda', or of joining a `pan-nationalist \n     front', totally ignoring the fact that no one, including the \n     bishops, had suggested that the unionist domination of \n     policing should be exchanged for a nationalist one. What was \n     being proposed was a vision of a pluralist police service for \n     a pluralist society. The issue was not one of religious \n     affiliation as such, but of the right of all citizens to a \n     neutral working environment, to pursue a career in the noble \n     profession of policing without having to subjugate \n     legitimate political, cultural or religious convictions to \n     an exaggerated Unionist ethos which has nothing to do with \n     professional policing.\n       Those unionist spokesmen on policing who were disappointed \n     with the Catholic Church's position decided to react by \n     employing an offensive distinction in their public statements \n     between what they now call ``reasonable'' Catholics and \n     ``unreasonable'' Catholics, the latter of course referring to \n     that overwhelming majority of Catholics who do not subscribe \n     to a unionist point of view. Apart from labelling the vast \n     majority of Catholics, including the Catholic bishops as \n     ``unreasonable'', something which affirms the presence of an \n     underlying ethnic superiority within unionism, those who \n     support a continued unionist possession of policing also \n     decided to ``spin'' a number of statistical findings about \n     Catholics and policing.\n       The rate of Catholic applications we were told had risen to \n     20 percent since the ceasefires. This was heralded as proof \n     that the main obstacle to Catholic recruitment to the RUC had \n     been the existence of a paramilitary threat. What was \n     conveniently ignored, however, was the fact that a 20 percent \n     application rate was merely a return to the level of \n     application which had existed prior to the troubles. Even \n     then, without the existence of a paramilitary threat for \n     almost 50 years, the maximum level of participation in \n     policing by Catholics for any sustained period was never more \n     than 12 percent.\n       We were also told the results of a survey by the Police \n     Authority on issues such as the name and the badge. \n     Interestingly the Police Authority Report itself points out \n     that we must always be cautious about the way in which we \n     interpret and use opinion survey findings (p. 42). Even more \n     interestingly, several important aspects of this survey have \n     been conveniently ignored by those who oppose a pluralist \n     ethos in policing. One is the fact that in regard to the \n     proposed change of name the survey did not ask Catholics \n     whether they agreed or disagreed with a change of name--it \n     simply asked if this would lead to an increase in support for \n     policing. This question was asked, however, in relation to \n     the slightly less contentious issue of the badge. Here, when \n     asked whether they agreed or disagreed with a change of the \n     symbolism associated with the badge over 71% of Catholics \n     agreed that the badge should be changed. This did not include \n     the additional 19% who neither agreed nor disagreed. What \n     this indicated clearly, but which is not admitted by those \n     who published the report, is that there was overwhelming \n     evidence of support in the Catholic community for a change to \n     the symbols and ethos of the RUC.\n       The second major weakness of the survey was that it did not \n     focus on the opinions of those who are most relevant to the \n     issue of recruitment. that is--young Catholics--most notably \n     those between 14 and 26 years of age. Principals of \n     Catholic schools, leaders of Catholic youth clubs and \n     clergy who were asked by the bishops about these issues \n     were very clear about the opinion of this age group, in \n     regard to the sectarian bias of the RUC and the need to \n     change the name and symbols if the recruitment of young \n     Catholics in sufficient numbers was to become a \n     possibility. The Police Authority survey did not take \n     account of the views of this important group.\n       At the end of the day the proverbial ``dogs in the street'' \n     know that the most serious obstacle to the recruitment of \n     young Catholics remains the unapologetic and ongoing effort \n     of the unionist community to dominate policing and to \n     obstruct the pluralist and community based ethos proposed by \n     the Patten Report. The failure of the secretary of state to \n     remain faithful to key elements of the Patten Report in the \n     current Policing Bill and his willingness to subject a \n     fundamental issue of cycle justice--the right to \n     representative policing--to the ``spin and win'' of politics, \n     has provided one of the greatest ``obstacles to \n     encouragement'' for young Catholics to have emerged in recent \n     years. In this context any appeal to the Catholic Church to \n     `. . . make it a priority to encourage Catholics to join' is \n     unlikely to be taken up by Church leaders. If the government \n     and the unionist community does have the recruitment of young \n     Catholics as a priority, what hope has the Catholic Church?\n       If we are to achieve the new beginning to policing made \n     possible through the independent adjudication of this issue \n     by an independent commission, then it is time for the \n     unionist tradition to let go of its cultural possession of \n     policing and to acknowledge the real pain, suffering and \n     sectarian bias which many Catholics have experienced, and \n     continue to experience, at the hands of the RUC. It is time \n     for the British government to acknowledge that most Catholics \n     have been ``locked out'' of policing for the last 80 years \n     because of their legitimately held political and cultural \n     beliefs and that in a pluralist society this cannot continue \n     to be the case.\n       The Catholic Church as gone to great lengths, in recent \n     months, to pay tribute to the RUC and to acknowledge the \n     great price that RUC officers have paid in the effort to \n     maintain stability and peace. Apart from their various public \n     statements, the decision by Archbishop Brady to attend the \n     George Cross award ceremony was a courageous and public \n     acknowledgement by the Catholic bishops that the future of \n     policing, indeed of our whole society depends on giving due \n     recognition to the suffering and sacrifice which has been \n     part of our collective past. What a pity then that, as yet, \n     Protestant Church leaders, unionist politicians and the \n     British government in the current Policing Bill,\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\n     have not found it possible to offer any similar reassurance \n     to the Catholic community about the commitment of the \n     Unionist-British tradition to the ``new beginning to \n     policing'' promised by the Belfast agreement. Such \n     reassurances, from such voices, while surprising, would \n     certainly be a welcome change.\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nKennedy, Dodd, and Mack in introducing this resolution on police reform \nin Northern Ireland.\n  Police reform is necessary in Northern Ireland to guarantee fairness \nand to advance the peace process.\n  Our resolution expresses the Sense of the Senate that the full and \nspeedy implementation of the Patten Commission's recommendations on \nreforming the police service in Northern Ireland holds the promise of \nensuring that the police service will gain the support of both \nnationalists and unionists. It calls on the British Government to fully \nand faithfully implement the recommendations included in the Patten \nCommission report. It also commends the parties to the Good Friday \nAgreement for progress to date in implementing all aspects of the Good \nFriday Agreement and urges them to move expeditiously to complete the \nimplementation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that documents which raise \nconcerns about police reform legislation be included at the end of my \nremarks. I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Lawyers Committee\n\n\n                                             for Human Rights,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 16, 2000.\n\n     Re Northern Ireland police bill.\n\n     The Rt. Hon. Peter Mandelson,\n     Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland \n         Office, Stormont Castle, Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n       Dear Mr. Mandelson: We are writing to you to convey our \n     continued concern about the proposed Northern Ireland Police \n     Bill. We recognise the difficult choices you face in \n     implementing a comprehensive program of police reform in \n     Northern Ireland. We are aware also of the deep sensitivities \n     surrounding the police issues that cut across religious, \n     racial and political lines. We commend you for the time and \n     attention you have directed to this highly important subject. \n     It is precisely because it is so important that we write to \n     you again following our letter on May 26, to register \n     concerns that arise out of the debate at the Second Reading \n     of the Bill.\n       At the Reading, you emphasised the need to concentrate on \n     ``detail'' and to move away from ``rhetoric'' and \n     ``hyperbole''. We agree, and recognise that this is a \n     critical time to ensure that the legislation accurately \n     embodies the recommendations made by the Patten Commission. \n     However, we take strong exception to your assertion that the \n     ``spirit as well as the letter'' of the Bill you are \n     proposing fully implements the Patten Commission's \n     recommendations. To the contrary, we are greatly concerned \n     that the proposed legislation fails to implement key elements \n     of the Patten Commission's Recommendations especially \n     relating to Police accountability.\n\n\n                  police ombudsman and policing board\n\n       In particular, the legislation significantly curtails the \n     powers of the Police Ombudsman and the Policing Board. In \n     fact, as it now stands, the legislation appears to undermine \n     the very mechanism that the Patten Commission envisaged as \n     necessary for holding the police force and its Chief \n     accountable.\n     a. Police Ombudsman\n       With respect to the power of the Police Ombudsman, the \n     Patten Commission recommended that:\n       ``[The Ombudsman] should exercise the power to initiate \n     inquiries and investigations even if no specific complaint \n     has been received . . . (and) should exercise the right to \n     investigate and comment on police policies and practices, \n     where these are perceived to give rise to difficulties.'' \n     (Recommendation 38).\n       In rejecting both the spirit and the letter of this \n     recommendation, you indicated at the Second Reading that you \n     believed you were right ``to resist the suggestion that the \n     Ombudsman should also have powers to review the policies and \n     practices of the police service.'' You proposed, instead, \n     that she would be able to raise wider issues only in the \n     course of investigating individual complaints.\n       The government's proposal, if accepted, will create a \n     system that would allow the Ombudsman to only address \n     patterns of misconduct by chance. Such an inquiry would only \n     be triggered if a person happens to come forward with an \n     individual complaint that also reveals a wider issue. This is \n     contrary to the Patten Commission's recommendation, and does \n     not seem the most effective way to monitoring police \n     adherence to human rights standards.\n     b. Policing Board\n       In proposing the creation of a police board, the Patten \n     Commission recognised that the Board could only be effective \n     if it were independent and powerful. (see Patten Report, \n     paragraph 6.23). The Commission proposed that the Policing \n     Board have power to initiate inquiries so that it had an \n     alternative mechanisms to ensure accountability, and not be \n     limited to the extreme remedy of calling upon the Chief \n     Constable to retire.\n       In rejecting this recommendation, the proposed legislation \n     bars the Policing Board's ability to inquire into past \n     misconduct and gives the Secretary of State the power to \n     prevent the Ombudsman from doing so. Although we are pleased \n     that you have indicated your initial proposal has ``probably \n     gone too far in the limitations'' imposed on the Policing \n     Board's powers, we are concerned that you appear to still \n     believe that the power to initiate inquiries is `extreme'.\n       We urge you to ensure that the legislation reflects the \n     Patten Commission's major emphasis on the centrality of human \n     rights by granting these monitoring bodies the power proposed \n     by the Commission.\n\n\n                         oversight commissioner\n\n       The new Oversight Commissioner, Mr. Constantine, will have \n     a critically important role in implementing police reform and \n     restructuring. The Patten Commission's Report proposed wide \n     powers and latitude for the Oversight Commissioner. We are \n     pleased that the Commissioner's terms of reference will have \n     a statutory basis, and we look forward to studying the \n     amendments brought forward on this point. We consider it \n     vital that the Oversight Commissioner's mandate relates to \n     his responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the \n     breadth of change envisaged in the Patten Commission's \n     recommendations, and not simply the Implementation Plan. From \n     a cursory reading of the Implementation Plan, it is clear \n     that it rests considerable discretion in the Chief Constable, \n     a constraint that is at odds with the overall approach \n     envisioned by the Patten Report. We strongly urge that the \n     Commission's written terms of reference give him the broadest \n     scope, latitude and independence possible to enable him to \n     effectively carry out his essential mission.\n\n\n                         human rights standards\n\n       Finally, we are concerned that the Bill fails to establish \n     adequate means for incorporating a human rights culture into \n     policing in Northern Ireland. Members of the Patten \n     Commission understood that international norms are important \n     safeguards to both ``the public and to the police officers \n     carrying out their duties.'' (Recommendation 5.17). The \n     Police Bill should reflect this principle at every \n     opportunity--in defining the function of the Police Board, \n     the role of the police, and organising principles of the Code \n     of Ethics.\n       Official accountability is an essential key to building \n     public confidence in a new policing institution in Northern \n     Ireland. I am sure you can appreciate that without this \n     public credibility, all reform efforts will be seriously \n     undermined. You have been presented with a unique opportunity \n     to institute effective and lasting reforms within the police \n     in Northern Ireland which puts a premium on respect for human \n     rights. If successful, the Northern Ireland experience could \n     become a model for other countries around the world embarking \n     on their own path to reform. But success must be built on a \n     legislative framework that ensures the fullest official \n     accountability.\n       We will continue to closely monitor the development of this \n     legislation. We look forward to hearing from you and would \n     welcome the opportunity to meet with you or your \n     representatives to discuss these issues further.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Michael Posner,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Police Bill Looks Set to Render Policing Board Ineffective\n\n       The Police Authority today expressed ``deep concern'' about \n     the new Police (NI) Bill 2000.\n       Authority Chairman Pat Armstrong stressed that although the \n     body was reluctant to criticise new legislation it felt it \n     had no alternative.\n       ``The Police Authority hoped to have been able to give the \n     same broad welcome to this Bill which it gave to the Patten \n     report when it was published.\n       ``We want to see policing in Northern Ireland move forward. \n     Although the main public focus on this legislation so far has \n     been about the name and symbols of the police service, we \n     feel that damaging limitations on the powers of the new \n     Policing Board represent the real meat of the debate.\n       ``The Police Authority has worked vigilantly for the last \n     thirty years to ensure police accountability to the people of \n     Northern Ireland and to protect the police service from \n     political intervention. In doing so we have made no secret of \n     the fact that our powers have always been severely limited by \n     the restrictions imposed on us by successive Secretaries of \n     State.\n       ``We therefore welcomed Patten's proposal and believed it \n     would at long last create a strong, independent and powerful \n     Policing Board for the community at large.\n       ``Worryingly, the early signs in this Bill are that the \n     Secretary of State is trying to curb the powers of this new \n     Board and substantially weaken its credibility before it even \n     gets off the ground.\n       ``While we haven't had the opportunity to analyze the full \n     impact of the Secretary of\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\n     State's proposals, it seems that if the legislation goes \n     through as it stands, the new Policing Board could actually \n     have less power then the current Police Authority--a \n     situation we find ludicrous and totally unacceptable.''\n       ``Police planning and financial control are two key areas \n     where it seems the new Board will have a reduced role, while \n     the Secretary of State enjoys greater influence.\n       ``And where the Board was supposed to get new powers, it \n     seems rigid restrictions have been imposed. On the power to \n     initiate enquiries for example, it is difficult to see how \n     the Board could ever satisfy all the conditions required by \n     the Secretary of State.''\n       ``This is not the first time that Government has attempted \n     to control policing in Northern Ireland. In our original \n     submission to the Patten Commission we catalogued consistent \n     attempts by the Government over the years to suppress the \n     powers of the Police Authority.\n       ``Successive Authorities have resisted such attempts by \n     Government to directly influence policing and we will \n     continue to do so in guarding against any weakening of the \n     powers envisaged by Patten for the new Policing Board. The \n     Patten report itself stated, `we do not believe the Secretary \n     of State . . . should ever appear to have the power to direct \n     the police.'--this obviously signalled a clear intention on \n     the Commission's part to curtail the powers of Government--\n     not enhance them as the proposed legislation seems set to \n     do.''\n       Mr. Armstrong however said the Authority supported much of \n     the legislation including the apparent safeguards put in \n     place to prevent District Policing Partnerships raising money \n     for `freelance' police services. He added that more time \n     would be needed to examine all the issues in detail.\n       The Authority will shortly publish an in-depth analysis of \n     the Government's proposed Patten legislation and \n     implementation plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6266-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6266-S6284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              DEPARTMENT OF LABOR APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 COLLINS (AND REED) AMENDMENT NO. 3700\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for Ms. Collins (for herself and Mr. Reed)) proposed an \namendment to the bill (H.R. 4577) making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 34, on line 13, before the colon, insert the \n     following: ``, of which $10,000,000 shall be used to provide \n     grants to local non-profit private and public entities to \n     enable such entities to develop and expand activities to \n     provide substance abuse services to homeless individuals''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 KERREY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3701\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for Mr. Kerrey (for himself, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Enzi)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 68, line 2, before the colon, insert the following: \n     ``, of which $250,000 shall be for the Web-Based Education \n     Commission''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COLLINS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3702\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for Ms. Collins (for herself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Robb, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. Reed)) proposed an \namendment to the bill, H.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 24, line 1, strike ``and''.\n       On page 24 line 7, insert before the colon the following; \n     ``, and of which $4,000,000 shall be provided to the Rural \n     Health Outreach Office of the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration for the awarding of grants to community \n     partnerships in rural areas for the purchase of automated \n     external defibrillators and the training of individuals in \n     basic cardiac life support''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      JEFFORDS AMENDMENT NO. 3703\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for Mr. Jeffords) proposed an amendment to the bill, \nH.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 43, line 9, before the colon, insert the follow: \n     ``, of which 5,000,000 shall be available for activities \n     regarding medication management, screening, and education to \n     prevent incorrect medication and adverse drug reactions''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SPECTER AMENDMENT NO. 3704\n\n  Mr. SPECTER proposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. 4577, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 50, line 20, after the dash insert the following: \n     ``Except as provided by subsection (e)''.\n       On page 51, line 1 strike ``December 15, 2000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof: ``March 1, 2001''.\n       On page 52, line 2, strike ``2000'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``2001''.\n       On page 52, after line 2, insert the following new section\n       ``(e) Territories.--None of the funds appropriated by this \n     Act may be used to withhold substance abuse funding pursuant \n     to section 1926 from a territory that receives less than \n     $1,000,000.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GRAHAM AMENDMENT NO. 3705\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HARKIN (for Mr. Graham) proposed an amendment to the bill, H.R. \n4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 54, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

While Congress intended to cut approximately \n     $100,000,000,000 from the medicare program over 5 years, \n     recent estimates put the actual cut at over $200,000,000,000.\n       (2) A recent study on home health care found that nearly 70 \n     percent of hospital discharge planners surveyed reported a \n     greater difficulty obtaining home health services for \n     medicare beneficiaries as a result of the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997.\n       (3) According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \n     rural hospitals were disproportionately affected by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, dropping the inpatient margins \n     of such hospitals over 4 percentage points in 1998.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress and the President should act expeditiously to \n     alleviate the adverse impacts of the Balanced Budget Act of\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\n     1997 on beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act and health care providers \n     participating in such program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TORRICELLI (AND REED) AMENDMENT NO. 3726\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for Mr. Torricelli (for himself and Mr. Reed)) proposed \nan amendment to the bill, H.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n       Sec. __.

ALLOCATION OF FUNDS FOR THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION \n                   OF A BALKANS STABILIZATION CONFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Balkans Peace and Prosperity Act of 2000''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Dayton Peace Accords and the cease-fire agreement \n     that concluded Operation Allied Force in Kosovo halted \n     Serbian aggression toward its neighbors and its own people.\n       (2) Efforts to restore the economy and political structure \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina have achieved limited success in \n     accordance with the Dayton Agreement.\n       (3) Similar efforts in Kosovo continue with very limited \n     success one year after the conclusion of Operation Allied \n     Force in June 1999.\n       (4) The Dayton Agreement explicitly left certain issues \n     unresolved, including but not limited to the status of the \n     city of Breko and other matters.\n       (5) Progress toward democratization and economic prosperity \n     in both Bosnia and Kosovo is often hampered by continuing \n     disputes among local authorities and between local \n     authorities and the international community.\n       (6) Other issues which are fundamental to the future \n     stability of the Balkan region remain unresolved, including \n     but not limited to the future status of Kosovo, the desire of \n     other Serb provinces for greater autonomy, and the status of \n     displaced persons who cannot return to prewar homes.\n       (7) The current position of the United States and its NATO \n     allies as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia calls \n     for an autonomous, multiethnic, democratic Kosovo which would \n     remain as part of Serbia, and such an outcome is not \n     supported by any of the parties directly involved, including \n     the Governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia, representatives of \n     the Kosovar Albanians, and the people of Yugoslavia, Serbia, \n     and Kosovo.\n       (8) There has been no final political settlement in Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina, where the Armed Forces of the United States, its \n     NATO allies, and other non-Balkan nations have been enforcing \n     an uneasy peace since 1996, at a cost to the United States \n     alone of more than $10,000,000,000 with no clear end in sight \n     to such enforcement.\n       (9) An effective exit strategy for the withdrawal from the \n     Balkans of foreign military forces is contingent upon the \n     achievement of a lasting political settlement for the region, \n     and only such a settlement, acceptable to all parties \n     involved, can ensure the fundamental goals of the United \n     States of peace, stability, and human rights in the Balkans.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding the Need for a Balkans \n     Stabilization Conference.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should take the lead in convening a \n     Balkans Stabilization Conference to evaluate progress on \n     implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords regarding Bosnia \n     and the cease-fire agreement with Serbia that ended Operation \n     Allied Force;\n       (2) a Balkans Stabilization Conference would serve a \n     critical purpose of reviewing progress to date and \n     considering such modifications to those agreements as may be \n     appropriate to foster stability, self-sustained peace, \n     improved self-determination by the inhabitants of the region, \n     and the eventual reduction in the levels of outside \n     peacekeepers;\n       (3) the potential for a successful review conference would \n     be maximized if it included the parties to the Dayton and \n     Operation Allied Force peace agreements, including \n     representatives of NATO, the Balkans ``Contact Group'', and \n     other affected regional parties; and\n       (4) in order to produce a lasting political settlement in \n     the Balkans acceptable to all parties, which can lead to the \n     departure from the Balkans in a timely fashion of all foreign \n     military forces, including those of the United States, the \n     international conference should have the authority to \n     consider any and all of the following:\n       (A) Political boundaries.\n       (B) Humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for all \n     nations in the Balkans.\n       (C) The stationing of United Nations peacekeeping forces \n     along international boundaries.\n       (D) Security arrangements and guarantees for all of the \n     nations of the Balkans.\n       (E) Tangible, enforceable, and verifiable human rights \n     guarantees for the individuals and peoples of the Balkans.\n       (d) Authorization of Funds for a Balkans Stabilization \n     Conference.--Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act for operations in the Balkans, there are authorized \n     to be available such sums as may be necessary not to exceed \n     $1,000,000 for the planning and execution of the conference \n     described in subsection (c).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       McCAIN AMENDMENT NO. 3737\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 2549, supra;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Russian Nuclear Weapons \n     Complex Conversion Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 3192. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Russian nuclear weapons complex has begun closure \n     and complete reconfiguration of certain weapons complex \n     plants and productions lines. However, this work is at an \n     early stage. The major impediments to downsizing have been \n     economic and social conditions in Russia. Little information \n     about this complex is shared, and 10 of its most sensitive \n     cities remain closed. These cities house 750,000 people and \n     employ approximately 150,000 people in nuclear military \n     facilities. Although the Russian Federation Ministry of \n     Atomic Energy has announced the need to significantly \n     downsize its workforce, perhaps by as much as 50 percent, it \n     has been very slow in accomplishing this goal. Information on \n     the extent of any progress is very closely held.\n       (2) The United States, on the other hand, has significantly \n     downsized its nuclear weapons complex in an open and \n     transparent manner. As a result, an enormous asymmetry now \n     exists between the United States\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\n     and Russia in nuclear weapon production capacities and in \n     transparency of such capacities. It is in the national \n     security interest of the United States to assist the Russian \n     Federation in accomplishing significant reductions in its \n     nuclear military complex and in helping it to protect its \n     nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and nuclear secrets \n     during such reductions. Such assistance will accomplish \n     critical nonproliferation objectives and provide essential \n     support towards future arms reduction agreements. The Russian \n     Federation's program to close and reconfigure weapons complex \n     plants and production lines will address, if it is \n     implemented in a significant and transparent manner, concerns \n     about the Russian Federation's ability to quickly \n     reconstitute its arsenal.\n       (3) Several current programs address portions of the \n     downsizing and nuclear security concerns. The Nuclear Cities \n     Initiative was established to assist Russia in creating job \n     opportunities for employees who are not required to support \n     realistic Russian nuclear security requirements. Its focus \n     has been on creating commercial ventures that can provide \n     self-sustaining jobs in three of the closed cities. The \n     current scope and funding of the program are not commensurate \n     with the scale of the threats to the United States sought to \n     be addressed by the program.\n       (4) To effectively address threats to United States \n     national security interests, progress with respect to the \n     nuclear cities must be expanded and accelerated. The Nuclear \n     Cities Initiative has laid the groundwork for an immediate \n     increase in investment which offers the potential for prompt \n     risk reduction in the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and \n     Zheleznogorsk, which house four key Russian nuclear \n     facilities. Furthermore, the Nuclear Cities Initiative has \n     made considerable progress with the limited funding \n     available. However, to gain sufficient advocacy for \n     additional support, the program must demonstrate--\n       (A) rapid progress in conversion and restructuring; and\n       (B) an ability for the United States to track progress \n     against verifiable milestones that support a Russian nuclear \n     complex consistent with their future national security \n     requirements.\n       (5) Reductions in the nuclear weapons-grade material stocks \n     in the United States and Russia enhance prospects for future \n     arms control agreements and reduce concerns that these \n     materials could lead to proliferation risks. Confidence in \n     both nations will be enhanced by knowledge of the extent of \n     each nation's stockpiles of weapons-grade materials. The \n     United States already makes this information public.\n       (6) Many current programs contribute to the goals stated \n     herein. However, the lack of programmatic coordination within \n     and among United States Government agencies impedes the \n     capability of the United States to make rapid progress. A \n     formal single point of coordination is essential to ensure \n     that all United States programs directed at cooperative \n     threat reduction, nuclear materials reduction and protection, \n     and the downsizing, transparency, and nonproliferation of the \n     nuclear weapons complex effectively mitigate the risks \n     inherent in the Russian Federation's military complex.\n       (7) Specialists in the United States and the former Soviet \n     Union trained in nonproliferation studies can significantly \n     assist in the downsizing process while minimizing the threat \n     presented by potential proliferation of weapons materials or \n     expertise.\n\n     SEC. 3193.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nFiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Act to authorize the conceptual \ndesign of a Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory at the Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory. As many of my colleagues \nknow, money for environmental cleanup is in short supply. The options \nfor addressing cleanup funding shortfalls are limited to taking funds \nfrom other programs to support environmental cleanup, not doing the \ncleanup, or putting money into research, development, science, and \ntechnology to make environmental cleanup cheaper and more efficient. \nThis amendment and the Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory addresses the \nlatter of these options.\n  The Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory would be located at the INEEL \nwhich, as the load laboratory for the Environmental Management program \nwithin DOE, is the natural location for this facility. In addition, the \ncapabilities and core competencies of the INEEL are a good fit with the \nsubsurface science needs of the nation. I say the nation because, \nalthough this facility would be located in Idaho, the solution \ndeveloped would be applicable to DOE sites across the nation. The \nsolutions developed would also be applicable outside of the DOE, in \nfact, anywhere environmental contaminants threaten subsurface water \nsupplies. The $400,000 authorized by this amendment for conceptual \ndesign of the Subsurface Geoscience Laboratory is an important first \nstep to developing the scientific and technical tools needed to solve \nenvironmental cleanup problems. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3751\n\n(Purpose: To assist the economic development of the Ute Indian Tribe by \nauthorizing the transfer to the Tribe of Oil Shale Reserve Numbered 2, \n   to protect the Colorado River by providing for the removal of the \n tailings from the Atlas uranium milling site near Moab, Utah, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       (The amendment is printed in Today's Record under \n     ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3752\n\n   (Purpose: To add funds for the procurement of the anti-personnel \n          obstacle breaching system; and to provide an offset)\n\n       On page 17, line 17, strike ``$496,749,000'' and insert \n     ``$500,749,000''.\n         On page 31, between lines 18 and 19, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 126.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Senate convened a \njoint meeting between Democrats and Republicans to receive a classified \nnuclear briefing from the Department of Defense. The purpose of this \nbipartisan meeting was for the members of the Senate to get a better \nunderstanding of our strategic nuclear weapons policy.\n  Our briefers, which included Admiral Richard Mies, Commander of \nSTRATCOM, had been invited to the Senate to explain the details of the \nSingle Integrated Operational Plan--or SIOP. The SIOP is the highly-\nclassified nuclear blueprint of targets and targeting assignments for \nour strategic nuclear weapons arsenal, and is the driving force behind \nour strategic nuclear force levels. While the SIOP is a military \ndocument, it is based on guidance given to the Department of Defense by \nthe President.\n  As elected representatives of the people, and with a Constitutional \nrole in determining national security policy, Congress should have an \nunderstanding of the principles underpinning our nuclear policy. Both \nthe guidance provided by the President and the details of the SIOP are \nnecessary for us to make informed national security decisions.\n  With this in mind, we gathered in an interior room in the Capitol to \nget a full briefing on the SIOP. But when we asked the DoD briefers \nprecise questions about the SIOP, we did not get the information we \nwere seeking. The briefers were unable, or unwilling, to give us the \nkind of specific information about our nuclear forces and plans we need \nto make the decisions required as elected representatives of the \npeople.\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\n In fact, when asked for detailed targeting information we were given \nthree different answers. First, we were told that they did not bring \nthat kind of information. Then, we were told there were people in the \nroom who were not cleared to receive that kind of information. Finally, \nwe were told that kind of information is only provided to the Senate \nleadership and members of the Armed Services Committee. Because members \nof the leadership and the Senate Armed Services Committee indicated \nthey had never received such information, I can only surmise there must \nbe a fourth answer.\n  We find ourselves in an uncomfortable and counter-productive Catch-\n22. Until we as civilians provide better guidance to our military \nleaders, we are unlikely to affect the kind of changes needed to update \nour nuclear policies to reflect the realities of the post-cold-war \nworld. Yet, providing improved guidance is difficult when we are unable \nto learn the basic components of the SIOP. Given this, I followed up \nour meeting with a letter to Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle \nrequesting that he schedule another briefing so that we could get the \ninformation our first briefers would not provide.\n  While I still believe this briefing is needed, we need not wait for a \nbriefing on the details of the SIOP to answer the question of how many \nnuclear weapons are needed to deter potential aggressors. In truth, it \nis important for citizens, armed only with common sense and open-source \ninformation, to reach sound conclusions about our nuclear posture and \nforce levels.\n  To illustrate, we should ask experts to describe the deterrent \ncapability of a single Trident submarine--our most survivable and \nreliable delivery platform. Within an hour of receiving an order to \nlaunch, a Trident could deliver and detonate 192 nuclear weapons on \ntheir targets. The minimum size of the detonations would 100 kilotons; \nthe maximum would be 300 kilotons. By comparison, the Hiroshima \ndetonation that caused Japan to sue for unconditional peace in August \n1945 was only 15 kilotons. In the open, we should assess what damage \n192 of these weapons would cause and determine whether this would deter \nmost, if not all of the threats we face.\n  Mr. President, I have made no secret of my strongly-held belief that \nwe can and we should make dramatic reductions in our strategic nuclear \narsenals. I believe that by keeping such a large arsenal of strategic \nnuclear weapons we are decreasing rather than enhancing our security. \nBy keeping such a large arsenal we are forcing the Russians to keep \nmore weapons than they can safely control. By keeping such a large \narsenal we are increasing the chance of accidental or unauthorized \nlaunch. By keeping such a large arsenal we are increasing the \nlikelihood of the proliferation of these weapons. By keeping such a \nlarge arsenal we are encouraging nations like India, Pakistan, Iran, \nand North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons option. And finally, by \nkeeping such a large arsenal we are diverting budgetary resources away \nfrom our conventional forces--the forces that are vital to protecting \nour interests around the globe.\n  In the near future, I will return to the Senate floor to discuss this \nissue further. I will return with non-classified information--\ninformation that comes not from briefings in secret rooms, but \ninformation all citizens can access through a simple search on Yahoo--\nin an attempt to better understand our nuclear policy and the changing \ndefinition of deterrence in the post-Cold War world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have some Executive Calendar matters \nand other unanimous consent agreements that have already been worked \nout. I will proceed to those. However, I do note I want to offer a \nunanimous consent request with regard to the estate tax matter. I want \nthe Democratic leader to be here when I make that request. I am hoping \nwithin the next few minutes we will also be able to conclude an \nagreement with regard to the Department of Defense authorization bill. \nDiscussions are still underway, but I thought I would take advantage of \nthis time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6292-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed \nGeorge Singal, the President's nominee for a seat on the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Maine, and rise to express my strong \nunequivocal support for his nomination.\n  In advance, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, for proceeding so expeditiously on Mr. \nSingal's nomination--especially when considering his nomination was \ntransmitted to the Senate just six weeks ago. In addition, I would like \nto thank the Majority Leader for bringing his nomination to the floor \nso rapidly--just three days after being reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  George Singal immigrated along with his family to the United States \nat a very young age, and has become a living embodiment of the American \ndream. He possesses a superior legal mind, has distinguished himself \nwithin the legal profession, and is deeply committed to upholding the \nvery highest standards of our nation's judicial system.\n  Moreover, Mr. Singal has a wide range of experience serving as both a \nprosecutor and as a defense attorney--a deep understanding and \nappreciation for the constitutionally mandated roles of the three \nbranches of government--and the enormous respect of his colleagues, a \nnumber of whom have contacted me in support of his nomination. Finally, \nand just as telling, he enjoys bipartisan support across the State of \nMaine.\n  Consider what George's background says about his character and \nqualifications. Born in a refugee camp in Italy after his family fled \nbefore the German invasion of his native Poland, he arrived in Bangor \nalong with his sister and widowed mother in 1949.\n  After graduating summa cum laude from my alma mater, the University \nof Maine in 1967, and becoming only the second recipient of the highly \nrespected Root-Tilden Scholarship in the history of the university, \nGeorge briefly left our state to receive his law degree from Harvard \nUniversity three years later.\n  Indeed, not one to forget his roots, George immediately returned to \nMaine to begin his legal career in Bangor, serving as the Assistant \nCounty Attorney for Penobscot County from 1971 to 1973, even as he \nworked his way to a partnership in the respected law firm of Gross, \nMinsky, Mogul, & Singal--the firm in which he has remained to this day.\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\n  Having served on a wide variety of professional committees--including \nthe advisory committee for the District of Maine that was assembled \npursuant to the Civil Justice Reform Act--George's impeccable \ncredentials and reputation for impartiality led to his appointment in \n1993 to the Governor's Judicial Selection Committee by my husband, \nGovernor McKernan.\n  That appointment, and the fact that he now chairs this prestigious \ncommittee that assists in the appointment of judges across the state \nunder Independent Governor Angus King, is why it's a special pleasure \nfor me to speak on his behalf today.\n  Of note, the enthusiastic support George has received from both sides \nof the aisle in Maine speaks volumes about Mr. Singal's talents and \nwork ethic, as well as the universal respect he has earned over his \nyears of work in the Maine judicial system.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Singal displayed remarkable legal acumen, \nthanks in large part to his thorough, reflective and balanced approach \nto his work. This approach has justifiably earned him accolades \nthroughout his career, including his selection to the American College \nof Trial Lawyers--an award given to less than one percent of trial \nlawyers nationwide--and his naming to the Best Lawyers in America, a \ndesignation that is made by his colleagues in the legal profession.\n  Mr. Singal possesses precisely the kind of judicial temperament and \nexperience I think we should expect from all our judicial nominees. I \nam certain this is due, in no small part, to his family's background \nand the perseverance and work ethic they instilled in him as an \nimmigrant brought to the United States by the ravages of World War II.\n  Further, his work during the late-1960s in the office of then-\nCongressman Bill Hathaway undoubtedly impressed upon him the need for \nbalance between the three branches of government. In fact, it is his \nbroad range of experiences that has undoubtedly instilled in Mr. Singal \na proper perspective on the appropriate role and appropriate \nconstitutional limitations of each branch of our government.\n  Clearly, George Singal has not only the professional qualifications \nto serve us well on the federal circuit, but also the personal \ncredentials to match.\n  My work with George over the past few weeks has only confirmed what I \nhad already heard--this is a man of the highest integrity and personal \ncharacter.\n  In conclusion, I am most proud to be able to express my support for \nMr. George Singal. He has the qualifications, the intellect, the \nexperience, the perspective, and the integrity to be an outstanding \njudge. Accordingly, I am pleased that my colleagues support his \nconfirmation to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6293-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 642, S. 2071.\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2071) to benefit electricity consumers by \n     promoting the reliability of the bulk-power system.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources with an amendment, as follows:\n  (The amendment will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I urge the Senate to unanimously \nadopt S. 2071, my bill also known as ``the Electric Reliability 2000 \nAct.'' The bill consists of a striking amendment adopted in the Energy \nCommittee and sponsored by Senators Murkowski, Bingaman, and myself. It \nincludes the original legislation and compromise language that \naddresses the concerns of the States on this issue.\n  We should be pro-active in addressing electricity reliability, and S. \n2071 is the correct approach at this time. The language has been \nendorsed by all of the major groups associated with the electricity \nindustry, including investor-owned utilities, public power, rural \ncooperatives, states groups, reliability groups, power producers, and \nconsumer organizations. Not only does this bill provide a long-term \nsolution to electricity reliability by creating a national reliability \norganization--modeled loosely on the Securities and Exchange \nCommission--it will give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nimmediate authority to prevent blackouts this summer.\n  Enacting S. 2071 is critical for all electricity consumers in the \nUnited States. This Nation's interstate electric transmission system is \nan extremely complex network that connects with Canada and Mexico. It \ndeveloped over decades with various voluntary agreements that allow \nareas to work together depending on changing power needs that vary from \nminute to minute. Yet a fundamental change has made this voluntary \nsystem unworkable. The system of buying and selling wholesale power is \nnow many times more complex than it was just a decade ago. With a \nstronger economy, electricity usage and its importance to the economy \nhas increased. Due to the uncertain nature of evolving retail and \nwholesale electricity markets, many utilities have cut investment that \ntraditionally enhanced the reliability of the nation's grid.\n  The fact is that the voluntary agreements just do not work any longer \nbecause there is no enforcement. With the beginning of competition, we \nneed a referee on the bulk-power system. A multitude of studies and \nincidents over the past several years show that the Nation's \nreliability is at its lowest point in decades. Certain entities can \n``game'' the transmission system--with potential of causing brownouts \nand blackouts within a region--and suffer no consequences for such \nactions. With continued extreme heat predicted for this summer, the \nproblem will continue. Blackouts hit the San Francisco area and Detroit \nin the past month, and even the Northwest is facing shortages this \nsummer.\n  As I said in February when I introduced this bill, reliability is \nmore than creating legally-enforceable rules on the electricity \ntransmission grid. It also includes cost-effective conservation and \ndemand-side management. Reliability will be enhanced with open-access \ntransmission policies and with more generation distributed throughout \nthe grid, whether it is small fuel cells or larger plants with clean \ntechnology. Sending the right signals to the investment community will \nbe aided by passage of a truly comprehensive bill next year that allows \nall regions of the country--including the Northwest--the ability to \nbenefit from a truly open and competitive marketplace. All of these \nfactors, along with S. 2071, contribute to electricity reliability.\n  The Electric Reliability 2000 Act is not a total solution to the \nelectricity reliability problem in this nation, but it is a solid \nstart. Enacting this legislation will have immediate benefits for \nAmerican consumers and the economy of the United States.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2071.\n  S. 2071 will promote the reliability of our electric power grid.\n  I strongly support the enactment of this legislation, but there \nshould be no misunderstanding that it does only part of the job of \nprotecting consumers.\n  It establishes enforceable rules for the use of the interstate \ntransmission grid, but it does not stimulate the construction of new \ngeneration and transmission.\n  New transmission and generation are essential if we are going to \navoid electricity shortages this summer and in the future.\n  While it is too late to avoid the problems this summer, if we start \nnow it is not too late for the future.\n  The best way to ensure that consumers have a reliable and reasonably-\npriced supply of electricity is through comprehensive legislation--\nwhich addresses other impediments to competition.\n  Along with provisions to stimulate construction of new generation and \ntransmission, it is essential that we repeal both the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, PUHCA, and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies \nAct, PURPA.\n  Both PUHCA and PURPA have long out-lived their usefulness, and they \nare now hurting both consumers and competition.\n  PUHCA prevents electric utilities and others from fully competing in \nthe electric power market, and that hurts competition.\n  PUHCA is an archaic 65-year-old law that has long outlived its \nusefulness.\n  Sixty five years ago PUHCA was needed to protect consumers, but other \nlaws and Federal agencies now fully protect consumers.\n  Thus, repeal of PUHCA would benefit consumers by enhancing \ncompetition without any loss of any needed consumer protections.\n  Legislation to repeal PUHCA is on the Senate Calendar, S. 313, \nCalendar No. 23, and I would urge that the Senate move to its \nconsideration.\n  Turning now to PURPA, it also harms consumers, and thus deserves to \nbe repealed.\n  PURPA makes electric utilities purchase power whether or not they \nneed it, and to pay so-called ``full avoided cost'' for that power \nwhether or not that price is above true market price.\n  And these costs are just passed on to consumers through higher \nelectricity prices.\n  It is estimated that as a result of PURPA consumers are today paying \n$8 billion per year extra for their electricity.\n  I would have liked to bring to the floor comprehensive legislation, \nsuch as the bill which I introduced, S. 2098, but I could not reach \nagreement with my Democratic colleagues on the Committee.\n  As a result, we were able to report only this more limited measure to \ncreate rules of the road for our interstate electricity transmission \ngrid.\n  I will now discuss the background and need for this legislation.\n  The Nation's interstate electric transmission grid is an extremely \ncomplex network that is also interconnected with the transmission grids \nof Canada and Mexico.\n  It has developed over decades with various voluntary agreements \nbetween utilities and others that allow areas to work together to \nrespond to changing power needs that vary from day-to-day, hour-to-hour \nand even minute-to-minute.\n  Many of these voluntary agreements were developed after a disastrous \nevent in 1965 that led to a major blackout in New York City and \nthroughout other parts of the Northeast.\n  While this voluntary system has worked well for the past 35 years, \nfundamental changes in the electric power industry are making this \nvoluntary system less workable for the future.\n  With the expansion of competition in the wholesale electric power \nmarket--starting with the 1992 Energy Policy Act--the system of buying \nand selling wholesale power is now many times more complex than it was \nless than a decade ago.\n  With a stronger economy, electricity usage has increased while \nthousands of new electricity marketers and buyers have created new \nstresses on the system.\n  Moreover, the emergence of competition in the wholesale power market \nhas changed the ability and willingness of market participants to act \nvoluntarily, particularly when it is not in their economic interest to \ndo so.\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\n  As a result, the existing scheme of voluntary compliance with \nvoluntary industry reliability rules is simply no longer adequate.\n  There has been a marked increase in the number and seriousness of \nviolations of voluntary reliability rules.\n  Under a voluntary system, there is no penalty for violating a \nreliability standard.\n  The users and operators of the system, who used to cooperate \nvoluntarily on reliability matters, are now competitors without the \nsame incentives to cooperate with each other or comply with voluntary \nreliability rules.\n  For example, last summer during an extremely hot period one Midwest \nutility took without any penalty electric power from the grid that it \nwas not entitled to.\n  It did so without even informing other utilities on the grid what it \nwas doing.\n  This action came close to jeopardizing power reliability in several \nStates.\n  This legislation will prevent that kind of inappropriate activity in \nthe future.\n  In order to maintain grid reliability, rules must be made mandatory \nand enforceable, and fairly applied to all participants in the \nelectricity market.\n  To address this need, more than a year ago a group of electricity \nindustry officials began meeting to develop legislative language.\n  As a result of this effort, the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil and a broad coalition of industry organizations have jointly \nproposed the language which is embodied in S. 2071.\n  The legislation is supported by virtually all aspects of the electric \npower industry, including: the American Public Power Association, the \nEdison Electric Institute, the Electric Power Supply Association, the \nElectricity Consumers Resource Council, the National Rural Electric \nCooperative Association, and the Canadian Electricity Association.\n  The proposal follows the model of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in its oversight of the securities industry's self-\nregulatory organizations--the stock exchanges and the National \nAssociation of Securities Dealers.\n  Let me now describe the key elements of S. 2071.\n  S. 2071 helps protect grid reliability by creating an industry-run, \nFERC overseen, organization that sets enforceable rules for the use of \nthe interstate transmission grid.\n  It also has provisions to ensure that States have an appropriate role \nin promoting reliability.\n  S. 2071 authorizes the establishment of a self-regulating Electric \nReliability Organization.\n  Both the establishment of the Electric Reliability Organization and \nthe reliability rules it establishes are subject to approval and \noversight by the FERC.\n  The legislation spells out specific criteria required for the new \nElectric Reliability Organization. In essence, the requirements are \nthat the Organization be independent and fair.\n  The Electric Reliability Organization would establish, monitor and \nenforce compliance with reliability standards for the interstate bulk \npower system.\n  The legislation does not give the Electric Reliability Organization \nor any affiliated regional reliability entity any authority to build or \nto pay for the building of any transmission or other facility necessary \nfor a bulk power user to comply with a reliability requirement.\n  The reliability standards established by the Electric Reliability \nOrganization would be mandatory on all owners, users and operators of \nthe interstate bulk power system.\n  The cost of complying with a reliability requirement is the \nresponsibility of bulk power users, not the Electric Reliability \nOrganization or any affiliated regional reliability entity.\n  The reliability standards only concern the operational security of \nthe bulk power system. They do not deal with generation adequacy, \nreserve margins; distribution system reliability; safety; transmission \nsiting; or retail customer choice plans.\n  Activities conducted in compliance with the statutory requirements \nreceive a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the Federal \nantitrust laws.\n  Until the new Electric Reliability Organization is up and running, \nthe existing North American Electric Reliability Council and its \nindividual regional reliability councils may file with FERC those \nexisting reliability standards they propose to be mandatory in the \ninterim.\n  The Electric Reliability Organization may delegate authority to \nimplement and enforce regional standards to an Affiliated Regional \nReliability Entity, which can enforce reliability standards and take \ndisciplinary action against system operators and users.\n  As I said before, the real way to prevent brownouts and blackouts is \nthrough comprehensive legislation that stimulates the construction of \nnew generation and transmission.\n  This legislation will help, but much, much more needs to be done.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to pass it \nwithout amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on this important piece \nof legislation. I believe that this legislation, and the electric \nreliability organizations created by this legislation, will \nsignificantly improve the reliability of our transmission system. I \nunderstand that a question has been raised, however, about the \npotential scope of authority of these electric reliability \norganizations and specifically their authority to waive environmental \nrequirements. I would like to seek clarification of this issue. It is \nmy understanding that nothing in this legislation in any way waives or \nmodifies any environmental requirements, or exempts any facilities \ncovered by the bill from any otherwise applicable federal or State \nenvironmental law or regulations, including the requirements of the \nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act, the Endangered Species Act, or any other environmental \nlaw.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I share the concerns that have been raised \nabout the potential scope of authority of the electric reliability \norganizations and would also seek clarification on this point. It is my \nunderstanding that in addition to not diminishing or affecting any \nenvironmental obligations, this legislation does not authorize the \nelectric reliability organizations to direct or authorize any covered \nfacility to violate or disregard the requirements of any Federal or \nState environmental law or regulation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the chairman and ranking member of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works are both correct that the \nlegislation will not affect or modify any requirements of our important \nenvironmental laws or authorize the electric reliability organizations \nto waive or modify those requirements.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I concur with the clarification by the \nchairman.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the chairman for this important \nclarification.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I also thank the chairman for his clarification.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment in the nature of a substitute be agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2071), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6295-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6295-S6296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEATH TAX ELIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to the estate tax repeal bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object. In fact, I should object. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nconsiders the estate tax bill, it be considered under the following \nlimitation: That the bill be limited to relevant amendments, with the \nfollowing exemptions of the minority: estate taxes\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\nand tuition tax deductibility; second, estate taxes and Medicare \nprescription drug benefit; third, estate taxes and long-term care tax \ncredit; next, estate taxes and Medicare off budget; next, estate taxes \nand retirement savings tax incentives; and, finally, estate taxes and \nkid savings accounts; that all first-degree amendments be subject to \nrelevant second-degree amendments, and that there be a time limitation \nof 1 hour for debate, equally divided in the usual form, on all \namendments.\n  I also say, just taking another brief minute, that at least one of \nour Members believes it would be appropriate that we should not be able \nto bring this estate tax legislation forward until we dispose of the \nChina PNTR legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator \nDaschle and I have been discussing this matter in the hope that we \ncould work out an agreement as to how we could proceed. We had \ndiscussed the possibility of certainly a substitute being in order on \nthe estate tax legislation. I  believe the Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan, had a substitute, or others, perhaps, joining with him would \nhave a substitute, and other related or germane amendments to that \nissue. We even offered the possibility of having two nongermane \namendments on each side.\n\n  Our problem gets to be when you go to five or six--I don't know how \nmany were included in that list.\n  Mr. REID. Six.\n  Mr. LOTT. Plus, if you have a substitute and then you have, let's \njust say, one or two related germane amendments, then you have five \namendments on each side--that is 10 amendments--and even if we got a \ntime agreement, you are talking about 12, or more, or 14 hours, which \nwould be a minimum of 2 days.\n  The problem we have in July is that we now have completed six \nappropriations bills, meaning there are still seven we have to get \ndone.\n  I hope that, at a minimum, we get five or six more done in July \nbecause they are very important bills that need to get completed so \nthey can get in conference with the House, so they can be sent to the \nPresident, so hopefully he can sign them.\n  We are talking about Agriculture; Interior; Housing and Urban \nDevelopment; Treasury-Postal Service; Commerce-State-Justice--these are \nbig, important appropriations bills. We have all those we have to do in \nJuly--a 3-week period--plus we have to do the marriage penalty tax \nelimination.\n  I think there is an overwhelming desire to get that done, on both \nsides of the aisle, although we still disagree on how to get it done. \nBut the Finance Committee has reported that out in a reconciliation \nbill. And there is a desire to do the China PNTR.\n  I know we don't have the time to set aside 2 whole days in the midst \nof all that for the death tax. If we could just agree to a substitute \nand germane amendments--this is a bill that passed the House \noverwhelmingly. Sixty-five Democrats voted for it. Members in the \nHouse, regardless of region or race or sex, voted for it. Why does the \nSenate need to get into all these other nonrelated matters?\n  But I understand there are Senators on the Democratic side who wish \nto have a debate and votes on these other matters. I believe they will \nprobably have an opportunity to come up on other bills before the \nsession is out. But that is why I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Under my reservation, I yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I think what we have done these last 4 \ndays shows we can move through things very quickly. There were over 150 \namendments after we worked on the bill a couple days. So we probably \nresolved over 200 amendments in the Labor-HHS bill.\n  But I also say, in the short time I have been in the Senate, we have \nhad some tax bills with hundreds of amendments and we have been able to \nwork our way through those in some way.\n  As with the leader, we on this side of the aisle think there should \nbe some change in the estate taxes. We want to do that. We are getting \nthe same calls you are.\n  But I say to my friend, we would be willing to take time agreements \non these amendments. I am certain we could finish  the amendments in \none good, long day. We would take time agreements on these amendments.\n\n  On tax bills that have traditionally been brought up in the Senate, \nwe have not had any restrictions on them. We will agree to have some \nrestrictions, but we think this would be appropriate.\n  We will be happy to have our staffs work on this during the break, \nand as soon as we get back, the two leaders can again talk about this. \nWe do want to bring up the estate taxes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may respond to that, just briefly.\n  After the good work that has been done, in a bipartisan way, this \npast week, and after having participated in the effort that was just \nmade to complete action on the military construction appropriations \nconference report, it has restored my faith that anything is possible \nin the Senate. I hope we can continue to work to find a way to resolve \nthis and get it considered other than through the cloture process. I am \ngoing to hold out hope until the very last minute that we can get that \ndone.\n  So we will continue to work. Our staffs have been exchanging \nproposals, and we will continue to do that right up until the time we \nneed to begin voting, which would be, I guess, Tuesday or Wednesday of \nthe week we return.\n  Under my reservation, I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the majority leader very much. I assure him, as a \nmember of the Finance Committee, we definitely plan to take up some \nform of estate tax reform. I don't know what version it would be, but \nclearly that has to pass this year.\n  In addition, however, I do believe there is one other matter that is \neven more important than estate tax reform, and that is PNTR for China. \nIt far transcends appropriations bills, marriage penalty relief, \nbankruptcy reform. Getting PNTR passed in July, I think, is of such \nurgency and is so important that I am constrained to object to any \nunanimous consent request that sets the schedule for July unless it \nalso includes a time when we are going to take up PNTR. I know the \nleader knows that is my view. I just hope that in working with the \nleader, we can work out some accommodation to reach that objective.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6296-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6296-S6297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MOTION TO PROCEED--H.R. 8\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under my reservation, Mr. President, I also say we have \nworked very closely with Senator Baucus and Senator Moynihan in trying \nto come up with an alternative, and some other matters that we believe \nshould be brought up with this piece of legislation.\n  For example, in 1992, under a tax bill that came before the Senate, \nwe, on the 25th, started considering that. We had 105 amendments, and a \nday and a half later it was all done. That legislation was totally \npassed. We had a number of amendments that were even offered by our \nmajority leader on that important legislation.

Mr. President, in a few short days, our Nation will \ncelebrate for the 224th time the signing of the Declaration of \nIndependence. For some, the occasion will take on an unwarranted \nspecial significance because there are people who have been led to \nbelieve--in some cases misled, I would say--that this is the first \nIndependence Day of the new millennium. For them, the celebration \nrequires extra fanfare, even more spectacular displays of fireworks, \nand an even bigger party, akin to the gala bashes of last New Year's \nEve. However, in reality, the millennial Independence Day celebration \ncoincides with the 225th anniversary of the signing next year, in 2001. \nSo I, at least, will reserve my extra sparklers and Roman candles for \nnext year.\n  I will not, however, let any confusion over the new century/new \nmillennium stand in the way of one of my favorite holidays. The Fourth \nof July is a standout. It is one of the few holidays still celebrated \non the actual anniversary of the day, as opposed to being appended to a \nweekend for convenience's sake. Though sales may beckon from nearby \nshopping malls, the holiday is not obscured beneath any major sporting \nevent.\n  There are no 4th of July college football championships, no \nbasketball finals, no baseball World Series games to divide families \ninto the camps of the spectators and the ignored. The 4th of July is \ninstead, typically, celebrated by families and friends in the great \nbeauty of the outdoors.\n  Some years, the weather is perfect, with blue skies, moderate \ntemperatures and low humidity, when the American flags are fanned by \ngentle breezes--the kind of a day that fills me with a sense of \nexhilaration and anticipation. Other years, the weather is almost \nunbearably hot and sticky, the flag hangs limply from the pole, and sun \nscreen mingles with sweat to turn picnickers into melting human \npopsicles. But even these sweltering days can be relieved by mimicking \nchildrens' refreshing runs through a water sprinkler arcing manmade \nrainbows across the yard, or by dousing the heat with gallons of tart \nlemonade and sweet watermelon chilled in a tub of ice. On summer days \nlike these, people still resort to rocking chairs on porches and paper \nfans waved lazily before faces, much as they did when I was a boy in \nthe days before air conditioning.\n  The highlight of the day, is, of course, the fireworks. My favorite \ntime of this holiday comes as the temperatures cool and the skies \ndarken, and the fireflies' display hints of the light show to come. I \ncannot wait to see my little great-granddaughter Caroline's expression \nas she is presented with the mysteries of smoke worms, sparklers, and \nRoman candles. I hope that she will not be so afraid of the explosive \nbooms of the big fireworks that she cannot enjoy the fiery display, the \ncascades of red, blue, green, and golden sparks drifting down over our \nheads.\n  It is alright for her to be afraid, of course. After all, those \nfireworks, so festive now, recall the great battles fought by our young \nnation to gain its independence from mighty Britain. Two-hundred and \ntwenty-four years ago, on a similar hot summer night, little Caroline's \npatriotic forbearers might have feared for their lives as the cannons \nboomed and the flintlocks cracked. The parades we watch today are a \nfaint reminder of the lines of troops that may have tramped with grim \nfaces through colonial towns on their way to battle with the redcoats. \nSo it is, perhaps, good to be a little afraid when watching 4th of July \nfireworks. It may be the closest many of our children come to reliving \nthis important time in the history of our Republic.\n  Probably most children watching 4th of July fireworks do not fully \nunderstand the link between the holiday and this day in our nation's \npast. That our children know little about history is not news. Poll \nafter poll in recent years has alerted us to huge gaps in historical \nknowledge among our nation's schoolchildren. Once again, a recent test \nof young peoples' knowledge of history, in this case, the history of \nour own nation, has demonstrated a sorry--and if I may add--scandalous \nignorance. What is disconcerting about this most recent report is that \nit reflects the knowledge base of college seniors from some of the best \ncolleges and universities in the nation, not younger children with many \nyears of learning still ahead of them. If those who do not learn from \nhistory are truly doomed to repeat it, then I shudder to think how much \nour future might resemble that silly movie, ``Groundhog Day.''\n\n  The test, sponsored by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, \nand administered by the University of Connecticut, consisted of asking \ncollege seniors at 55 top colleges and universities some 34 questions \nfrom a high school-level American history test. I was very sorry to \nread that nearly 80 percent of those tested earned only a ``D'' or an \n``F.'' A mere 23 percent could identify James Madison as the principal \nframer of the Constitution. More than a third did not know that the \nConstitution established the division of powers in American government. \nJust 60 percent could correctly select the 50-year period in which the \nCivil War occurred.\n  Imagine that. Just 60 percent could correctly select--in other words, \n40 percent could not correctly select--the 50-year period in which the \nCivil War occurred--not the correct years, or even the correct decade, \nbut the correct half century! A scant 35 percent could correctly name \nthe President in office at the start of the Korean War. It was, for the \nrecord, President Truman.\n  But, 99 percent of these college seniors correctly identified Beavis \nand Butthead as television cartoon characters. That is a sorry \ncommentary, indeed. Years of experts advising parents to limit and \nmonitor their children's time in front of the television, and to \nencourage their children to stretch their minds by reading or their \nmuscles by playing outdoors, have come to this--a nation of \nincreasingly overweight children who spend increasing numbers of hours \nwatching moronic and scatological so-called humor on television and who \ndo not learn the history behind some of the most fundamental tenets \nunderlying our system of government. It is a disgrace--a colossal \ndisgrace. Perhaps we should attempt to restrict books and learning, in \norder to make them more desirable ``forbidden fruits'' in our \nchildren's eyes.\n  I do not want to put the blame for this sad state of affairs entirely \non parents or even on our lowest-common-denominator-seeking \nentertainment industry. Another recent review, this time, of high \nschool textbooks by the American Association for the Advancement of \nScience, slammed biology and science textbooks, in particular, as \nmissing the big picture behind the four basic ideas driving today's \ncutting edge research. Not one of the two dozen biology texts reviewed \nby the group, which are aimed at grades 9-12, were considered excellent \nor satisfactory. Other reviews in the past of history books have \nillustrated similar deficiencies. I fear that we are nowhere close to \nanswering the century-plus old prayer by Charles Kingsley--``I hope \nthat my children, at least, if not I myself, will see the day when \nignorance of the primary laws and facts of science will be looked upon \nas a defect only second to ignorance of the primary laws of religion \nand morality.'' We are, instead, closer to fulfilling the prediction by \nRobert A. Heinlein that ``A generation which ignores history has no \npast--and no future.''\n  In light of this dismal knowledge of our national history, I have \ntoday offered an amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations Bill to provide $50 million--just a little seed corn--to \nthe Secretary of Education to award grants to states to develop, \nimplement, and strengthen programs that teach American history as a \nseparate subject within school curricula.\n  It doesn't mean social studies. That is about all they have today. \nSome people look upon social studies and claim that is history. I have \nnothing against social studies, except it is not history. What I am \nsuggesting here by way of this $50 million amendment is that the\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\nSecretary of Education award grants to States to develop, implement, \nand strengthen programs that teach American history--not social \nstudies. The schools may, if they wish, teach social studies. But this \nis American history as a separate subject within the school curriculum. \nThe importance of American history is too often undervalued in our \nnation's classrooms. As I have already indicated, poll after poll in \nrecent years has alerted us to huge gaps in historical knowledge among \nour nation's schoolchildren. It is my hope that this amendment will \nencourage teachers and students to take a deeper look at the importance \nof our nation's past.\n  A Supreme Court ruling just a few days ago would take prayer out of \nour school functions, about which I will have more to say on a future \nday. It seems that knowledge is already in short supply there. The \nearly patriots who established our great nation, and who inscribed on \nthe Liberty Bell a quotation from Leviticus 25:10, ``Proclaim liberty \nthroughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof,'' would surely \nbe surprised at this sad turn of events. Trained in the classics, \nsteeped in history as surely as that tea was steeped in Boston Harbor's \nwaters, they readily mingled faith and learning, and valued both.\n  I hope that on this 4th of July, some few imaginative parents might \nencourage their children to see, not the smoke of the backyard grill, \nbut the smoke of battle; to hear, not the explosions of fireworks but \nthe percussive thunder of cannons; and to spark in these young minds \nnot a taste for firecrackers but a taste for history.\n  Our Founding Fathers gambled so much for our freedom. They invested \ntheir lives, their families, their fortunes, and the best of their \nintellects, in winning our freedom and then protecting it with a \nmarvelously thought-out system of government. For 224 years, it has \nwithstood the tests of history. Our Constitution, our government, our \nnation, has bested every effort to bring it down. It has proved capable \nof stretching to cover millions more acres, millions more people, and \nmillions of new circumstances, the likes of which Thomas Jefferson, \nJames Madison, John Adams, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and \ntheir peers could not have dreamed. If we are to appreciate their gift, \nif we are to carry on their legacy, we must learn about it, care about \nit, and share it with our children. I would not wish to visit upon our \nchildren, through ignorance, the fate of the protagonist Philip Nolan \nin ``Man Without a Country.''\n  I believe it was written by Edward Everett Hale. I read it many years \nago. It would be well if our schoolchildren and even our adults would \nread it today.\n  Philip Nolan's sentence in ``Man Without a Country,'' for wanting to \nrenounce his country, was to forever sail upon the high seas never \nagain hearing news from home, not even the name of the homeland that he \nfinally comes to realize that he loves. Our children should recognize \nthe gift that is their birthright, and they deserve sufficient \nknowledge of their history to appreciate and protect the liberties that \nthey enjoy.\n  I know that my knowledge of our Nation's history, and my study of the \ndocuments and lives that shaped it, only deepen my love for my Nation. \nI have been fortunate. I have been blessed by the Creator, blessed by \nthe God who reigns over the destinies of nations--blessed to live a \nfull life with many opportunities for travel, but always, I share the \nsentiments in the poem by Henry Van Dyke, ``America for Me.''\n\n                             America for Me\n\n     `Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,-\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in \n           Rome\n     But when it comes to living there is just no place like home.\n\n     I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and [travel] for a day\n     In friendly [West Virginia hills] where Nature has her way!\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack:\n     The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,-\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/30/senate-section/article/S6299-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M.
