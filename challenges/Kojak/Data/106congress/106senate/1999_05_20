On this day 3,311 years ago, You descended on Mount Sinai and \ngave the Ten Commandments amidst ``thunder and lightning and the \npowerful sound of the ram's horn.''\n  Before issuing Your Commandments, the most crucial of which are: Thou \nshalt not commit murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not \nsteal, You awesomely declared, ``I am God, your God.'' You declared so \nbecause, in Your infinite wisdom, You knew that only by constantly \nfocusing on Your sovereignty could humans control their negative \nimpulses.\n  Almighty God, this august institution, the Senate of the United \nStates of America, responds daily to Your declaration at Sinai by \nopening their convocations in this historic and noble Chamber with the \nrecognition of Your sovereign presence and by publicly offering prayers \nto You.\n  Reward this sacred practice by granting the Senators good health, \ngood cheer, good fellowship, long life, and abundant wisdom. May this \nwise and sacred practice be an inspiration to all convocations and \nassemblies which are convened daily throughout our blessed country and \nthroughout the world to do likewise, in light of today's event in the \nschool in Georgia, especially in the Nation's public schools, so that \nmortality, safety, tranquility, and happiness prevail throughout our \ncountry and throughout the world.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will withhold.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is an important day because this is \nthe day on which we hope we can finally pass this juvenile justice \nbill. We have had another shooting of students just today at a high \nschool in Georgia. The shooting occurred at 8 a.m. at the Heritage High \nSchool and a number of children were wounded. I won't go into the \ndetails, but the shooting was exactly a month after the April 20 \nslaughter at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where two \nstudents killed 13 people before taking their own lives.\n  It is apparent that we have to do something about this, and this bill \nis a very considered attempt to do exactly that.\n  Now, we are going to have two very crucial amendments this morning. \nThe Smith amendment is first to come up, and this amendment is to \nresolve the pawn shop issue and the special licensee issue. I commend \nthe distinguished Senator from Oregon and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont in particular for their thoughtfulness in trying to \nresolve this difficulty. We want to do this in a bipartisan way. I \nsurely hope people quit trying to score political points and help to \nget this bill done.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, look where we are today--another high \nschool shooting incident in Atlanta, four young people, at least in the \ninitial news, injured, not killed. I talked about it with the Attorney \nGeneral a few minutes ago. She had expressed her concern. I also \ncommended her for her strong words of last week because I believe that \nhelped move this bill forward. We are considering it during the eighth \nlegislative day. We have not spent full days on this important bill. We \nwill not be able to spend a full day. Notwithstanding that, we have \nmade significant progress.\n  Today, we will also consider the long-delayed emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Mitch, \nhumanitarian aid in the Balkans, aid for farmers, and aid for the \nvictims of natural disasters, as well as military and other \nappropriations.\n  In the time available to us today, I do hope we will be able to move \nto final passage on this bill. The bill has been much improved since \nits predecessor was introduced 2 years ago as S. 10. I detailed some of \nthose improvements yesterday, and yesterday the Senate took a giant \nstep forward with the adoption of the managers', the Hatch-Leahy \namendment. Those modifications go a long way toward improving the bill. \nI predicted all week long that once we adopted Hatch-Leahy, we would \nhave fewer than 10 amendments offered from the Democratic side.\n  As we begin this morning, I am sure of that. I am working with other \nDemocratic Senators to see if the number of amendments can be reduced \neven further. Thanks to the hard work of Senator Reid and others, the \nDemocratic amendments have been pared down from 89 to a precious few \nleft to be offered. They are still pending; they are still to be \noffered. I am hoping, though, that none will pose a stumbling block.\n  I know that in a little while the President of the United States will \ntravel to Colorado for events in connection with remembering and \nhonoring those who perished in Littleton, CO, recently as a result of \nschool violence. I hope the visit from the President will help heal the \nwounds and ease the suffering. He is right to go to Colorado, just as \nhe went to Oklahoma and has gone to the side of other Americans in \nother places where tragedy has struck over the last several years. I \nhad hoped that perhaps the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I \ncould place a joint call to the President before he leaves Colorado \nthis afternoon to tell him the Senate is doing its job, the Senate has \ncompleted its initial work on the juvenile crime bill, and the Senate \nis sending the bill to the House for its prompt consideration. I would \nlike for the President to be able to share that news with the people of \nColorado and the Nation so that parents and youngsters everywhere can \nbe reassured we are making progress in our work and that the Senate of \nthe United States is acting as the conscience of the Nation.\n\n  There is one set of amendments that still threatens final passage of \nthis bill. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment, which proposes modification of \nIDEA, is a matter of significant controversy and turmoil. Because that \namendment threatens completion of the bill, I made a series of \nsuggestions over the last couple of days in an effort to try to avoid \nthat risk to the underlying measure. We need the cooperation of the \nRepublican sponsors of that amendment if we are to complete our work on \nthe juvenile bill today.\n  We are also working our way through a series of gun-related proposals \nto the bill. Last week, the Senate adopted a pattern of tabling \nDemocratic amendments one day, and the next day it adopted pieces of \nthose amendments if they were offered by Republicans. I suppose I \nshould be glad to see our amendments finally get in one way or the \nother, but it is petty to say the amendments aren't worth anything if \nthey are offered by Democrats, but they are wonderful if the same \namendment is offered by a Republican. We have to do better. This should \nbe a bipartisan bill.\n  Unquestionably, the Senate hit a real snag on this bill when it \nrejected, on a virtual party-line vote, the Lautenberg amendment. They \ndidn't solve the first Craig amendment and Hatch-Craig II, seeking to \nreconstitute the ill-advised initial votes on the gun show issue.\n  Senator Schumer and I tried to point out problems with the Craig \namendment, only to be told we were wrong last Wednesday night. In fact, \nwe were told in fairly scathing terms how wrong we were. Of course, the \nnext morning after the press looked at it, and after the Senate adopted \nthe initial Craig amendment, it was clear to almost all throughout the \ncountry that mistakes had been made, the Senator from New York and I \nwere correct, and matters needed to be fixed. So we saw another partial \nfix.\n  Today, we will see yet a third Republican amendment seeking to \nrectify what the Senate did when it rejected the Lautenberg amendment \nin favor of the Craig amendment last week. The Smith-Jeffords amendment \nis the most recent Republican amendment in that series of Republican \namendments making corrections. As President Reagan said in another \ncontext, ``There you go again.'' Unfortunately, the Smith-Jeffords \namendment closes only 2 of the 13 loopholes created by adoption of the \nCraig and the Hatch-Craig amendment.\n  The Smith-Jeffords amendment is baby steps toward background checks. \nThat is what it is, baby steps toward background checks. It closes one \nloophole by requiring special licensees under Hatch-Craig to conduct \nbackground checks on firearm sales at gun shows. It closes the pawnshop \nloophole by repealing the Hatch-Craig amendment provision that allowed \ncriminals to redeem guns at pawnshops without background checks--the \nsame loophole adopted by the Senate last week.\n  The Smith-Jeffords amendment still leaves 11 loopholes that were \ncreated by adoption of the Craig and Hatch-Craig amendment of last \nweek. The Smith-Jeffords amendment does not close the legal immunity \nloophole created by the Craig and Hatch-Craig amendments. Those \namendments dismiss pending lawsuits against some gun dealers and \nperhaps even gun manufacturers. Giving gun dealers and manufacturers a \nget-out-of-jail-free card is wrong.\n  The Smith-Jeffords amendment does not close the loophole that weakens \nall background checks at gun shows by giving law enforcement only 24 \nhours to complete the checks. Most gun shows take place on weekends \nwhen courthouses and record departments are closed. Law enforcement may \nwell need the full 3 days to do the job right.\n\n  Now, at the rate of the Smith-Jeffords amendment on closing only 2 of \nthe 13 gun show loopholes--the ones the Republicans voted for last \nweek--by closing only 2 of the 13 gun show loopholes at a time, I \nbelieve the Republican majority will need to offer 6.5 more amendments \nto finally fix all the\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\nproblems in the amendments they adopted last week. The Senate does not \nhave the luxury of time to follow the ``baby steps toward the \nbackground checks'' approach.\n  Fortunately, Senators Lautenberg and Kerrey are offering the Senate \nanother chance to right this matter by adoption of the modified version \nof the Lautenberg amendment this morning. The Lautenberg and Kerrey \namendment closes all 13 gun show loopholes. I hope we will finally step \npast party labels and close all 13 loopholes.\n  If we hear that we have already voted on this matter, be careful. We \ndid. It was tabled. But didn't we find after that more loopholes were \nopened up? We have to come back. Let's close the loopholes once and for \nall. After all, the Senator from New Jersey should be commended for \noffering the Senate a second chance to do the right thing.\n  We have had three amendments on the subject from the other side, \nfirst opening huge loopholes, and now--and I commend Senator Smith for \ntrying to close the same loopholes that he voted for last week. I hope \nthat all Members will step back from the heat of the debate and vote on \nthe merits of these proposals. They can be corrected today. The way to \ndo that is to vote for the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment and close all \nthe loopholes--not the baby steps but the one giant step.\n  Let's not keep coming back, and let's not be in a position we seem to \nput ourselves in. We open up huge loopholes, the American public reacts \nwith great unanimity against those loopholes, and then we come back and \nsay let's close a few and wait and see what the reaction is. Let's do \nwhat the American people are saying: Close all the loopholes.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the vote we are about to take is about \ncompromise. It is an attempt to try to get a bipartisan bill. It is \nabout finding common ground to resolve an issue vital to the Nation. We \nshould join together and show the American people that it is in a \nbipartisan manner that the Senate can responsibly deal with the issue \nof guns.\n  As a Senator who voted for the Brady bill, I understand the \nimportance of background checks. I understand the need to keep firearms \nfrom felons. I have long supported the concept of background checks at \ngun shows.\n  This amendment mandates that every gun transaction at a gun show must \ninclude a background check, period. There are no loopholes. This is not \na smokescreen. This is strict language, strong language, that will \nforce gun sellers and purchasers to follow responsible actions in \ntrading and selling guns.\n  The system we created with this amendment mandates that people \npurchase firearms legally and, therefore, go through the background \ncheck. It is time to tell gun owners and buyers to be responsible. It \nis time to show the Nation that we understand their concerns and we are \nacting.\n  The tragic shooting at Littleton and today in Atlanta further \ndemonstrates the need for both sides to come together and to work on \nthis issue to find a common solution to the escalating level of school \nviolence.\n  The amendment Senator Smith and I are offering will help ensure that \ntimely background checks are performed on a purchase of firearms at gun \nshows. The Smith-Jeffords amendment should bring this Senate together \nwith the common goal of any illegal firearm sales. The amendment is a \nbold, bipartisan step and should be adopted. Now is the time for \naction. Now is the time for reason to prevail over rhetoric. Now is the \ntime to show our Nation's parents that we can get together and end this \nsenseless violence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise first to thank the \ncosponsor of this amendment, Senator Jeffords; and also Senator McCain, \nwho was instrumental in helping me and others to bring attention to the \nneed to get a bill we can be proud of and that actually works.\n  Second, I extend my condolences, my thoughts, my prayers to the \npeople of Atlanta. I know whereof they suffer this terrible day. It was \na year ago, and a few days, that Oregon, in Springfield, at Thurston \nHigh School, suffered a similar tragedy. Now we must add Atlanta to the \nroll of Littleton and Springfield and Jonesboro and Paducah and many \nother places.\n  We stand here today as elected representatives of the people of the \nUnited States, to try to do right by them. But too often in this \nChamber the focus seems to suggest there is only one answer and that \nanswer is to go after guns. But the problem is so much deeper than \nthat. I am willing to admit there are things we can do, and things we \nare doing now, that will separate law-abiding citizens and gun owners \nfrom the fanatics and the kooks and the criminals, the dangerous and \nthe deranged in our society. We do not want them to have guns. We do \nnot want obtaining guns to be easy for them. But we want to construct a \nsystem that encourages the law abiding to come and participate in an \ninstant check, a system that encourages, that incentivizes, and does \nnot just regulate and drive things into the back alley and into the \nparking lot.\n  The amendment that Senator Jeffords and I offer today does two very \nsimple things. We do close the pawnshop loophole. We use the very \nlanguage of my colleague and friend from New York, Senator Schumer, to \ngo back to current ATF regulation to make sure if someone comes in and \nhocks his gun he cannot then go, commit a felony, and then retrieve \nthat gun without a background check. I have no intention of leaving \nthat loophole open. We are going to close it today.\n  Second, because there is a dispute as to the Hatch-Craig language in \nterms of licensees, we are clarifying that. We are saying simply those \nin the new Federal firearms dealer category of a ``special licensee'' \nmust comply with all dealer provisions of the Gun Control Act and \nalways do a background check with no exceptions.\n  This morning we have heard there are apparently 13 additional \nloopholes. Let me suggest the difference between our amendment and \ntheirs. What our amendment does is incentivize. What their amendment \ndoes is regulate. The special licensee, if he obeys the law, comes in \nand is entitled to an instant check, access to the instant check \nsystem. He is not charged a fee, because we are not interested in \nincreasing taxes here. He is immune from civil liability and fines of \nup to $10,000 and 5 years in prison. We are trying to get people to \nunderstand we want them to come in. We do not want to drive them into \nthe back alley and into the parking lot and into the street. We want \nthem to come in, in the light of day, because they are proud of their \nsecond amendment rights, and will protect their second amendment rights \nthrough instant check.\n  Let me tell you what else we do. There is a huge difference between \nthis amendment and the one my friend from New Jersey is proposing. He \nis allowing for 72-hour checks. If it takes 72 hours to get a \nbackground check, it is not an instant check. If you have ever been \npulled over for a traffic violation, you know the policeman will check \nyour car, check your license, check your registration, and he will find \nout if there is any additional reason, other than a traffic violation, \nto hold you. We have instant check now. Why do we not make instant \ncheck available to people who are exercising their second amendment \nrights? I want to be real clear: 72 hours is not an instant. We are \ngoing down to 24 hours because we want to incentivize this Government \nto finally go to work and produce instant check, make it available.\n\n  One of the most appalling revelations to come out of the tragedies of \nLittleton is that gun laws are not prosecuted by this administration. \nWe can pass all the laws in the world on guns but if they are not \nenforced they are of little value to this country. So, where it makes \nsense to add, we are adding. But we call on the administration also to \nenforce. If we enforce our laws, we will begin to make them \nefficacious; we will begin to change conduct.\n  But there is an important additional reason for supporting this \namendment versus that of the Senators from New Jersey. Many States, as \nwe speak, my own included, are debating the issue of gun shows, are \ndebating the issue of instant check. You and I know very well that law \nenforcement takes place where crimes occur, at the local level. There \nare Governors and legislators\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\nwho are working with gun advocates, gun opponents, and police forces \nwho are trying to come up with definitions that will work for their \nStates and their localities. That is happening as we are talking. It is \nhappening in my State. If we go to Senator Lautenberg's definition, all \nwe would do is nullify much of the work that has already been done and \nhas been passed into law. I am saying we should not do that. Because \nlaw enforcement, while we have a role, will remain primarily a local \nconcern because it is locally administered.\n  So I would like to trust the States, to leave them some room, some \ndiscretion to fix this problem on their terms, in ways that work in \ntheir communities. We cannot know it all here, even though we too often \npretend to. So, if you care about the issue of States rights and law \nenforcement, Smith-Jeffords is the way to vote. If you want Washington \nto dictate every principle and every definition, then Senator \nLautenberg's approach is the way to do it.\n  There is another reason. I talked about incentives. I congratulate \nthe Senator from New Jersey. His amendment today is much better than \nthe one I proudly voted against on Wednesday night. That one made sure \ntaxes were raised, Government bureaucracies were built, and everybody \nin sight got sued. What we are trying to do is not raise taxes, not \ngrow Government, and to provide some immunity, therefore some \nincentives to get people to comply with these laws. We call upon this \nadministration to enforce these laws.\n  I hope my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, will vote for this \namendment. We are using Senator Schumer's language. I thank him for \nthat. It works. It clarifies. It ties it up. But if you try to tighten \nevery loophole you see, I promise you the effect of your work today \nwill be to create a black market, an underground, a back alley \nbusiness, a parking lot exchange. I want them to come inside.\n  Because second amendment rights do come with second amendment \nresponsibilities, let's make it easier; let's not make it harder. We \nare doing this in this amendment. We are applying instant check, we are \ntrusting the States, and we are not growing Government. We are \nprotecting kids in the schools, we are protecting the second amendment \nright to bear arms, we are protecting law-abiding citizens, and we are \ngetting after the kooks and the criminals, the deranged and the \ndangerous who haunt our society, to make sure this is not a huge \nloophole that will give them access to dangerous weaponry.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment and vote against \nthe Lautenberg amendment. It is too much and it will drive this issue \ninto the back alley.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from New York?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield my remaining 5 minutes--I believe I \nhave 5 minutes--to the Senator from New York. He is going to speak \nright before the Senator from New Jersey who, under the original order, \nis guaranteed time in any event.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I now, in the 5 minutes yielded to me generously by the \nSenator from Vermont--I believe I have 20 minutes. I will speak for \n10--I will control 10 and yield 10 to the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. To be sure, the Parliamentarian may be able to tell \nus. How much time will we have on the Smith and Lautenberg amendments \ncombined?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe there are 20 minutes left, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 20 minutes total. The \nmajority has 15 minutes 58 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And the Senator yields----\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be yielding 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this morning while we are compromising with the gun \nlobby, ambulances are rushing to Heritage High School to save children \nfrom another shooting. It is profoundly disheartening. How much longer \nare we going to embrace the gun lobby instead of the mothers and \nfathers of America? Why are we compromising on such simple issues?\n  It should not have taken us a week to come to the view that we should \nclose the gun show loophole. It never should have been opened, and it \nnow should be closed, and it should be closed cleanly and simply by \npassing the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  We are making progress. At the beginning of the week, we started way \napart, and because of the American public, we have come closer and \ncloser together. I commend my colleague from Oregon. He has adopted \nlanguage which I believe closes the pawnshop loophole. That is a major \nstep in the right direction.\n  But, I say to my colleagues, there are other loopholes to close, and \nthis very morning when there has been another shooting, why are we \nafraid to close those as well?\n  There is the new 24-hour loophole when the instant check system does \nnot work, when the records are not immediately available, the FBI says \nthey need 72 hours to check to see if the person asking for the gun is \na felon. We now make it 24 hours. If a gun show is held on Saturday, \nthere is no way--no way--to check. So what we will have is felons \ngetting guns at gun shows. We will have children even being able to buy \nguns in many different ways.\n  The amendment of the Senator from New Jersey is simple. If we want to \ndo it, let's do it. Let's not do an elaborate minuet where we take one \nstep forward, two steps back, two steps forward, three steps back. That \nis what we have been doing this week. Yes, we are making progress, but \non such a modest amendment like closing the gun show loophole, why does \nit take us 7 days of debate? Why does it take three different fixes \nthat still do not close all the loopholes?\n\n  It is time for this body to come clean. It is time for this body to \nsimply say, yes, we believe in the right to bear arms, but we also \nbelieve there are practical limitations that do not interfere with the \nrights of legitimate gun owners that we can make, and we can make them \nforthrightly and cleanly without all of these tiny baby steps.\n  I guarantee you, the American people are fed up with compromises with \nthe gun lobby. Since the beginning of time, some teenagers have been \ncrazy and angry and mixed up and sometimes disturbed, but they have \nnever been armed. Until now, a teenager who was truly disturbed had his \nfists, and there might be a broken thumb and there might be black-and-\nblue eyes. There would not be dead children being taken out of our \nschools in every corner of America.\n  There are still loopholes, significant loopholes, that will be left \nin the law if we do not vote for the Lautenberg amendment. We can close \nthem. We can stand up to the gun lobby. If anything, the actions this \nmorning should have taught us that winking at the NRA and then smiling \nat the American people just produces more carnage.\n  It is not hard, it is not technically difficult, and it is not \nbureaucratic. The law for licensed dealers has worked since 1968. The \nBrady law has worked since 1993. It has prevented 250,000 felons from \nbuying guns. What are we saying now? At a gun show, maybe; the FBI \ndoesn't need 72 hours to check when it fails.\n  What the heck is going on in this country? Why do we let the gun \nlobby continue to pry open more loopholes for the Klebolds and the \nHarrises to crawl through? Because those who want to get guns for \nillicit purposes have ways to do it. Even if Lautenberg should be \nadopted--and I pray to God that it is--they will have means. But let's \nat least do our best to close those loopholes.\n  This week has been a week of both encouragement and discouragement \nfor the American people. There has been encouragement. Because of the \nefforts of the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Arizona, we are \nclosing the pawnshop loophole, but it is discouraging overall, Mr. \nPresident. It is discouraging that it takes us such time to close a \nsimple loophole like the gun show loophole and not do it cleanly and \nnot do it completely. It is discouraging that when we close certain \nloopholes, somehow we feel obligated to open two or three more. It is \ndiscouraging that the gun lobby still seems to rule the roost, not in \nAmerica, not in urban, suburban, or rural America, but here in this \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\n  I am going to support the Smith amendment because it does close the \npawnshop loophole, but I am going to vote for, and urgently and \nprayerfully urge my colleagues to support, the Lautenberg amendment \nbecause it does not open or leave open other loopholes.\n  This is a test of the soul of America. I watched television this \nmorning, and I said to myself: What is going on in America? The \nAmerican people are asking themselves not only what is going on in \nAmerica, they are asking, What is going on in the Senate of the United \nStates? Let us show courage. Let us step up to the plate. Let us be \nstrong, let us close the gun show loophole, let us not open new \nloopholes, and then let us move to do the other things that will \nprevent children and criminals from getting guns.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be an \nextra 6 minutes per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this morning we stand on the floor of the \nSenate in the wake of another shooting at a high school in America. My \ncolleague from New York has just said in rather plaintive but \nappropriate terms: What's wrong in America?\n  We know there is something desperately wrong. Yes, we struggle with \nthis problem here. I do not question the sincerity of anyone who comes \nto the floor today to debate this issue. But it is very important for \nsome of us to stand and make as clear as we possibly can the \ndifferences between the amendments about which we are talking.\n  The reason there are an alleged 13 loopholes in the Craig-Hatch \namendment is because there are 13 paragraphs, and the other side would \nsuggest the whole thing is a loophole. That is simply not true--it has \nnever been true--because, as the Senator from Oregon says, we are \nattempting to craft a very fine but important constitutional line \nbetween law-abiding citizens and their right to own guns unfettered by \na Federal Government and the criminal who will seek and find a gun \nanywhere he or she wants and, of course, the disaffected youth of \nAmerica who in some way find it necessary to express their frustrations \nor their sicknesses with the use of a firearm.\n  What the other side has not said, but what they whisper loudly, is: \nThe second amendment is a loophole. Let's wink and nod at it and then \ntry to close it up.\n  I cannot do that. I really do believe in our Constitution and I do \nbelieve that law-abiding citizens have rights. I must tell you, the \nother side is winking and nodding and saying: Oh, yes, they have \nrights, but we will close all of the doors up to that right and see if \nyou can find the key to get through.\n  So we came to the floor a week ago and began to strike a balance, \nrecognizing that those constitutional rights must stand supreme for the \nlaw-abiding citizen, because the law-abiding citizen, in owning a gun \nunder that right, accepts the responsibility of that gun.\n  The Senator from New York is right; all he wants to do will not stop \nthe criminal from getting a gun, because it never has. It is law \nenforcement that stops the criminal. It is the handcuff provision of \nthis bill that says to Janet Reno: Put your cops on the street and \narrest the criminal who uses the gun. Janet Reno, your record of law \nenforcement is dismal. You have winked and nodded at the law. And now \nit is time you wide-eyedly move to the streets and arrest the criminal \nwho uses the gun.\n  That is what the juvenile crime bill says. It says it loudly. It says \nit very clearly. Let's not wink and nod at our Constitution. Let's go \nat the criminal element of our society. Let's not create the kind of \nprovision that the Lautenberg amendment does. It is not 72 hours; it is \nthe old 3-day waiting period. Even that side said, once we get instant \ncheck, that goes away. That is what the law said. Now they want it \nback, even though we tried to honor our legal citizens by providing an \ninstant check system.\n  That is what the Congress has said for a decade: We will fund it. We \nwill implement it. And we will demand that it be used. The law-abiding \ncitizens, the gun owners of America, in gun-owning America, say: We \nagree. There is no argument there.\n  So as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee worked with his \ncommittee and here on the floor to craft a juvenile crime bill, it is \nso tragic that the other side tried to make it a gun control bill only.\n  Let's see what we did. We put juvenile Brady in the bill. We said to \nviolent juveniles: You lose all of your constitutional rights when you \nact violently as a juvenile felon.\n  We have gone after gangs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask my chairman for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We have gone after gangs. We have gone after the juvenile \noffender. We have built in youth protection. We are concerned about gun \nsafety.\n  This Senate has put in gun laws. The Senator from Vermont said: OK, \nif you don't believe Craig and Hatch, let's say it one more time for \nthe record: People who sell guns at gun shows will do background checks \non those who purchase guns.\n  I am sorry I sound as if I am stuttering, but that is what the other \nside demanded, that we say it again. And we have said it again. We have \nnot changed the law; we just said it again for the record. I hope that \nis enough.\n  We are going after crime control. We are giving our schools of \nAmerica the tools of safety. If they had those tools maybe in Georgia \nthis morning it might have worked.\n  So I hope we will withstand the vote on the Lautenberg amendment, \nvote it down, and let the Craig-Hatch amendment stand with its \ncorrections----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And serve the law-abiding citizens of America as we search \nout the criminal element.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of the Lautenberg amendment. It would close \na number of serious loopholes that were created by the Hatch-Craig \namendment. As the Hatch-Craig amendment stands today, any number of \nplaces where people could buy large quantities of guns would not be \ndeemed gun shows, would not be subject to these types of regulations. \nThe Lautenberg amendment closes that loophole.\n  The Lautenberg amendment would allow for 72 hours in certain \ncircumstances for background checks. That is absolutely necessary. As \nthe Senator from New York said, on a Saturday, when many of these gun \nshows take place, there is no possible way of doing a 24-hour \nbackground check.\n  It would also allow the individual who is a weapons dealer to be \nsubject to liability if they are not following the law. That is very \ncritical.\n  All of these provisions together are in the Lautenberg amendment. \nThat is an amendment the American people support overwhelmingly, \nbecause they want a structure of laws that actually protects their \nchildren and does not simply provide some slick cover for the gun \nlobby. They want their children protected. They want us to do it in a \nsensible way. They want us to pass laws which are not cynical exercises \nin self-preservation but will actually protect the children of America.\n  The Lautenberg amendment will do this. I strongly support it. Gun \ncontrol is absolutely essential to the process of protecting children, \nbut so many of these incidents we have seen--as just this morning--show \nthat we also need to take preventative action to ensure that children, \nwith or without access to firearms, do not feel self-destructive\n\n[[Page S5638]]\n\nand destructive of others. That is part of this overall legislation. In \nfact, we could do much more. Today we are here to make a clear choice \nbetween laws that work to protect children and an exercise in simply \nprotecting the gun lobby. I support the Lautenberg amendment.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the chairman, Mr. President.\n  The largest gun dealer in the State of Nebraska is Guns Unlimited. \nThe owner of that operation is a man by the name of Tom Nichols. I \nturned to Tom when this legislation was first introduced and when the \nissue of gun control came up because I trust him. I believe that he \nunderstands what works and what does not work.\n  As I said on this amendment when I first came to the floor, I have \nsupported things that work. If I believe it is going to make the public \nsafer, I will support it. If I don't think it will work, and that all \nwe are doing is sort of a political figleaf, which happens from time to \ntime on these issues, then I am not going to support it, because all we \nare going to do is add regulatory friction or interference with people \nwho are law-abiding citizens, and it is just an irritant; it does not \ndo anything other than perhaps make our press releases sound a little \nbit better.\n  But I asked Tom about this amendment. I have great respect for the \nSenator from Oregon and the Senator from Vermont. I think they have \ncome a long way in closing the loophole on pawnshops, which is very \nimportant, because oftentimes people who are criminals or who have guns \nthat they have stolen will go to a pawnshop and pawn the gun. They need \nto have a background check done.\n  There is still a significant weakness in this amendment. Again, I \nurge colleagues to vote for the Smith-Jeffords amendment--or is it \nJeffords-Smith, whatever it is. I urge them to vote for that and to \nvote for the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment.\n  Here is the reason why. In the words of Tom Nichols, the owner of the \nlargest gun shop in the State of Nebraska--he sells more handguns and \nother kinds of guns than anybody in the State of Nebraska--80 percent \nof the people who come in to buy a gun in his shop are cleared in 24 \nhours. The instant check system gets them just like that. These are the \nlaw-abiding citizens. These people have absolutely nothing in their \nbackground at all that would indicate there is any kind of a problem. \nBut, he said, the people of greatest concern aren't those 80 percent. \nThe people of greatest concern are the ones who take a longer period of \ntime, require a special agent to get into their background to find out \nwhat is going on.\n  If it is only 24 hours, what is going to happen is, yes, the law-\nabiding citizens will be OK; you will clear those out with no trouble \nat all. But those aren't the people who are the problem. Those people \nare getting cleared out in the 24-hour instant check, just like that. \nIt is the people who require a little bit more work who are the ones we \nwant to deny the opportunity to own a gun.\n  I urge colleagues, as they come down here, if you really want to try \nto change the law to increase public safety, my recommendation is to \nvote for the amendment offered by the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenator from Vermont, but then also vote for the amendment which has \nbeen offered by the Senator from New Jersey and myself. Ask your own \ngun dealers why and who and what happens with that additional 48 hours. \nThey will tell you. The answer is, that is when you get the people who \nare the biggest problem. That is when you create the most public safety \nwith the Brady bill background checks.\n  I understand that this issue has been highly charged and there has \nbeen a lot of heat and rhetoric and hard feelings on both sides which \nhas occurred as a consequence of that. But if you are trying to write a \nlaw that will increase public safety, that will decrease the number of \nAmericans who are either felons or dangerous or have something else in \ntheir background but own guns, I urge Senators to vote for both of \nthese amendments, which we will have an opportunity to do, I guess, in \nabout 10 minutes.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New Jersey and others who have taken \nthe leadership on this. I thank, again, Tom Nichols from Guns Unlimited \nin Nebraska. You put yourself out a little bit in this kind of \nsituation. He is basically saying we need to have a level regulatory \nplaying field. You have 2,000 or 3,000 gun shows a year. The Senators \nfrom Oregon and Vermont will allow instant checks for those gun shows, \nbut we need that other 48 hours in order to be able to level the \nplaying field between licensed gun dealers and gun shows. That is all \nwe are doing.\n  There is no more money that they will be paying in, no more \nregulatory burden. It merely levels the playing field so people who buy \na gun in a gun show and people who buy a gun from a licensed dealer \nwill have to go through the same thing. If you want to make Americans \nsafe, I urge you to vote for both of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, may I inquire, how much time remains on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 16 minutes, and the \nSenator from New Jersey has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is there anybody on their side who cares to speak at this \ntime, or should I?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to give the proponents time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to do that.\n  We are hearing a lot in the media and on the floor of the Senate \ndemonizing those who believe in the second amendment, those who strive \nto protect the rights of American citizens. The sincere steps taken \ntoday to try to find a middle ground are slapped aside by some. And, \nquite frankly, I find that to be discouraging and dispiriting.\n  I still hold out hope that the Littleton shooting can bring out the \nbest in all of us. We have come together on some issues and have before \nus a bill that responds to Littleton and does so in a way which \nrespects the rights of law-abiding citizens. But to suggest, as one of \nour colleagues did yesterday, that in defending the second amendment \nrights of law-abiding citizens the Senate is ``whistling past the \ngraveyard of Littleton'' is contemptible, in my view. Given what is in \nthis bill already, how can anyone in good conscience really say such a \nthing.\n  If today's shooting in Atlanta isn't a wake-up call to those who want \nto play politics with this bill, I don't know what is.\n  Americans still believe that gun ownership is a basic right of our \npeople. If any community would change its views as a result of the \nLittleton shooting, it would be the residents of Colorado, where prior \nto the shooting 70 percent believed firearms ownership was a basic \nright. Has support for gun control increased in Colorado? No, just the \nopposite. A recent poll found that 75 percent of Coloradans believe gun \nownership is a basic right. The people of Colorado and elsewhere \nrecognize that this is a complex problem and that going on a gun \ncontrol feeding frenzy is not the answer. Those who think otherwise \nshould take a deep breath, take stock in what we have accomplished to \ndate with this bill, and bring this bill to passage, because this bill \ncan have a dramatic effect on helping us to resolve some of these \nproblems with teen violence in our society today.\n  We have had a vigorous and lengthy debate about gun shows and how \nbest to limit criminal access to guns at these shows. There have been \nnumerous unnecessary delays on this matter. Today I hope we can bring \nclosure on this matter. This is an evolving process. After several days \nof debate last week, Republicans took a step to require background \nchecks at gun shows without substantial cost and without overregulatory \nburdens.\n  We all realize our duty to do what is best for our children and to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States, including the second \namendment. We all realize that the political benefits of scoring \ndebating points lasts only for the hour, while the real benefits of \nprotecting our children last for a lifetime.\n  The evolutionary process continues. The supporters of the Lautenberg \namendment have made changes to their proposal to bring it closer to our\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\nplan, and we are proposing the Smith-Jeffords amendment to deal with \nthe pawnshop exemption and to clarify the special licensee provision. \nOur plan, however, does not impose substantial disincentives to obey \nthe law. My sense and hope is that our efforts will continue to evolve \nand that we will be able to find common ground, a common ground that \nprotects the rights of law-abiding citizens to legally use guns but \npunishes criminals who illegally use guns.\n  There is one firearm-related provision on which I hope we can reach \nbipartisan agreement. That is the treatment of pawnshops that have \ntraditionally been exempt from the requirement to conduct background \nchecks when they simply return a firearm to its owner.\n  Contrary to what the distinguished Senator from Nebraska said, if a \nstolen gun is pawned, it will be discovered when the gun comes into the \npawn shop. State law requires pawn shops to notify state or local law \nenforcement agencies concerning the gun. These state and local agencies \nthen check to determine if the gun is stolen. If the gun is stolen, the \npolice can investigate and, if necessary, arrest the pawning customer. \nThis all happens before the gun is returned to the customer and thus, \nbefore a Federal background check would be required.\n  The pawn shops protested the 1993 Brady law that required them to do \na federal background check in addition to the state check they were \nalready doing. Further, they complained about the 3-day waiting period. \nIf a pawn shop had to wait 3 days under the orginal Brady law to \nconduct a federal background check, it could not return the gun to the \ncustomer when the customer repaid the loan. That is why Congress \namended the Brady law in 1994 to exempt pawn shops from the requirement \nto do a federal background check.\n  The Craig amendment which we passed last Wednesday simply restored \nthe exemption for pawnshops that had been part of the Brady law for 4 \nyears and had been approved by some notable people, even some here on \nthis floor. Thus, the Craig amendment did not effect a major change in \nlaw, but a change back to how the Brady law read from 1994 to November \n1998 when the exemption lapsed as the instant check system became \neffective.\n  As I have stated repeatedly, it is my goal to find common ground on \nthese issues. Wherever possible, I want to do what is best for our \nchildren and for the public, which is consistent with our oath as \nSenators to uphold the Constitution. Frankly, I viewed the pawn shop \nprovision as a technical matter, one which should not be politicized. I \nam glad that Senators Smith and Jeffords have made a bipartisan \nproposal to resolve this matter so that both sides can get together.\n  With respect to special licensees, last Wednesday the Senate passed \nthe Craig amendment which provided that persons who wished to engage in \nthe business of selling firearms but just at guns shows must obtain a \nspecial Federal license to do so. Subsequently, however, my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle complained that the Craig amendment was \nnot clear enough in requiring special licensees to conduct background \nchecks. We have looked at the language and think it is clear.\n  Nonetheless, to address the concerns of our colleagues, I offered a \nsimple one-page amendment last Friday which made it absolutely clear, \nbeyond any shadow of a doubt, that special licensees were subject to \nthe background check provisions of the Gun Control Act. Unfortunately, \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle rejected this \nclarification. Instead of dealing with their concern, they wanted to \ndebate it, and, boy, have they debated it.\n  Today the Smith-Jeffords amendment contains the clarification I \noffered last Friday with a bit more explanation. It states:\n\n       Except as to the State and local planning and zoning \n     requirements for a licensed premises as provided in \n     subparagraph (D), a special licensee shall be subject to all \n     of the provisions of this chapter applicable to dealers, \n     including, but not limited to, the performance of an instant \n     background check.\n  The key language of the amendment states:\n\n       A special licensee shall [not might, but shall] be subject \n     to all [not some, but all] of the provisions of this chapter \n     applicable to dealers, including but not limited to, the \n     performance of an instant background check.\n\n  This could not be any clearer. Special licensees must perform a \nbackground check before selling a firearm at a gun show. So let's get \nrid of the talk about loopholes.\n  The Smith-Jeffords amendment deals in a bipartisan fashion with the \npawn shop exemption and with the clarification of the requirement for \nspecial licensees to perform background checks.\n  There has been a lot of talk about loopholes, and the Smith-Jeffords \namendment should lay most of that talk to rest. But the biggest \nloophole for criminals is the lack of enforcement of criminal laws that \ncurrently exist by our Attorney General and this administration. If we \nin Congress pass a law prohibiting a criminal transaction, it is the \nduty of the Attorney General to enforce it. But she has not. Our bill \nincludes the CUFF program to fund more prosecutions of gun crimes and \norders the Attorney General to report on her progress in prosecuting \ngun crimes. By enforcing criminal statutes, we can protect our children \nand our schools. If a criminal knows that the statutes we pass will not \nbe enforced, however, we expose our children to more crime.\n  Let me make a point with these charts. Is this a record to be proud \nof in this administration? We are quoting the Executive Office of the \nU.S. Attorneys for these figures. Prosecutions under the Brady Act \nbackground checks: In 1996, zero. They claim that the Brady Act stopped \n200-some-odd-thousand felons from getting guns. There was not one \nprosecution in 1996, not one prosecution in 1997, and just one \nprosecution in 1998.\n  If there is a loophole, it is in the failure of the Attorney General \nand the Justice Department to enforce the laws that are already on the \nbooks. Yet, you hear this hue and cry for more gun control laws. But \nthis is only for political purposes because they know that their own \nAttorney General will not enforce these laws.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I wonder if the Senator can address this. He is \ninto this issue, but I think we have to answer the question the Senator \nfrom Nebraska has raised, Why do you need the 3 days, 72 hours?\n  My point really is this. I wonder if this amendment isn't so \nregulatory that it really isn't trying to end gun shows, and not an \nattempt to provide the service that we are asking be provided. If they \nfind that there is a question, shouldn't the Justice Department, the \nFBI, deny the check in 24 hours, 1 hour, or whenever it occurs, and \nthen go investigate it?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator really poses an interesting question. The \ncurrent law requires no background check for sales at gun shows between \nnon-licensed individuals. For sales by dealers, however, an Instant \nCheck background check is required. If there is a question, the FBI \ngets 3 days to resolve the question. Of course, because a gun show \ngenerally lasts only 3 days, the show will be over by the time the FBI \nis through checking.\n  Our bill requires the FBI to resolve any question within 24 hours. \nThis strikes a balance between the time constraints of a gun show and \nthe time needed by the FBI to resolve any Instant Check question.\n  Further, this is an evolving process. As technology advances and more \nrecords are placed on the Instant Check database, the FBI will be able \nto resolve any question in less than 24 hours.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the Senator will yield for another question. \nAs chairman of the Judiciary Committee, don't you believe that if the \nJustice Department needed more resources to do this to provide the \nservice, we would find the ways and means to accommodate them?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator makes a good point. As chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, I will work with the FBI and the ATF to ensure \nthey have the resources to get the job done. We will do everything in \nour power to find the means to solve these problems.\n  Mr. President, with respect to the Attorney General's prosecution \nrecord, this is not a record to be proud of--this business of \nprosecutions under Brady. There were zero in 1996, zero in 1997,\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nand one in 1998. Yet, they want new laws. We are not enforcing the laws \nwe already have.\n  Is this a record to be proud of? Prosecutions for transfer of \nhandguns or ammunition to a juvenile: This Justice Department, in 1996, \nhad nine prosecutions. We have had that many shootings in the last \nshort while. In 1997, five prosecutions. In 1998, six prosecutions. Why \naren't we enforcing the laws that already exist instead of making \npolitical points to have a whole bunch of other laws that there is a \nquestion whether the Justice Department will enforce?\n  Let me go into this one. Is this a record to be proud of by this \nadministration? Prosecutions for possession or discharge of a firearm \nin a school zone. Think about that. In 1996, four prosecutions; in \n1997, five; in 1998, eight.\n  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could enforce the laws that are \nalready on the books? We would not have nearly the problems we have \ntoday. By the way, this business of prosecutions for transfer of a \nhandgun or ammunition to a juvenile, and others, there are thousands of \ncases that they know of and there are only these limited number of \nprosecutions.\n  Well, Mr. President, the plain fact of the matter is that the revised \nLautenberg amendment, though improved to look more like the Republican \nproposal, is still not as good as the current bill as amended.\n  The revised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide qualified \nimmunity to persons who obey the law and act appropriately with \nfirearms, even after the Senate voted on it yesterday to provide \nqualified immunity when parents properly use child safety locks. The \nrevised Lautenberg amendment still fails to provide tax relief to \nlicensees and others who perform background checks. And the revised \nLautenberg amendment still fails to relieve gun show organizers of \nsubstantial new recordkeeping requirements. It is very unfair.\n  Thus, the revised Lautenberg amendment is a small step in the right \ndirection, and I sincerely appreciate that step. However, in my view, \nit fails to go far enough.\n  The revised Lautenberg amendment will change an unregulated market \ninto a very heavily regulated market overnight. In fact, by imposing \nthis much regulation, without providing any immunity or tax protection, \nand without any provision for licensing temporary dealers, the revised \nLautenberg amendment will create a black market in gun trading, because \npeople will not go to the gun shows, they will go into the streets and \ndo it. By creating a black market in gun trading, the revised \nLautenberg amendment will inevitably promote gun sales where there are \nno Federal licenses, no records, and no background checks. We do not \nneed a black market, but we need a free market with reasonable, \nnonburdensome regulations where buyers and sellers have incentives to \ncomply with the law.\n  Mr. President, the current bill with the Smith-Jeffords amendment \nwill strike the appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of \nlaw-abiding citizens to own, buy, and sell lawful products and the \npublic interest in preventing criminals from obtaining guns. The \npowerful incentives included in our plan will ensure that persons will \ncomply with the mandatory background check requirement on all sales at \nevery gun show. The Republican plan also gives law-abiding gun owners \nthe peace of mind that they have not inadvertently transferred a \nfirearm to a felon, and strongly encourages the Attorney General to \nbegin prosecuting the criminals who have violated the existing gun \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, this juvenile justice bill is too important to our \ncountry's schools, parents, and children to be held up by endless \ndebates.\n  Only this morning, we heard of another shooting in Georgia. So far, \nthank goodness, there have been no reports of death.\n  We have to stop debating and pass this bill. We have had enough \ndelays. We need to protect our students and our schools now. We in the \nSenate have an opportunity to take a major step toward protecting our \nchildren by passing the juvenile crime bill. Our country needs it. We \nshould do it in a bipartisan way, and we need to do it today.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate has spent the past week \nattempting to clean up the mess that our Republican colleagues have \nmade over the gun show loophole. Now, again we have a chance to do the \njob correctly, by closing the gun show loophole the right way, not the \nNRA way.\n  As they say in the circus, it's a big job cleaning up after a big \nelephant, especially when the National Rifle Association is the trainer \nof the elephant.\n  The first two attempts by our Republican colleagues to close the gun \nshow loophole were a travesty. They left the loophole open, and they \ncreated new loopholes while they were doing it.\n  While the Senate dithers, the need grows greater. Gun violence has \nstruck again at one of the nation's schools--this time at a school in a \nsuburb of Atlanta.\n  Enough is enough. We will decide today whether the United States \nSenate is serious about closing the gun show loophole, or whether we \nwill continue to allow young people to have almost unlimited access to \nguns.\n  The Lautenberg amendment will close this deadly loophole in our gun \nlaws, and close it all the way, not just part of the way.\n  The Smith amendment only goes part way. It closes the loophole our \nRepublican friends opened for pawn shops last week--but it leaves \nunchanged the other serious loopholes that put guns in the wrong hands \nat gun shows.\n  Our Republican colleagues still refuse to close another major \nloophole they created last week--the 24 hour loophole, which makes a \nfarce out of the background checks on gun purchasers.\n  These background checks have kept thousands of guns out of the hands \nof criminals and others who have no business owning guns. But the NRA \nopposes that law, so it wants to undermine it in a way that will \nprotect illegal transactions at gun shows.\n  The Lautenberg amendment closes this loophole too.\n  Our Republican colleagues still refuse to close a third loophole they \ncreated last week, which makes it much more difficult for police to \ntrace guns used by criminals. They have set up a new class of gun \ndealers called ``special registrants,'' who can sell as many guns as \nthey want to anyone they want, without keeping the records needed to \ntrace guns used in crimes.\n  The Lautenberg amendment closes this loophole, too.\n  Since the tragedy in Littleton, parents and children across the \ncountry have lived in fear that their school--their community--could be \nnext. Now, it has happened in Georgia. On some days in recent weeks, \nparents have kept their children away from school in an effort to \nshelter them from violence.\n  Families cannot continue to live this way--in constant fear that \ntheir children and their school could be the next gun battleground.\n  There is only one way to close the gun show loophole, and that's to \nadopt the Lautenberg amendment.\n  In a few minutes, we will have two important votes. The Senate can \nact on the urgent needs of the American people, or it can continue to \nplay ostrich--head in the sand, ignoring the national crisis of gun \nviolence.\n  It is clear that the overwhelming majority of the American people \nwant Congress to pass responsible gun control measures. Eighty-nine \npercent of the people say that it is important for this country to pass \nstricter gun control laws.\n  Now, we have the opportunity to get it right. Gun laws work. The \nfacts speak for themselves. It is time--long past time--for the Senate \nto act, to say enough is enough is enough is enough.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey and hope his amendment will be \naccepted.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, first of all, want to say to my \ncolleagues on the other side--to Senator\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\nSmith, to Senator Jeffords, to Senator Gregg, to Senator Hatch--I \nreally do appreciate the fact that they are trying to arrive at a \nconsensus. I think what was said in the earlier presentation was that \nit is a bipartisan agreement. I wonder whether parents in Littleton, \nCO, care whether it is bipartisan or not, or whether it is a compromise \nor not. What they want to make sure of is that it never happens again, \nas it did this morning in Georgia.\n  It is a pity we are discussing whether or not there is too much \nregulation, or whether or not the law enforcement people are hard at \nwork. I want them to look at the statistics. We will talk about that in \njust a minute. That is not the issue. The issue is, do you want to save \nlives, or do you want to save the NRA? Do you want to permit them to \ncontinue to oppose all sensible legislation?\n  There are people sitting here, I am sure, who have children at home \nand they don't want to worry about them when they go to school. That is \nthe issue. What are we talking about here? Eighty-nine percent of the \nAmerican people say they want the gun loopholes closed--finally shut. \nWhat do you think the percentage might be out of Georgia today, or out \nof Colorado, or out of Pearl, MS; or Paducah, KY; or Springfield? What \ndo you think the percentage of those families are? I will bet you it is \n100 percent.\n  We know one thing. It was admitted by the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, or at least suggested--not admitted. He said 40 percent of the \npeople who buy guns at gun shows do so without any identification at \nall. ``Buyers anonymous.'' Buy your gun. Don't tell anybody who you \nare. Forty percent, by my calculation. It is around 800,000 guns a \nyear. Maybe I am wrong by 100,000 or 150,000. Over 5 million handguns \nare sold in this country each and every year.\n  Mr. President, I want us to stand up to the American people and say \nwe care more about your kids; we care more about your family; we care \nmore about violence in this country than we do about whether or not \nthis one gets credit, or whether it looks like we are imposing an extra \nburden.\n  I want to talk about the burdens for just a moment and talk about \nFederal gun prosecutions. The distinguished Members on that side will \nsay they are down. I would tell you this: Twenty-five percent more \ncriminals are sent to prison for State and Federal weapons offenses \nthan in 1992. That is because we work more closely with our partners in \nState and local law enforcement.\n  Look at the result. Stop looking at the process. Look at where we \nwant to come out. Overall violence and property crimes are down by 20 \npercent. The murder rate is down 28 percent--the lowest level in 30 \nyears. We have accomplished something. Do you know why? Because we are \nasking questions about guns. Yes. There are things wrong in our \nculture. There certainly are. But I look at our culture, and I look at \nother nations which are well developed. We have 35,000 Americans killed \neach year with firearms compared to 15 in Japan--15 people--30 in Great \nBritain. Just take the murder side of that--homicides, almost 14,000; \nsuicides, 18,000. That happens, I guess, in other countries. But I am \nsure it doesn't happen to the same extent with guns.\n  When we hear our friends decrying this extension of time that is \nneeded to get your mitts on a gun, why should we slow down the process? \nSomebody wants a gun. They give it to them. That is what they are \nsaying.\n  I will tell you something. If they read the law carefully--the \nLautenberg law--then they would see that the law limiting enforcement \nto 24 hours for gun show background checks is only if--72 hours; \nforgive me--only if there is some detection in the first minutes that \nsomething is wrong. If there is nothing wrong, you can have a gun in 5 \nminutes. Is that quick enough? Is a day quick enough? I think it is \nquick enough for the American people. Ask those in Littleton and ask \nthem in other places how quickly the guns ought to be available.\n  No, Mr. President, we are missing the boat. We are arguing about \nprocess while we are exposing more and more of our kids to \naccessibility to guns. It is not right. The Lautenberg amendment closes \nthe loopholes once and for all.\n  Again, I commend Senators Smith and Jeffords for closing the pawnshop \nloophole, but they don't close all of the loopholes. There is still \nlimited liability for gun sellers. There are still people who are going \nto be able to buy guns without registering them. They are not \nregistering without going through a background check. They are not \ninsisting that everybody go through a background check, and they are \nnot insisting that 24 hours be extended to 72 for normal purchases.\n  I think what we ought to do is say once and for all--I hope my \ncolleagues will respond--to the American people, enough of the debate \nabout the process. The process is fair.\n  We are not talking about increasing taxes.\n  We are not talking about increasing the bureaucracy.\n  I would like to mention one thing--that even as our friends talk \nabout more enforcement being the difference, the fact is that when we \ntried to hire 280 new ATF agents, requesting over $10 million to hire \nthose people, and over 40 new Federal prosecutors as well, the NRA has \nnever supported backing its tough talk with real money for State, local \nand Federal law enforcement agencies to investigate, arrest and \nprosecute. They like to talk about it here. But they don't want to pay \nfor it.\n  It is time to face up to reality. One is we are going to probably \npass the Smith-Jeffords amendment with an overwhelming vote. That is \nOK, because it starts the process. But it doesn't complete the process. \nThe process will be complete when the Lautenberg amendment is passed, \nand I hope we have enough courage in this room to stand up and say, \n``Yes, I vote for the Lautenberg amendment.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the President.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah has 42 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  The fact of the matter is that the overwhleming majority of instant \nchecks can be completed in a matter of minutes. If the instant check \nsystem approves the purchase, it will do so quickly. If the instant \ncheck system disappoves the purchase, it will do so quickly. The \nproblem is the portion that instead of being approved or disapproved, \nraise a question. Under the 24-hour rule, the Justice Department has to \nwork harder to resolve questions for gun show instant checks. This is \nbecause the gun show will be over in 3 days. If you allow 3 days to \nresolve questions for gun show checks, the questions will not be \nresolved until after the gun show is over. It means private people are \ngoing to take their guns to the streets and sell them there. It means a \nblack market. It means more problems--more accessibility to those who \nare unsavory in our society to guns.\n  I can't imagine why people can't see this, because it is as clear as \nthe nose on anybody's face. The politics of it is more important than \nseeing the truth.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin make a unanimous consent request not related to this \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on the rollcall vote on the McConnell amendment No. \n365 to S. 254, I voted no. I ask unanimous consent that I be recorded \nas voting in favor of the McConnell amendment. Changing my vote will \nnot affect the final outcome of that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope Senators in voting for Smith-\nJeffords will realize it is only a baby step towards background checks.\n  If they really want to close all 13 loopholes, they also have to vote \nfor the Lautenberg amendment.\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, very simply, we have just made a decision to close a \ncouple of the loopholes that existed before on gun show sales, and I \ncommend the Senators who offered the amendment. But we are still left \nwith significant numbers of people who do not have to have a background \ncheck, and that is not the way we want to do it. We want to close all \nthe loopholes.\n  They have insisted we remove the 72-hour window for investigation of \nbackgrounds, and that is only triggered if there is something that \ndiscredits the individual. Otherwise, it is 24 hours or less. If there \nis nothing on the person's record, the sale goes through.\n  It is hard to imagine why we cannot take enough time to investigate \nthe prospective buyer sufficiently to make sure we are protecting our \npeople.\n  That is the issue, and I hope our friends on the Republican side who \nvoted with us last time will continue to vote with us. We could have \nwon this several times if we had support from the Republican side of \nthe aisle. I hope they will demonstrate to the American people that \nthere is concern about limiting access to guns as the citizens of the \ncountry want us to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have debated this at length. The \nLautenberg amendment creates more loopholes. It will be more expensive. \nIt is going to increase taxes.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the supplemental appropriations conference report and there \nbe 3 hours for debate, to be equally divided in the usual form, and \nthat it be in order for Senator Gramm to raise a point of order against \nthe conference report, and at that point there be 30 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form on the motion to waive.\n  I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time \nand the disposition of the motion to waive the Budget Act, if \nsuccessful, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \namend the consent agreement to allow me to offer a bill immediately \nfollowing the adoption of the conference report regarding an across-\nthe-board cut in nondefense discretionary spending to offset the \nsupplemental appropriations conference report. I understand that the \nconference committee has been disbanded since the House of \nRepresentatives has voted to adopt the conference report. Therefore, I \nunderstand that it will require unanimous consent for the conference \nreport to be amended.\n  Having said that, I now ask unanimous consent that following the \nadoption of the conference report, I be recognized to offer a bill that \nwould call for an across-the-board cut in nondefense discretionary \nfunding to offset\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nthe supplemental appropriations conference report, and there be 30 \nminutes for debate on the bill, to be equally divided, and no \namendments or motions in order.\n  I further ask consent that immediately following the use or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are proceeding under a \nreservation of the right to object. Senator Enzi was explaining his \nreservation, and he is asking to be recognized to offer a bill that \nwould call for an across-the-board cut in the appropriations process in \norder to pay for the additional funding here. Is that the gist of the \nSenator's reservation of the right to object?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. There are a few questions we want to ask in regard to \nreserving this.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, \nI want to note my support for what Senator Enzi is stating, and that I \nam concerned that what we have in the underlying bill is not paid for \nand we ought to have appropriate offsets to this supplemental. It is an \nimportant supplemental bill, but I am reserving the right to object and \nI am saying that we should pay for this. It should be offset with other \ncuts in nondefense discretionary and domestic spending.\n  We have a $15 billion supplemental appropriations bill. We are asking \nin the nondefense areas that there be offsets to that. This is not a \nmajor thing for us to do. I think it is fully appropriate that we move \nforward and have offsets taking place in this supplemental bill. There \nis important spending taking place in the supplemental that I think is \nappropriate. There is some for my home State and the disaster we had. \nBut let's pay for it. That is why I am reserving the right to object.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, also reserving the right to object, I \nshare Senator Enzi's concern and making this UC request to introduce a \nbill that would allow us to have offsets. We have an appropriations \nbill, as so often is the case with these emergency spending bills that \ncome before us, traveling like a freight train. The ``freight train'' \nhas little stowaways hidden all through it. So in the very short period \nof time that I began to look at some of the little stowaways hidden on \nthis ``freight train,'' I found $1.8 million for safety renovations of \nthe O'Neill House Office Building, $1.9 million for the Northeast \nMulti-Species Fishery, $250,000 for the L.A. Civic Center, $1.5 million \nfor the University of DC, and $3.76 million for the House page \ndormitory. These may all be good things, but they are certainly not \ngoing through the right process.\n  There is $100 million for aid to Jordan; $77 million to the Census \nBureau, Postal Service, USTR, et cetera. The Office of the Special \nTrustee for American Indians gets $22 million. I don't see how that can \nbe termed an emergency coming before us. There is $8 million dollars \nfor an access road to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. On and \non go these little stowaways. There is a high school, White River High \nSchool, which receives $239,000.\n  The point is, Mr. President, we have a process that is being \nperverted, a process that is being circumvented.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order has been called for.\n  Is there objection to the request of the majority leader?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Reserving the right to object, I also rise in strong \nsupport of Mr. Enzi----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no right to reserve the right \nto object when the regular order has been called for. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of the objection, I renew my request for time \nagreements on the supplemental conference report, as stated earlier in \nmy remarks, with 15 minutes of the Democrats' time under Senator Dorgan \nand 10 minutes of the Republican time under Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what we have now--if I could explain it to \nthe Senate--we have set aside the juvenile justice bill for now. We are \ngoing to do the supplemental appropriations bill. We have a 3-hour time \nagreement with some specific time set up for individual Senators. We \nalso have a waiver of a point of order, with 30 minutes of time equally \ndivided on that.\n  So there will be a vote on that point of order and, I presume, the \nvote on final passage. At that point, it is our intention to go back to \nthe juvenile justice bill.\n  I say to the Senators who reserved their right to object, I certainly \nunderstand why they are doing it. I appreciate it and I want to support \ntheir effort. There is no question that more of this bill should have \nbeen offset. I know the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who \nis probably in the vicinity, does not agree with that. But I have \nindicated all along I thought there should be more offsets. To Senators \nEnzi and Brownback, Hutchinson, Grams, and perhaps Sessions--and I am \nnot quite sure if Senator McCain is here to raise that concern also--I \ncertainly am sympathetic, but there was objection heard from Senator \nDorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to observe that the unanimous consent proposal \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming had not been cleared on our side. \nWe were constrained to object. I also observe, if we are going to \nestablish an order for legislation to be brought to the floor following \ndisposition of the supplemental, for example, we may want to bring to \nthe floor the proposed amendment that died in conference committee by a \n14-14 vote dealing with the agricultural fund.\n  Our point was that there are other priorities as well. But the \nunanimous consent request had not been served on our side. That is why \nwe were constrained to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wonder if other Senators want me to yield.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5643-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5643-S5667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   1999 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 1141) making emergency supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for \nother purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1141), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report. (The conference report is \nprinted in the House proceedings of the Record of May 14, 1999.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is the conference report accompanying \nH.R. 1141 before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That conference report is not amendable? There are no \namendments in disagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I first want to start off by commending \nthe chairman of the House committee, Congressman Bill Young, for his \nleadership in the conference on this bill. He was the chairman of this \nconference, and through his efforts we have achieved passage not only \nby the House but we achieved the result of getting a bill out of \ncommittee. Chairman Young and I have worked very closely in the past. \nHe chaired the defense subcommittee before becoming chairman of the \nfull committee. I look forward to continuing that partnership during \nhis tenure as chairman of the House committee.\n  We face a difficult task in reconciling the funds needed to respond \nto hurricane damage in Central America, the\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency and agriculture disasters--those \nFEMA disasters are national disasters declared by the President--and \ncontinued military operations in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Iraq, and in the \nhigh state of alert in South Korea.\n  This is not an easy period to be chairman of this committee. We have \nwhat amounts to four major crises going on at one time. We are trying \nto maintain our defense capabilities to preserve our interests \nworldwide. This is very difficult, apparently, for some Members to \nunderstand. It is a difficult process, at best, to handle a \nsupplemental and an emergency bill together, but it does take \nconsideration of the Members of the Senate to understand which versions \nin these bills are emergency and which are just a normal supplemental.\n  They have been joined together. The President has sent us two bills \nand the House has passed two bills. They address the needs and the \nformal requests of the President. The Senate passed one bill, the \nCentral American agriculture bill, in late March, prior to the Easter \nrecess. At that time, before the recess, I urged that we have a chance \nto come to the floor and pass that supplemental. We knew there was \ngoing to be a second supplemental, but we could not get the time on the \nfloor and the Senate did not act on the separate Kosovo package.\n  Due to the emergency nature of the funding for military operations \nand the availability of the first bill, it was our intention to merge \nthe two bills into a second single bill in conference, which we have \ndone. That is consistent with rules of the Senate and the House. These \nwere matters which were emergency in nature, and we have added them as \nemergencies.\n  Now, as I think Senators are aware, there are many ideas in how we \ncan address other needs in this bill. Supplemental bills have routinely \nbeen amended by both the House and the Senate. Questions have been \nraised about some of the matters in these bills--assuming that we have \nno right to add any amendments to emergency bills.\n  Now, this is both a supplemental and an emergency appropriations bill \nbefore the Senate. I hope Senators will keep that in mind. As most of \nthe Senators are aware, these matters are brought up by individual \nMembers of the Senate or the House and are considered and adopted by \nmajority vote. I am not that happy about some of the provisions of this \nbill but, again, I have the duty to carry to the Senate floor those \namendments that were included by action of the conferees. I hope \nSenators will keep that in mind as we proceed.\n  The conferees decided that some of these matters that are before the \nSenate and were presented to us should be reserved in the fiscal year \n2000 bill, which the Appropriations Committees will start marking up \nnext week. We cannot get to the regular appropriations bills until we \nconclude the action of the Congress on the supplemental and emergency \nmatters in the bill before the Senate now.\n  Again, I know there are objections to this bill; there are objections \nto the process we are following. Many of those objections are brought \nforward because we do not have a point of order against legislation on \nappropriations bills.\n  That is not my doing. I have sought to restore that point of order \nand I continue to support the concept of that point of order. But we \nhave several matters included in the Senate-passed version of the bill \nthat were deleted by the conference.\n  One of them was a matter that was very close to my heart, and that is \nthe Glacier Bay provision which was offered by my colleague, Senator \nMurkowski.\n  What I am saying is there are matters before the Senate some people \nobject to. There are matters not in the bill that people object to, and \none of them is that Alaska provision of my colleague. Obviously, a \nconference report is always a compromise. That is why we go to \nconference. We have disagreements with what the House has done, the \nHouse has disagreements with what we have done, and we meet in \nconference and try to resolve the problems.\n  This bill, for instance, contains more money for defense needs than \nwere proposed by the Senate. After we went to conference with the \nHouse, we concluded they were right in seeking additional moneys for \nour defense readiness. There is no question it also contains more \nfunding for refugees and for agricultural relief than was proposed by \nthe House. The House has come towards the position of the Senate on \nboth refugees and agriculture relief. Again, I think that is the \nprocess of compromise that should take place in a conference. This \nconference report needs to be passed today. The men and women of the \nArmed Forces must understand we support them, regardless of our points \nof view on the war that is going on in Kosovo.\n  Refugees ousted from their homes and their country by Serbian \natrocities need our help also. I was honored to be able to go with \nother Members of the Senate to visit Albania. We saw the camps in \nMacedonia. We visited with the President of Macedonia and the Prime \nMinister of Albania. We went to see our forces in Aviano--that is our \nair base in Italy--and we visited with the NATO people in Bosnia.\n  Many Senators here have also visited the region since that trip I \ntook with my colleagues and Members of the House. There were 21 of us \non the first trip. All the Senators who went there know what needs to \nbe done; there is no question in our minds. It is unfortunate we cannot \ntake more people over there to let them see it, because I think \nuniformly the people who saw the troubles over there are supportive of \nthis bill. We have provided additional funds in this bill for the \nKosovo operation and for the victims of the war there in Kosovo. They \nare sort of an insurance policy.\n  We have faced this in the past. We went into Bosnia. We were supposed \nto be there 9 months and be out by Christmas. That is 5 years ago this \nChristmas. We have had to add money every year, take money from various \nportions of our appropriations process and pay for the cost of Bosnia.\n  We also have increased the level of our activity in the Iraq area. \nEven during the period of the Kosovo operation, there continue to be \nretaliatory strikes on Iraq because of the their failure to abide by \nthe cease-fire agreement.\n  In South Korea, the North Koreans are continuing to rattle the cage, \nas far as we are concerned, and we are on a high level of alert in that \narea.\n  What I am telling the Senate again is this bill reflects those \npressures on our defense forces. We want those people who are defending \nthis country to know we support them when they are out there in the \nfield representing our interests. The funds provided in excess of the \nPresident's request are contingency emergency appropriations for \nagriculture, for defense, for FEMA and for the refugees. The amounts \nadded by the House and the Senate can only be submitted if the \nPresident declares an emergency requirement exists. We are going to get \ninto that question of the emergency requirement here when the Senator \nfrom Texas raises his point of order. But we worked in conference very \nhard to assure adequate resources will be available through the \nremainder of this fiscal year to meet the needs in the areas we \nvisited, in the Kosovo area, and to meet the needs of the military \nworldwide. Some of our systems are being taken from the areas I have \ndescribed before--from South Korea, even from Bosnia and from Iraq--to \nmove them into the area of the conduct of the hostilities in and around \nKosovo and Serbia. Those funds that are needed on a global basis are in \nthis bill. Some of them, as we know, the President did not request.\n\n  We believe we have taken action. Hopefully we will not have to see \nanother emergency supplemental with regard to the conduct of the Kosovo \noperation during the period of time we will be working on the regular \nappropriations bills for the year 2000. In effect, we have reached \nacross and gone in--probably this bill should be able to carry us, at \nthe very least to the end of this current calendar year. The initial \nrequests of the President took us to the end of the fiscal year on \nSeptember 30.\n  I am happy to inform the Senate I am told today the President will \nsign this bill as soon as it reaches his desk. He has specifically \nasked us to complete our work and pass the bill today. I understand he \nhas a trip planned and it would be to everyone's advantage if we get \nthis bill down to him today and\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\nhave it signed. Therefore, I am pleased we do have the unanimous \nconsent which does allow us to vote on this bill. I take it that will \nbe sometime around 3:20 we will vote on the bill.\n  I do earnestly urge every Member of the Senate to vote for this \nconference report. To not vote for this conference report because of \nsome difference, because of the process, would send the wrong message \nto the young men and women who represent this country in uniform. One \nof the things that impressed me when I was on the trips, both to Bosnia \nand into the Kosovo area, was if you go into the tents where these \nyoung people are living when they are deployed, do you know what you \nfind? You find computers. They are on the Internet.\n  Right now, some of them out there will be picking up just the words I \nam saying. We are not back in the period, like when I served in World \nWar II in China, when we did not hear from home but maybe once or twice \na month at the most. We had to really just search to find news of what \nwas going on at home and we were starved for news from home. These \npeople are force fed news from home and many times what they see are \nrumors that come across the Internet. We don't need any more rumors \ngoing out to the men and women serving in the Armed Forces overseas. In \nthis bill is the pay raise. We are committed that the money is there \nfor the pay raise. We have initiated the concept of reforming the \nretirement system, which was one of the gripes we heard last year both \nin Bosnia and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n  This is a bill the men and women of the armed services are watching. \nThey are going to watch how you vote on this bill. And they should. It \nis not time for petty differences over process or committee \njurisdiction. This is a time to act and give the people in the Armed \nForces the money they need so they know they will have the systems and \nthey will have the protections they need when they go in harm's way at \nthe request of the Commander in Chief.\n\n  I urge we not only vote to pass this bill, but Senators listen \ncarefully to this point of order the Senator from Texas will raise, as \nit is raised against specific provisions of this bill.\n  Mr. President, there is no question in my mind, as we look at this \nbill, it is a different bill. When I woke up this morning, I looked in \nRoll Call and I was interested to see the statistics on supplemental \nappropriations, 1976 through 1996. We had no supplementals in 1995. We \nhad one supplemental in 1996. I will get that number for 1997. People \nwho are saying we are having too many supplementals--they are just \nwrong. We have not had too many supplementals. We go through a process \nof predicting how much money we will need. The departments of the \nGovernment start the process of sending their requests to the President \nthrough their agencies. They come up in the department, they go to the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the President finally gets them \nsometime in September of the year before. In January or February, the \nbeginning of the year, the President submits his budget which will be \nmade available the following September, following October, going \nthrough the September of the next year.\n  In other words, what I am saying is this is the process. The money we \nare spending now on a routine basis started through the agencies in the \nfall of 1997, came into the departments in the spring of 1998, went \nthrough the President's process and got to OMB and were presented to \nus, in terms of a process, to have a bill for the year 2000 presented \nto us and considered in 1999.\n  This appropriations process is a long process. I hope I have not \nshortened it. But it is a very long process. In the process of trying \nto estimate the needs, things are overlooked, concepts are developed \nand, particularly in the defense field, new involvements of our \nmilitary erupt. Kosovo is a good example. We had no knowledge we would \nhave that kind of operation, an immense operation now, probably the \nlargest engagement we have had, in terms of this type of crisis, since \nthe Persian Gulf war. Actually, I think before we are over, it may be \nmore expensive than the Persian Gulf war was to the United States.\n  I recognize the comments that are coming, particularly from my side \nof the aisle, about greater consistency in our appropriations process. \nI want people to look at the record. We have not had an excess of \nsupplementals. We had an omnibus bill last fall, and most of the \ncomments made on this floor are about the two omnibus bills that ended \nup the fiscal year--the one my predecessor, Senator Hatfield, was \ninvolved with and the one last year with which I was involved.\n  In both instances, if the Senators look carefully, they will find the \nappropriations process reached a stalemate, and the stalemate had to be \nresolved on the leadership level with the President. That was not the \ntwo committees that added that money. It was a negotiation with the \nPresident, in both instances, by the leadership of the House and \nSenate, and I commend them for it. We had to get out of that impasse or \nwe would have had another impasse like we had previously when there was \nan attempt to shut down the Government.\n  When this Government is at war, it is not going to be shut down on my \nwatch. I want everyone to know that. We are not going to shut down the \nGovernment when there is a war going on. We are not even going to \nsuggest it. Anybody who does suggest it better understand he or she \nwill not be here for long. The American people will not stand for that. \nTheir sons and daughters are out fighting, and we ought to fight to get \nthem the support they need.\n  I am going to fight--I am going to fight as hard as I can --to get \nbills such as this through and keep funding the Department of Defense \nat the level it should be funded to assure their safety--not just \nnormal safety--but every single system we can adopt that will save the \nlives of the men and women in the armed services ought to be approved. \nThis is what this does. It gives them the money they need to carry \nthrough the remainder of this year.\n  This year is going to be a very tough year. Any one of those other \ncrises which are going on in Iraq, in Bosnia, in South Korea, or other \nplaces could erupt. I was told yesterday that we have people in the \nuniform of the United States in 93 different places throughout the \nglobe now--93 different places--and any one of those places could erupt \nagain while this Kosovo conflict is ongoing.\n  I do not want to hear anyone tell me that we have provided too much \nmoney. We have not provided too much money. If the money is not needed, \nI can guarantee you that this Secretary of Defense and this Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs is not going to spend it. We have given them under \nthis bill an enormous amount of discretion to spend the money. We have \nnot earmarked this money. We have suggested things in the report that \nwe hope they will consider, but this is the money to meet the needs of \nprotecting our men and women in the armed services abroad, and it has \nto be viewed on that basis.\n  I urge every Member of the Senate to vote for it and to forget petty \ndifferences.\n  I am delighted to yield now to my good friend from West Virginia, a \npartner in this process of trying to get this supplemental and \nemergency bill to the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, the senior Senator, Mr. Ted Stevens, the manager of the bill \nand the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is my longtime \nfriend. I have served many, many years in the Senate and on the \nAppropriations Committee and on various subcommittees of the \nAppropriations Committee with Senator Stevens.\n  He was fair and he was dedicated to the positions of the Senate \nthroughout the discussions on the supplemental appropriations bill when \nit was in conference with the other body. He stood up for the Senate's \npositions, and he was remarkably effective. I am proud to associate \nmyself with him. First of all, he is a gentleman. His word is his bond. \nHis handshake is his bond. I like that.\n  He is not so partisan that partisanship overrides everything else. We \nare all partisan here to an extent, but to some of us party is not \neverything, party is not even the top thing. Party is important, but \nthere are other things even more important.\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n  Mr. President, I intend to support this emergency supplemental \nconference report accompanying H.R. 1141. It is the result of a long \nand difficult conference with the House of Representatives. There are a \nnumber of matters in this agreement that I do not support, and there is \none provision which is not included in the agreement but which I \nbelieve was as deserving as any emergency contained in the conference \nagreement.\n  That provision is the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. \nSenators will recall that the Senate substitute to H.R. 1141 included \nthe amendment that I offered to establish a 2-year $1 billion loan \nguarantee program to assist the more than 10,000 U.S. steelworkers who \nhave already lost their jobs as a result of a huge influx of cheap and \nillegally dumped steel during 1998, last year.\n  This matter had strong support by the Senate conferees during the \nHouse-Senate conference. After a thorough discussion of the Emergency \nSteel Loan Guarantee Program, the House conferees voted to accept this \nSenate provision. Not all of the House conferees. All the House \nDemocratic conferees and three of the Republican conferees voted to \naccept this provision. However, that vote was subsequently overturned \nthe next day, and the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program remained a \nmatter of contention until the very end of the conference.\n  In order to expedite the completion of this very important emergency \nbill, not everything which I support in the Senate, but I am going to \nsupport the bill, and because of the need to get it to the President as \nquickly as possible, I agreed to drop the Emergency Steel Loan \nGuarantee Program in return for a commitment from the House and Senate \ncongressional leadership that this loan guarantee provision would be \nbrought up as a freestanding emergency appropriations bill in the very \nnear future.\n  Pursuant to that agreement, I hope and expect that such an \nappropriations bill will be brought up in the Senate prior to the \nupcoming Memorial Day recess. I hope, because it is vitally important, \nthat we act expeditiously, this being a real emergency.\n  The plight of many of the steel companies in this country is serious. \nThe Speaker of the House has agreed to permit a motion to go to \nconference within 1 week of receiving the Senate-passed bill and has \nagreed to allow normal appropriations conferees to be appointed and to \npermit the resulting conference report to be brought up before the \nHouses.\n  Subsequent to Senate adoption of the substitute on H.R. 1141, the \nHouse Appropriations Committee marked up a second emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill to provide emergency funding \nprincipally to support the military operations, refugee relief, and \nhumanitarian assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo and for \nmilitary operations in Southwest Asia for fiscal year 1999.\n\n  In light of the House action in relation to the Kosovo supplemental, \nand in hopes of being able to move both the Central American emergency \nspending bill, H.R. 1141, as well as the emergency funding for Kosovo, \nit was determined by the joint leadership that the Kosovo funding \nshould be taken up directly by the House-Senate conferees on H.R. 1141. \nAs a consequence, the Senate Appropriations Committee never marked up \nthe funding measure for Kosovo, nor did the Senate have an opportunity \nto debate that measure at all--no opportunity to amend it, no \nopportunity to debate it, no opportunity to vote it up or down. In \nother words, the first time the Kosovo funding has been before the \nSenate is today in the form of this conference agreement on H.R. 1141.\n  I generally do not support the handling of appropriations matters in \na manner that does not allow the Senate to work its will on each of the \nissues in appropriations bills, but in this instance, I agreed to allow \nthis procedure to be followed because of the importance of the matters \ncontained in this particular conference report.\n  This conference agreement contains appropriations totaling some $15 \nbillion, of which $10.9 billion is for the support of our men and women \nin uniform in Kosovo and Southwest Asia and $1.1 billion is for Kosovo-\nrelated humanitarian assistance. These amounts represent an increase of \n$6 billion--$6 billion--above the President's request for Kosovo-\nrelated appropriations. The $6 billion in emergency funding above the \nPresident's request contains a congressional emergency designation, but \nwill only be available for obligation if the President agrees with that \nemergency designation, only if the President also requests these funds \nand declares them emergency spending.\n  In addition to the $12 billion for our Kosovo-related expenditures, \nboth in military and humanitarian assistance, the pending measure also \nincludes $574 million in emergency agriculture assistance programs, \nsome $420 million higher than the administration's request. For the \nvictims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America and the Caribbean, the \nconference agreement includes $983 million, of which $216 million is to \nreplenish Department of Justice operation and maintenance accounts \nwhich were used to provide immediate relief to the hurricane victims. \nFinally, the agreement contains $900 million in emergency funding for \nFEMA in order to address the needs of the American people who suffered \nfrom the recent tornadoes in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Tennessee.\n   Mr. President, as I have stated, this was a very difficult \nconference that consumed many days and late nights to reach agreement. \nThis was the first time that the present chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Bill Young of Florida, had an opportunity \nto serve as chairman of the conference. I must say that he performed \nhis responsibilities very capably. During the many contentious debates \nthat took place, he was always fair and evenhanded and respectful of \nall members of the conference, just like our own chairman, Senator \nStevens. Yet, at the same time, he displayed the necessary firmness in \norder to keep the conference moving toward completion. So, I compliment \nChairman Bill Young for his excellent work on this difficult \nconference.\n  Let me again compliment Senator Stevens, but also I compliment the \nranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. David Obey, \nwhom one will never find asleep at the switch. He is always there. He \nis always alert, combative enough, to be sure, and loyal to his own \nbody, the House of Representatives, and the Democrats whom he \nrepresented in the conference. His work is always effective and very \ncapable.\n  In closing, let me again say that Chairman Stevens stoutly defended \nthe Senate position on all of the matters throughout the conference and \nalso made certain that all Senate conferees were able to express their \nview on each of the issues.\n  I hope that the Senate will support the conference report. As I say, \nthere are some things in it I do not like, some things that were left \nout of it that I very much wanted and believe in and believe constitute \nas much of an emergency as some of the other items that are designated \nas such in the conference report. But I want to support this. I urge \nall Senators to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement of mine \nconcerning the objectionable provisions contained in the bill be made \npart of the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as a former Member of Congress once said, \n``Every disaster is an opportunity.'' This bill proves that statement \nremains true today.\n\n  Scattered throughout this bill, which was supposed to be for \nemergencies only, is more than $1.2 billion in non-emergency, garden-\nvariety, pork-barrel spending. When the Senate passed this bill just \ntwo months ago, I could find only $85 million in low-priority, \nunnecessary, or wasteful spending. By the time the conferees were done \nwith it, the waste had grown by a factor of 14-14 times more pork-\nbarrel spending was deemed worthy of inclusion in this conference bill.\n  Mr. President, I have compiled a list of the numerous add-ons \nearmarks, and special exemptions in this bill. Now, I know that some of \nthese programs may well prove meritorious, but there is no\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\nway for us to determine their merit because the process for doing so \nhas been circumvented in this bill.\n  For example, the bill contains $1.5 million to purchase water to \nmaintain sufficient water levels for fish and wildlife purposes at San \nCarlos Lake in Arizona, and an earmark of $750,000 for the Southwest \nBorder anti-drug efforts. I know that these are important programs, but \nare they the most important programs in my state? The process by which \nthese two earmarks were added in conference on this bill makes it \nimpossible to assess the relative merit of these programs against all \nother priority needs in Arizona and across the nation.\n  The normal merit-based review process, which requires authorization \nand appropriation, was not followed, and these programs were simply \nadded to this so-called ``emergency'' bill. The usual ``checks and \nbalances'' were just thrown out the window.\n  Once again, I have to object to including programs in appropriations \nbills that have not been authorized. The Commerce Committee has \njurisdiction over the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Yet, without \neven seeking, much less obtaining authorization from the Commerce \nCommittee, the appropriations put $38 million in this bill for the CPB \nto buy a new satellite. I have raised this issue before. There is a \ngood reason for the two-tiered process that requires an authorization \nbefore appropriating any money for a program--to eliminate unnecessary \nor low-priority spending of taxpayer dollars. That process clearly was \ncircumvented in this bill.\n  This bill contains the usual earmarks for specific amounts of money \nof special-interest projects, such as:\n  An emergency earmark of $26 million to compensate Dungeness crab \nfisherman, fish processors, fishing crew members, communities and \nothers negatively affected by restrictions on fishing in Glacier Bay \nNational Park in Alaska.\n  Emergency earmarks of $3.7 million for a House page dorm and $1.8 \nmillion for renovations in the O'Neill House Office Building, which \nwere added in conference.\n  $3 million earmarked for water infrastructure needs at Grand Isle, \nLouisiana, again added in conference.\n  An emergency infusion of $70 million into the livestock assistance \nprogram, which is redefined to include reindeer.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that Santa Clause is happy today although \neven he would blush not only at the process but the amount of money \nthat is included in this legislation.\n  Then there are the many objectionable provisions that have no direct \nmonetary effect on the bill, but you can be sure there is a financial \nbenefit to someone back home. For example:\n  Apparently, last year when we added millions of dollars to help maple \nproducers replace taps damaged in ice storms in the Northeast, we added \na bit too much money. This bill directs that leftover money be used for \nrestoration of stream banks and maybe repairing fire damage in \nNebraska.\n  The media has reported extensively on a provision (which was added in \nconference) allowing the Crown Jewel mine project in Washington State \nto deposit mining waste on more than the five acres surrounding the \nmine than is currently permitted. What hasn't been reported is that \nthis language also reverses for several months any earlier permit \ndenials for any other mining operations that were denied based on the \nfive-acre millsite limit.\n  The bill contains language making permanent the prohibition on new \nfishing vessels participating in herring and mackerel fishing in the \nAtlantic--a protectionist policy that was slipped in last year's bill \nand is now, apparently, going to become permanent.\n  The bill contains another provision that provides a special, lifetime \nexemption from vessel length limitations for a fishing vessel that is \ncurrently operating in the Gulf of Mexico or along the south Atlantic \nCoast fishing for menhaden--an issue that should be dealt with by the \nauthorizing committee, the Commerce Committee.\n  The report directs that three facilities be built to house non-\nreturnable criminal aliens in the custody of the INS--facilities which \nare much-needed--but then the conferees decided to go one step further \nand direct that one facility had to be built in the mid-Atlantic \nregion.\n  Last year's 1999 Transportation appropriations bill earmarked funding \nfor a feasibility study for commuter rail service in the Cleveland-\nAkron-Canton area, and the conference report expands on the use of \nthose funds to allow purchase of rights-of-way for a rail project \nbefore the feasibility of the project has even been determined.\n  There are many more low-priority, wasteful, and unnecessary projects \non the 5-page list I have compiled, and is included in the Record.\n  Most of these add-ons are listed as ``emergencies'' in this bill. Do \nthese programs really sound like emergencies to you?\n  A small number are offset by cuts in other spending, but that doesn't \nmake it right to include them in a non-amendable bill that circumvents \nthe appropriate merit-based selection process of selecting the highest \npriority projects.\n  Some of these programs, like the page dorm, were not even in the \nbills that passed the Senate and House. They were simply thrown into \nthis bill in conference, at the last minute, in a bill that cannot be \namended or modified in any way.\n  For the Coast Guard, this bill presented the opportunity to pick up \nanother $200 million for operating expenses and readiness. This, too, \nwas a last-minute add in conference of ``emergency'' funding--again, an \nissue for the Commerce Committee to consider.\n  I also want to note with interest the apparent prescience of the \nappropriators in including an additional $528 million in unrequested \nemergency funding, for ``any disaster events which occur in the \nremaining months of the fiscal year.'' Apparently, the appropriators \nhave some inkling that bad things are going to happen in the next five \nmonths.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues understand that designating \nspending as an ``emergency'' doesn't make it free. It still has to be \npaid for. The fact is that most of the pork-barrel spending in this \nbill comes straight out of the Social Security Trust Fund. At a time \nwhen the American people are worried about the fiscal health of Social \nSecurity, worried about whether Social Security will be there when they \nretire, it defies logic that we are taking money out of the Trust Fund \nfor these projects. The Trust Fund is estimated to be bankrupt by the \nyear 2032, and taking another billion dollars out of it clearly \naccelerates that fiscal crisis. That is exactly the opposite of what we \nshould be doing, which is taking the Trust Fund off-budget and putting \nmore money into it to ensure benefits will be paid, as promised, to all \nAmericans who have worked and paid into the Social Security system.\n  Mr. President, disasters should not be opportunities. It seems the \nCongress may still be suffering from ``surplus fever,'' a giddy lack of \nfiscal discipline because of projected budget surpluses into the \nforeseeable future. Last year, we spent $20 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus for wasteful spending in the omnibus appropriations \nbill. I voted against the omnibus bill last year, and I will vote \nagainst this bill.\n  This bill is a betrayal of our responsibility to spend the taxpayers' \ndollars responsibly and enact laws and policies that reflect the best \ninterests of all Americans, rather than the special interests of a few. \nI cannot support a bill that makes a mockery of the Congress' power of \nthe purse and contributes to Americans' growing lack of faith in their \nGovernment.\n  Finally, I was very pleased to see the other Senators come to the \nfloor. We cannot continue this practice of adding appropriations in \nconference. We cannot continue to circumvent the authorization process. \nI identified some 30 instances in last year's bill. It will stop, \nsooner or later. We promised the American people when we regained the \nmajority we would not do this kind of thing, this kind of money, in \nthis kind of unauthorized authorizations that circumvent the committee \nprocess.\n  I find it offensive as a committee chairman. Most of all, I find it \noffensive as an American citizen who also pays his taxes.\n  I assure Members and my friends on the Appropriations Committee, we \nintend to take additional measures in the appropriations process. If \nappropriations bills come to this floor without proper authorization of \nexpenditures of\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nmoney or authorizations that are not agreed to by the committee \nchairmen who are authorizers, there are going to be a lot of problems \naround here.\n  Last fall, when we added $21 billion in unnecessary spending, some \n30-odd reauthorizations, I said at that time in a letter to the \ndistinguished chairman and my friend on the Appropriations Committee \nthat I will not stand for it any further. I believe there are a whole \nlot of Senators on both sides of the aisle who are tired of this \nprocess.\n  I say that with all due respect for the dedication, the difficulties \nand the obstacles that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and \nother appropriators have as they go through a very difficult process, \nbut it must stop.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Objectionable Provisions Contained in H.R. 1141, the Emergency \n Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions for Recovery From Natural \n Disasters and Foreign Assistance for Fiscal Year Ending September 30, \n                                  1999\n\n     Bill language\n       Bill language directing that funds made last year for maple \n     producers be made available for stream bank restorations. \n     Report language later states that the conferees are aware of \n     a recent fire in Nebraska which these funds may be used. \n     (Emergency)\n       Language directing the Secretary of the Interior to provide \n     $26,000,000 to compensate Dungeness crab fishermen, and U.S. \n     fish processors, fishing crew members, communities, and \n     others negatively affected by restrictions on fishing in \n     Glacier Bay National Park, in Alaska.

(Unrequested)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am surprised by some of the items \nlisted in the Senator's statement. This bill is both a supplemental and \nan emergency appropriations bill.\n  A supplemental appropriations bill that was submitted by the \nPresident in March contained a request for $48 million to replace the \nNational Public Radio satellite system. It is in this bill not as an \nemergency but as a supplemental appropriation. When we passed this bill \nin March, the Senate version of this bill contained $18 million for the \nsatellite system. That was less than the President's request. The \nPresident made that request because the Public Radio system satellite \nfailed and radio programs are currently being sent through an emergency \nbackup satellite that will not be available until around the middle of \nSeptember, early fall. The supplemental funding was requested by the \nPresident and approved by the Senate at the level of $18 million. The \nHouse insisted on the full $48 million. It is an item that is not \ndesignated as an emergency.\n  There are a series of other misunderstandings, I think, with regard \nto this bill, and I will be happy to discuss them with the Senator from \nArizona later. I don't disagree with him about legislation on \nappropriations bills. The point of order under the rules that were \npreviously in place against legislation on the appropriations bills was \ndestroyed through a maneuver here on the floor of the Senate before my \nbecoming chairman. We have had a tough time trying to get that put back \ninto our system. I will be happy to help restore the point of order \nagainst legislation.\n  I don't look with favor on the omnibus process that occurred last \nfall and occurred once before I became chairman. But clearly, my job is \nto carry forward the bills as they come out of the Senate and out of \nthe House and out of the conference by a majority vote. Under the \ncurrent circumstances, there is not a point of order in the Senate on \nlegislation against appropriations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise to make a brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I might just confer.\n  How much time does the Senator from California wish?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished and \nvery able senior Senator from the State of California, which is larger \nthan all the nations of the globe except, how many?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Are there six nations that are larger than California?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Six nations that are larger than California. So the two \nCalifornia Senators really are here representing a State that is larger \nthan all of the nations of the world except six. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member. I \nappreciate his comments about my State. I also compliment both the \nranking member and the chairman of the committee for their drive, for \ntheir motivation, and for their staying power to get this conference \nreport done.\n  Mr. President, the room was crowded. The hours were long. The views \nwere sometimes cantankerous. But both the chairman and the ranking \nmember, I think, were steadfast in the desire to produce a conference \nreport which could, in fact, be approved by both bodies.\n  I also pay tribute to the chairman from the House, Mr. Young.  I had \nnever seen him preside before. What I observed, which I think is well \nworth noting, was his fairness, his equanimity, and really his ability \nto move the process along which, without rankling, can be a very \ndiverse membership. I say the same for Mr. Obey, who really was \nsteadfast in pursuing his own views.\n  I support this report. It contains the $12 billion for Kosovo. I am \nespecially pleased to note that the supplemental contains funding for \nthe documentation of war crimes, including rapes that appear to have \nbeen committed as part of Serbia's brutal campaign of ethnic \ncleansing. As the ranking member and the chairman have pointed out, it \ncontains the much-needed disaster assistance and the $574 million in \nagricultural funding to provide a measure of assistance to very hard-\npressed farmers throughout this great country.\n\n  I do want to speak about one small item. As we debate the conference \nreport on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, I want to \nexpress my concerns about the inclusion of a ``hold harmless'' \nprovision for what are called concentration grants authorized by Title \nI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  In chapter 5, on page 91 of the conference report (Report 106-143), \nthe conferees included $56.4 million for Title I concentration grants \n``to direct the Department of Education to hold harmless all school \ndistricts that received Title I concentration grants in fiscal year \n1998.* * *'' The report goes on to say, ``Neither the House nor the \nSenate bills contained these provisions.''\n  This provision is very disturbing for several reasons.\n  First, it was not included in either the House or Senate bills. \nTherefore, it has not been considered by the authorizing committees of \neither house. It has not been considered by the appropriations \ncommittees of either house. There have been no hearings. It has not \ngone through the normal deliberative process under which we hear from \nexperts, weigh the pros and cons and cast votes. Quite frankly, this \nprovision appeared ``in the dark of night.''\n  Second, the hold harmless provision contravenes an important \nprovision of the law, known as the census update, a requirement in law \nthat the U.S. Department of Education must allocate Title I funds based \non the newest child poverty figures, figures that are updated every two \nyears. Congress adopted the census update requirement in 1994 so that \nTitle I funds--which the law says are to help disadvantaged children--\ntruly follow the child, that dollars be determined generally by the \nnumber of children who are eligible. The holdharmless provision in this \nbill before us, guaranteeing that school districts that got funds in \n1998 will get funds in 1999, even if their number of poor children has \ndeclined, violates the requirement that funds be allocated based on the \nmost recent child poverty data available. The provision in this bill \neffectively rewards ``incumbents,'' despite their number of poor \nchildren, despite merit or need.\n  Third, this provision disregards Title I's eligibility requirements. \nTitle I concentration grants are supposed to be especially targeted to \nconcentrations of poor children, under the law. Districts that have \npoor children exceeding 6,500 or 15% of their total school-aged \nchildren are eligible for these grants, which are in addition to the \n``regular,'' basic Title I grants. Guaranteeing funds to districts, no \nmatter what the number or percent of poor children in those districts, \nspreads limited funds to districts that are not eligible because they \ndo not have concentrations of poverty. It effectively takes away funds \nfrom districts that do have high concentrations of poor children. It \noverrides the eligibility requirements we have set and agreed on in \nlaw.\n  In my state, some school districts could benefit from this ``hold \nharmless'' provision because the number of poor children changed; it \nwent below the eligibility threshold of the Title I concentration \ngrants program. Like most Senators, I do not want any school district \nin my state to lose education funds.\n  But we either have rules or we don't. We have eligibility criteria or \nwe don't.\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\nIf the current eligibility rules are wrong or are not working, we \nshould change them in the authorizing process, a review which the \nHealth and Education Committee is currently undertaking. We should not \nset up eligibility rules and then flagrantly ignore them, override them \nor ``freeze'' in place funds to districts that do not meet the \nrequirements. We should not rewrite the rules in the ``dark of night'' \noutside the normal legislative process.\n  Fourth, this provision violates the principle that funds should \nfollow the child. Title I was created for poor, disadvantaged children. \nThat is its fundamental purpose and funding to states is determined \nlargely by the number of poor children, children that all agree have \ngreat educational needs. This amendment sends funds to districts merely \nbecause they got funds in the previous year, not because the districts \nhave needy children and not in proportion to the number of poor \nchildren they have.\n  Finally, this provision is very unfair to states like mine that have \na very high growth rate in the number of poor children. In California, \nthe number of poor children grew by 52 percent from 1990 to 1995. In \nArizona, poor children grew 38 percent from 1990 to 1995. In Georgia, \n35 percent. In Nevada, 56 percent. That is why Congress included a \nrequirement for a child poverty update. This amendment is very unfair \nto those children. This amendment takes the funds away from the poor \nchildren for which the funds were intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may have 30 seconds to wrap up.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member.\n  Even though it ``freezes in'' funding to districts--including some in \nmy state--that got funds last year, even though they do not qualify, it \nmakes a mockery of the basic purpose of the Title I program, its \neligibility rules and the requirement to use recent poverty data. If \nCongress continues to override these basic rules of the authorizing \nlaw, we are effectively operating with no rules, or at least, \nconstantly changing rules. Districts will not know whether they are \neligible or what they can or cannot count on. This is just plain wrong. \nIn my state, even though 39 districts would have their funding ``frozen \nin'' by this provision, next year, California will have 166 new school \ndistricts that will become eligible. If these ``hold harmlesses'' keep \nappearing in the dark of night, these eligible districts, with \nconcentrations of poor children, could be deprived of funds to which \nthey are entitled.\n  Because this is a conference report, under our procedures, I am not \nallowed to offer an amendment to delete this provision.\n  But let me put my colleagues on notice that I find this provision and \nthis procedure very objectionable.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in ending this practice so that our \nchildren can get the education Congress intended in creating the Title \nI program in the first place.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am authorized to yield myself 5 minutes \noff of the time of Senator Stevens.\n  Eleven billion dollars in this bill are earmarked to pay for the \ncosts of the war in the Balkans and its consequences, direct and \nindirect. That war was begun in folly and has been conducted since with \nan almost incredible degree of incompetence. I have opposed the war \nfrom the beginning and will not support it now.\n  The conflict was begun because of Serbia's refusal to sign an \nagreement granting autonomy to the people of Kosovo and protecting its \ncitizens. Other demands, including the free right of NATO troops to \ntravel through any part of Yugoslavia, were impossible for any \nsovereign nation to agree to.\n  Our goals were worthy. But they were not of sufficient importance to \nvital American interests to warrant the use of our armed forces in \ncombat. This proposition is perhaps best illustrated by the President's \nrefusal to use all of the means necessary to attain his goals, choosing \nto cause death and destruction to the Serbs, and suffering, \ndislocation, and death to the very people we purport to protect, than \nto risk American lives in order to succeed. This is no way to wage a \nwar.\n  But vital American interests have been seriously and adversely \naffected by the war itself. We have destabilized Macedonia and \nMontenegro, and perhaps other nations in the Balkans as well. We have \ndamaged relations with Russia and may have pushed it along the road to \nreaction. We have put ourselves on the defensive with respect to China \nwhen we should have the high ground in many of our differences. We have \nfueled anti-American sentiment around the world.\n  If we win, we get to occupy Kosovo for a generation and to spend \nbillions rebuilding it; if we lose, we are humiliated and NATO is \nweakened.\n  In addition, this war appropriation comes to the Senate in a form in \nwhich it cannot be amended. I, for one, am denied the opportunity to \nattempt to earmark a modest portion of this money to arm the Kosovo \nAlbanian rebels. It is inconceivable that we should trigger this ethnic \ncleansing, refuse to intervene on the ground to defend the Kosovo \nAlbanians, fail even to attack their persecutors effectively, and top \nit off by refusing to aid those who wish to fight for their own \nliberties.\n  Finally, of course, this entire emergency appropriation comes \nstraight out of our Social Security surplus. I am not sure that the \nAmerican people are at all aware of this fact. I cannot believe that \nthey would support it. At my behest, the conference committee added \nmanagers' language calling for the restoration of this borrowing to the \nSocial Security Trust Fund out of future general fund surpluses. But \nthe language is not mandatory, and may well be ignored. We should not \nuse Social Security to pay for a war in the Balkans.\n  For these reasons, and in spite of its many good and important \nprovisions on other issues, I oppose this supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nemergency appropriations bill because it is an emergency, it is \nnecessary. I have been reading all of the press reports about the bill \nand criticisms of the bill because it is too large or perhaps too much \nmoney has been spent on one area or another. But the fact is, we have \nemergencies in our country that are not covered by the budget. We have \nhad more emergencies in our agriculture area than we ever could have \nforeseen. You can't pick up the paper that you don't read about a \nterrible tragic tornado, and we are coming into hurricane season. So we \nare putting more money into FEMA. We have had floods in my home State. \nWe must deal with these as they occur, and clearly on an emergency \nbasis.\n  A good part of this bill is for agriculture. We are also helping our \nneighbors in Central America who were ravaged with a terrible hurricane \nand tornadoes. We are trying to do the things we have promised we would \ndo. But since we started this emergency appropriation, we have also had \na new emergency, and that is the situation in Kosovo. We are seeing, \nevery day, what is happening there.\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that I have spoken out strongly \nagainst the way we got into this Kosovo operation. I have spoken out \nagainst going into an operation when we didn't have a good contingency \nplan. I have spoken out against so much of our policy in the Balkans. I \njust came back from the Balkans, just over the weekend, and I met with \nour soldiers on the airfield in Albania, the ones who are going to be \nsupporting our humanitarian effort and, hopefully, be part of our \ndefenses there, whatever we may do. I went to Aviano, Italy, and met \nwith the troops who are doing so many of these air operations that we \nare seeing day after day after day. And, of course, there is no \nquestion that our troops are doing a great job. They don't make the \npolicy; they just do the mission they are\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\ngiven. Nobody can question their sincerity, their great attitude, and \ntheir commitment to our country. You will never meet a young man or \nwoman in the military who isn't there because they love our country.\n  So when I think about this supplemental appropriation--and I know I \nhave spoken against the mission itself, the way it has come about--and \nI remember looking into the eyes of the young men and women who are on \nthe front line, I think, now, can I vote not to give the money to them \nto have the equipment they need to do the training they need, to have \nthe incentives that they need to be doing a very tough job in a very \ntough neighborhood? Well, the answer is no, I can't vote against paying \nfor their security, because they are the security for me and my family \nand for every one of us who is lucky enough to live in the greatest \ncountry on Earth.\n  So they have volunteered to give their lives so that we may live in \nfreedom. Do you think for one minute I would vote not to give them the \nequipment they need to do that job? It would be unthinkable. So while \nwe debate how we pay for it or who is responsible, in the end, I am \ngoing to vote for this bill, because I am going to support the troops \nwho are in the field.\n  I am going to continue to argue with the administration that we need \nto learn the lessons about how this operation has been handled, and I \nthink we will. I think there is a glimmer of hope that perhaps Mr. \nMilosevic has seen that we are going to win and prolonging it will only \nhurt his own people. So there is a glimmer of hope, and a glimmer of \nhope is better than total darkness. I think we need to seize on that \nglimmer of hope and try to come to the first agreement that we must \nhave from Mr. Milosevic--that he will stop the atrocities against the \npeople of Kosovo.\n\n  I just visited with the people of Kosovo. I visited with them in \nMacedonia. I visited with them in Albania. Those people have been \nthrough more than any one of us will ever know or understand. What I \nwant now is the atrocities to stop for the ones who are still there. \nThe ones we met with are in refugee camps. They are not comfortable, \nbut they are safe. I want to try to help the people who are still in \nKosovo, and the atrocities on them to stop so that we can then allow \nthe people who have fled their country in terror to be able to go back \nin and rebuild their homes, rebuild their economy, so that they will be \nable to have a livelihood, so that they will be able to raise their \nchildren in their homeland without fear of a despot who would commit \nthe atrocities that there is no question in my mind have been committed \nin the last 6 months and, indeed, for many years in this part of the \nworld.\n  So, Mr. President, while we are debating policy, while we are \ndebating from where the money is going to come all of which is \nlegitimate debate, while we are talking to each other about our \nprinciples, which is our right to do, but at the end of the day, it is \nmost important that we have the emergency appropriations which would \ngive our kids who are on the front line and their commanders everything \nthey need so as to know that we are not going to pull the rug out from \nunder them, that they will have the equipment, they will have the \nairplanes, they will have the helicopters for their own security while \nthey are protecting yours and mine.\n  So let's talk policy. Let's talk about never going into an operation \nlike this again without a contingency plan. Let's talk about the \ntreasure we have spent in this country to try to solve this problem. \nAnd let's not stop with Kosovo, because the money and the troops that \nwe have put in harm's way cannot be lost for us to put a Band-Aid on \nKosovo. Let's finish this job now.\n  But when we have stopped the atrocities and when the Serb troops have \nstarted leaving Kosovo, and when an international peacekeeping force \nmoves in, let's take the opportunity, let's seize the moment to do \nsomething bigger than putting a Band-Aid on Kosovo. Let's look at the \nBalkans and do what we can to try to help them form areas of government \nthat have to change so that those people will be able to have jobs, \nstart farming their land, to live in security. That is what I want for \nthe Balkans.\n  But continuing to say we can amalgamate the Balkans as if they were \nAmerica is not going to have a long-term chance for success, because we \ndon't understand what they have just been through in the last 5 years. \nWe don't understand what it would be like to force people to live next \ndoor to each other when their mothers have been raped, when their \nfathers have been brutally murdered, when their families have had to \nflee in terror.\n  Let's start today by supporting our troops. Let's start today by \nkeeping open the glimmer of hope for peace. And then let's take one \nstep at a time to try to help these people become a contributing part \nof Europe so that they can do what every one of us wants to do; that \nis, live in peace and freedom, to have jobs, to support our families, \nand to give our kids a better chance than we have. That is what the \nKosovar Albanians want. It is what the Serbs want. They are the good \npeople of Serbia--not President Milosevic. That is what the Moslems in \nBosnia want. That is what the Croats want. It is what the Albanians \nwant. And they should be able to have it. That should be our goal.\n  I am going to support this bill. I am not going to say there are not \nlegitimate differences about certain parts of it. Sure there are. That \nis why 100 of us are elected independently to represent the views we \nhave--the views of our States. But we are required to come together. I \nhope the Senate will do the right thing and come together to do what is \nright for the farmers who are hurting, for the people in Central \nAmerica who are hurting, for the people in the Balkans who are hurting, \nto help promote peace in the Middle East, and to continue to appreciate \nthat we live in the greatest nation on Earth. We need to make sure we \nkeep the security and the freedom of our country on our watch.\n  It is our responsibility to pass this bill and talk about the policy \nand talk about our differences, and our Constitution that provided that \nwe do this.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized to \nspeak for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments on the emergency \nspending bill we have before us. Many of us had hoped that the almost \ngrotesque experience of last year's omnibus appropriations bill might \nhave shamed Congress into refraining from the kind of fiscally \nirresponsible spending and catering to special interests that \ncharacterized that legislation. Apparently, it was a vain hope. We are \nback at the same disgraceful work barely seven months later.\n  Mr. President, few would argue the need for many of the core \nprovisions of the legislation, especially the urgently needed \nhumanitarian relief in Central America, our current military and \nhumanitarian operations in the Balkans, and for victims of natural \ndisasters here at home. Regrettably, those legitimate provisions are \ncompletely eclipsed by dozens of others that are at best highly \nquestionable and at worst grossly irresponsible.\n  Mr. President, first and foremost among this latter group are the \nbillions in additional funding for the military that was not requested \nby the administration.\n  Mr. President, to say there is a double standard when it comes to \nfiscal prudence in Congress is to say the ocean is damp. We saw it last \nyear in the omnibus appropriations bill, we saw it again when this body \ntook up and passed an unfunded military pay and retirement increase \neven before we had passed a budget resolution, we saw it still again \nduring the budget resolution when military spending received a special \nexemption from the tough new emergency spending rules we adopted, and \nsadly, we see it now in this bill.\n  As has been noted by others, including my distinguished colleague \nfrom the other House, Wisconsin Representative David Obey, what we are \nprobably witnessing is an effort to load as\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\nmuch military spending into this bill under the pretext of an emergency \nin order to make room for special interest military spending provisions \nin the Defense appropriations bill later this summer.\n  Mr. President, put simply, this emergency supplemental measure uses \nSocial Security Trust Fund revenues to help lard up an already \ncorpulent defense budget.\n  Almost as troubling as this reckless use of Social Security revenues \nto pay for the military budget is that this technique isn't an \nexception. It has become the custom.\n  Mr. President, our budget caps have become a sham. We agree to those \ntough caps with great acclaim and fanfare, only to circumvent them \ncasually on a regular basis with the emergency provisions of our budget \nrules.\n  Mr. President, as much as I oppose raising the budget caps, it would \nbe far better if Congress and the White House were to raise those caps \nin an honest and open manner, than to continue the pretense that the \ncaps have meaning only to circumvent them through the abuse--I say \n``abuse''--of the emergency funding designation.\n  Mr. President, while the doubling of the military budget request is \ncertainly the dominant flaw in this bill, there are other provisions \nthat deserve notice as well. They represent what is most unseemly about \nthe emergency appropriations process--special interest provisions that \nrelate to no true emergency, but avoid the scrutiny of the normal \nlegislative process and instead capitalize on human suffering or an \ninternational crisis, finding their way onto what we have come to call \nmust-pass bills.\n  Mr. President, let me note that it may be that some of these \nextraneous provisions have merit. But they should be subject to the \nsame fiscal scrutiny we ask of any proposal. They should be paid for. \nThe standing committees should review and authorize these proposals, \nand the Appropriations Committee should propose a level of funding for \neach of them that makes sense in the context of the overall budget.\n  Mr. President, by circumventing this process, the advocates of these \nprovisions reveal their distrust of Congress and possibly their own \napprehension that their provisions may not be able to gain passage on \ntheir merits.\n  One such provision is the so-called Russian Leadership Program, a new \nprogram, Mr. President, newly authorized by this legislation which also \nprovides it with $10 million in funding. I understand the program is \nintended to enable emerging political leaders of Russia to live here in \nthe United States for a while to gain firsthand exposure to our \ncountry, our free market system, our democratic institutions, and other \naspects of our government and day-to-day lives.\n  Mr. President, offhand, that doesn't sound like it is necessarily a \nbad idea. I might be able to support such a program, though I would \ncertainly want to know something more about it before endorsing still \nanother new democracy building effort. But, Mr. President, this \nproposal has not gone through the normal legislative process. It has \nnot been held up to the scrutiny of a public review by the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  Mr. President, if one were asked where the new Russian Leadership \nProgram were to be housed, one might reasonably guess somewhere in the \nState Department, perhaps in USAID. Those a bit more familiar with the \narray of duplicate programs we have might stroke their chin wisely and \nsuggest that it would probably be included in the National Endowment \nfor Democracy, a quasi-governmental agency that many of us believe \nduplicates services provided elsewhere in government.\n  But, Mr. President, if you guessed the State Department, or NED, you \nwould be wrong. For the next year, this new Russian Leadership Program \nis to be housed in the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress, \nMr. President.\n  Mr. President, as some may know, we already have numerous educational \nand other exchange programs with Russia. Agencies and Departments which \nhave received funding from the Congress for exchange programs with \nRussia include, but are not limited to: the Departments of Commerce, \nDefense, Education, Justice, State, and Treasury; the Agency for \nInternational Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Trade Commission, the \nMarine Mammal Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space \nCommission, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment \nfor Democracy, the National Science Foundation, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and the Peace Corps.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the tremendous impact that educational \ncultural exchanges have had on our relationship with Russia. I have to \nwonder if we really need to create still another exchange program. Even \nif we determine that the program has great merit, I think serious \nquestions can be raised about whether this ought to be administered by \nthe Library of Congress.\n  It doesn't end there. According to the authorizing language in this \nlegislation, the Librarian of Congress is given authority to waive any \ncompetitive bidding when entering into contracts to carry out this \nprogram. In other words, this program is effectively shielded from any \nexpertise or efficiencies that might be brought to bear by existing \nfirms or nongovernmental agencies with experience in this area.\n  There we have it: In this bill, a brand-new program that has \ncompletely avoided the review of the appropriate standing committees \nestablished in an agency, that is wholly inappropriate, with virtually \nno restrictions on its administration. This is a heck of a way to \nlegislate.\n  Of course, this is just one example, one of dozens of extraneous \nprovisions that have been slipped into this emergency supplemental \nbill. I am not talking about a lot of different bills; it is just what \nis going on in this bill.\n  As others have noted, these unrelated riders have become business as \nusual. This is especially true with respect to antienvironmental \npolicy. This is not the first time I have expressed concerns regarding \nlegislative riders in appropriations legislation that would have a \nnegative impact on our Nation's environment. I am sorry to say with \nrespect to one of these policies, the delaying of the implementation of \nnew mining regulations, this is not even the first time such a rider \nhas been inserted into an appropriations bill.\n  The merits of this policy, this very important policy relating to \nmining, should be debated at length on another occasion. I do want to \nnote that the rules that safeguard our public lands with respect to \nmining badly need updating, if only to keep pace with the changing \nmining technology. One such technique, the use of sulfuric acid mining, \ncaused grave concern 2 years ago in my own State when it was \nappropriated for use in private lands in the neighboring Upper \nPeninsula of Michigan.\n  Regulations also need to take into account other land uses that would \nbe displaced by mining, and they need to do more to require meaningful \ncleanup. Currently, there is no requirement to restore mine lands to \npremining conditions. This leaves taxpayers holding the bag for the \nmining industry's mistakes.\n  Obviously, this kind of a change requires a full, careful, and open \ndebate. It just can't get the kind of attention it needs when it is \nquietly slipped into an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that \nwe are only going to debate for 3 hours. Of course, that is precisely \nthe reason the advocates of the rider have done it this way. They see \ntheir opportunity. They don't want a full and careful and open debate--\nspecial interests that push this policy know it will do them best and \nthey will get it done best behind closed doors, away from the light of \nopen debate.\n  In this connection, I think my colleagues should be aware that the \nPACs associated with the members of the National Mining Association and \nother mining-related PACs contributed more than $29 million to \ncongressional campaigns from January 1993 to December 1998. Mining soft \nmoney contributions totaled $10.6 million during the same 6-year \nperiod. Mr. President, that is nearly $40 million in campaign \ncontributions in recent years from an industry that stands to benefit \nfrom this rider that has been stuffed in this bill which we are only \ngoing to debate for 3 hours.\n  And so it is with too many of these provisions.\n  It should come as no surprise that a process characterized by secret \nnegotiations and backroom deals should be\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\ndominated by special interests and produce such questionable policy. \nThese interests have succeeded in presenting Congress with a take-it-\nor-leave-it deal, and they are betting we will acquiesce for fear of \ndelaying the true emergency assistance that I and everyone else have \nsaid is truly urgently needed.\n  Of course, I realize this measure is likely to pass. I hope it does \nnot. But I cannot endorse this package or the process that brought it \nto the floor by voting for it. I ask my colleagues to consider calling \nthe bluff of the interests that have succeeded in loading this bill up \nwith extraneous matters that could never command a majority in Congress \non their own.\n  If we can defeat this measure and insist on a clean, true emergency \nbill, we just might be able to shame those who have participated in \ncrafting it and maybe even prevent this kind of abuse in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 minutes to \nspeak against this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will not object.\n  Mr. President, Senator Stevens has left the floor and I am here in \nhis stead. Please enlighten the Senate as to the time situation \npursuant to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Stevens has 39 minutes, Senator Byrd \nhas 42 minutes, and Senator Dorgan has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, obviously appropriating money is a very \ndifficult task. I had the privilege for 7 years to serve on the \nAppropriations Committee. During that time I had the great privilege of \nserving as chairman of Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations. \nProbably more than most Members of the Senate who don't currently serve \non Appropriations, I think I have some understanding of the difficulty \nour colleagues have in appropriating money. Let me also say that the \nfunding issues are the most important and the most difficult issues we \ndebate.\n  I will share with my colleagues and anybody who might be following \nthe debate an experience I had in 1980. I was a second-year Member of \nthe House and I had been an economist prior to coming to Congress. I \nkept noticing that on the issues that really mattered--the spending \nissues on amendments--we were consistently losing on virtually every \none of those votes. I ran sort of a running total for about 6 months on \nthose votes.\n  Here is what I concluded, as best I can remember. The average vote on \nspending that really mattered cost about $50 million. These were little \nadd-on amendments that were voted on in 1980 in the House of \nRepresentatives. There were about 100 million taxpayers in 1980. So the \naverage taxpayer was paying about 50 cents. The average appropriation \namendment was costing about $50 million; there were 100 million \ntaxpayers; so each taxpayer was having a cost imposed on them of about \n50 cents.\n  As best I could figure, the average beneficiary was getting about \n$700.\n  Members don't have to have a degree in mathematics or any fundamental \nunderstanding of economics to understand that if you have 100 million \npeople all losing 50 cents each, and then you have beneficiaries who \nare getting, on average, $700 each, it doesn't take a lot of \nimagination to understand why in 1980 we were losing on every spending \namendment. The reason being, the average taxpayer could benefit only by \n50 cents if the amendment were defeated. That wasn't enough to activate \nthem to write a letter in opposition. The average beneficiary was \ngetting about $700, as best I could figure, on these votes on \namendments. For $700 they were willing to do quite a bit, especially \nthrough groups that represented them where they would have thousands of \nmembers, sometimes tens of thousands of members, who were getting $700 \neach.\n  So it very quickly became evident to me that we were fighting a \nlosing battle on spending. That ultimately gave rise to our efforts to \ntry to elevate this to a national issue where, rather than voting on \nall these little amendments that cost taxpayers 50 cents each, we could \nturn it into a big issue where we were talking fundamentally about the \nfuture of America, which is what budgets are about. And, in fact, in \n1981 when Ronald Reagan became President, we were able to adopt a \nbudget that dramatically reduced the growth in government spending, \nthat reformed entitlements, and that cut taxes across-the-board by 25 \npercent. And I would argue, probably more than anything else, that and \nRonald Reagan's opposition to regulations and the rolling back of \nburdensome regulations, and the monetary policy of the Fed, explained \nwhy we are in the happy condition we are in today with the current \nstate of the economy.\n  But what I discovered in 1981 was the only way you can win on these \nissues is when you are debating the big issue instead of the individual \nspending program. The budget has become our way of trying to rein in \nspending. One of the vehicles we have in that budget process is \nspending caps, where we debate how much money we are going to spend on \ndiscretionary programs and we set it in law and then we judge spending \nbased on that number that we have in fact set into law. In order to try \nto beef up our strength to try to hold the line on spending, we \nestablished budget points of order. In order to try to enforce them we \nestablished supermajority budget points of order, with 60 votes \nrequired in order to violate the budget.\n  I will, later today, raise a budget point of order against this \nappropriation bill. Why do I object to this appropriation? First of \nall, you cannot spend $14 billion beyond the spending caps in actual \ncash outlays, without doing a lot of things that almost everybody is \ngoing to be in favor of. But here is the basic problem. We set out, in \n1990, in a budget agreement, a little loophole. I would have to say I \nwas worried about it when it happened. But the loophole was allowing \nthe President and Congress to get together and declare emergency \nspending, to designate spending as an emergency and therefore get \naround the binding constraints on spending that we had written into the \nbudget. That provision went into effect in 1990. And in 1991 we \ndeclared $900 million of emergency spending. But in 1992, with the \nPresidential election, with the election of Bill Clinton, and with the \nfundamental change that occurred since then, here is what has happened \nto spending that we have annually designated as an emergency, and \ntherefore outside the budget caps, and outside any binding constraint \nthat we all solemnly voted for as part of the budget process. In fact, \nthe spending levels that I will be trying to defend today with my point \nof order were adopted 98 to 2 on June 27 of 1997. Only two Members of \nthe Senate voted against making the commitment to hold the line on \nspending. I am today going to be offering a point of order to try to \nhold the line on that commitment we made.\n  But here is what happened. Beginning in 1991 we had $900 million \ndesignated as an emergency in a government that was spending, in 1991, \nmaybe $1.2 trillion. It was not very much money by comparison. In 1992, \nwe declared $8.3 billion of spending to be such an emergency that it \ndid not even count as part of the budget process; that it was exempt \nfrom the cap. By 1994 that number had grown to $12.2 billion that, in \n1994, we designated as an emergency.\n  Because of our action at the end of last year in passing a $21 \nbillion emergency funding bill, we have already violated the budget for \nfiscal year 1999 above the level that we committed to on June 27 of \n1997. We have already violated that budget by $15 billion in budget \nauthority, which is the portion of the $21 billion that the President \nhas already released by concurring in the emergency designation. If we \nadopt this bill unchanged, as it is written and now is before the \nSenate, we will declare another $14.8 billion in budget authority as \nemergency, which will mean that in 1999 alone, we will bust the \nspending cap by $29.8 billion, all of which will be designated as an \nemergency, and all of which will be exempt from our budgetary process.\n\n  First of all, isn't it amazing that we have seen the level of \nemergency spending grow in 1991 from $0.9 billion, to $29.8 billion? \nWhat this really shows is we have lost control of the budget\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\nprocess. This loophole is literally destroying our ability to control \nspending.\n  What are these items that are declared as emergencies, items that \nwere so critical that we had to pass an emergency supplemental \nappropriation in order to fund them? Let me just give you some of the \nones from last year that have already busted the budget by $15 billion. \nThen I will give you a few from this year. Army research into \ncaffeinated chewing gum; the National Center for Complementary and \nAlternative Medicine; grasshopper research; manure handling and \ndisposal; onion research--those are the kind of items that were \nincluded in the emergency measure that we passed last year that has \ncaused us to violate this year's budget already by $15 billion.\n  Let me go over some of the items that make up this supplemental \nappropriation bill. ``National Public Radio, $48 million to purchase \nsatellite capacity; $1.3 million for the World Trade Organization \nministerial meeting in Seattle.'' Would anybody have us believe that we \nplanned that meeting and we suddenly discovered, after years of \nplanning, that we had to pay for it? Would anybody believe that this \nshould suddenly be contained in an emergency bill? No. But what they \nwould believe is we always knew we had to pay for it but we did not put \nit in the budget, knowing we would put it in an emergency bill and \ntherefore we could get around spending constraints.\n  ``Filling up San Carlos Lake; the purchase of a post office and a \nFederal court house in Minnesota; modernization at Washington \nInternational Airport.'' Modernizing an airport is God's work, but does \nit belong in an emergency bill? Don't we fund that out of a trust fund? \nWhat is it doing in an emergency supplemental bill? ``Renovating the \nU.S. House page dormitory?'' I do not doubt that is meritorious. If I \ndid a survey among the pages they might think it is a wonderful idea. \nBut is suddenly the world going to come to an end if we did it in this \nyear's regular appropriation? My guess is we will not spend a penny of \nit until this year's appropriation bill is enacted anyway, so why is it \nin this emergency appropriation? It's in this emergency appropriation \nso we do not have to count it toward the spending caps next year. \n``$1.5 million for the University of the District of Columbia.'' Then \nthere is funding for the majority whip's office--that is in the House \nlet me make clear--and the House minority leader's office, $333,000 \neach. Why isn't that in the appropriation bill for the legislative \nbranch of Government? Why are we not funding that through the normal \nbudget process? The answer again is we put these things in emergency \nfunding measures in order, basically, to take them out of the process.\n  Why does it matter? Why does it matter that we are getting ready to \nbust our spending caps by $29.8 billion? Why it matters is that every \npenny of that money is coming out of Social Security. We do not have a \nsurplus today except for the fact that Social Security is collecting \nmore money than it is paying out. In fact, Social Security is \ncollecting $127 billion this year more than it will spend. We have \nalready spent $16 billion of that on something other than Social \nSecurity. We are getting ready to spend another $14.8 billion from this \nbill on something other than Social Security.\n  The point is, if we had not passed the emergency supplemental bill \nlast year, which ended up taking $17 billion away from Social Security \nin this year, we would have had in this year the first time ever in \nAmerican history where we actually had a Social Security surplus \navailable to either lock up in a lockbox so it could not be spent or \nuse it to save Social Security.\n  We do not have that ability now because of the emergency bill we \npassed last year, and now we are passing another bill that will take \n$14.8 billion.\n  The point I am making is this: We cannot have it both ways. We cannot \nsay we want to lock this money up for Social Security and spend it at \nthe same time. You can say you want to spend it and that this spending \nis critical and that it is absolutely essential we fill up these lakes \nand build these dormitories and that we fund reparation payments to \nJapanese South Americans from World War II, that we repair high \nschools, which I never knew was a function of the Federal Government.\n  You can say those are emergencies and they are important enough that \nwe are willing to plunder Social Security in order to fund them. That \nis a legitimate position. It is not one with which I agree, but it is a \nlegitimate position. What you cannot do is say we are going to lock \nthis money away from Social Security or we are going to use it to save \nSocial Security and then turn around and spend it. It is not legitimate \nto do both. What we are trying to do in this Congress is say we want to \nsave the money for Social Security and we are trying to spend it at the \nsame time.\n  I do not hold myself out as being more righteous than anybody else, \nbut that is turning a little more sharply than I can turn. I still \nremember the press conferences where we stood up and said we want to \nlock this money away. Here we are today spending it.\n  What am I trying to do in my point of order and what will it do? \nFirst of all, there is not a point of order under the budget resolution \nagainst defense spending. There is a point of order against nondefense \nspending. The tragedy of this bill is that we could have offset all the \nnondefense spending in this bill. There was a point at which, before we \nstarted piling on more and more spending, we could have, with $441 \nmillion, offset all of the nondefense spending in this bill, in which \ncase we would not have had an emergency designation to allow us to \nspend beyond the budget.\n  A decision was made by the Appropriations Committee not to do that. \nThey could have done it. The level of reductions in other programs \nwould have been minuscule. But the basic response from the \nAppropriations Committee, with all due respect, has been: We are not \ngoing to pay for these programs, we are not going to offset them and, \nbasically, if you don't like it, do something about it.\n  That has basically been the message, and people have been up front \nand honest about it. The only thing I know to do about it is to oppose \nthe bill and to use the budget which we adopted and of which I am \nproud--it is the best budget that has been written since I have been in \nCongress or certainly the best budget since the Reagan budget.\n  The problem is, I do not see any willingness on the part of our \ncolleagues to enforce the budget. It is as if somehow writing a good \nbudget was enough. Every day I read in the paper, often from members of \nthe Appropriations Committee, that they do not have any intention of \nliving within these numbers.\n  Some people are saying: OK, let this $14.8 billion go and then the \nnext time we will resist. If you are going to resist this never-ending \nspending spree and this plundering of the Social Security trust fund, \nyou have to begin to resist.\n  We are averaging over $10 billion a year of spending we are not even \ncounting as part of the budget, and I believe that has to end.\n  I am going to make a point of order which simply makes the point that \nunder the budget we wrote earlier this year, any Member of the Senate \ncan raise a budget point of order identifying emergency designations in \nnondefense areas that are not offset, and that in order to overcome \nthat point of order, those who want to spend that money, those who want \nto take that money out of Social Security, will have to get 60 votes to \nwaive that point of order.\n  I do not deceive myself into thinking we are going to get enough \nvotes to sustain this point of order. I realize how the system works. \nBut I think it is important that we begin to raise questions about what \nis going on in the Senate. I do not know how we are going to save \nSocial Security if we keep spending the Social Security surplus, nor do \nI see how we are ever going to give tax relief if we----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 20 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that I may take 7\\1/2\\ minutes off \nmy 15 minutes on the point of order I will raise and use that 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have great \nproblems now. I understand the Senator wants to vote on this point of \norder,\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nand there are 30 minutes on that. We then have time left for the debate \non the bill itself. This vote then, I take it, will occur sometime \naround 25 after 2, the way I look at it. I put the Senate on notice \nthat I am going to ask that the Senate stand in recess or stand off \nthis bill from the hour of 3:30 p.m. until 4:15 p.m. I have not done it \nyet, but I want everyone to know we have to go off this bill. Our \ncommittee cannot be on the floor during that period of time because of \na very important meeting the committee has that we cannot cancel.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be very happy to have this vote on waiving the \npoint of order at any point that will convenience the Senator. There is \nnothing magic about doing it now. I had thought at the end of this 7\\1/\n2\\ minutes that I would raise the point of order, we could go ahead and \nhave this vote and dispose of it, and therefore there will be no \ntrouble being off the bill or potentially finishing the bill before the \nmeeting. If the Senator wants to delay it, I will be happy to do that. \nThe time is not of any importance to me. Whatever will convenience the \nSenator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is 1 hour 6 minutes beyond that. I serve notice to \nthe Senate, as manager, I cannot be here between the hour of 3:30 p.m. \nand 4:15 p.m. We will go ahead and have the vote when Senator Gramm's \ntime expires, but then I will ask the leader to give us consent to do \nsomething in that period of time so we can keep our meeting as \nscheduled. The Senator has another 7\\1/2\\ minutes now, as I understand.\n  Mr. GRAMM. On this. Why don't I go ahead and raise the point of order \nand take my 15 minutes and explain it, if that is OK with the chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what has the Senator been doing? I \nthought we gave him 20 minutes so he can do that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator gave me 20 minutes to speak against the bill. \nI have done that. I am ready to raise the point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And speak 15 more minutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have a right to under the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I misunderstood when I quickly gave the Senator 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator wants me to yield the floor so he can speak \nnow----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There are 30 minutes on his motion to waive.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I get half the time on the motion to waive since I am \nagainst waiving.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the conference report \ncontains nondefense emergency designations in violation of section 206 \nof House Concurrent Resolution 68. I send a list of those designations \nto the desk. There are 29 nondefense emergency designations in this \nbill that are in violation and that are subject to a point of order, \nand I raise the point of order against each of these 29 designations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 206 of H. Con. Res. \n68 and section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive all \npoints of order against this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me be sure to clarify: There are 29 \nprovisions in the bill that are subject to a point of order because \nthey are not funded.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues what this point of order does and \nwhat it does not do.\n  This point of order does not kill the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. This point of order does not strike any funding \nmeasure in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. What this \npoint of order does, by striking the emergency designation for these 29 \nunfunded, nondefense provisions, is that it will trigger an across-the-\nboard cut in all nondefense programs to fund these items.\n  That across-the-board cut will fund $3.4 billion of unfunded \nprograms. It will do it, according to the Office of Management and \nBudget, with a 1.25-percent across-the-board cut in discretionary \nnondefense programs.\n  Obviously, our bill--if this point of order is sustained--will differ \nfrom the House bill. Under the procedures of our budget the bill would \ngo back to the House, which could adopt the bill with this point of \norder made and therefore require the across-the-board cuts to offset \nthis new spending, or the House could amend the bill to throw out the \npoint of order, and the bill would come back and we would vote on the \nbill again and see if we could sustain it.\n  So that is basically what we are doing.\n  This point of order does not kill the supplemental appropriation, it \nsimply pays for it. It simply says, in the $3.4 billion of programs \nthat are not funded, that under the Budget Act you can make a point of \norder that they are not funded, and insist on that point of order so \nthat 60 Members of the Senate would have to vote to say we do not want \nto fund these programs, we want to bust the budget, and we are willing \nto take the money out of the Social Security surplus in order to pay \nfor it--which is what you will be saying if you vote to waive this \nBudget Act point of order. Have no doubt about that.\n  If we sustain this point of order, there will be a 1.25-percent \nacross-the-board cut in the same accounts, same section of the budget, \nnondefense discretionary, to fund these programs. The Appropriations \nCommittee will have a decision at that point as to whether they really \nwant these programs if they have to fund them. My guess is for many of \nthem, they will not. My guess is, if you have to fund these programs, \nyou will decide you do not really want them all.\n  Why have I made this point of order? And why is it important? Why it \nis important is that our budget is so different from real budgets in \nthe real world. Every time we want to bust our budget, we say we have \nan emergency. But American families have emergencies every day. They \nare not able to bust their budgets. What we basically do here would be \nequivalent to a family--they have written out their budget, and they \ndecide to buy a new refrigerator this year or they are going to go on \nvacation this year or they are going to buy a new car this year; and \nJohnny falls down the steps, breaks his arm.\n  The way the Government does it, they say: Well, that is an emergency, \nso we are going to waive our budget. We just won't have to count that \nas part of what we are spending. But that is not the way families work. \nFamilies have to sit back down around their kitchen table, get out an \nenvelope and a pencil, and they have to figure out that if they have \nspent $400 setting Johnny's arm, they are not going to be able to buy \nthat refrigerator or they are not going to be able to go on that \nvacation. They do not like it, but that is what they have to do, \nbecause that is the real world.\n\n  All I am asking here is that on these $3.4 billion worth of programs, \nif they are so good and they are so important, let's pay for them. It \nis not as if we are going to do great violence to the budget of the \nUnited States if we are required to pay for it. We are talking about a \n1.25-percent across the board reduction in order to pay for these \nprograms.\n  My view is that if you really wanted these programs, you would be \nwilling to pay for them. If you are not willing to pay for them, we \nought not to be spending it.\n  So I want to reserve the remainder of my time and conclude by just \nsaying this. If you meant it when you set those caps on spending, if \nyou meant it when you said you want to lock away this money for Social \nSecurity or use it for Social Security reform, we have an opportunity \ntoday to save $3.4 billion that belongs to Social Security. It does not \nbelong to general government. It does not belong to all of these \nprojects we are funding here. It belongs to Social Security.\n  If you want to save that $3.4 billion for Social Security, if you \nwant to lock it away or use it to save Social Security, vote to sustain \nthis point of order. I hope my colleagues will vote to sustain this \npoint of order, because I think it is important. I think if we do not \nstand up now, we will now be at $29.8 billion by which we have \noverspent the 1999 budget before we have ever passed a single regular \nappropriations bill--all in the name of emergencies.\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\n  So if we are ever going to stand up and stop this plundering of \nSocial Security and stop this runaway spending train, we have to do it \nnow. I urge my colleagues to vote with me if you want to protect Social \nSecurity and if you want to live up to the budget.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for just 2 minutes on this motion \nto waive. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for making that motion to \nwaive.\n  My point in addressing the Senate now is to inform the Senators that, \nbasically, this point of order deals with the moneys that are in the \nbill for PL-480 food aid, for refugee assistance, for farm aid, aid for \nthe Wye River, aid to Jordan, for the Central America and Caribbean \nemergency due to Hurricane Keith, and for the FEMA disasters that have \ntaken place throughout our country.\n  All of those are matters that could not have been contemplated in \n1947. We controlled $1.8 trillion on a 2-year period. And the Senator \nfrom Texas is objecting to the fact that these events, that have taken \nplace totally unexpectedly, are going to cost $29.6 billion.\n  He is talking about 16 one-hundredths of 1 percent of the total \nspending that we control. In other words, estimates that were made have \nbeen exceeded now because of unforeseen circumstances in Central \nAmerica, in farm aid, in terms of the assistance to Jordan, in terms of \nFEMA disasters, and national disasters declared by the President, and \nhave consumed 16 one-hundredths of 1 percent more money than we \nestimated.\n  He is wrong in talking about the bill for the year 2000. We have not \ngotten to the year 2000. This does not have any impact on the year 2000 \nexcept in terms of defense. It aids us in defense trying to deal with \ndefense matters.\n  These are things that the Budget Act rightfully said there is a time \nwhen you can have emergencies, when they are unexpected items that have \nhappened.\n  There are a lot of things in this bill that are not emergencies; they \nare supplemental; they are supplemental items. We can argue about them, \nbut they are not involved in what the Senator from Texas is doing. An \nopinion about lumping all those things in the bill is one thing, but to \ndeal with this concept of knocking out the emergency clause is wrong. I \nhope the Senators will support the motion of the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, not too long ago Senator Gramm and I \nstood on the floor shoulder to shoulder preparing a budget for the \nUnited States. Not too long ago, I came up with the idea of a lockbox \nfor Social Security. Once my friend, Senator Gramm, saw it, a few words \nof congratulations and a few thoughts on how to make it perhaps a \nlittle better, we stood shoulder to shoulder that we wanted to save the \nSocial Security trust fund. Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is proud of the budget that is going to \noperate for the year 2000, the new millennium. It is going to be a \ntough budget, and we are going to try to live with it. But I do not \nbelieve we should leave the floor today with a lot of Americans, if \nthey were listening, thinking that the budget of the United States is \nout of control.\n  Sometimes my good friend from Texas overstates the case. And by \noverstating the case, sometimes, instead of being as effective as he \ncould be, he is a little less effective.\n  Nobody looking at the budget of the United States as it pertains to \nthe accounts we are talking about, defense and appropriated domestic \naccounts, thinks it is out of control. As a matter of fact, the whole \nworld looks at this budget, the one that the Senator from Texas is \nsaying is out of control, and says, how do you do it? You are doing so \nwell.\n  As a matter of fact, the defense spending which is in this budget--\npart of the budget that the Senator is talking about--is at the lowest \nlevel and under control, the lowest level since World War II, the end \nof World War II, in terms of the percent of our gross domestic product \nthat goes to defense. Likewise, the domestic spending that he is \nalluding to, out of control, says he, well, let me tell you, it is the \nlowest in history in terms of the percent of GDP. We are doing a great \njob of controlling this part of the budget.\n  He and I may come to the floor and discuss another issue where we \nmight agree, but it has nothing to do with this bill, nothing to do \nwith these ideas that he is alluding to today about the budget. They \nhave to do with entitlements and mandatory spending. So for those who \nthink the budget has gotten kind of big, we have to face up to where it \nis that it is getting its pot belly. It is not getting it from these \ntwo accounts, defense and domestic discretionary spending. That is the \ntruth.\n  The Senator referred to families and their budgets. I noticed some \npeople were listening to him almost enraptured thinking about their own \ncheckbooks. To compare a family checkbook with a great American country \nthat has a war going on in Kosovo that we didn't know about 6 months \nago and expect us not to have to spend some money for that is to \ncompare an individual American family in their kitchen with their \ncheckbook to a country that is at war and needs money to fight the war. \nThat is what is principally behind this appropriations bill. The \noverwhelming percentage of this spending is for the defense of our \nNation, if that is why we are in Kosovo, because we have something to \ndefend. And whether you like the war or you don't like the war, it \ncosts money. It isn't predicted in the family checkbook that in the \nmiddle of the month you are going to have a war, because families don't \nhave wars. They don't go out and buy more tanks and more airplanes, \nwhen they have a disaster.\n  That is point No. 1--the budget is not out of control.\n  Point No. 2--the overwhelming percentage of this particular bill is \nfor the defense of our Nation. Many of us are proud that we put more \nmoney in than the President had asked us for. We thought the President \nlow-balled the request because he didn't want to be embarrassed about \nthis war, and so he has far too little money. We put in $5 billion more \nin this bill. Take that to the American people and ask them: Would you \ndo that, or would you not do that? Would you believe Senator Gramm's \nreasoning for saying let's cut some other American programs to pay for \nthat?\n\n  By the way, the sequester which he is speaking about, the across-the-\nboard cut which will be done by the Office of Management and Budget, \nthe President's people, it will not be 1.25 percent for all the rest of \nthe accounts. Because the year is so far down, it will be almost 4 \npercent, 3.75 percent, or some $3 billion. Is that what we should do \nwhen we have emergencies, cut all of Government across the board 3.75 \npercent, not when the budget starts, but when the budget year is half \nover with or more than half over with, just say we are going to cut it? \nFamilies do not do that either, if you want to talk about families. \nThey don't come along when they have all their children's bills paid \nfor and everything else and say that we are going to cut 3.75 percent \nout of it and spend it for something else. They don't have that kind of \nproblem. That is what we are going to be confronted with for American \nprograms in education, in construction, in highways, in everything.\n  It is just not worth it, in this Senator's opinion. The longer you \nwait and delay this bill, the more the demands are going to be, not \nless. They will be more.\n  Let me just give you one more. If we are out of control, every \ncountry in Europe and every industrial democracy in the world has \nalready gone out of this world. They are all spending more than we are \nas a percentage of their budgets. Their budgets are much higher than \nours. And that is why we are doing so well--because our budgets are \nlow, and our taxes must remain low.\n  To be sure on my comments about how low defense spending is and how \nlow domestic spending is versus other years and other nations, I have \nthat on two pieces of paper. I ask that those two documents be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\n Total government--Federal, State, local--spending as a percentage of \n                               GDP (1998)\n\n\n                                                                Percent\nUnited States........................................................31\nEngland..............................................................40\nFrance...............................................................54\nGermany..............................................................47\nJapan................................................................37\nCanada...............................................................42\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Percentage of GDP\n                                               -------------------------\n                                                  Defense     Nondefense\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1980..........................................          5.0          5.2\n1985..........................................          6.2          4.0\n1990..........................................          5.3          3.5\n1995..........................................          3.8          3.8\n1998 \\1\\......................................          3.2          3.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The lowest percentage since WWII, both defense and nondefense.\n\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The issue now is not whether you want to vote for this \nbill or not. The issue is whether you want to support a motion to waive \nthe point of order, a very specific, new point of order; I helped draft \nit. It is a nice point of order. Whether you want to waive it or not, \nthat is the issue. If you want to vote against the bill, you can still \ndo that but, frankly, you should move to waive this so that when those \npeople who want to vote for this bill vote for it, they are not \nconfronted with having to cut Government 3.75 percent in order to \naccomplish the purposes suggested here by my good friend from Texas, \nSenator Gramm.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from New \nMexico for helping me see that in an effort to derail this point of \norder that we didn't do something that could undercut the whole budget. \nI am very grateful for his help on that.\n  I want to disagree with the points that have been made by my two \ncolleagues and do it in such a way as to not be disagreeable.\n  First of all, our dear colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, says that the violating expenditures here that are not \noffset are only sixteen-hundredths of a percent of overall Government \nspending. Well, my point is, if it is that small an amount of money, \nwhy don't we pay for it? In a budget of $1.7 trillion, we are in \nessence saying that $3.4 billion of nondefense spending is so important \nwe are willing to violate the budget in terms of spending beyond our \ncap. But it is not important enough that we are willing to cut \nsomewhere else to fund it? It seems to me if it is that important, we \nought to be willing to pay for it.\n  As to whether the budget is out of control relative to much of the \nworld, our budget is not out of control. I agree with our colleagues. I \nam not making a statement trying to send the stock market down at 2, \nnor do I think any statement I could make would be capable of doing \nthat. But I am not comparing America to Honduras. I am not comparing \nAmerica to Japan. I am comparing what America is doing relative to what \nCongress promised the American people we would do.\n  I do say that when we are spending, in emergency spending in 1999, \nthree times as much as we have ever spent before, that suggests to me \nthat something is out of control. As we all know, we read every day in \nthe paper where Members are saying there is no way we can live up to \nthese spending caps, and that this is only the beginning of our \nviolation of the budget. My view is this ought to be the beginning of \nthe fight to preserve the budget numbers we adopted.\n  Let me tell you how the budget is out of control. It is not out of \ncontrol the way we keep our books, even though we are beginning to lose \ncontrol by designating all the spending as an emergency. But if we used \naccrual accounting, like American business has to, with Medicare and \nSocial Security, we would be running huge deficits today.\n\n  I agree with our colleague from New Mexico. Many of our worst \nproblems are in areas like Social Security and Medicare. But the point \nis, we have to have Presidential leadership, we have to put together a \nprogram to deal with those problems; and it takes a concerted effort to \ndo that. But the one area that we can control by ourselves is \ndiscretionary spending. The point is, if we don't have the will to \nprevent $3.4 billion of new spending, how are we going to have the will \nto reform Social Security or Medicare?\n  In terms of comparing the checkbook of a family to a great nation and \na great economy, I think it is a good comparison. In fact, Adam Smith \nonce observed:\n\n       What is wisdom in every household can hardly be folly in \n     the economy of a great nation.\n\n  Where can we find a better blueprint for fiscal responsibility than \nlooking at working American families sitting around the kitchen table? \nThe fact that they are dealing with thousands of dollars and we are \ndealing with billions of dollars doesn't fundamentally change things. \nThey have to set priorities. They have to say no. And they have to say \nno to their children, the people they love, and to real needs.\n  All I am saying is that we need to say no more often so that working \nfamilies can say yes more often. I want to save Social Security so we \ndon't have to double the payroll tax. I want to save Social Security so \nwe don't have to cut benefits for the elderly. But we can't do that if \nwe keep spending the Social Security surplus.\n  In terms of across-the-board cuts, if it is not worth cutting to pay \nfor, then why is it worth spending? If it is not worth taking it from a \nlower priority, is Social Security the lowest priority? Is taking this \nmoney out of the Social Security surplus of lower significance than \nfunding all the thousands of other programs we fund? I don't think so.\n  The final point. This is a point of order under the Budget Act \nagainst the nondefense portions of this bill. I would have raised a \npoint of order against all the emergency designations in the bill had \nthe point of order existed. I don't want people to think this is \nsomehow nondefense versus defense. I believe in a strong defense. My \ndad was a sergeant in the Army for 28 years 7 months and 27 days. I \nhave voted for defense. I have helped write budgets that rebuilt \ndefense. But I want to pay for defense.\n  I think where the difference is, I am willing to cut other programs \nto fund defense. But I don't understand why we are not willing to take \nit away from something else to fund defense but we are willing to \nviolate our spending caps to fund defense. And if this war is so \nvitally important--let me make it clear that I don't see the vital \nnational interest here. I don't see this as a vote on the war. But let \nme make it very clear, if this war is so vital, we ought to be willing \nto cut other Government programs to fund it. The idea that we ought to \ntake the money out of Social Security to fund this war, I think, is \nwrong.\n  So, again, this is a hard issue. I don't doubt the sincerity of our \ncolleagues who are trying to do a difficult job in writing these \nappropriations. But there are two reasons I am here making this point \nof order. No. 1, we busted the budget by $21 billion on the last day of \nthe last Congress. We are already at almost $30 billion of busting it \nnow. We have to stop this from happening at some point. Let's do it \nnow.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that the Senator yield me 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to the chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let's go back to what we are talking \nabout. If a family had a $16,000-a-year income and had a 16 one-\nhundredths of 1 percent overage in their expenditures that year, they \nwould have to borrow $20. We are talking about 16 one-hundredths of 1 \npercent in excess of the budget. And it is for items that are \nemergencies. What family would not borrow $20 to meet an emergency? Is \nit disaster relief emergency? Yes. Is the Central America-Caribbean \nexpenditure an emergency? Yes. The Wye River accord for Jordan, was \nthat an emergency? Yes. Is farm country in trouble? Is that an \nemergency? Yes. All we are saying is we are going to deal with that $20 \nout of $16,000. That is the comparison for an average family.\n\n  Mr. President, the thing that bothers me most about this is, we have \nto contemplate change. I will make one statement to you. If the New \nMadrid Fault that runs through the center of this country suffers an \nearthquake again--the last time it went off, the church bells rang in \nBoston because of an earthquake that took place going through the area \nwest of the Mississippi. It changed the Mississippi River. It went \nbackwards. It started a new channel which it has today. Can you imagine \nthe amount of money we\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nwould have to have? That is why the Budget Act provides money for \nemergencies. If the Senator is trying to say you have to have 60 votes \nto overcome that, now, that is wrong. I hope we have them today, Mr. \nPresident. This is an emergency, and this money is needed by the \nDepartment of Defense, and the agencies need it.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator from Texas have any time remaining?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't think I have any.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in conclusion, Senator Gramm makes a lot \nof good points. I believe we make some good points, also. I don't \nbelieve we ought to, at this stage of the budget year, adopt a point of \norder that will send us back to all of the Government programs, some of \nwhich many of us don't like, some of which many of us love, most of \nwhich are halfway through a year. I don't believe we ought to go back \nand have them cut 3.7 percent across the board.\n  One thing about missing our budget targets--the so-called caps, Mr. \nPresident--the overwhelming percentage of supplemental appropriations \nhave been for real emergencies, or emergencies that the President of \nthe United States asked us for and in which we concurred. That is what \nthe Budget Act says; caps are binding except for emergencies; emergency \nmoney is not subject to caps. That is what we have here.\n  I hope we pass this appropriations bill today and fund what our \nmilitary desperately needs to replenish the Kosovo war and replenish \nthe military equipment and the time that was spent in Central America \nfor the disaster that killed 10,000 of our neighbors in Central \nAmerica. Those are predominant items in this bill. There are a lot of \nsmall ones that are difficult to justify, but in a real sense they \ndon't really amount to the essence of this bill, which is emergencies \nwe cannot contemplate.\n  I yield back whatever time I have.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support to Senator \nGramm's point of order against the supplemental appropriations \nconference report. As I have said before, we must provide the offsets \nfor the nonemergency portions of this conference report. There is \ncurrently $13.3 billion of nonemergency spending that has not been \noffset, in violation of the Budget Act. I believe that Congress must \nprotect the Social Security surplus and ensure that the money is there \nfor future generations, not spend it on items that are clearly \nnonemergency items.\n  We have been spending the last few years talking about fiscal \ndiscipline and the spending caps. Now that we have a surplus, Congress \nmust resist the temptation to circumvent the regular appropriations \nprocess. Many of the items contained in the report should have been \nconsidered by the appropriations subcommittees and debated on the floor \nof the Senate. Congress must allow the regular process to take place \nand not sneak things into appropriations bills.\n  I tried to offer legislation that would provide those offsets, but an \nobjection was raised. I want to ensure that Congress does the right \nthing and preserves the Social Security surplus. This is what the lock \nbox legislation would prevent. This is what my legislation would \nprevent. I ask my colleagues not to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I supported Senator Gramm's point of \norder because, while some of the spending programs in this bill may \nhave merit, they should not be funded by Social Security Trust Fund \nbalances. The point of order would not prevent these programs from \nbeing funded, but would force Congress to find adequate offsetting \nspending cuts to pay for those programs, or those spending cuts would \nbe imposed automatically at the end of the fiscal year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion \nto waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \ntake place at 15 minutes after 2, in 7 minutes, and I yield that time \nuntil the vote to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. The vote \nwill take place at 2:15, in 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The vote \nwill be at 2:15.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, for yielding me the time.\n  I support the waiver on the point of order. The conference committee \nlabored extensively and diligently to come up with the bill that is on \nthe floor at the present time. It was a tough, contentious, \nargumentative conference. While not perfect, we conferees did the very \nbest we could. At some points on Wednesday night of last week, it \nlooked a little like ``Saturday Night Live,'' except it was Wednesday. \nC-SPAN was in the conference room recording and videocasting across the \ncountry to the few who might have been inclined to watch.\n  Having been a party to that conference and having struggled through \nthe issues of the necessity for military spending and the emergency \nprograms that are involved in Hurricane Mitch and the tragedies in \nOklahoma and Kansas--Kansas being my native State --the conference \ncommittee did the very best it could.\n  This bill ought to be enacted in toto. Since that requires a waiver \ninitially, that ought to be undertaken.\n  We are really looking at broader, complex issues as we face the \nappropriations process for fiscal year 2000.\n  We have recently seen the allocations in the House of \nRepresentatives. The allocations in the Senate are portending for very, \nvery severe cuts.\n  I chair the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services. The \nPresident's budget is slightly in excess of $90 billion. The allocation \npreliminarily marked up for my subcommittee is $80 billion. If that is \nto happen, we are going to have some really drastic, drastic cuts, cuts \nwhich the American people are going to have to evaluate as they are \nmaking their wishes known in our representative democracy to the \nMembers of the House and Senate.\n  We have budget caps. I would like to live within those budget caps. \nBut to do that, we are going to be looking at these kinds of reductions \nin spending:\n  On Safe and Drug-Free Schools, there would be a cut of $66 million \nfrom the Drug and Violence Prevention Program.\n  Here we are today on a juvenile crime bill where we are trying to \ndeal with the problems of juvenile crime, and at the same time we are \nlooking at a budget which is going to cut funding of $66 million from \nthe guts of that kind of a program--drug and violence prevention.\n  We are looking at cuts on the Job Corps of $150 million from a $1.3 \nbillion program.\n  When we talk about the Job Corps, here again we are talking about \ndealing with juveniles who may have gone astray.\n  If you have a juvenile offender without a trade or a skill, a \nfunctional illiterate who leaves prison, that individual is going to go \nback to a life of crime, and is going to get the first gun he can put \nhis hands on. And here we are talking about an enormous cut in the JOBS \nProgram, which is designed specifically against that problem.\n  We have enormous cuts in child care--$131 million in our efforts to \nwhip the welfare program and send welfare mothers to work. Child care \nis indispensable.\n  Special education--a favorite of all Senators--would be cut by $480 \nmillion.\n  The National Institutes of Health, the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment, perhaps the only jewel of the Federal Government--instead \nof having a $2 billion increase, which the Senate said we ought to have \nin the sense of the Senate, the National Institutes of Health would be \nreduced by $1.8 billion, which would result in approximately 6000 fewer \ngrants at a time when medical research is on the verge of solving \nenormous problems of Parkinson's with the new stem cells estimated \nwithin the 5- to 10-year range.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Some of those who were called to \norder may be the ones who ought to be listening to what needs to happen \nin our appropriations process if we are to achieve the goals of our \nlofty rhetoric.\n  But interrupting, the juvenile violence bill on the culture of \nviolence\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\nwe have programs which are designed to deal with that. The way we are \nheading, we are going to be cutting the heart out of the precise \nprograms intended to deal with that culture of violence.\n  These are issues which I hope the American people will understand so \nthat their views may be felt in our representative democracy.\n  We would all like to stay within the caps. We would all like to \neconomize. But when we take a look at a $10 billion cut which hits \nlabor, safety programs, and health and education, those are matters \nwhich have to be decided by this body reflecting the views of our \nconstituency.\n  I again thank the chairman for yielding the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. On \nthis question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 70, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 135 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--70\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Voinovich\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 70, the nays are 30.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if we could, for the orderly presentation \nof the balance of the argument on this bill, I inquire, how much time \nremains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 12 minutes. The \nSenator from West Virginia has 42 minutes. The Senator from North \nDakota has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask the Senator from West Virginia if we can make a \nlist of who is going to be recognized, because almost all the time is \nallocated, as I understand it. I yield 5 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner. I reserve 7 minutes of the time. Can \nthe Senator allocate his time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Let me see how much time I have left. I have 45 \nminutes promised.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has 42 minutes, but I will give him 3 of my \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Please tell us what they are.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator Conrad, 5 minutes; Senator Landrieu, 5 minutes; \nSenator Harkin, 8 minutes; Senator Graham, 7\\1/2\\ minutes; Senator \nDodd, 5 minutes; Senator Durbin, 5 minutes; Senator Wellstone, 5 \nminutes; Senator Boxer, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator reserving some time for himself?\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator Dorgan has 15 minutes for himself outside this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does that allocate fully the Senator's 42 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). It does.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge the Senators to take their time starting now.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I begin, I pay tribute to the Senator \nfrom Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens, \nand the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and other of my \ncolleagues. I see the Senator from Mississippi on the floor, Mr. \nCochran, and so many others who in that conference spent hour after \nhour, day after day hammering out a conference agreement. Especially \nthe chairman and the ranking member. I recall one evening sitting there \nat 1 in the morning, and they were still there exhibiting the kind of \npatience that is quite extraordinary in order to resolve all of these \nmany issues.\n  Much of the discussion was about the victims of Hurricane Mitch, the \nresponsibility to respond to our neighbors in this hemisphere who have \nbeen hit with such a terrible disaster, the military needs with respect \nto the airstrikes in Kosovo, and the prosecution of that conflict, the \nneeds for spring planting loans in farm country, and a range of other \nissues.\n  I support many of those areas, but I am not going to support the \nconference report because I believe, as I indicated in the conference \ncommittee, that if there are resources above that which was requested \nfor the Defense Department for the prosecution of this conflict in \nKosovo, if there were $2 billion or $3 billion or $5 billion or $6 \nbillion more available, then I believe we should have a better debate \non the priorities of the use of those funds. I, for one, believe we \nhave an urgent, urgent need in rural America to provide a better safety \nnet to give family farmers a chance to make it through this price \ndepression. I believe that is the priority.\n  We had a vote in the conference on the Senate side, and we lost 14-14 \non a proposal that would have added nearly $5.5 billion for some price \nsupports to build a bridge across those price valleys during these \ntroubled times in rural America. We lost 14-14. I wish we had won.\n  Nearly $5.5 billion to $6 billion was added to this package for \ndefense spending that was not requested. It is not that the money is \nnot available, it is that a different priority was attached to the \nspending of this money.\n  I will tell you why I feel so strongly about this. I come from rural \nAmerica. I come from a small town. We raised some cattle and horses. \nLast Thursday, my brother called a florist in a little town called \nMott, ND. Mott, ND, is 14 miles from my hometown of Regent. Regent has \n300 people and Mott is a bigger town and always was, even when I was \ngrowing up. Mott is about 800 people.\n  My brother called the florist on the Main Street of Mott. There is \none little florist shop. He said: My brother and I want to order \nflowers to be delivered to the cemetery at Regent for our mother and \nfather for their graves on Memorial Day. We do that each year, and we \nalso do so on Mother's Day and Father's Day.\n  My brother said he told the woman who runs and owns the floral shop: \nBy the way, I forgot to call you this year on Mother's Day. I was going \nto have you deliver some flowers for Mother's Day.\n  Incidentally, this floral shop always apologizes when we call because \nshe says: We have to charge you a $2 delivery fee. It is 28 miles.\n  My brother said: I forgot to call you this year to deliver flowers \nfor our mother's grave on Mother's Day, but I would like you to deliver \nthem on Memorial Day.\n  The woman who owns the flower shop said: That's all right, we \ndelivered some on Mother's Day because we know you call every year and \nwe thought you just forgot. Later on, we were going to send you a bill, \nand if you paid it, that was all right, and if you did not, that's all \nright, too.\n  That probably does not happen across America, but it happens in my \npart of the country, in rural America, where family farmers and Main \nStreet merchants work together in a lifestyle that is really quite \nwonderful. People do things, people help each other, but there is no \namount of help in farm country these days that can reach out\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nand say to family farmers who are struggling to make a living: We will \nhelp you with the price of your grain. We know you are trucking that \ngrain to the elevator these days and are told there is no value; we \nwill help you.\n  That is not what is happening. In fact, they are going to the \nelevators today to find out the grain market has collapsed and they are \ngetting Depression-era prices, at the same time the current farm \nprogram, freedom to farm, is pulling the rug out from under these \nfarmers with respect to the safety net. We need to help.\n  If we want family farmers in our future, we need to help. If we want \nto preserve this kind of lifestyle, yes, of family farms and Main \nStreet of our small towns, we need to do something to help.\n  I want to read a few things from Ted Koppel's program ``Nightline'' \non Tuesday, May 18. They did a program on the farm crisis. They pointed \nout--while all of the good news comes to the Washington Post and the \nNew York Times, just open them up and read all the wonderful news, our \neconomy is growing, unemployment is down, inflation is down, virtually \neverything else is up, a lot of good news--but the farm belt does not \nexperience that good news. Family farmers are in desperate trouble and \nsmall towns are shrinking. The rural economy is in desperate trouble.\n  Ted Koppel on his program had farmers and others talking. I will \nshare some of that with my colleagues:\n\n       Here's what many farmers see happening, the prices they can \n     sell their crops for falling and predicted to stay low. . . \n     . wheat prices are down 42 percent.\n  Now, ask yourself, how would you feel or your family feel if you had \na 42-percent cut in your income? Would you feel that the economy is \ndoing real well?\n\n       Corn prices are down 38 percent. Oats and barley down 32 \n     percent.\n\n  In constant dollars, these are prices that we received in the family \nfarm in the Great Depression.\n  At the start of the program, Ted Koppel interviewed a fellow. He \ntalks about a guy who works with farm families, tries to help them. \nWillard Brunell said:\n\n       I think the scariest one was back a few years when I got a \n     phone call from a farm wife [who] said my husband just left \n     with a gun and he's driving away. He said he's going to his \n     tractor. [He said] I was there with him 20 minutes and it was \n     quite a ways away. I got him out of his tractor. He sat in my \n     little car and we spent two hours in that car trying to talk \n     him down and he told me exactly how he was doing, going to do \n     it. He had the gun with him. . . .\n\n  They get more than 50 calls a month in this fellow's church talking \nabout that kind of desperation.\n  In Minnesota and North Dakota, where Ted Koppel's program was taped, \nis some of the richest farmland in the entire world. Last year, one in \nevery three farmers grew a crop that cost more to produce than they \ncould sell it for. For many, it was the fourth, fifth year that \nhappened.\n  Lowell Nelson was interviewed on this program. He is one of those \nfarmers.\n\n       He was born, raised and had his own sons on this land, a \n     fertile 400 acres he bought from his brothers 35 years ago \n     after his dad died. But this spring [is the first spring] \n     he's not planting anything.\n\n  He cannot. He is ruined. He said:\n\n       Well, I had been putting it off [this decision] for quite \n     [a long] time and I had gotten a lot of urging, you know, \n     from my wife to make a decision and I had just been putting \n     it off. It's a decision I didn't want to make.\n\n  His wife said:\n\n       One night he was out in the field and all of a sudden \n     called me on the [shortwave] radio and wanted me to come over \n     just to ride with him [on the tractor] and I knew something \n     was wrong and it was shortly thereafter that he decided he'd \n     better get some medical help.\n\n  The interviewer asked Mr. Nelson:\n\n       How badly did you scare yourself?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Real bad.\n\n  The interviewer asked:\n\n       What do you mean?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Thinking that it may be better off not being here.\n\n  The reason I mention the ``Nightline'' program, they interviewed \nthese folks. These are real people in desperate trouble--just in \ndesperate trouble. We have a country whose economy is growing and \nthriving and rising--full of good news. The stock market hits record \nhighs. Everybody says this is a terrific economy. Then you drive out \ndown a country road, and talk to a family who has struggled for 20, 30, \n50 years, and you see what is happening.\n  A big guy stood up at a meeting I had one day. He had a big beard, a \ntall fellow, a strong fellow. He said: You know, my granddad farmed my \nfarm. My dad farmed it for 40 years. And I have farmed it for 23 years. \nThen his eyes teared up and his chin began to quiver, and he could not \ncontinue anymore. When he finally got the words out, he said: And I \ncan't keep going anymore. I'm broke, so I have to sell the farm.\n\n  That may not matter to some, but it matters to me.\n  A woman wrote me a couple of weeks ago and said: We had our auction \nsale on our farm, and my 17-year-old son would not get out of bed to \ncome downstairs. He refused to come down and help at the auction sale \nbecause he was so heartbroken. He knew he would never be able to do \nwhat his dad did. He knew he would never be able to farm that farm. She \ncould not get him out of bed he was so heartbroken.\n  I tell you all of that because we pass a supplemental bill and we \nsay: All right, on defense, the Defense Department needs $6.1 billion \nto prosecute this war in Kosovo. We must restore munitions and planes \nand do other things. And I am for all of that. I support all of that. I \nsupport our men and women in uniform and support this mission.\n  But then we also say there is another $5 or $6 billion we want to add \nto that. And I say, if there is $5 or $6 billion around that can be \nused in this discretionary way, then I want the priority to say: We \nwant to continue to invest in America's family farmers.\n  You think this country is going to be a better, stronger place when \nwe don't have family farmers left? When corporations farm America from \nCalifornia to Maine, you think food prices are not going to go up? And \nit is more than just farming. These folks contribute in every way to \ntheir community. They contribute to a way of life that we are losing in \nthis country. Yet, somehow, when we talk about all of these fancy \neconomic theories, nobody talks about the family as an economic unit--\nnobody.\n  The economic unit in this country is the large corporation. They are \nall getting married, as you know. There is all this corporate romance \ngoing on all over America. Every day you wake up and see a new couple \nof corporations have decided to get hitched and get bigger.\n  What about the economic unit that really matters in the center of \nthis country in America's farm belt that grows America's food? That \nmakes America's communities strong? That helps build America's \nchurches? That puts life on main streets on Saturday night? What about \nthose economic units? What about family farmers?\n  Last year, we passed an emergency bill. About half of that money is \nnot yet in the hands of family farmers. It will be there in a matter of \nweeks, I guess, through the USDA, through this formula. But it is $1.5 \nbillion short of what was promised. We should have at least added that \nto this piece of legislation. We should have at least added some \nadditional support to say to family farmers, when prices collapse at \nDepression-level prices, we are going to reach out a helping hand, \nextend a helping hand to you to say you matter to this country.\n  We had an opportunity to do that and did not. A 14-to-14 vote, and \nhow I regret losing that vote--but in this business, in this system, \nyou win some and you lose some. My hope is that those who felt it not \nappropriate, those who felt it was not the time to respond to this need \nnow will, a week from now or a month from now, decide that it is time \nto respond.\n\n  This is not Democrat and Republican. We have had bad farm programs \nunder all kinds of administrations--Democratic administrations, \nRepublican administrations. I want the farmers to get the price from \nthe marketplace as well. That would be my fervent hope. But when the \nmarketplace collapses, we must help.\n  Let me make a final point. I think it is fascinating that at a time \nwhen\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\nsomehow the economic unit of the family, with respect to agriculture, \ndoes not seem to matter, that which the family farm produces in this \ncountry is used by everybody else to make record profits--the railroads \nmake record profits hauling it; the cereal manufacturers make record \nprofits putting air in it and puffing it up and putting it on the \ngrocery store shelves and calling it puffed wheat--the farmers go \nbroke. The manufacturers get rich. Or they sell a steer for a pittance \nor sell a hog for $20, an entire hog. You can buy a hog for $20 at the \nbottom of the hog market, and then go to the store and buy a ham that \ncost you $30 or $40. Buy a small ham at twice the price you bought the \nentire hog for.\n  Something is fundamentally wrong, and farmers know it. So everybody \nwho touches these products make record profits and are getting bigger \nand richer; and the folks who start the tractor and plow the ground and \nplant the seed, and then hope all summer it does not hail, the insects \ndon't come, that it rains enough and doesn't rain too much, and that \nthey, by the grace of God, might get a crop, wonder whether they will \nbe able to sell it in the fall and make any kind of profit.\n  So I cannot vote for this conference report. But having said that, I \ndeeply admire the work of the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nWest Virginia and others who participated in it. The priorities, in my \njudgment, needed to include the priorities I have just discussed with \nrespect to helping family farmers, and they do not, regrettably.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nconference report. I say to my good friend from North Dakota, I had \noriented myself to one set of remarks, but I listened carefully to his, \nas I frequently do. He certainly speaks from the heart about his \npeople. I remember the floods that his State experienced years ago. I \nfeel as if I am on the farm, the family farm, with him. And you talked \nabout that family.\n  So while we may be at odds on this bill, I want to take the same \ntheme and talk about a family. I want to talk about a military family. \nThis bill has in it provisions for a military family.\n  I want to talk about that wife here in the United States, or in other \nplaces of the world, with their children, whose husband is flying an \naircraft right at this minute in harm's way. It could be the reverse, \nbecause women are flying aircraft in harm's way in this conflict over \nthe Balkan region, over Iraq.\n  Mr. President, this country is at war. And for that wife at home, war \nis hell. For that individual in the cockpit, war is hell.\n  The purpose of this emergency legislation is to provide the dollars \nnecessary to alleviate to some extent the strain on the families and \nthose in the cockpits.\n  Every Member of the Senate has young men and women involved in the \nconflict in Kosovo or over the general Balkan region or over Iraq or \nstanding guard, as they are, in other far, remote areas of the world to \nprotect freedom. That is what this bill is all about.\n  Let me add one other feature, and then I will yield the floor, \nbecause many are anxious to speak.\n  Each year, the Department of Defense plans for the next year and the \nyear following as to how many aviators, for example, they will train to \nkeep the cockpits filled. Last year, the number of pilots we had to \nkeep to maintain the flying status of sufficient men and women fell by \n1,641. That number of young men and women trained as aviators decided \nthey no longer could remain on active duty and would return to civilian \nopportunities. Many of those decisions were dictated by their concern \nfor their families. But stop to think of what it costs every American \ntaxpayer to replace that individual in that airplane, to train the \nnumber of new recruits to be pilots or navigators or to take to sea in \nthose combat airplanes.\n  I ran that calculation. It costs roughly between $2 million to $6 \nmillion, depending on the type of aircraft, to train a man or a woman \nto become an aviator, $2 million to $6 million. If you multiply the \naverage of that times 1,641, it is $9 billion just to replace the \naviators. That same drain on trained manpower, womanpower in the \nmilitary occurs in other branches of the service where perhaps their \ntraining is not as costly to the taxpayer but $9 billion just to close \nthe gap for those flying aircraft.\n  Let us think about the families, as my good friend from North Dakota \ndescribed, the farm community. Let us talk about the military, what \nthose wives and their children, what those aviators are doing in harm's \nway today. They are carrying out the orders of the President of the \nUnited States, as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. This Nation \nis but one of 19 nations locked together in the first combat operation \nin the 50-year history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  This is a critical moment for families, be they farm families or \nmilitary families.\n  Mr. President, as I said, support the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill now before the Senate. As chairman of the Committee \non Armed Services, I join with my colleague and close working partner \non defense matters, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to \nurge all our colleagues to support our military forces by voting for \nthis bill.\n  I support this bill for one simple reason--we are at war. As we \nspeak, we have military forces engaged in combat--going in harm's way--\nin the skies over the Balkans and Iraq. Whether or not there is \nagreement on how these risk-taking operations are being prosecuted is \nnot now the question. We must support our military forces who are \nrisking their lives daily to carry out the missions they have been \nassigned.\n  Mr. President, the conflict in Kosovo has been ongoing since March \n24, when the NATO use of force began. Since that time our pilots and \nthe pilots of our allies have flown thousands of combat missions \nagainst Milosevic's military machine. We have already spent billions of \ndollars--on both aircraft operations and munitions--in support of \nOperation Allied Force. These funds are now coming out of the readiness \naccounts of our military services. Without this supplemental, there \nwould be further and unacceptable degradation of the readiness of our \nforces.\n  The conference agreement provides $10.9 billion for defense, \nincluding $2.2 billion above the President's request for aircraft \nflying hours, spare parts, depot maintenance and munitions, including \nsophisticated precision-guided missiles and bombs, which allow our \npilots to be more effective at reduced risk--both to them and to \ninnocent civilians on the ground.\n  Mr. President, I know that some of my colleagues have expressed \nconcern regarding the funds provided in this bill for pay raises, pay \ntable reform and retirement reform. I firmly believe that all my \ncolleagues would agree that we have very serious problems of recruiting \nand retention in our military services. I believe the problems are of \nsuch magnitude--indeed, we have a hemorrhaging of skilled personnel \nleaving our military--that this situation qualifies as an emergency. As \nan example, both the Army and the Navy failed to meet their 1998 \nrecruiting goals and the Army, Navy, and the Air Force project that \nthey will not meet their recruiting goals for 1999.\n  Last year, 1641 more pilots left the service than the Department of \nDefense projected. It costs about $6 million to train a single pilot. \nThe cost to replace these 1641 pilots is more than $9 billion. We must \nact to stop this hemmorhage of pilots and other skilled military \npersonnel. We must send a signal now that we in the Congress intend to \ntake care of our military personnel and their families.\n  I know that there are Senators who are concerned about this process, \nand there are Senators who disagree with some of the items in this \nemergency supplemental. I share some of these concerns. But, Mr. \nPresident, as I stated earlier, our Nation is at war. We can argue the \nprocess and our other concerns at another time.\n  I believe that now is the time for the Senate to show its support for \nour men and women in uniform who are, as we speak, carrying out their \nassigned missions under difficult and dangerous conditions. I will vote \nfor this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate \nhis work on this very important measure for our country at this time.\n  I was here in the Chamber and got to hear the remarkable speech of \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota. He is absolutely correct. \nThere is not enough money in this supplemental appropriations bill to \naddress the devastation that we are experiencing throughout rural \nAmerica. My State in particular has been hard hit because of weather-\nrelated disasters, the worst drought in over a century occurred last \nyear.\n  It is my hope that in the months ahead we will all, on both sides of \nthis aisle, Democrats and Republicans, be more mindful of the \ntremendous difficulty that rural America is experiencing and come up \nwith additional and real ways of helping that lead us to a more market-\noriented approach but recognize that there are some safety nets and \nsome bridges that need to be put in place that are not there yet, and \nit is causing great pain throughout America.\n  However, I want to point out that in this supplemental, partly \nbecause of the fine work by the Senator from North Dakota and others, \nwe have added a half billion dollars for much-needed farm relief. It is \nnot enough, but it is better than nothing. Farmers in my State in \nLouisiana and in many States around the Nation are depending on us \ntoday to vote favorably toward this measure and to send them this help. \nEvery day in my office the phone rings with farmers needing their \nemergency assistance that was promised to them last year but not \nforthcoming.\n  It is estimated from our agriculture commissioner that there are over \n300 to 400 farmers that are just barely holding on, waiting for these \nchecks and this assistance so that they can make future plans.\n  It is important. It is not enough money in this bill, but it is \nbetter than what it started out to be. Because of the leadership, a \nhalf billion dollars has been added. I am happy to say that a great \ndeal of that money will go to help Louisiana and other States in our \narea.\n  This package includes much-needed emergency assistance to farmers in \nLouisiana and other agriculture States still reeling from last year's \nextreme weather conditions.\n  Mr. President, I will never forget the faces of farmers in my home \nState as they showed me acre after acre of scorched row crops, or how \nshocking it was to see the horrible cracks and craters in what was once \nfertile soil.\n  This package, Mr. President, includes additional assistance to \nreplenish the fiscal year 1999 emergency loan account, which has been \ndepleted due to the severity of this crisis.\n  Hundreds have received help but, right now more than 300 farm \nfamilies in Louisiana are waiting for their emergency loan applications \nto come through. And although more assistance may still be needed, \nthose loan payments are crucial to help our farmers stay in business.\n  Mr. President, hurricane victims in Central America are also waiting \non this emergency package. In fact, they've been waiting for more than \n6 months.\n  The winds and rains of Hurricane Mitch claimed the lives of more than \n10,000 people, and left an estimated 1 million homeless. It completely \nwiped out hundreds of schoolhouses, bridges, roadways, and churches. \nBut after visiting Honduras and Nicaragua, I can assure you the numbers \nfail to convey the full extent of the devastation.\n  Besides the obvious humanitarian reasons, helping our Central \nAmerican neighbors recover serves the long-term interests not only of \nthe United States but the entire Western Hemisphere.\n  Within the past few decades, we have seen Central America move from \nconflict to peace, from authoritarian governments to democracies, from \nclosed to open economies. Now this progress is at risk.\n  In the past, the United States has played a strong role in \nencouraging economic development in Central America.\n  Nearly four decades ago, President Kennedy traveled to Costa Rica to \nannounce his ``Alliance for Progress'' to promote the expansion of \nagriculture exports throughout the region.\n  Since then we have pursued a variety of other measures designed to \nhelp these countries diversify their economies and boost exports.\n  While these policies have not always been successful, the United \nStates has always shown its willingness to help lift these economically \ndepressed nations to a more prosperous standard of living.\n  The point is--the United States has a long history of helping our \nCentral American friends move further down the path of development. \nNow--perhaps--that friendship is being tested by the devastation that \nhas decimated their towns and villages and the commerce that flows \nthrough them.\n  But, as we all know, friendships become stronger when they are \ntested. And I am glad that the United States is responding like good \nfriends should.\n  I am also particularly pleased that this supplemental package will be \nused in part to addresses the problem of permanent housing in Central \nAmerica.\n  During a historic meeting--hosted by Senators Lott and Coverdell--\nheld in the LBJ Room several months ago, four Central American \nPresidents made it clear that permanent housing is among the highest \npriorities for their recovery. The numbers say it best: Mitch destroyed \n700,000 homes, severely damaged 50,000 and left 35,000 people in \ntemporary housing--tents, schools, churches.\n  I will be working--along with other colleagues on both sides of the \naisle--to see that we do all we can in the area of housing in Central \nAmerica.\n  Helping Central America rebuild is of special concern in Louisiana. \nWith one of the largest Honduran communities outside Honduras, New \nOrleans is sometimes referred to as ``the third largest Honduran \ncity.''\n  Brought to our State through trade with the port, these enterprising \npeople have been a source of strength to our community for many years \nnow. So this package is of utmost importance to them and so many others \nback home.\n  Before yielding the floor, Mr. President, let me also express my \nsupport for the increase in military spending in this supplemental.\n  Over the last decade, we have seen a slow, steady decline in the \nrecruitment and retention of our military men and women. We have \nallowed the disparities between military and private sector to grow so \nlarge that our service men and women are being lured away.\n  For instance, B-52 pilots at Barksdale Airforce Base in Shreveport, \nLA, can go right down the street to the Shreveport International \nAirport and sign on with a commercial airline with better salaries, \npensions, and benefits.\n  It is imperative that we reverse this trend. Mr. President, my hope \nis that these military spending increases will mark a good step forward \nin helping us recruit and retain the best and the brightest.\n  In closing, let me say again how important this Emergency \nSupplemental Package is to farmers in Louisiana and other rural \ncommunities in America. And as we consider the interests of our Nation \nand this hemisphere--and the future of the fragile democracies in \nthem--on the edge of this new century, let us make sure we honor our \nties of friendship with the nations of Central America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia and my leader on the Appropriations Committee, and my friend, \nSenator Stevens from Alaska, who is not present on the floor; he is \nalso the chairman of this important committee.\n  You can measure the values of a nation by the way it spends its \nmoney. If you take a look at this bill, you will see that the values of \nAmerica are strong in many areas. We are prepared to spend $6 billion \nto make sure that the men and women in uniform in Kosovo have the very \nbest. Were it my son or daughter, I would demand nothing less. I am \nsure we all feel the same.\n  We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars for humanitarian \nrelief. Isn't it typically American that no matter what our sacrifice, \nwe are willing to help others, whether it is the refugees\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\nin Kosovo or those suffering from the hurricane in Central America.\n  Many other good things are in this bill. I was happy to be part of an \neffort to provide financial assistance to those who have been in the \npork production industry and have been hard hit during the last year. \nSenator Bond and I have worked for $145 million to try to help some of \nthese farmers to face the toughest times in their lives. Net farm \nincome in Illinois is down 78 percent. Farmland in Illinois is some of \nthe best in the country, yet farmers have seen this dramatic decline in \nincome. With all these good things in the bill, it would seem fairly \nobvious to vote for it without reservation. I wish I could. I plan on \nvoting for it, but with serious reservations. Let me tell you what they \nrelate to.\n  When this bill came from the White House, the President asked for $6 \nbillion for military and humanitarian assistance, and then the House \nadded $5 billion in military spending which the President didn't ask \nfor. Among other things in this bill is $500 million for military \nconstruction around the world that is not authorized, not requested. It \nis put in here.\n  When I went to the conference with Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, \nthe Senate side of the aisle said we are going to propose an amendment \nthat I offered--$265 million for American schools. You have heard of \nall the things I have mentioned. There is not a penny in this bill for \nAmerican schools--nothing. Are schools on our minds? You bet they are. \nCities like Conyers, GA; Littleton, CO; Jonesboro, AR; West Paducah, \nKY; Pearl, MS; Springfield, OR. The sad roster of schools in America \nthat have been hit by school violence continues to grow.\n  I produced an amendment for $265 million for two things--not radical \nnew suggestions but tried and true things such as school counselors so \nthat kids who are troubled and have a problem have somebody to turn to, \nand afterschool programs so that kids are supervised in a positive, \nsafe learning environment. The House conferees rejected that. Not a \npenny for schools, not $265 million. Not a penny for schools, but $5 \nbillion more in military spending than this President requested.\n  Where are our values? Where are our priorities? If our priorities are \nnot in the schoolrooms and classrooms of America, if they are not with \nour children, where are our values?\n  I salute what is in this bill. Much is good. But it pains me greatly \nto stand on the floor of the Senate and say that in a conference \ncommittee only a few days ago the idea of sending money to America's \nschools for America's schoolchildren was soundly rejected by the House \nconferees. That makes no sense whatsoever.\n  We will talk in the juvenile justice bill about how to reduce crime \nin America, how to reduce violence, and we should. We will talk about \ngun control, and I support it. But there is more to it. We have to be \nable to reach out to those kids who show up at school every day with a \nworld of hurt, a world of problems, kids who probably see school as the \nonly shelter, the only nurturing environment, in their lives. These \nkids need a helping hand, and with this helping hand they can be better \nstudents and better Americans.\n  We missed an opportunity in this bill by denying one penny for those \nschools. We missed that opportunity. I am sorry to say that this bill \ndoes not include it. But I promise you this. As long as I serve in the \nSenate, I will join with those in the Senate and, I hope, others in the \nHouse, who come to the realization that there is no greater priority \nthan our children.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia and the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. Like \nour other colleagues, I commend him and the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for their hard work on this particular proposal we will be \nvoting on today.\n  I regret that I am not able to support this particular bill because \nthere is so much in it that I do support. I clearly recognize the \ncritical need for additional spending for our military. Indeed, we are \nnot spending enough on our military today, even with the emergency \nspending that is legitimately included in this bill for the crisis in \nKosovo. We are going to have to spend even more if we are going to meet \nour commitments around the world and provide the national security that \nwe're expected to provide--and indeed that we profess to be able to \nprovide. We are not spending enough money on ships, or planes, or \nammunition, or on quality of life improvements for members of our Armed \nServices. We are going to have to address those needs, even beyond what \nis provided in this bill.\n  I am embarrassed by the fact that we're just now getting around to \nfunding the emergencies that occurred as a result of Hurricane Mitch, \nand the needs of our farmers are acute and critical. There is simply no \nexcuse for the delay in providing the emergency funding in these areas. \nThe concern I have is with the process. We cannot continue to do \nbusiness this way. If we determine that this is an emergency spending \nmeasure, we ought to make sure that what we are funding are true \nemergencies and take care of our other priorities through the normal \nauthorization and appropriations process.\n  We have the promise of a surplus. We ought not to abandon the fiscal \nresponsibility that brought us that promise and has given us the chance \nto make real progress on debt reduction. We should not use the fact \nthat we have our men and women in harm's way overseas as an excuse to \ngo on a spending binge here at home. Many of the projects in this bill \nhave merit. If it is an emergency, it ought to be in this bill. And we \nought to take out the nonemergency spending, pass a clean bill, and get \nthe emergency spending where it is needed, especially to our military.\n  In short, Mr. President, providing substantial emergency funding for \nour troops in Kosovo is the right thing to do. Providing long-overdue \nemergency funding for the victims of Hurricane Mitch is the right thing \nto do. And providing desperately needed emergency funding for our \nnation's farmers is the right thing to do. But combining these \nlegitimate emergency requests with billions of dollars of nonemergency \nspending--no matter how meritorious the individual project--is the \nwrong way to do it.\n  With that, I yield back any time I may have. With great regret, I \nannounce that I am unable to support the bill, although I fully support \nmany of the priorities the bill includes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 7\\1/2\\ minutes to Mr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that Colton \nCampbell be afforded floor privileges during the duration of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will reluctantly support this \nlegislation because it contains important issues. It contains the \nfunding for our troops in the Balkans. It contains the funds to meet \nour humanitarian responsibilities to our neighbors in Central America \nand the Caribbean. It also retains a provision--which I know the \nPresiding Officer has strongly supported--to clearly state that the \nfunds the States secured through their tobacco settlements will be \nfunds to be managed, administered, and prioritized at the State level.\n  Mr. President, I share many of the concerns of my colleague from \nVirginia. I share those concerns because what we are doing is to chip \naway at the financial security of 38 million Americans--38 million \nAmericans who receive Social Security income. Forty percent of those 38 \nmillion Americans would have fallen below the poverty line but for \nSocial Security.\n  Why is this relevant to this debate? It is relevant because we are on \nthe verge of draining an additional $12 billion from the Social \nSecurity fund through this legislation. We had three choices when we \nstarted this debate. One choice was to do the tough thing, to \nreprioritize our spending, to say that if it is important that we spend \nmoney on our humanitarian needs in\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean, then let us reduce spending \nsomewhere else.\n  I am pleased to say that for that account we in fact have done so.\n  We had another choice, which was to say let's raise revenue. If we \ncan't find an area where we think it is appropriate to reduce spending, \nthen let's be prepared to pay for this emergency.\n  Third, we could say let's use the accumulated surplus that we have, \nwhich today is a 100-percent surplus generated by the Social Security \ntrust fund. As to the $12 billion in this legislation, we have elected \nthe third course of action.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time we have done so. In fact, \nit is not the first time in the last 8 months that we have done so.\n  Last October, in the waning hours of the budget negotiations, \nCongress passed a $532 billion omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Tucked into that bill was $21.4 billion in so-called emergency \nspending.\n  The effect of that designation then--as it is today--was to relieve \nCongress of the necessity of finding some other reprioritized spending \nto eliminate in order to pay for this emergency.\n  But because of the emergency designation, the $21.4 billion in \nOctober could be approved without offsets, and because of the emergency \ndesignation today, we will approve an additional $12 billion of \nexpenditure without offsets.\n  Let's look at the numbers.\n  In 1998, Social Security was $99 billion. The first use of that money \nwas to offset $27 billion in deficit in the rest of the Federal budget. \nAn additional $3 billion was used to pay for emergency outlays, leaving \nus with a total surplus not of $99 billion but of $69 billion.\n\n  This year, 1999, we are projecting a $127 billion surplus.\n  Again, we have used $3 billion to offset deficits elsewhere in the \nbudget, $13 billion for emergency outlays, and we are about to spend \nanother $14.6 billion for emergencies, reducing our surplus from $127 \nbillion down to $96 billion. And for the year 2000, we have already \ncarried forward some of the emergency spending from 1999.\n  Again, we will be reducing the Social Security surplus by $10 \nbillion. This is from where we are paying for these emergencies.\n  Mr. President, the repetitive misuse of the emergency process is \ncontinuing to erode the Social Security trust fund. This misuse is done \nin a manner that precludes most Members of Congress from any meaningful \nrole in what has traditionally been accepted as emergencies. We have \nbeen denied the opportunity to participate in a determination as to \nwhether the proposed emergency expenditure met the standards of being \nsudden, urgent and unforeseen needs, which is the standard that has \ntraditionally been used for emergencies.\n  The same Congress that claimed to be saving the surplus for Social \nSecurity--committed to a ``lockbox'' for Social Security--is again \nactively participating in raids on the Social Security trust fund \nthrough the back door.\n  Willie Sutton once was asked, ``Why do you rob banks?'' His answer: \n``That's where the money is.''\n  We may manufacture the strongest vault to protect the Social Security \nsurplus from Willie Sutton. But if we let Jesse James continue to steal \nthe money on the train before it gets to the bank, we will have the \nsame result. The money will not be there for our and future generations \nof Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Social Security is a federally mandated program. We have a legal \nobligation to our children and grandchildren to secure the surplus for \nits intended purpose--Social Security. We must assure that the budget \nsurplus is not squandered on questionable emergency items in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, with your support and that of Senator Snowe of Maine, \nwe have introduced legislation which has as its objective to establish \npermanent safeguards that will assure that nonemergency items are \nsubject to careful scrutiny and not inserted into emergency spending \nbills to circumvent the normal legislative process.\n  I urge our colleagues' support for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, as we adjust to the welcome reality of budget \nsurpluses--after decades of annual deficits and burgeoning additions to \nthe national debt--we must never forget how easily this valuable asset \ncan be squandered.\n  For too long, the Federal Government treated the budget like a credit \ncard with an unlimited spending limit.\n  Private citizens are warned against falsely dialing 911. Congress \nshould exercise the same restraint in using its emergency authority.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \nadditional 10 minutes be authorized for debate on this measure, and \nthat 8 of those minutes be under the control of the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, and 2 minutes be under the control of this Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just say that being for or against \nthis bill is basically a tossup, as far as I am concerned. It is one of \nthose 51-49 types of propositions. So that is how I am going to come \ndown on the 51-percent side, and vote for the conference report.\n  First of all, this is not a time to indicate anything less than full \nsupport for our troops in Kosovo and the surrounding areas.\n  There is also in this conference report some much-needed farm \nassistance and disaster assistance for the United States and Central \nAmerica. However, I must say there are parts of the bill to which I \nregister my stiff opposition.\n  First, this bill forfeits the opportunity to ensure that tobacco \nsettlement money is used to fight smoking and to promote health--that \nis not in here. In fact, just the opposite.\n  Second, the bill provides only a fraction of critically and urgently \nneeded farm assistance. Let me just talk for a moment about that \nsubject.\n  This is an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. We take care \nof emergencies in Central America and other places. But one of the very \nbiggest emergencies facing us today is the emergency in American \nagriculture. Export prospects are dismal. Exports for this year are \nprojected to fall to $49 billion, which is a 19-percent decline from \n1996. Asia still hasn't recovered. Net farm income for major \ncommodities could drop to $17 billion compared to an average of $23 \nbillion a year for the previous 5 years. Net farm income for major \nfield crops will be 27 percent below what it was for the last 5 years.\n  It is true that there is some farm assistance in this package, and I \nwas pleased to work with my colleagues to get it in the bill. But it is \nnot enough, and it is too late.\n  The White House sent up the supplemental appropriations request for \nadditional farm loan funds and Farm Service Agency funding on February \n26. Now here we are just getting to it, nearly three months later.\n  This money was critically and urgently needed for the planting \nseason. Now we are just getting around to it, even though the planting \nseason is well over halfway past. The farm assistance that we have in \nthe bill is good. Sure, an aspirin is good, if you have a major illness \nand you have some pain. But it doesn't get to the real root cause of \nit, and neither does the assistance in this bill. It falls far short of \nwhat is needed.\n  I offered an amendment in the conference committee to address the \ndeepening crisis in the farm economy. The amendment addressed a range \nof farm income problems in the crop, livestock and dairy sectors, and \nit dealt with agriculture's economic crisis around our nation, not just \nin one or two regions. Regrettably, that amendment failed on a 14-14 \ntie vote of Senate conferees.\n  The amendment lacked just one vote. So we will be back again on \nwhatever measures we can get up on the floor this year to provide \ncritically and urgently needed economic assistance to our farm families \nand our rural communities.\n  All I can say is that when it came to the issue of Kosovo, we were \nwilling to meet our obligations and respond to the emergency. In fact, \nthe conferees had no trouble coming up with $5 billion more than what \nwas asked for in\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nmilitary spending. But we couldn't come up with the money needed to \nhelp our beleaguered farmers and the rural economy.\n  Finally, I also want to say a word about offsets for this bill. For \nthe small portion of the bill that is offset, there was a beeline to go \nafter programs that are vital to the most vulnerable in our society: \nfood stamps and housing. Hunger and poverty remain persistent and \npervasive problems in our society. Now we know these rescissions are \nnot genuine offsets, since there are not outlay reductions associated \nwith them. So perhaps there is no harm, but clearly these offsets \nshould not lay the groundwork or create a precedent for future \nrescissions that actually reduce program benefits.\n  Again, on the whole, I will vote for the conference report.\n  I just want to register my objections to two major portions of the \nconference report, farm assistance and tobacco, which I consider to be \ntotally inadequate.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n               needed support for the pan am 103 families\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a significant provision in the 1999 \nKosovo supplemental appropriations bill will enable the Justice \nDepartment to pay for the travel expenses of the Pan Am 103 families \nwho wish to attend the upcoming Lockerbie bombing trial in The \nNetherlands this summer. Existing law prevents the Department from \nusing federal funds to pay for this travel.\n  Under this provision, the Justice Department's Office of Victims of \nCrime will be able to use an existing reserve fund to pay for the \ntransportation costs, lodging, and food at government per diem rates \nfor immediate family members of the Pan Am 103 victims. The Department \nalso plans to establish an 800 number and a web site to keep family \nmembers informed during the trial. In addition, the Department plans to \nestablish a compassion center, staffed with counselors, at the base in \nThe Netherlands where the trial will be held, in order to help the \nfamilies cope with the emotional strains of the trial.\n  The families of the victims of this terrorist atrocity have been \nwaiting for more than ten years for justice. They have suffered the \ndeep pain of losing their loved ones, and that pain has been compounded \nby the Libyan Government's refusal for many years to surrender the \nsuspects accused of the bombing. Now the suspects are finally in \ncustody and the trial will begin soon. We can never erase the pain of \nthe loss that the families have suffered, but we can enable them to \nattend the trial and see that justice is finally done. I commend the \nHouse and Senate conferees for including this important provision to \nhelp these long-suffering families.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, in the past, American presidents have \nargued that a congressional appropriation for U.S. military action \nabroad constitutes a congressional authorization for the military \naction. I will not vote for an authorization of money that may be \nconstrued as authorizing, or encouraging the expansion of, the \nPresident's military operations in Kosovo. I will oppose the \nappropriation of almost $11 billion for a war I have consistently \nspoken out against.\n  On March 23, I voted against President Clinton's decision to launch \nthe air campaign in Yugoslovia. On May 4, I voted against a resolution \nthat would have given the President blanket authority to expand the \noperation. To date, I have not been convinced that this war is \nnecessary to protect a vital national security interest, and I have \nopposed efforts to escalate the conflict.\n  I have a number of secondary considerations with respect to this \nlegislation. I am concerned, for one, about plundering the Social \nSecurity trust funds to pay for a war that involves no vital national \nsecurity interest. If I believed that vital national security interests \nwere at stake, I would consider the argument to fund the war from the \nSocial Security trust fund surplus. But in the absence of a vital \nnational security interest, I do not believe the Congress should pay \nfor the war out of the Social Security trust funds.\n  I am also concerned about some of the anti-environmental riders added \nto the emergency supplemental bill in conference. These provisions \nshould have been fully debated, and should have gone through the normal \nlegislative process, instead of being slipped into the bill in the dead \nof night.\n  I am disappointed that I can't support this bill, because it contains \nfunding for farmers hit by low commodity prices. Some of this is \nfunding that I've argued for and, in fact, voted for in earlier \ninstances, including S. 544. But my opposition to funding the military \naction in Kosovo is firm. I can endorse neither the authorization for \nthe war, nor the appropriations process that is its genesis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the Conference Report of H.R. 1141--\nthe Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill before us today. I do so \nreluctantly, however, because of the many special interest riders that \nhave been attached to this emergency legislation. In the final analysis \nI will support the conference report because it provides critically \nimportant funds to assist American farmers, to support ongoing action \nagainst Yugoslavia, to relieve the suffering of Kosovar refugees, and \nto help Central America recover from the devastating effects of \nHurricane Mitch.\n  In light of all the other measures that have been added to this bill, \nmany of dubious merit, I deeply regret, Mr. President, that the Speaker \nof the House refused to allow House conferees to accept a Senate \namendment that would have freed up monies for payment of the United \nStates debt to the United Nations. I find it somewhat puzzling that \nHouse Republicans are on record calling for a negotiated settlement of \nthe Kosovo conflict, yet are not prepared to provide overdue payments \nto the organization that will likely play a central role in \nimplementing any peace agreement. I would like to dwell on two major \nprovisions of this bill which I support, namely the aid to help Central \nAmerica recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch and the funds \nto sustain our ongoing efforts in the Balkans.\n  The funds aimed at helping Central America recover from Hurricane \nMitch stem from an emergency request the President made back in \nFebruary. It is extremely embarrassing that it has taken until May for \nthe Congress to finally get around to passing the necessary legislation \nto provide relief for a natural disaster that occurred last fall.\n  I cannot overstate the degree to which the storm ravaged Nicaragua, \nHonduras and other nearby nations. In less than a week, Hurricane Mitch \nclaimed at least 10,000 lives--possibly as many as 20,000, left more \nthan a million others without adequate food or shelter, and set the \neconomies of Nicaragua and Honduras back as much as a generation. The \nneed for long-term international assistance is great.\n  In late October and early November 1998, Mitch carved a slow, \nmeandering and deadly path through the Caribbean. At the hurricane's \napex, Mitch's storm clouds stretched from Florida to Panama and wind \ngusts topped 200 miles per hour. Meteorologists labeled Mitch a \n``Category 5 Hurricane,'' the highest such designation.\n  Unlike other hurricanes, Mr. President, it was not Mitch's winds \nwhich proved so deadly. By the time the storm crossed the Honduran \nCoast on October 29, 1998, its winds had slowed to 60 miles per hour \nand the storm's movement to a mere crawl. The torrential rain, however, \ndid not abate. The storm's slow speed allowed it to continually pound \nthe same area day after day. By the time the skies cleared, Mitch had \ndropped five feet of rain onto Honduras and Nicaragua.\n  The massive flooding which followed claimed the lives of at least \n10,000 Central Americans. That number, Mr. President, is certainly \nshocking. Yet, sadly, it is probably an understatement of the actual \nloss of life. As many as twelve thousand other people in the region are \nstill missing and presumed dead. The Honduran government has declared \n5,657 dead and 8,052 officially missing. In Nicaragua, at least 3,800 \ndied. Smaller numbers perished in El Salvador, Guatemala and other \ncountries in the region.\n\n  Mr. President, not since the Great Hurricane of 1780, nearly 220 \nyears ago, has a storm claimed so many lives in the eastern Caribbean.\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\n  Mitch also destroyed or damaged 338 bridges, 170 in Honduras alone, \nleaving much of Honduras and Nicaragua accessible only by helicopter. \nThe lack of helicopters in the region and their limited capacity left \nthousands without adequate food and water for weeks while some of the \nfood provided by international aid organizations rotted at the airport.\n  Those who survived face the task of piecing the economy and mangled \ninfrastructure back together. Meanwhile, more than a million people \nthroughout the region, including one out of every five Hondurans, had \nto rebuild their homes and replace their personal possessions.\n  Honduran and Nicaraguan agriculture--a vital component of both \neconomies--was decimated. Hurricane Mitch destroyed a quarter of \nHonduras's coffee plantations and 90 percent of the country's banana \nplants. The entire shrimp farming industry was destroyed. Damage to \nsugar and citrus crops was similarly heavy. The factories and farms of \nHonduras's Sula Valley, which normally contribute 60 percent of the \ncountry's GDP, were all flooded. While Nicaragua was not as badly \ndamaged, the effects are still staggering: 20 percent of the nation's \ncoffee plantations were destroyed. Newer crops such as citrus were \ncompletely annihilated.\n  The process of rebuilding the shattered lives, infrastructure and \neconomies of Honduras and Nicaragua will be long and expensive. The \nWorld Bank and the United Nations Development Program estimate the \ntotal damage to the region at more than $5.3 billion. While these \nnumbers are difficult to comprehend, they are even more daunting given \nthat the GDP of Nicaragua is only $9.3 billion and that of Honduras \nonly $12.7 billion.\n  I commend my colleagues for finding the resources to assist our \nneighbors to the south who have called upon the international community \nin their hour of need. It is not only in their interest, it is in our \ninterest to assist them. It deserves our strong backing.\n  The original intent of the President's request for emergency \nappropriations from the Congress was to provide our men and women in \nuniform with the equipment and materiel they need to effectively strike \nthe Yugoslav military. While I am heartened by recent reports of a \npossible diplomatic solution, we must remain prepared to continue our \nmilitary efforts in the absence of an enforceable diplomatic solution \nwhich meets NATO's conditions.\n  Mr. President, we must never take the decision to send our service \nmen and women into harm's way lightly. If a situation which is such an \nanathema to the United States that it calls for military action \npresents itself to us, however, we must vigorously support our \nsoldiers, sailors and airmen through both word and deed.\n\n  As I just mentioned, the decision to send our military into battle is \none of the most solemn that this body or this nation ever faces. And \nso, before I go on, let me reiterate why the situation in Kosovo \njustifies, in fact demands, American military involvement.\n  Slobodan Milosevic has carved a place for himself amongst history's \nmost despicable tyrants. Serb forces have murdered least 5,000 ethnic-\nAlbanian civilians and burned six hundred villages. To date, \napproximately 80 percent of Kosovar Albanians--more than 1.3 million \ninnocent men, women and children--have fled their homes in a desperate \nattempt to outrun Serb military and police forces. Nearly 750,000 \nKosovar Albanians have made it to the relative safety of neighboring \ncountries and are now living under the most difficult of conditions.\n  These numbers, however horrific, tell only part of the story. They \ncannot express the pain of a family torn apart by blood-thirsty \nparamilitary policemen or the pain of a young woman gang-raped by Serb \nsoldiers. They do not express the tears of a young child who spends \neach day wandering between the tents of a Macedonian refugee camp \nsearching for his or her missing parents. They do not describe the \npain, both physical and psychological, the victims of torture feel each \nday.\n  Many members of Congress, myself included, have traveled to the \nregion and visited the refugee camps. We have seen the pain in the eyes \nof the refugees fortunate enough to have made it out of the killing \nfields of Kosovo. Mr. President, the look in the eyes of these refugees \ndefies description.\n  The ongoing genocide in Kosovo is antithetical to the most basic \nprinciples on which the United States stands. By acting to preserve the \nfundamental rights of Kosovar Albanians, the United States is \nreaffirming our belief that all people are endowed with certain \ninalienable rights, including the rights to life, liberty and the \npursuit of happiness. If, however, the United States chose to stand \nidly by in the face of such grotesque evil, we would draw into question \nour dedication to human rights and our resolve to oppose dictators \naround the globe.\n  Our military, however, cannot effectively combat this evil if we in \nthe Congress fail to offer them our support. One month ago, President \nClinton sent a request to Congress for $6 billion in order to fund our \nmilitary operations through the end of the fiscal year. That money is \nincluded in this bill.\n  As we debate this issue, people far beyond the walls of this chamber \nare listening to our words and watching our actions. Our men and women \nin uniform throughout the region who are putting their lives on the \nline each day want to know whether we in the Congress will seize this \nopportunity to support them. They need and they deserve the very finest \nequipment our nation can muster--the type of equipment the President's \noriginal request will pay for.\n  In capitals across Europe, our allies are listening and looking to \nthe United States for leadership. They want to know whether the United \nStates will maintain its commitment to NATO and to this important \noperation.\n  In refugee camps in Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and elsewhere, \nhundreds of thousands of Milosevic's innocent victims are listening; \nhoping that we will reaffirm our commitment to them.\n  In the hills and forests of Kosovo, men, women and children who are \nhiding from soldiers and policemen are listening to American radio \nbroadcasts on portable radios. They are looking to the United States \nfor hope and support in their most desperate hour.\n  And finally, tyrants around the world, but especially in Belgrade, \nare judging our dedication to human rights and freedom.\n  Mr. President, we must send the same message to all: The United \nStates will not back down in the face of unspeakable evil.\n  Just a moment ago, I mentioned that the President requested $6 \nbillion for the ongoing operation in the Balkans. In just one month, \nhowever, that $6 billion bill has ballooned into a $14.9 billion \nmonstrosity. The President's original request now represents well under \nhalf of the total bill.\n  Regretfully, the majority of the new spending is for non-emergency \nprograms which fall far outside the original intention of the \nlegislation. Such programs should rightfully be left to the regular \nappropriations process. The issues this bill was intended to address \nare simply too important to be embroiled in political spending. Thus, \nwhile I continue to support strongly the President's original request, \nI support the legislation before us with reluctance due to the \nexpensive, non-emergency riders that were added during the House/Senate \nconference on this measure.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of this bill relating to Kosovo and \nCentral America deserve our immediate attention and support. The \nvictims of mother nature's fury in our own hemisphere and of Slobodan \nMilosevic's genocide in Europe, as well as the brave American men and \nwomen fighting under the American flag, need and deserve America's \nsupport. For that reason I intend to vote to support passage of this \nconference report despite its imperfections.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Helms, has a very distinguished guest whom he wishes to \npresent. I therefore yield for that purpose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no time be charged to the remaining \nspeakers because of that fact, and I ask unanimous consent following \nthe introduction by Senator Helms, there be a recess of 3 minutes so \nSenators may personally greet the distinguished guest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\n            VISIT TO THE SENATE BY KING ABDALLAH BIN HUSSEIN\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, as always, is gracious, and I thank him very much. As he \nindicated, we have today a distinguished son of a distinguished father \nwho has visited many times. His Majesty, King Abdallah bin Hussein of \nJordan.\n  He has been visiting with the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and I \npresent him to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5667-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5667-S5682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate stand in \nrecess for 3 minutes.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:37 p.m., recessed until \n3:42 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the very able and \neloquent distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise for the first time since I have \nbeen in the Senate to oppose a supplemental appropriation. It hurts my \nheart because there is so much in this bill that is good. But I have to \nsay there is a lot in this bill that does not belong in it, and there \nare some things left out of this bill, one or two things, that I \nthought were real emergencies that should have been in there.\n  What started out as requests to fund unexpected emergencies has \nturned into a flurry of spending and riders that simply do not belong \nin this bill. The one area that I particularly cared about, violence in \nour schools--which is an emergency by anybody's measure when parents \nare telling us, 75 percent of them, they are concerned about their \nchildren when they go off to school--a very modest proposal by the \nSenator from Illinois was turned down by the House members of the \nconference after it was approved by the Senate members of the \nconference. So all kinds of dollars were found for many things, but \nthey could not find it in their hearts to do something about violence \nin the schools by providing some counselors, some afterschool money so \ndesperately needed in our country today.\n  I am happy for the Senator from West Virginia, that he was able to \nget a commitment for a crisis he is facing in the steel industry in his \nState. I agreed with him, that particular piece of legislation and \nthose funds should have been placed into this bill, and they were not. \nSo I found this a very strange conference. I miss the Appropriations \nCommittee. I was on it for two beautiful years. So I sat and watched at \n1 in the morning as Senators and House Members debated. You may wonder, \nwhy would the Senator from California do that? Very simple: It is a \nvery important bill that is before us.\n  I believe in what NATO is trying to accomplish. I agreed with the \nPresident that we needed to find about $6 billion for the military. It \nturns out it is almost double that, that winds up in this bill. The pay \nraise is taken care of. I wanted to do an even higher pay raise, but \nthat pay raise--it is not an emergency, it is an obligation. We have to \nback the pay raise in the regular appropriations bills. This is just \nanother way to push dollars around.\n  I do not think it is fair to say that is an emergency. I supported \nthe funds in there for America's farmers, for Hurricane Mitch; those \nthings were fine. But some of the riders in this bill really were \nwrong, not only wrong in substance but wrong to put in this bill. For \nexample, the rider that deals with the tobacco funds from the tobacco \nlawsuit. It is not that I object that the Federal Government will not \nget a share of that--because I am willing to say it is fine, the \nGovernors are the ones who put their names out there and they should \nget these funds. But to say to the Governors who are getting our part \nof the reimbursement: By the way, spend it any way you like--we are \ngoing to see Governors use that money to put a swimming pool in the \nGovernor's mansion; we are going to see Governors use that to build a \nlittle street in the neighborhood where maybe some of their donors \nlive.\n  I do not come from the school of thought that Governors are better \nthan Senators. I think we run on a platform and most of us, most of us \nfrom both parties, believe we need to take care of the health care \nneeds of our people. Comes along this bill, comes along a rider that \nsays: Governors, you can spend that any way you want. Build a running \ntrack for your friends around the Governor's mansion? Fine, no problem, \nno strings. I have a problem with that. We should make sure our \nGovernors are taking care of the health needs of their citizens since \npart of that money rightly comes from a recovery that included Federal \nprograms--Medicaid, as an example.\n\n  Then there are three riders that deal with the environment in one way \nor the other. One has to do with oil royalties. This is about the third \ntime that antienvironmental rider has been placed in this bill, because \ncolleagues know they cannot get the votes here. It is stopping the \nInterior Department from collecting the rent payments or the royalty \npayments from oil companies who drill on Federal land, taxpayers' land. \nThat money is being stolen from us. How do I know that? Because there \nhave been lawsuits. And every time the Federal Government wins those \nlawsuits--I ask for 1 additional minute, if I might.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining under my \ncontrol?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So here we have a situation where the Interior Department \ncould use the money to help with our parks and open space, and the oil \ncompanies get another special rider on this bill. It is the third time \nthat has happened. Mr. President, I do not think that is the way to \nlegislate.\n  Then we have an environmental rider placed in the bill by Senator \nGorton who now, I understand, is not even going to vote for this bill \nwhich has his rider in it that does tremendous damage to the State of \nWashington by permitting a mine up there.\n  There are so many things in this bill that do not belong in it. So it \nis with a heavy heart I say to my friends, for whom I have great \nrespect, I cannot vote for this. I do not think everything in there is \ntruly an emergency. Yet I think those things that were emergencies were \nleft out.\n  I look forward to working with my friends in the regular order so we \ncan debate some of these important measures outside this so-called \nemergency designation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I will vote against the pending \nconference report because I believe it, and the policy and process \nbehind it, represent a shameful failure on behalf of our American \nservicemen and women now in harm's way in the Balkans.\n  This legislation before the Senate today displays exactly what's \nwrong with Washington, including the United States Senate. There is \nmuch in the pending conference report on Supplemental Appropriations \nwhich is urgently needed and which I support. American farmers need and \ndeserve the disaster assistance included in this legislation. The \nKosovar refugees need and deserve massive resettlement and \nreconstruction assistance, of which the pending measure provides at \nleast a down payment. Our servicemen and women need and deserve the pay \nraise it provides and above all, those who are on the front lines in \nthe Balkans and elsewhere in the world need supplies and equipment.\n  However, in spite of these positive features, I will be voting ``no'' \nbecause of the bill's funding for an expanded, open-ended war against \nYugoslavia, which in my opinion, has not been adequately and \nappropriately considered by the Congress, and also because this \nimportant legislation has been used for petty provincial interests. In \neffect, our servicemen and women are being held hostage while the bill \nhas been loaded up with narrow amendments to assist special interests, \nsuch as a gold mine in Washington state, a dormitory for Congressional \npages, and reindeer ranchers.\n  While I have certainly observed this same game of special interest \ninfluence on the legislative process all too often since I have been in \nthe Senate, this current case is particularly egregious\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\nbecause of the boldness of the special interests and the apparent \nwillingness of too many of our national leaders to allow those \ninterests to be placed above consideration of the interests of our \ntroops in the field.\n  Our troops deserve better from all of us.\n  I have spoken before my reservations about NATO's current policy in \nthe Balkans and Congress' abdication of our Constitutional \nresponsibilities with respect to war powers. To say the least, neither \nof those reservations have been alleviated in this conference report.\n  Our leadership, including both the Clinton Administration and NATO, \nhave failed to clearly state what our mission is in the Balkans, what \nspecific goals we intend to achieve, and how we will end this mission.\n  As perhaps the leading military analyst of the Vietnam War, Colonel \nHarry Summers, wrote in his excellent book ``On Strategy: The Vietnam \nWar in Contest:''\n\n       The first principle of war is the principle of ``The \n     Objective.'' It is the first principle because all else flows \n     from it. . . . How to determine military objectives that will \n     achieve or assist in achieving the political objectives of \n     the United States is the primary task of the military \n     strategist, thus the relationship between military and \n     political objectives is critical. Prior to any future \n     commitment of U.S. military forces our military leaders must \n     insist that the civilian leadership provide tangible, \n     obtainable political goals. The political objective cannot \n     merely be a platitude but must be stated in concrete terms. \n     While such objectives may very well change during the course \n     of the war, it is essential that we begin with an \n     understanding of where we intend to go. As Clausewitz said, \n     we should not ``take the first step without considering the \n     last.'' In other words, we (and perhaps, more important, the \n     American people) need to have a definition of ``victory.''\n\n  Colonel Summers continues:\n\n       There is an inherent contradiction between the military and \n     its civilian leaders on this issue. For both domestic and \n     international political purposes the civilian leaders want \n     maximum flexibility and maneuverability and are hesitant to \n     fix on firm objectives. The military on the other hand need \n     just such a firm objective as early as possible in order to \n     plan and conduct military operations.\n\n  Mr. President, we've been here before, and speaking personally, I \nknow all too well the kind of price that is paid by our men and women \nin uniform when our political leaders fail to lay out clear and \nspecific objectives. More than thirty years ago, in Vietnam we also \nlacked clear and specific objectives. We attempted to use our military \nto impose our will in a region far from our shores and far from our \nvital national interests, and without ever fully engaging the Congress \nor the American people in the process. The result was a conflict where \nthe politicians failed to provide clear political objectives, but \nintruded in determining military strategy, and where our policy was \nnever fully understood or fully supported by the American people.\n  Too many Americans never came home from that war, and others came \nhome unalterably changed in mind or body. I cannot in good conscience \nsit here and watch it all appear to be happening again. I will not \nsupport putting American ground troops into Kosovo, and I cannot vote \nfor this conference report which, in my opinion, moves us further in \nthat direction.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nconference report before us. It uses funds for undeniably urgent \nneeds--our operations in Kosovo, our rescue of struggling family \nfarmers, our efforts to dig out from the hurricanes of last year and \nthe tornados of this month--to mask spending on unnecessary and \nunbudgeted urges. That is more than dishonest; it is disgraceful. It is \nlike agreeing to let your neighbors use your car to take their sick \nchild to the hospital--if they also agree to pick up and pay for your \ngroceries, your dry cleaning, a set of new tires for the car, and a \npizza.\n  It is no surprise that people are cynical about talk that comes out \nof Washington. By adopting this conference report, we prove our work \nmeans very little. We prove that the budget we endorsed just two months \nago was not a promise--it was posturing. We prove that we are more \ninterested in sound bites than sound accounting.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there are genuine emergencies that \nrequire us to spend beyond what we had anticipated for a given fiscal \nyear. I will vote to fund such emergencies immediately and work out the \nbudget details later. I also understand that there are supplemental \nspending requirements that can come up during the year. And I will also \nsupport passing supplemental appropriations bills and paying for them \nwithin the budget limits we have set for ourselves. What I find \nunconscionable is what we are doing here today: attempting to get \naround the draconian budget resolution we passed in March by stuffing \nas much supplemental spending as possible in this bill and then \ntreating it as an emergency.\n  Given my strong feelings on this, I would like to clarify my vote to \nwaive the Gramm point of order. Senator Gramm, rightly I believe, \nraised many of the same issues that concern me. His point of order, \nhowever, did a surgeon's job with a hatchet. His point of order would \nhave brought down spending that was truly emergency, and therefore was \nnot offset--spending for humanitarian aid for the Kosovar refugees, for \ninfusions of cash into the struggling farm credit system, for helping \nareas hit by natural disaster. The point or order would also have \nbrought down domestic spending that was not an emergency, but that the \nAppropriations Committee went to great pains to offset. There are over \n$2 billion in offsets in this bill, and the great majority come from \ncuts in nondefense programs.\n\n  So, while I understand Senator Gramm's desire to make this bill \nfiscally honest and responsible, I cannot support his methods. Instead, \nwe should defeat this bill and start again--passing only what the \nDepartment of Defense says they need to continue their operations in \nKosovo, only what is truly a domestic emergency, only what is non-\nemergency and offset.\n  I have voted in support of the use of air power in Kosovo, a decision \nI made solemnly, and I am willing to vote to support funding the \nmission. This conference report, however, contains money the Pentagon \nnever asked for and that will never have an impact on the situation in \nKosovo. Almost five billion dollars in non-emergency defense spending \nhas been attached to the President's request without even allowing the \nSenate an opportunity to vote or debate these additions. Calling some \nof these new military construction projects an ``emergency'' is \nshameful. Those projects cannot compare with the urgency in hurricane \nravaged Central America, the economic hardship faced by our family \nfarms, or the plight of refugees on the desolate hillsides of Albania.\n  Obviously a great deal of munitions, fuel, and material have been \nexpended in our mission over Yugoslavia. The need to fund these \noperations, however, should not be an excuse to fund other special-\ninterest projects that were never high enough priorities to be placed \nin the tight military budget. Suddenly these projects are so important \nthey are given emergency designation, when a few months ago they hardly \ndeserved mentioning, and were certainly not worth including in the \nbudget resolution Congress adopted in March.\n  It is wrong for those who want a much larger defense budget to hold \nhostage the emergency funds needed for the Kosovo operation, Central \nAmerica, and the devastated rural America--and it is wrong to go to the \nAmerican taxpayers to pay their ransom.\n  Thus, it is with some regret that I must vote against this conference \nreport. Regret, because there are a number of very good things in this \nbill,  including funding that I worked hard to ensure would be there to \nhelp respond to the desperate situation of our family farmer.\n\n  This bill provides $43 million for Farm Service Agency personnel and \n$110 million and for the farm credit program requested by the \nAdministration in response to the tremendous credit crunch facing our \nNation's farmers. The Farm Service Agency funds are needed to provide \nthe support staff so USDA can deliver disaster assistance promised to \nfarmers last fall. The additional $110 million for USDA's farm credit \nprogram will provide essential loan guarantees to farmers as they \nstruggle through historically low prices.\n  The conference report also includes $63 million for FY 1999 and FY \n2000 to\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nallow the USDA to provide technical assistance to landowners as they \nenroll in USDA's Natural Resource Conservation Service environmental \nprograms. Because of funding shortfalls, Wisconsin's NRCS has already \nstopped providing technical assistance. That means thousands of acres \nof land, ready to be returned to their pristine state through the joint \nefforts of farmers and the USDA, are lying fallow.\n  Finally, I want to highlight another provision I worked on in this \nconference report: food assistance to the Kosovar refugees. We have all \nseen the news accounts, the pictures, and have heard the terrible \nstories of tragedy that the people in the Balkans are facing daily. \nReports from that region include hunger as another major problem that \nis hitting hardest among the children, the elderly, and the most \nvulnerable. Humanitarian food assistance, or PL-480 funds, have been \ndiverted to Kosovo from other regions of the world where serious needs \nexist. Funding for Kosovo food assistance was not included in initial \nversions of this bill, but without it, people in Africa, Bangladesh, \nand other troubled regions will continue to suffer from hunger and \ndeprivation. It is never good policy or sense to rob Peter to pay Paul, \nbut it is disgraceful when Peter and Paul are innocent, starving \nchildren on opposite sides of the world.\n  However, even with all these good things, this conference report is \nthe harbinger of terrible things to come. By trying to slip so much \nnon-emergency spending into this bill, the conference committee has \nacknowledged that we cannot meet the genuine needs of our citizens \nwithin the budget that was laid out in March.\n  Mr. President, the American people deserve an honest budget, and they \ndeserve to know that we will meet their emergencies in a forthright \nmanner. I regret that we could not do that today. If we pass this \nconference report, we will further and deservedly lose the trust of \nthose who send us their hard earned tax dollars. I urge my colleagues \nto vote no.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will reluctantly vote for this \nsupplemental appropriations bill for three primary reasons: to provide \nour agricultural producers at least a portion of the support they need; \nto support our troops in Kosovo; and to assist the desperate Kosovar \nrefugees and Hurricane Mitch victims. I strongly oppose the mining \nrider added in the middle of the night to this emergency spending bill \nand am saddened this Congress will not require States to spend of the \ntobacco settlement funds on actually preventing teen smoking or \nprotecting public health.\n  I very enthusiastically support the $109 million in this bill for \ndirect and guaranteed loans to provide credit for American agricultural \nproducers. This and the other agriculture-related provisions in this \nbill are vitally important to our growers, providing more than $700 \nmillion for important agricultural programs. Every single dollar of \nthis aid is all the more critical because Congress failed to support a \nfunding level that would help producers weather these difficult \neconomic times. I support the Harkin-Dorgan amendment to add $5 billion \nto this agricultural aid package during the conference committee's \nconsideration of this bill. Unfortunately, the amendment was rejected. \nMeanwhile, our growers are left waiting for more meaningful assistance \nas they struggle under the so-called Freedom to Farm Act.\n  This bill also contains vital funding for our military forces in the \nBalkans. I strongly support the Administration's original request for \nmonies to support the Kosovo effort. I am fully prepared to meet our \nresponsibilities to our troops and personnel involved in this important \nNATO effort. It is unfortunate the House insisted on adding billions of \nadditional, unrequested funding for defense projects, many of which are \nunrelated to the NATO action in the Balkans. I also endorse our \ncommitment to assist the millions of refugees, who are victims of this \nunfortunate conflict.\n  I, too, am pleased this bill provide critical assistance to the \nvictims of Hurricane Mitch. This deadly and destructive hurricane \ndecimated several Central American countries, and has been particularly \ndifficult on families already surviving on subsistence levels. The U.S. \nshould have long ago signaled our commitment to lead the international \neffort to aid the victims of Hurricane Mitch.\n  These important issues aside, I strongly oppose the rider on mining \nincluded in this bill. I do not accept the argument put forth by \nseveral of my colleagues on the conference committee that the \nsupplemental appropriations bill was the proper place to address an \nadministrative interpretation of the 1872 Mining Law. Within this bill \nare two provisions that simply are not emergencies and do not belong. \nOne is the further blockage of the Department of Interior's \nimplementing regulations on hard-rock mining.\n  The other provision is particularly troubling to me for it affects a \nproposed mine in my State of Washington. Included in this bill is a \nprovision that blocks the Department of Interior from enforcing a \nrecent solicitor's opinion interpreting allowable mill site acerage. \nThat opinion reinterpreted the 1872 mining law and limited the amount \nof mining waste companies could dump on public lands. For many years, \nmy constituents and people across the nation have been calling for true \nreform of the 1872 mining law. This late-night change is not what they \nhave been asking us to do. The industry knows these provisions would \nnot win approval in the normal legislative process, so they sought \nriders on a military and disaster relief appropriations bill. These are \nissues that deserve to be debated in full and in public, not in a mere \n10 minutes, late at night among conferees without the necessary \nexpertise to determine whether this is the correct policy.\n\n  I want to add that I have spoken with officials at the White House \nwho have shared their concern about these mining provisions. I told \nthem we must not allow this action to be a precedent for how we \nauthorize new open pit mines on our public lands. We should debate \nreform of the 1872 mining law fully and in the bright spotlight of \npublic review. Protecting the public's interest in their federal lands \nmust be a top priority. They agree.\n  I am also extremely disappointed this bill will allow the states to \nallocate the federal share of the multi-state agreement (MSA) with the \ntobacco companies to any program or project they desire. I strongly \nbelieve we have missed an historic opportunity to reverse the \ndestruction caused by smoking. It is tragic to think that every day we \ndelay reducing underage smoking, 3,000 children will try this deadly \nhabit. Five million children today will face illness and premature \ndeath due to smoking. Yet we are allowing the states to spend the \nfederal share on any program they may chose.\n  I am proud that in Washington state, the state legislature and \nGovernor Locke chose to do the right thing and spend the settlement \nmoney working to eliminate the plague of tobacco. However, Washington \nstate is only one of three states using the MSA settlement funds to \nsupport public health efforts and smoking cessation.\n  There is some irony in this debate about the role of the federal \ngovernment in spending so-called settlement monies. The tobacco \ncompanies win immunity from future prosecution or liability from the \nstates of federal government and because of states' inaction, the \ncompanies will be guaranteed a whole new generation of smokers. By not \nstanding firm and using these monies to eliminate underage smoking and \nreduce adult rates, the cost of care for these individuals will be the \nburden of the federal government and federal taxpayers. As members of \nthe Senate, we will have to find the additional funding to pay for \nincreases in Medicare, FEHBP, CHAMPUS, and VA health care costs.\n  I am disappointed that we could not reach an acceptable compromise \nthat would have protected our children, allowed states' reasonable \nspending discretion, and shielded the federal budget. I am hopeful we \ncan continue to work at the federal level to enact tough, anti-tobacco \nrestrictions, including FDA regulation of tobacco and increased efforts \nby CDC to help the states reduce the burden of tobacco.\n  Let me address one more topic. This bill transfers the Disaster \nRecovery Initiative (DRI) program, commonly known as the unmet needs \nprogram, from HUD to FEMA. While I do not oppose this transfer, my \nconcerns about\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nit grew as Congress delayed its consideration of this supplemental \nbill. President Clinton declared two disasters in Washington state \nduring calendar year 1998, including a slow-moving, on-going landslide \nin the Aldercrest community in Kelso. For a variety of reasons, FEMA \npublic assistance dollars will not reach Aldercrest victims for some \ntime. That makes the unmet needs money--now administered by FEMA--all \nthe more critical. While I am frustrated with the delay in this \nprocess, I am pleased we are moving forward once again. This conference \nreport highlights the conferees interest in ensuring Aldercrest victims \nget this disaster assistance as quickly as is possible.\n  Mr. President, this is a very difficult vote for me. I chose not to \nsign the conference report, but I support the bill to help our ailing \nagricultural producers, support our troops, and provide assistance to \nrefugees and disaster victims.\n\n\n               effective human rights response to kosovo\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, an important provision in the Statement \nof the Managers on the 1999 Kosovo Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act recommends $13 million above the administration's \nrequest for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia. It also recommends $10 million more than the administration \nrequested for the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund.\n  The conferees on this legislation have recommended these additional \nresources to help support a more effective human rights response to the \nKosovo crisis. Many of us are deeply concerned over the escalation of \nhuman rights abuses in Kosovo since the breakdown of the Rambouillet \nnegotiations. The additional funding for the War Crimes Tribunal will \nenable it to expand its investigative efforts to see that justice is \ndone.\n  Justice Arbour has made a strong case that this funding is needed \nimmediately for forensic investigative teams, mass grave exhumations, \ninvestigations, Albanian translators, equipment, and other associated \ncosts. America is the strongest support of the War Crimes Tribunal, and \nit is essential for us to provide provide the additional resources the \ntribunal needs without delay to ensure that those responsible for the \ngross violations of international law in Kosovo are brought to justice.\n  I also strongly support the work of the State Department's Human \nRights and Democracy Fund. The HRDF's ability to respond quickly to \nemergencies has enabled the Department to begin documenting mass \nexecutions, rape, deportations, and torture. Unfortunately, its \nresources are stretched thin as a result of the large scale of these \natrocities.\n  the additional funds recommended by Congress for the HRDF will enable \nthe State Department to enhance its ability to obtain information \npromptly and methodically from fleeing refugee victims and witnesses \nand provide the information to the U.S. Government, the War Crimes \nTribunal, and the public to ensure that those responsible for these \natrocities will be held accountable.\n  The funds will also enable the State Department to provide documents \nto refugees whose passports, identity papers, and property titles were \nstripped from them when Serb forces compelled them to leave Kosovo. \nDoing so will help counter President Milosevic's cynical policy of \n``identity cleansing'' and facilitate the return of the refugees to \ntheir homes. The funds are also intended to enhance our government's \nefforts to ensure that victims receive proper counseling for the \nunconscionable trauma they have suffered.\n  I commend the conferees for making these additional resources \navailable to achieve an effective human rights response on Kosovo.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1996, I authored the Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act to provide assistance to victims of terrorism and mass \nviolence, wherever it occurred. This assistance is limited to victims \nwho are citizens or employees of the United States who are injured or \nkilled as a result of a terrorist act.\n  Unfortunately, that legislation is not doing the job as we intended. \nThere are still too many victims of terrorism who are not getting the \nhelp they need and deserve--the help that Congress meant to give them \nin 1996. Among those left out in the cold are the families of those \nkilled in the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, and \nthe victims of last year's embassy bombings in West Africa.\n  Section 3024 of the emergency appropriations bill will provide a \nlimited but immediate response by providing much-needed assistance to \nthe families of the Americans who were killed in the bombing of Pan Am \n103. I am proud to have worked to get this emergency provision included \nin the conference report.\n  Currently, in cases involving terrorist acts occurring outside the \nUnited States, the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) may only give \nsupplemental grants to the States, for compensation of state residents. \nThis formulation has not provided the intended help to victims of \nterrorism who reside overseas and do not have a clear State residence, \neven though they are U.S. citizens. It is of little assistance to the \nnon-citizen victims employed by our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, \nwho also deserve our support and assistance. And due to an overly \nrestrictive interpretation of the 1996 law by the Department of \nJustice, it has not provided help to the victims of the Lockerbie \nbombing and other victims of terrorist acts that occurred before the \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act went into effect.\n  The current law has led to slower implementation than I intended when \nemergency aid is desperately needed, and has not enabled OVC to provide \nemergency relief, crisis response or training and technical assistance \nfor victim service providers, as I intended.\n  Accordingly, this week I offered an amendment to the juvenile justice \nbill, S. 254--which was accepted in the mangers' amendment--which would \nimprove the law even further. It would ensure that OVC can provide \nefficient and effective assistance--and really make a difference--for \nAmericans whose lives are torn apart by acts of terrorism and mass \nviolence occurring outside the United States.\n  In the meantime, the trial in the Pan Am 103 case is getting under \nway, and the families of those victims need our help now. This is an \nurgent matter, and I am glad that we are addressing it in this \nemergency bill.\n\n\n                           Outstanding Claims\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. I have a few questions for my colleague from Alaska on \nSection 3021 of the bill which authorizes the Attorney General to \ntransfer funds available to the Department of Justice to pay \noutstanding claims of Japanese Americans under the Civil Liberties Act \nof 1988 and outstanding claims of Japanese Latin Americans under the \nsettlement agreement in the case of Carmen Mochizuki et al .v. United \nStates (Case No. 97-294C, United States Court of Federal Claims).\n  Am I correct that this provision would allow the Attorney General to \npay redress of $20,000 to Japanese Americans who were interned by the \nUnited States during World War II and who filed a timely claim for \nredress under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, \nthe United States has paid redress to more than 82,000 eligible \nindividuals over the 10 year life of the program. Eligible individuals \nunder this Act had to file a claim for redress by August 10, 1998. \nThere were a number of individuals, however, who did not complete the \ndocumentation necessary for the Department of Justice to determine, \nprior to the termination of the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund \nand the expiration of the redress program six months later, whether \nthey were eligible for redress under the Act. This provision would \nallow those individuals, if they filed timely claims, to provide any \nnecessary information to the Department of Justice, and allow the \nDepartment to complete its review of their files. If the Department \ndetermines that they are eligible, this provision allows the Attorney \nGeneral to pay the claimants restitution under the Act.\n  Mr. INOUYE. In the case of Carmen Mochizuki et al versus United \nStates, plaintiffs brought a class action against the United States \nseeking redress for Japanese Latin Americans who were interned by the \nUnited States during World War II. The United States settled this case. \nThe settlement provides that each eligible class\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nmember would receive a $5,000 restitution payment, to the extent there \nwere funds available in the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund. Even \nthough this Fund has now terminated, does this provision also allow the \nAttorney General to pay restitution to Japanese Latin American \nindividuals who are found eligible under the Mochizuki settlement \nagreement and who filed timely claims covered by the agreement?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Some of the class members in this \nlawsuit were paid $5,000 restitution before the funds in the Civil \nLiberties Education Fund were exhausted. However, there are a number of \nclass members who filed timely claims under the Mochizuki settlement \nwho were not provided with restitution because there were no funds \nremaining. In addition, some class members were not able to complete \nthe documentation necessary for the Department of Justice to determine, \nprior to the termination of the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund \nand the expiration of the redress program six months later, whether \nthey were eligible for redress under the settlement agreement. This \nprovision would allow those individuals, if they filed timely claims, \nto provide any necessary information to the Department of Justice, and \nallow the Department to complete its review of their files. If the \nDepartment determines that they are eligible, or has already done so, \nthis provision allows the Attorney General to pay them restitution \nunder the settlement agreement.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleague from Alaska for the clarification on \nthis provision in the bill.\n\n\n                     cleanup from spring tornadoes\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Cochran and Senator Kohl, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and Related Agencies, for their help regarding clean up \nneeds in my state following the devastating tornadoes that struck on \nJanuary 21, 1999. On that day, an estimated 38 tornadoes touched down \nin at least 16 counties in Arkansas, a one-day record for the number of \ntornadoes in a single state in one day. Eight deaths and scores of \ninjuries resulted. The storms damaged or destroyed two thousand homes, \nat least 126 businesses, and various utilities in eleven counties. As \nyou might imagine, a tremendous amount of debris is scattered \nthroughout the damage area.\n  When the Senate considered S. 544, the supplemental appropriations \nbill which is now before us as the conference report to H.R. 1141, an \namendment of mine was adopted that would direct the Natural Resources \nConservation Service (NRCS) to assist in the removal of debris left \nfrom those storms. It is extremely important that we provide assistance \nnecessary to remove this debris in order to help restore lands to a \nmore productive state, but even more importantly, to prevent more \nserious emergencies that will result if this debris is allowed to \nobstruct stream flows and cause flooding, erosion, and other economic \nand environmental problems. Could the Senators please explain how his \nconference report addresses this situation.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator for her comments and I understand her \nconcern about the need to provide debris removal assistance following \nthe violent storms in her state and other states. The amendment of the \nSenator, to which she refers, would have expanded the statutory \nauthority of NRCS to exercise debris removal activities on lands not \ncovered by current law. This would not only have included the lands of \nwhich the Senator speaks, but could be interpreted to cover a wide \narray of other lands. It is our understanding that statutory authority \ndoes exist for the debris removal activities about which the Senator \nspeaks, making bill language unnecessary. However, certain \nadministrative actions by the Department will be necessary before these \nactivities can be carried out.\n  From time to time, we are asked to provide emergency funds in \nresponse to natural disasters. Too often, there is a human cost to \nthese disasters that we have no power to compensate. In other \ninstances, the level of our assistance is appropriate and necessary for \nthe task. There are times, however, when the sums required could have \nbeen reduced had a little prevention been in place before the crisis \nstruck.\n  Obviously, the force of a tornado is such that mankind may never be \nable to control or overcome. The devastation we all have witnessed this \nSpring in several states including Arkansas, and more recently Oklahoma \nand Kansas, was of such a magnitude in economic and human costs that \ncalls for our assistance must not go unheard. Now, however, we are \nfaced with choices about actions that might, at this point, prevent \nfuture damage and future costs.\n  The debris of which the Senator describes is not only that which \ncurrently is obstructing stream flows or causing flooding or erosion, \nbut it also includes debris located in the immediate vicinity of those \nstreams and waterways. It takes little imagination to envision another, \nfar less intensive storm in the region that would cause that debris to \nbe removed directly into the steambed with substantial damage and cost \nas a result, costs for which we and the American taxpayers might very \nwell be asked to compensate in the near future. in this case, a little \nprevention today may save substantial sums tomorrow. That is why the \nSenator is precisely correct and why we must ensure these needs are \nmet.\n  The conference report now before the Senate does not include the bill \nlanguage the Senator offered earlier due to the fact that, as mentioned \nabove, the statutory authority for those activities of concern to her \nand to others currently exists. The Statement of Managers makes that \npoint. However, the purpose of her amendment is well taken in bringing \nto the attention of the Department that necessary administrative \nactions must be taken immediately to address the emergency situation \nthat remains. We do not here suggest that the Watershed and Flood \nPrevention Operations authorities be broadened to include ``any'' \nlands. Instead, it is important for us all to recognize that reasonable \nsteps by the Department should be taken to remove the debris in \nquestion before it becomes the cause of more substantial losses in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for raising this issue \nand I appreciate the comments of my other colleagues on this subject. I \nagree with the Senator from Wisconsin that the Department should \nexercise any preventive measures practicable as the best way to avoid \nmore costly restoration and rehabilitation in the future.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleagues for this explanation.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the 1999 Supplemental \nAppropriations legislation. Let me make a few brief remarks explaining \nwhy I will vote against it. I do so reluctantly because some of this \nfunding is necessary, such as the agriculture spending, and some is \noffset. I co-sponsored and strongly supported the Enzi amendment to \nfully offset spending in this bill. Since our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle blocked this effort to be fiscally responsible, \nthereby giving their support to this spending of Social Security \nsurplus funds, I cannot endorse this irresponsible spending.\n  The Concord Coalition, a bipartisan watchdog of fiscal policy, calls \nthis bill a ``SAYGO'' bill, and SAYGO stands for spend-as-you-go. \nAccording to the Concord Coalition, ``Congress is using the emergency \nspending loophole to create a new budgetary concept--spend as you go \n(SAYGO). I fully agree with the Concord Coalition. Sadly, the term \n``SAYGO'' has captured the essence of this legislation.\n  However, there is nothing new about this practice. Congress has \nrepeatedly used this old trick on the American taxpayers as a way to \nexpand government programs and escape budget disciplines.\n  Let me remind my colleagues about what happened last year.\n  As you recall, Mr. President, despite the rhetoric of President \nClinton and Congress to use every penny of the budget surplus to save \nSocial Security, last year, we spent nearly $30 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus for alleged ``emergency spending.'' This was more than \none third of the entire Social Security surplus for 1998. In last \nyear's omnibus spending legislation alone, Congress spent $22 billion, \nand nearly $9.3 billion in regular appropriations was shifted into \nfuture budgets, a new\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nsmoke-and-mirrors gimmick, since we are now hearing how impossible it \nwill be to live within budget caps for FY 2000. No wonder!\n  In addition, few of these ``emergency spending'' items were true \nemergencies. Many of these dollars could have been included in the \nannual appropriations process.\n  Last year's irresponsible spending used up the Social Security \nsurplus we were supposed to save, broke the statutory spending caps we \npromised to keep, and as a result made the caps even tighter for this \nyear.\n  Clearly, that was a big mistake. That's why many of us believe we \nshould end this practice before it becomes automatic and even more \negregious in the future. In fact, that's why we passed this year's \nBudget Resolution with a new enforcement mechanism which allows any \nSenator to raise a point of order against non-defense emergency \ndesignations in an appropriations conference report. In my judgment, \nthis should include defense as well.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, we are repeating the same mistake in \nthe 1999 Supplemental Appropriations bill. It includes $15 billion of \nspending with an estimate of only $2.5 billion actually outlayed this \nfiscal year. So it is quite obvious this spending is a way to relieve \nsome of the pressure on the FY 2000 spending caps. If the spending caps \nneed to be lifted, let's vote on that up front, not this way. I would \nnot vote to lift the caps anyway, but it is a more responsible way of \nhandling what some believe is a budget crisis.\n  The legislation was originally intended to provide disaster relief to \nCentral America and was later expanded to cover our military action in \nKosovo, which are necessary and important spending. Even the \nagriculture spending is necessary. But conferees also added significant \nfunding that is not emergency-related and was not requested by the \nPresident in the conference report.\n  The conference report for this year's emergency spending bill \nincludes $15 billion with only $1.9 billion offset. This means Congress \nis spending $13 billion of the Social Security surplus, which is over \n10 percent of this year's Social Security surplus.\n  The President requested $5.5 billion for military operations in \nKosovo and Southwest Asia. But the conferees have doubled that amount. \nAs a result, American taxpayers now have to pay $10.9 billion \nadditional for defense, much of which should be considered in FY 2000 \nappropriations and was not an emergency. These add-ons include $1.84 \nbillion for military pay and pension increases and $2.25 billion for \nspare parts, depot maintenance and readiness training.\n\n  I believe we must allocate sufficient resources to ensure our \nnational security and I am concerned about readiness. We must provide \nadequate funding to maintain our military operations and support our \ntroops in Kosovo and elsewhere. However, I don't believe we can use our \nimmediate needs as a vehicle for non-emergency defense spending. \nGeneral defense readiness needs, such as a military pay raise and a \npension benefits increase, is not an emergency and should be handled \nthrough the normal budget, authorization and appropriations process. \nAgain, if the spending cap is a problem, we should deal with that \nproblem head on, not by this back-door approach.\n  Further, this conference report is a Christmas tree that's loaded not \nwith ornaments, but with plenty of non-emergency spending items under \nthe guise of an emergency, totaling over $200 million. Even some \nemergency related funding is far above what is needed and requested. \nFor example, the President requested $370 million funding for FEMA, but \nthe conference report has almost tripled that amount. This is not \nright. Attached is a copy of Senator McCain's list on the objectionable \nprovisions contained in this conference report.\n  My biggest concern is that we have promised the American people we \nwill save every penny of the Social Security surplus exclusively for \nSocial Security. In the recently-passed budget resolution we included a \nprovision to lock in $1.8 trillion of the Social Security surplus to \nsave and strengthen Social Security. We are continuing to pursue Social \nSecurity lockbox legislation to prohibit Washington from continuing to \nloot the Social Security surplus for unrelated government spending. Now \nwe are backing off from that promise, claiming we will make it up next \nyear. I've heard that before. I believe this will damage our \ncredibility and accountability with the American people, as well as \nfurther endanger our already damaged Social Security system.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there are some good provisions I strongly \nsupport in this bill. Frankly, some of the provisions and funding will \nhelp my own state of Minnesota. But the non-emergency spending which is \nnot offset overshadows these good provisions. I cannot in good \nconscience vote for this legislation.\n  Finally, the Concord Coalition challenges us, I quote: ``Fiscally \nresponsible Members of both parties should put an end to SAY-GO by \nrejecting this emergency supplemental.'' They are right. Above all we \nmust maintain the fiscal discipline and responsibility we promised the \nAmerican people. We must keep our commitment to protect Social \nSecurity.

(Unrequested)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this marks the third time I have been to \nthe floor to discuss the emergency supplemental bill. For months now I \nhave been trying to get my colleagues' attention about the extreme \nurgency of the items included in this bill. There are provisions \nincluded in this bill that were deemed an ``emergency'' back in March \nof this year. In addition to the tornado-related funding we just \nreferenced, I have received call after call from farmers who have been \nanxiously awaiting the loan money that is tied up in this supplemental \nappropriations bill. Mother Nature does not wait for Congress to act. \nThe ideal planting window has already come and gone for several \ncommodities in the South, and yet, many producers have not been able to \nput a crop in the ground because they do not have adequate funds for \noperating expenses. The money is included in this bill and it is \ncritical that we act on this matter as quickly as possible.\n  While I am pleased that these funds are included, I am disappointed \nthat more assistance is not provided to the agriculture community. If \never there was an emergency in this country, we are seeing one now in \nrural America. I commend the distinguished ranking member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, on his efforts to provide \nadditional assistance to farmers. I hope that my colleagues will be \never mindful of the potential consequences this country will face if we \nallow our producers to simply die on the vine, and I strongly urge this \nbody to revisit the agricultural crisis as soon as possible.\n  Some of my colleagues have chosen to use this bill, which is designed \nspecifically for emergency needs, to fund projects that would have a \nhard time passing the laugh test of emergency spending. In spite of \nthis, I will be casting a vote in favor of this bill on behalf of the \nbrave servicemen and women representing our nation in the conflict in \nKosovo, and on behalf of our nation's family farmers.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n          emergency community development block grant funding\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise regarding the conference report \nlanguage in the supplemental bill regarding the transfer of emergency \nCommunity Development Block Grant funding from HUD to FEMA.\n  January 1998 will long be remembered in the State of Maine because of \nthe extraordinary and historic Ice Storm that crippled the State. The \ncombination of heavy rains and freezing temperatures left much of the \nState under a thick coat of ice which downed wires, toppled \ntransformers and snapped utility poles in two. At the peak of the storm \nmore than 80 percent of the entire State was literally in the dark. \nVice President Gore best summed up the situation during his visit on \nJanuary 15, 1998, when he said,\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\n``We've never seen anything like this. This is like a neutron bomb \naimed at the power system.''\n  The response from the federal government to our plight was for the \nmost part remarkable. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), \nthe Small Business Administration, and the Department of Defense all \nanswered Maine's call for immediate help. In addition, utility workers \nfrom up and down the East Coast came to work in freezing temperatures \nand hazardous situations to kill live wires and free remaining wires \nfrom downed trees and poles. These men and women worked side by side \nwith Maine's utility companies around the clock until the lights were \nback on in every house in the State.\n  I am here today, however, because while the storm brought out the \nbest in people across the State and in many federal agencies, we still \nhave not received the assistance we need from the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development. In fact the lack of help from HUD has surpassed \nthe storm in many people's minds as the truly extraordinary event.\n  To understand fully, one has to know the history. The Stafford Act \nwhich provides FEMA's guidelines for assistance covers public power \ncompanies. It will reimburse 75 percent of the costs related to a \ndisaster. Because Maine and much of the Northeast have utilities that \nare investor-owned rather than government-owned, we were ineligible to \nreceive assistance from FEMA for this purpose, despite the fact that, \nFEMA's own Ice Storm ``Blueprint for Action'' noted that the greatest \nunmet need from the storm is the cost of utility infrastructure. The \n``Blueprint'' also noted that ``(The) HUD Community Development Block \nGrant Program can supplement other federal assistance in repairing and \nreconstructing infrastructure, including privately-owned utilities . . \n.''\n  Utility reimbursement is of great concern to Maine as it was not only \nthe largest unmet need from the Ice Storm, but ratepayers in our State \nalready pay the fourth highest utility costs in the country. Without \nsome federal help, ratepayers would have been called on to cover \nutility infrastructure repair costs through increased rates.\n  So the Maine Congressional Delegation joined with the delegations \nfrom Vermont, New Hampshire and New York to obtain funding in the 1998 \nSupplemental Appropriations Act to provide money for the CDBG program \nto help our States complete their recovery from the Ice Storm. Working \nwith Senator Bond, Chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Mikulski the Ranking Member; and Appropriations Chairman \nStevens, we secured $260 million in the Senate's 1998 Supplemental.\n  When the Senate considered this legislation, members from the \nNortheast spoke of the need for, and reasons behind, this additional \nfunding and in a colloquy between Senators Bond and D'Amato, it was \nnoted that $60 million of this funding was meant specifically for the \nNortheast to help with the recovery costs from the Ice Storm. During \nthe subsequent conference, that amount was dropped to $130 million, as \nthe House version of the bill only contained $20 million for this \npurpose.\n  The Supplemental was signed into law on May 1, 1998. On November 6, \n1998, 11 months after the disaster and six months after the bill had \nbeen signed into law, HUD announced that it was allocating \napproximately half of the $130 million, including $2.2 million for \nMaine. With an unmet need of more than $70 million, this funding was \nsimply unacceptable and made all the more so because HUD would not or \ncould not explain the rationale behind the numbers. Phone calls were \nmade, meetings were held, letters were sent and still we received no \nexplanation.\n  In the 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill adopted by Congress at the \nend of the 105th Congress, $250 million was provided for emergency CDBG \nmoney to cover disasters occurring in both FY98 and FY99. Secretary \nCuomo told me in a phone conversation on March 2, 1999 that he would \nuse some of this money to allow States dissatisfied with their original \nallocation to reapply. This discussion occurred a few days before the \nSenate Appropriations Committee marked up the 1999 Supplemental that \nincluded language to transfer the remaining CDBG emergency funding from \nHUD to FEMA because, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee \nreport,\n\n       The Committee is concerned over HUD's continuing failure to \n     implement an effective emergency disaster relief program for \n     the ``unmet needs'' of states with Presidentially-declared \n     natural disasters. Instead, the Committee believes that FEMA \n     is the appropriate Federal agency for addressing these unmet \n     disaster needs since FEMA has primary responsibility for \n     assessing and responding to all natural disasters and for \n     administering most primary programs of disaster assistance.\n       In particular, FEMA is urged to review and respond \n     appropriately to the needs of the Northeast for damage \n     resulting from the ice storms of last winter. HUD failed to \n     respond properly to these needs despite congressional concern \n     over the ice damage.\n\n  On March 5, 1999 I spoke again with Secretary Cuomo when he called to \nexpress his concern that he could not publish the notice as OMB said \nthat the Senate Appropriations Committee's actions on March 4 to \ntransfer the money from HUD to FEMA prevented him from doing so. After \nconversations with OMB, I sent a letter to the Secretary detailing \nOMB'S response that it was permissible to publish the notice as long as \nfunding was not allocated.\n\n  On March 10, the Federal Register (p. 11943 to p. 11945) contained a \nnotice from HUD that provided a review for states unhappy with their \noriginal funding allocation. Maine began work at once on an application \nfor this funding.\n  On March 23, we learned that HUD had allocated the rest of the money \nfrom the 1998 supplemental and that Maine was slated to receive another \n$2.158 million. HUD took this action despite the fact that they had \nbeen informed by the VA/HUD Subcommittee Chair and Ranking member, \nSenators Bond and Mikulski respectively, that they ``wait for final \naction by the Congress on the program structure for the award of \nemergency funding for ``unmet'' disaster needs'' and that ``because of \na number of outstanding program issues, we believe that HUD should \n``hold'' all final award allocations pending final congressional action \non S. 544.'' So HUD's allocation announcement was somewhat confusing as \nthey did not have the authority to release the money. I request \nunanimous consent that a copy of the HUD notice be included in the \nRecord.\n  Secretary Cuomo told me on March 24 that the State should get their \napplication in response to the March 10 Federal Register in as soon as \npossible, and the State delivered it to HUD on March 25.\n  On May 4, as conferees were working on the Supplemental, I received a \nletter from Cardell Cooper, Assistant HUD Secretary for Community \nPlanning and Development, announcing that Maine would receive an \nadditional $17,088,475 based on the State's March 25 application under \nthe March 10 Federal Register notice. This letter also noted that \nMaine's money was subject to Congressional action.\n  Mr. President, mere words cannot explain the frustration that Mainers \nhave experienced with HUD throughout this process. I am deeply grateful \nfor the leadership that Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski, Chairman \nStevens and the entire Senate Appropriations Committee have \ndemonstrated in their willingness to work with us and to help us \naddress Maine's unmet needs.\n  The conference report language on this bill states that:\n\n       The Department is directed to award the remaining funds in \n     accordance with announcements made heretofore by the \n     Secretary, including allocations made pursuant to the March \n     10, 1999 notice published in the Federal Register, as \n     expeditiously as possible.\n\n  This language directs HUD to live up to its March and May promises of \nfunding for Maine to help pay for the unmet needs of the Ice Storm.\n  Mr President, with passage of the Supplemental, Maine's fifteen month \njourney for equity will hopefully end. We can now complete the recovery \nthat began in January, 1998 and has dragged on far too long.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to comment today on the \nEmergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program which my distinguished colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd, worked so hard to have included in \nthe Senate-passed Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. Despite \nhis tireless efforts, the measure was stripped from the bill at the \neleventh hour for reasons which are beyond me.\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\nI take umbrage with the misleading moniker that some Members of the \nHouse Leadership have shamelessly placed upon this vital program for \npartisan political purposes.\n  This program, far from being a handout for any one company in my \nstate of West Virginia or anywhere else, would provide emergency relief \nfor more than a dozen American steel producers who have been stricken \nby the effects of the unprecedented surge in steel imports into the \nU.S. over the last year. This crisis, which has caused as many as \n10,000 layoffs at steel factories across the nation and threatens as \nmany as 100,000 more jobs, has unfairly injured the credit ratings of \nAmerica's steel manufacturers by forcing them to compete with dirt \ncheap foreign steel, which is often being sold in the U.S. at costs \nbelow that of production.\n  If you ask me, this important crisis, without question, is \nappropriately classified as an ``emergency''. If you ask the \nsteelworkers who've either been laid off or who are the next to go, I \nbet they say the same thing. Ask their families and communities if this \nis an emergency, and you'll get the same answer. The emergency is that \nour American steel industry is being pummeled by illegal foreign \ncompetition, and that the imports are taking a very real and \ndevastating toll on the people who depend on steel for their \nlivelihood.\n  The program that Senator Byrd proposed in the Senate-passed version \nof the Supplemental Appropriations bill would have made it possible for \nmany of the most financially-unstable steel producers in this country \nto persevere until we in the Senate can take decisive and comprehensive \naction to address the underlying cause of our domestic steel industry's \ncurrent predicament--imports. The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee \nProgram would have made much-needed capital available to those \ncompanies who have been the hardest hit by the import surge, and it \nwould have done so at minimal expense to the American taxpayer. The \nprogram just made good sense, and I was extremely disappointed to hear \nthat Members of the House Leadership insisted that it be eliminated.\n  The argument was, from what I hear, that Senator Byrd's provision was \ntoo expensive and of benefit only to Weirton Steel Corporation in West \nVirginia. The fact is, Mr. President, that Weirton was just one of more \nthan a dozen companies which the Department of Commerce determined \nwould be eligible for loans under this program. All of these distressed \ncompanies have been doing everything in their power to survive the \ncurrent crisis. I know first hand the great lengths to which Weirton \nSteel has gone through simply to keep its head above water. In my state \nalone we've had nearly 1,000 layoffs as a direct result of the import \nsurge. The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program would have made it \npossible for companies across the nation to make upcoming debt payments \nwhich many steel producers are in jeopardy of defaulting on because of \nthe current crisis. Moreover, the cost of the program was $140 million \nto leverage $1 billion in loans--that's a good investment. I deeply \nregret that the unwillingness of some Members of Congress to open their \neyes to the plight of America's steelworkers has resulted in the loan \nprogram being removed from this vehicle. That is very bad news for the \nmany steel companies who stood to benefit from the program. Some of \nthem are now that much closer to joining the other four major American \nsteel producers who have already been forced into bankruptcy by this \ncrisis.\n  However, there remains time to reverse this mistake. I hope that the \nMembers of Congress, who did not understand the details of how this \nloan program functions or the benefits that it would bestow upon a \nlarge number of steel companies across the nation, will reassess their \nposition. We still have an opportunity to support this important \nprogram. I intend to work with Senator Byrd in moving this program on \nanother legislative vehicle.\n  Each of my colleagues knows how strongly I believe that this body \nmust act to address the import surge in a comprehensive way. However, I \nalso know how vital the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program is to \nmany U.S. steel producers. It is a critically important stop-gap \nmeasure which would allow companies like Weirton steel to remain in \nbusiness long enough for the United States Senate to take the tough and \ncomprehensive action which is necessary to protect our domestic \nindustry from unfair foreign competition.\n  Mr. President, I truly hope that we seize the opportunity to take up \nthis measure again. Without it, steel companies in a number of \ndifferent states may soon find themselves the next victims of our \nfailure to aggressively enforce our unfair trade laws.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I do not support the adoption of the \nconference report on H.R. 1141, the fiscal year 1999 emergency \nappropriations act.\n  My decision to oppose this bill was not an easy one, Mr. President. \nThis legislation contains funding for our U.S. military forces in \nKosovo, Iraq, Bosnia, and elsewhere around the world. Regardless of my \ndeep concerns about NATO's Kosovo operations, I realize that our \nmilitary, already stretched to the limit by numerous foreign \ndeployments, needs the resources provided by this legislation. Further, \nthis bill contains funding to help farmers in Oklahoma who are finding \nit hard to get credit, and it will make sure disaster assistance for \nOklahoma tornadoes does not deplete FEMA's funding reserves.\n  Unfortunately, it is also fiscally irresponsible.\n  H.R. 1141 provides $15 billion in new spending authority, $13 billion \nof which is provided for fiscal year 1999 and $2 billion of which is \nprovided for fiscal year 2000.\n  The outlays flowing from this budget authority will reduce our budget \nsurplus by $14.6 billion over the next five years. In fiscal year 1999 \nand 2000, when the entire budget surplus is attributable to the Social \nSecurity trust fund, this bill spends $11 billion of the surplus.\n  Additionally, $14.7 billion of the bill's total spending is \ndesignated as emergency spending, so that it is outside of the spending \ncaps. $10.9 billion of the emergency spending is attributable to \ndefense.\n  Unfortunately, the efforts of my colleague Senator Gramm to remove \nthe nondefense emergency designations failed earlier today. I supported \nhim in that effort, and I am disappointed that more of my colleagues \ndid not join us.\n  This legislation makes a mockery of our budget process. I believe \nCongress cannot continue to squander the economy's good fortune on a \nbigger, more invasive government. I believe the fiscal restraints we \nall agreed to in 1997 should be enforced, and I believe the budget we \npassed just a few weeks ago must be complied with.\n  A soaring economy and the 1997 budget agreement combined last year to \nproduce the first budget surplus since 1969. What was Congress' \nreaction?\n  We abandoned all fiscal restraint and passed a monstrous Omnibus \nspending bill which included a record $22 billion in emergency \nspending.\n  With CBO predicting an even bigger budget surplus this year, $111 \nbillion, we are rushing to enact a $15 billion emergency spending bill.\n  Since spending caps were instituted in the 1990 budget deal, Congress \nhas appropriated $132 billion in emergency spending; $70 billion since \nthe end of the Gulf War. The average annual emergency appropriation \nfrom 1993 to 1997 was $8 billion.\n  I believe that Senators must decide if they truly intend to abide by \nthe budgets we pass, or simply ignore them.\n  As I have already mentioned, this bill includes $1.13 billion in new \nspending for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, partially offset \nby a $230 million transfer from the Community Development Block Grant \nprogram. This $1.13 billion is in addition to the $1.2 billion Congress \nhas already appropriated to FEMA for fiscal year 1999.\n  While I support the work FEMA is doing to help my state recover from \nmassive tornado damage, I believe the funding in this supplemental is \nfar more than the agency needs. In fact, after touring Oklahoma tornado \ndamage two weeks ago, the President asked for an additional $372 \nmillion for FEMA. I have been assured by FEMA that they do not require \nresources beyond this request to accommodate the Oklahoma disasters.\n  Unfortunately, the conferees on the supplemental decided to pile on \n$758 million more than the President requested. This extra funding has \nnothing to do with FEMA's current needs.\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\nIt has everything to do with the appropriations committee's desire to \n``pre-fund'' the agency in an attempt to avoid the fiscal year 2000 \nspending caps.\n  Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for his efforts to keep \nthe cost of this bill down and remove some of its objectionable \nprovisions. However, I deeply regret that I cannot support this \nemergency supplemental spending bill. I believe we are losing our grip \non fiscal sanity, and I fear that worse is coming later this year. I \nplan to work aggressively throughout this year to make sure we comply \nwith the budget we enacted last month.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the supplemental \nappropriations conference report.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not perfect, and I realize that some of \nmy colleagues do not believe it is worthy of support. I disagree. This \nlegislation meets several pressing demands that we have a \nresponsibility to meet. First, this compromise provides essential \nfunding for our military operations in Yugoslavia as well as \nhumanitarian aid for Kosovo refugees. Without this funding our fighting \nmen and women will face equipment and material shortfalls and view a \n``no'' vote as a lack of support for them and their mission. Second, \nthis legislation follows through on a commitment we made to provide a \nlong-overdue pay raise for our troops. Third, this legislation provides \ndisaster assistance to help our Latin American neighbors recover from \nthe hurricane which struck that region so viciously earlier this year, \nand it contains funds to aid recovery from the recent spate of \ntornadoes here at home. Lastly, it extends the Airport Improvement \nProgram which helps our nation's airports reduce aircraft noise and \nensure aviation safety.\n  However, I am disappointed that the Conference Committee decided to \nretain the Hutchison-Graham tobacco settlement recoupment provision in \nthis year's Supplemental Appropriations bill. This amendment clearly \ndoes not deal with an ``emergency'' situation and should, therefore, \nnot be included in this legislation. I am also deeply concerned that we \nhave not thoroughly considered the potential impact this provision will \nhave on the federal budget in years to come.\n  In essence, this provision usurps the ability of the Congress to \nengage in a healthy debate about the use of the federal share of the \ntobacco settlement. While many argue that the federal government has \nabsolutely no claim to this money, those assertions simply are not \ntrue. Current law dictates that the federal government rightly has a \nsay over the percentage it contributes to the Medicaid program. Yet, \ninstead of bringing this matter to the floor and considering it in an \nhonest fashion, we are allowing an unprecedented opportunity to make a \nreal difference in the lives of millions of Americans completely slip \naway from us. It is unfortunate that proponents of turning over the \nfederal share of the tobacco settlement to the states without any \nguidelines have taken this backdoor approach.\n  In essence, we have allowed our hands to be tied by the states, who \nwish to use this money to cut taxes, fix roads and build new buildings, \namong other things. According to a recent survey conducted by the \nCampaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the majority of states, as of today, \nhave no definite plans to spend a portion of the settlement on programs \nto prevent children from starting to smoke or to help current smokers \nquit the habit. This action is in direct contrast with the desires of \nthe majority of Americans who would like to see a major portion of this \nmoney set aside for tobacco prevention and cessation programs and \nhealth care to cover the cost of tobacco related illness. In my state, \nRhode Islanders have resoundingly supported dedicating a significant \namount of the settlement for tobacco related activities.\n  I am saddened that we appear to have lost sight of the fact that the \nprocess of suing the tobacco companies was not so states could get more \nmoney for roads or schools, but because for decades these companies \npurposefully deceived the American public about the dangers of smoking. \nAs a result, generations of Americans have suffered the adverse health \neffects of this campaign of deceit, and the federal government spent \nbillions addressing the health care needs of these folks. While states \nwere triumphant in reaching this monumental agreement, what will the \neffort have been for if there is no change in teen smoking rates in \nthis country?\n  Lastly, I am concerned that the conference report contains a number \nof dubious environmental riders that should be more fully debated as \nwell as several budgetary off-sets that raise a number of questions. In \nparticular, as a Senator who serves on the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee, I believe that the rescission of $350 million worth \nof Section 8 funds could jeopardize the renewal of affordable housing \ncontracts for thousands of elderly and low-income Americans, which \nwould be a step backwards in our effort to increase the amount of \naffordable housing in our nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I regret that I have to come to the floor \nto cast my vote against the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nbefore the Senate today. When we face crises in this country, when you \nhave American men and women serving courageously in Kosovo, when you \nhave the borders in Macedonia and Montenegro overflowing with refugees, \nand when you have hundreds of thousands of hurricane victims in Central \nAmerica, you would expect that the U.S. Senate would be capable of \ncoming together--unanimously--to address these challenges. It used to \nbe that way in the Senate. It's not that way anymore. Now we fund our \noperations in Kosovo, and we help the refugees, and we aid the \nhurricane victims, but at the same time we practice legislative \nextortion--we say to every Senator, ``You want to vote for Kosovo? You \nwant to vote for aid for hurricane victims? Go ahead--but you have to \nvote to cut vital housing programs for working Americans across this \ncountry. And you need to vote to eliminate environmental regulations.'' \nThat's not the way we ought to do business in the U.S. Senate, and I \nthink it's time we start to talk about changing that course before it \ncontaminates public life any further. That is why I will cast my vote \nagainst this emergency supplemental appropriations bill: to register my \nfrustration and my sadness with the way we now do business in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Before I say more about the damage this bill does to so many of the \nvital areas of public policy in the United States, I must tell you that \nin many respects I only have the liberty of voting against this bill--\nof casting a symbolic stone against legislative blackmail--because I \nknow this bill will pass the Senate overwhelmingly. Critical \ninvestments for our troops in Kosovo--which, as a veteran, as a \ncitizen, and as a senator, I have aggressively supported--will be made \nin spite of my vote against this bill. The truth is, if this were not \nthe case, if my vote would have undermined in any respects our efforts \nin Kosovo, I would have had to vote for this bill, in spite of the \ndamage it does. I would have had to--regrettably--support this bill \nbecause we have a responsibility to support the American troops we have \ncommitted overseas, and I would never stand by and allow the Senate to \nsend what I believe is the wrong message to our troops, and the wrong \nmessage to Slobodan Milosevic about American resolve . I believe the \nUnited States, and NATO as a whole, must remain united against the \nsystematic killing, raping and pillaging of innocent Kosovar Albanian \nmen, women, and children at the hands of Serb forces. The funding \nincluded in this supplemental appropriations conference report will \nprovide support for the U.S. service men and women who are putting \ntheir lives in jeopardy and will, I believe, give them a greater \ncapacity to achieve our military objectives in Kosovo. It will also \nprovide the desperately needed relief for humanitarian efforts already \nunderway to assist the refugees in that region. And these investments \nwill be made by the U.S. Senate, reflected in our final tally.\n  I believe this Nation must have a bipartisan foreign policy, and that \nwe can not afford to allow politics to endanger our troops. But I wish \nthat more of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, those who \nincluded provisions which cut directly against the interests of low \nincome working Americans and our environment, would\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nalso have a commitment to bipartisanship on domestic issues of \ntremendous importance to so many working Americans struggling to keep \ntheir heads above water even in this great economy we celebrate on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. The rescissions and changes in policy \nincluded in this Conference Report will eventually hurt the poorest \nAmericans and will immediately hurt our environment. That should not be \nacceptable in a Senate which prides itself on its ability to do what is \nright for all Americans. I can not in good conscience support these \nmeasures.\n  I question what it says about our commitment to helping those who are \nbeing left behind in this new economy, that we could find the resources \nto provide $983 million in disaster relief for those whose lives were \ndisrupted when Hurricane Mitch struck the Central American nations of \nHonduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala and when Hurricane \nGeorges struck in the Caribbean last year--but we are cutting critical \ninvestments in housing for working Americans. Hurricanes in Central \nAmerica have left almost 10,000 dead and have driven millions from \ntheir homes. The cost of damages to businesses, hospitals, schools and \nindividual homes have been enormous. We are right to provide assistance \nto the victims of these hurricanes. But we ought to be able to do it \nwithout abandoning thousands of our neediest citizens here at home.\n  Today there are more than five million low-income Americans facing \nsevere housing needs, receiving federal housing assistance. At least \nanother 15 million Americans qualify for help but do not receive it \nbecause of limited budget appropriations. They suffer from \nhomelessness--600,000 Americans homeless each night; 5.3 million \nAmericans pay rents that are more than 50 percent of their household \nincome, or live in severely substandard conditions--these are the \nsevere housing problems we once hoped to address. These families are \none misfortune away from homelessness. A child gets sick, a parent gets \nlaid off--even for a week or two, the car breaks down, and that family \nends up on the streets. So what are we doing in this supplemental \nappropriations bill? We're rescinding $350 million from the Section 8 \nprogram that helps these families who are working through the tough \ntimes--and we're rescinding this money in spite of the fact that the \nHUD budget in FY1999 will already be almost $1 billion less than it was \nin FY1994. This rescission will result in a shortfall that will cause \nthe loss of subsidy and the displacement of approximately 60,000 \nfamilies. 60,000 families. It will make the current waiting list \ncrisis, where families must sometimes wait years to find some relief, \neven more difficult to solve.\n  This isn't the first time this has happened. Year after year, HUD's \nbudget is raided--targeted for cuts in 1995, in 1997, in 1998, and \nagain this year--to pay for emergencies which, by their nature and by \nlaw, are not required to be offset with budget cuts. Only a very small \nportion of this $15 billion bill is offset with spending cuts. I am \ndisturbed, really, that some of my colleagues have chosen to make cuts \nto this program because they believe it is politically vulnerable. \nHUD's budget should not fall victim to this type of spending cut--and \nfamilies struggling to stay off the streets shouldn't fall victim to \nthis kind of politics.\n  I am not new to this game. I have fought year in and year out against \nsubstantial cuts that have been made to the HUD budget. These cuts have \njeopardized the existing public housing services and have undermined \nHUD's capacity to continue the Secretary's ambitious program of reform \nor even just to make up for previous under-funding of capital needs to \nmeet our Nation's demand for affordable housing. Last year, the \nCongress passed the first new section 8 vouchers in 5 years. This \nrescission would reverse in large part the down payment Congress made \nin addressing unmet housing needs. At least 100,000 new vouchers are \nneeded to begin to address the outstanding needs. This rescission moves \nus in the wrong direction.\n  As the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee, as someone who \nsees first hand in Massachusetts the struggles of so many families \nworking their fingers to the bone and trying to stay off the streets, I \ncan not support these draconian cuts in housing.\n  But this bill doesn't stop there. Some of my colleagues have included \ndangerous environmental riders in this bill--in a practice that is \nbecoming all too common in this Senate. It wasn't this way 15 years ago \nwhen I came here, it wasn't that way 30 years ago when Democrats and \nRepublicans worked together to write our first environmental laws, but \nit's that way now--even basic environmental protections have become a \npartisan fight--and the riders in this bill do serious damage to our \nenvironment. Specifically, the conference report includes three \nenvironmental riders that I believe will set back environmental \nprogress, unnecessarily limit federal revenues and undermine the \nlegislative process--and I oppose all of them.\n\n  The conference report extends the moratorium on issuing a final rule-\nmaking on crude oil valuation until October 1, 1999. It restricts the \nimplementation of the Department of the Interior Solicitor's opinion on \nmining that limits the number of millsites to one five-acre millsite \nper patent.\n  The environmental rider that I find most egregious prevents the \nDepartment of Interior from issuing new rules for hardrock mining on \npublic lands. This is the third time the Senate has attached such a \nprovision to an appropriations bill. As a result, the hardrock mining \nindustry continues to cause environmental damage and costs the \ntaxpayer.\n  The extraction of hardrock minerals like gold, silver and copper \nusually includes the excavation of enormous pits and the use of toxic \nchemicals like cyanide, and its results have been destructive. \nAccording to the General Accounting Office, there are almost 300,000 \nacres of federal land that have been mined and left unreclaimed. \nAbandoned mines account for 59 Superfund sites and there are more than \n2,000 abandoned mines in our national parks.\n  The Mineral Policy Center estimates that the cleanup costs for \nabandoned mines on public and private lands may reach $72 billion. \nRather than reform the industry through comprehensive legislation or \nproper execution of existing executive branch authority, we will once \nagain block reform through a rider.\n  It is time that we put an end to this policy of undermining the \nenvironment, of gutting environmental protections, by slipping riders \nthrough the back door of every spending bill. We ought to be a better \nSenate than that. We ought to have our debates on the floor, in public, \nand if you want to promote a vision of an America where we turn the \nenvironment over to polluters, over to those who would destroy our \nnatural resources, if that's your vision, then let's debate it--and \nlet's end the practice of environmental degradation through \nappropriations bills.\n  Before I yield the floor, I do want to draw our attention to \nsomething in this supplemental bill which I believe is an important \nvictory for Massachusetts, and for our fishermen. I am pleased that \n$1.88 million was included for NOAA's National Marine Fisheries \nService, NMFS, to promote cooperative management and research \nactivities in the Northeast multispecies fishery. These funds will \ncomplement the $5 million in emergency assistance that was appropriated \nfor Gulf of Maine fishermen last November.\n  Many in this Chamber know that too many fishermen in New England are \nexperiencing economic hardship due to new groundfish regulations \nrecently imposed in the Gulf of Maine. In order to help alleviate the \nnegative effects of these new regulations, fishermen have joined with \nNMFS in developing a spending plan for the $5 million in emergency \nassistance. The plan proposes to compensate fishermen for lost fishing \nopportunities that have resulted from inshore groundfish closures. \nFishermen, in return, will make their vessels available to take part in \ncooperative research projects. A portion of the $1.88 million will be \nused to fund the cooperative scientific projects that will be conducted \nby NMFS and other institutions. In addition, some of the new funding \nwill be used to employ fishermen as scientific observers. This new \npartnership will have a twofold benefit. Cooperative research \nactivities will keep fishermen employed on the water while groundfish \nstocks recover,\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\nand this plan will promote a more constructive relationship between \nfishermen and NMFS with the goal of improving management activities in \nthe Gulf of Maine groundfish fishery. I express my very real \nappreciation for the support of Senate Appropriations chairman, Senator \nTed Stevens and the Democratic ranking member, Senator Byrd, for \nincluding this provision in the conference report and for their \ncontinued steadfast support of the New England fishermen.\n  In conclusion, let me just say that I fully support the American men \nand women who are putting their lives in jeopardy in the Kosovo region \nfor a mission which I believe in very deeply--as a veteran, I support \ntheir interests very personally in fact. I would have liked to have \nseen the Senate produce an Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill \nthat we could all vote for, unanimously. But this bill is a far cry \nfrom that kind of legislation, a far cry from the kind of bipartisan \nforeign policy we demand from our leaders in the United States. I am \nentirely disappointed that some members of the Senate have used this \nbill as a vehicle to hurt low-income working families and damage the \nenvironment we all share.\n  Mr. President, we are a great country of Americans who care about \neach other, who believe that we have a national purpose and that part \nof the reason we are a special nation is that we help each other make \nit through the times and make the most of our own lives. We're a great \nnation. We ought to be a great Senate that reflects that sense of \ncommitment to one another, and I look forward to the day when those \nvalues return to this Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have three additional speakers. I sent \nword to them. Does the distinguished Senator from Mississippi have any \nsuggestions at the moment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I intend to reserve our time until just \nbefore the vote, if that is satisfactory.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if it is agreeable with the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, I ask unanimous consent there be a recess for \n3 minutes and it not be charged against the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We would just suggest the absence of a quorum for that \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. We can't call off a quorum in 3 minutes if anybody objects.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not intend to object and I hope no one would.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time will not be \ncharged.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no more requests for time. I yield my \ntime back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there has been some conversation about \ndisaster assistance for farmers and complaints that this bill does not \ngo far enough to address the needs in the agriculture community for \ndisaster assistance.\n  I point out to Senators that there are funds in here that will \nprovide guaranteed loans for those farmers who are having difficulty \ngetting financing for this year's crop so that the Government will \nguarantee the repayment of that loan. That will allow them to get loans \nthey otherwise would not be able to get because of the inability to \nshow that this year's crop will produce a profit.\n  This is a real problem, and we are sensitive to that. We have had \nhearings on that subject, and we are aware of it. In this conference \nreport, we spell out, in addition to the funds I have talked about \nalready in the bill, the following:\n\n       The conferees recognize the problems facing agricultural \n     producers today and understand that the actual needs for \n     disaster assistance funds provided last year likely will \n     exceed the projections of the Department of Agriculture. The \n     Department of Agriculture has projected that net farm income \n     will decline $3 billion below last year. The conferees expect \n     the administration to monitor the situation closely and if \n     necessary, submit requests for additional funds to the \n     Congress for consideration.\n\n  This acknowledges that the problems are real. We know they are real. \nLast year was a big disaster in agriculture, and the Congress and the \nadministration agreed to respond with a multibillion-dollar disaster \nassistance program. Some of the farmers have not gotten the benefits of \nthat program yet. We provide funds to accelerate the availability of \nthose benefits from the Department of Agriculture, and we are meeting \nevery request that has been submitted by this administration for \nadditional funds for that purpose.\n  The conference is sensitive to those needs. We did reject an \namendment that was offered to increase the funding, and we hope the \nadministration will let us know if additional funds are truly needed.\n  In many cases, it is impossible to determine what the assistance \nneeds will be until after the crop year has begun. In many places, we \nhave not even seen planting, but we do think this is responsive to that \nproblem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 1141, the fiscal year 1999 emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The pending bill includes emergency funding to finance the United \nStates participation in NATO military operations in Kosovo and \nYugoslavia. This supplemental makes available $11.0 billion in \nemergency, and contingency emergency, defense appropriations based on \nthe crisis in Kosovo and the closely related readiness crisis in our \narmed forces.\n  Of these funds, $10.8 billion are appropriated to the Department of \nDefense:\n  The supplemental provides the $5.5 billion the President requested \nfor military operations in Kosovo and Department of Defense refugee \nassistance.\n  It also provides some very needed readiness funding, specifically: \n$1.0 billion for procurement of depleted munitions stocks; $1.1 billion \nfor spare parts, stocks of which have reached crisis proportions for \nsome weapon systems; $700 million for overdue maintenance of these same \nweapons systems; $100 million for recruiting to address DoD's retention \ncrisis; $200 million to improve the declining training of military \npersonnel in high priority military specialties, and $200 million to \nrepair aging bases.\n  These are important additions that clearly merit this additional \nfunding and an ``emergency'' designation. Some will argue that these \nadds for defense are too much; others will argue, correctly I believe, \nthat these readiness increases are overdue. I have received both \nofficial and unofficial reports of extremely serious readiness problems \nin our armed forces. This additional funding will just begin to address \nthese problems correctly.\n  The legislation also makes $475 million available to the Secretary of \nDefense for Military Construction for him to use, under proper \ncontrols, as he sees fit. Another $1.8 billion is provided for military \npay and pensions, subject to authorization legislation that Congress \nmay choose to enact.\n  Both of these latter additions are deemed ``contingent emergencies.'' \nThe money will only be expended if the President agrees that the needs \nconstitute an emergency and the funds should be spent for the stated \npurpose. The President need not spend these funds if he so selects. \nThis, I believe, is an appropriate way to make these funds available.\n  I strongly support these funds for our troops in the Balkans and for \nthose in other parts of the world who may soon find themselves also \ninvolved in this troubling conflict. Regardless of our views regarding \nthe conflict in the Balkans, we must fully support our armed forces \nbeing employed there and ensure that their equipment and training is \nfully and completely supported. It would be dangerous and foolish to do \nanything less.\n  The conferees also provide $1.1 billion for humanitarian assistance \nto refugees from Kosovo. Congress provided an additional $548 million \nabove the President's request to aid refugees that have fled Kosovo and \nthe 20,000 that are temporarily resettling in the United States. This \nis a significant infusion of\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nresources to address an increasingly desperate situation in the nations \nbordering Kosovo.\n  I commend the managers of the conference report for including the \nemergency aid to Central American countries who suffered form the \nravages of Hurricane Mitch. This aid is for our neighbors who faced \ndevastation of Biblical proportions last fall. The final aid package \ntotals $814 million for the region.\n  I remind my colleagues that the United States has worked for more \nthan a quarter of a century to help develop democratic movements in \nthis region. The need to move quickly and pass this funding cannot be \noverstated. When I visited the region in December, I was gratified to \nhear government agencies and relief groups emphasize over and over \nagain, ``We want your help, not forever, but so we can begin to help \nourselves and continue building stable and democratic societies.''\n  In addition to these critical items, the final bill addresses the \nPresident's request for a $100 million appropriation for Jordan under \nthe Wye Peace Accord. The Congress also provides an additional $574 \nmillion for aid to America's farmers following the $5.9 billion in \nemergency aid approved by Congress last October. It is also important \nto note that the conferees have taken swift action to ensure that \nsufficient disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, is available for Oklahoma, Kansas, and other Midwestern \nstates that have been severely damaged by recent tornadoes.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to print in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks a table by the Congressional Budget Office \nthat summarizes the spending in the pending bill.\n  Mr. President, including offsets to some of the nondefense emergency \nand non-emergency spending in the bill, the net total of the final bill \nis $11.35 billion in BA and $3.7 billion in outlays for fiscal year \n1999. An estimated $2.0 billion in BA and $7.4 billion in outlays will \nbe expended in fiscal year 2000 according to CBO estimates of the bill.\n  Finally, I address an issue raised by the inclusion of a provision in \nthe conference report concerning the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, OPIC. Because this language in the conference report \nattempts to change the way we treat an OPIC program under title V of \nthe Budget Act (The Federal Credit Reform Act), it violates section 306 \nof the Budget Act.\n  We have consulted with CBO and OMB, and both agencies say they will \nnot change their treatment of OPIC programs from past practices because \nof this provision. Therefore I will not challenge this language, \nbecause I do not think the conference report will have any practical \neffect on credit reform or our budgetary treatment of OPIC programs.\n  I support this bill. It is largely an emergency spending package that \nresponds to serious natural disasters at home and abroad, and to the \nNATO military campaign in the Balkans and the resulting tragedy of \nthousands of Kosovar refugees displaced during this conflict.

Mr. President, we will soon vote on a $15 billion \nspending bill that will, among other things, further fund the war \nagainst Yugoslavia. Although the Administration requested some $6 \nbillion for military and humanitarian needs for the Kosovo operation, \nthis amount has almost doubled, and is well over $11 billion. Sadly, \nthis higher figure will not get our readiness back where it needs to \nbe--where we could, at the drop of the hat, successfully wage two full \nscale wars at the same time--as directed in the ``Quadrennial Defense \nReview.''\n  It also illustrates something seriously gone wrong here in \nWashington, D.C. Only a small amount of these funds are subject to \noffsets--its as if there is this notion, both in the Administration and \nin Congress, that this is ``free money.'' Well it's not, Mr. President. \nFor every dollar spent, another priority loses out. And I can think of \na whole host of areas where this money would be better spent than in \nfighting a war in a part of the world where most Americans can't \nclearly identify on a map. Tax cuts, Social Security, Education, to \nname just a few.\n  I will vote against this bill for two reasons: (1) our Kosovo policy \nis seriously flawed and the only way we in Congress can truly voice our \nopposition is voting where it hurts the most--the pocketbook; and (2) \nthis is a spending bill gone mad--there is no fiscal accountability \nhere, nor is there any notion of fiscal responsibility.\n  This vote, at least for me, will be one of the toughest I have had to \ncast in my tenure in the United States Senate. I strongly support our \nmilitary, and am proud of our men and women in uniform. I certainly do \nnot want to jeopardize our people who are charged with carrying out \nthis war. But even so, this is not a vote against our military--rather, \nit is a vote in opposition\n\n[[Page S5680]]\n\nto the Administration's seriously flawed, if not inept Kosovo policy.\n  No one disputes that Milosevic is a bad person and that he should be \nstopped. His brutal, persistent attacks on the Albanian Kosovar people \nis akin to Germany in the Second World War. But air strikes alone are \nnot going to do it--they will level Yugoslavia, destroy most of its \ninfrastructure, terrorize its civilian population, and most likely, not \nbe successful stopping Milosevic.\n  I do not believe that our war fighters' are being given sufficient \nlatitude to make this mission a success. Their decisions are subject to \ndual-review: (1) the ``political'' review of the White House; and (2) \nthe ``consensus'' of our NATO allies through every step of the war.\n  A few examples. General Clark's request to deploy gunships continues \nto be denied by ``senior military advisors in Washington, D.C.'' Who \nare these people? The Joint-Chiefs of Staff? Or Sandy Berger and \nMadeleine Albright?\n  It took over a month to get Apache helicopters to the region; and \nthey sit grounded because the ``polls'' show no support for a ground \ncampaign.\n  It seems to me that one of the first priorities in waging a war is to \ncut off the supply lines of the other side--and oil, in particular, so \nthat they cannot fuel their tanks and planes.\n  Unbelievably, the NATO alliance refused to cut off the flow of fuel \nthat fires Milosevic's war machine. Although the U.S. proposed a \nblockade to stop the oil, it was defeated by France which opposed \nimplementing a blockade without a formal declaration of war.\n  We are executing massive, full scale air bombings every day; people \nare being killed; but the French believe a declaration of war must be a \nprecondition for a blockade.\n  Our bombs have gone off course several times, hitting refugee \nconvoys, the country of Bulgaria, and the Chinese embassy in Belgrade--\nwhich is technically Chinese soil in Yugoslavia.\n  At least in the case of the Chinese embassy, it wasn't the bombs at \nfault, it was our intelligence. Although the tourist maps in Belgrade \naccurately place the Chinese embassy in that locale, our intelligence \nwas using an outdated map that led them to believe it was a procurement \ncenter for the Serbian military.\n  The Chinese people are outraged, and well they should be. But the \nAmerican people should be just as outraged--not just by this bombing, \nbut by the continued incompetence which has come to typify this policy.\n\n  I fail to understand how waging this war by NATO consensus is getting \nus anywhere except more deeply involved militarily, and less likely to \nfind a diplomatic solution to this crisis. Mr. President, wars should \nnot be waged by consensus, and diplomacy should not be directed by \npolls.\n  Internationally, the world is a much less stable place than it was \neven two months before. There was a sense of optimism that Russia might \nhelp broker a diplomatic solution to Kosovo. The possibility remains, \nbut Russia is far less stable than previously thought: President \nYeltsin survived an impeachment proceeding, but he has again disbanded \nhis government to the degree that it is unclear who in Russia has the \npower to help negotiate an end to this crisis.\n  The Chinese are no longer just a sideline observer. While China has \nopposed the NATO bombings from the outset, it didn't have a dog in this \nfight until we bombed their embassy in Belgrade. If a deal on Kosovo is \nreached, it will have to pass muster with the Chinese who hold veto \nauthority on the U.N. Security Council.\n  We continue to bomb Iraq daily--stretching our Air Force readiness \neven further. Saddam Hussein shows no signs of letting up, and will \nmost likely use this as an opportunity to push us even further.\n  And last, but not least, the Korean Peninsula continues to be a \ncrisis in waiting. Starvation in North Korea is rampant, food supplies \nare gone, and the country is undergoing one of the worst droughts in \nhistory. If the North Koreans decide to engage us militarily, we will \nbe fighting three wars at the same time--beyond that envisioned by our \nmilitary strategists in the Quadrennial Defense Review, and perhaps \nmuch more than we are currently prepared to do.\n  Again, we will soon vote on this supplemental funding package. Over \n$15 billion. And when the war is over, we will be asked to vote on \nadditional funding to rebuild Yugoslavia. We will probably vote to \nrebuild the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. And if we approve additional \nfunds for the military campaign, the end costs of rebuilding Yugoslavia \nwill only continue to mount.\n  My vote does not undermine my support, concern or pride for our \nmilitary. But I do believe that a diplomatic solution to this problem \nshould have been found, can still be found, and must be found if we are \nto avoid the further escalation of this war. Failure to do so will cost \nus precipitously--not just in dollars, but in American lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the $15 billion \nsupplemental appropriations conference report before us. The \nsupplemental spends far more than is necessary to support our effort in \nKosovo and, worse, will take vitally needed money out of the Social \nSecurity surplus, thereby raiding the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  Protecting the Social Security trust fund is one of my highest \npriorities. The Social Security system is expected to go into deficit \nin 2014 and we will need every dollar of that surplus today in order to \nbe prepared for the tomorrows ahead of us.\n  Until this point, the Senate has been headed in the right direction \non Social Security. The Budget Resolution, which I strongly supported, \ncalled for reduced debt and taxes, increased funding for education and \nnational defense, and maintaining the spending caps so necessary to \ncontrol spending.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the budget resolution built in on-budget \nsurpluses from the year 2001 and beyond. This is significant because \nsurpluses that are accumulating in the Social Security Trust Funds will \nno longer be used to finance on-budget operations of government. Social \nSecurity surpluses should not be used to finance deficits in the rest \nof government.\n  The Budget Resolution stood in stark contrast to President Clinton's \nbudget, which, over the next five years, proposed spending $158 billion \nof the Social Security surpluses on non-Social Security programs.\n  The Budget Resolution, in addition to preserving every penny of \nSocial Security surpluses, also contained procedural hurdles blocking \nfuture budgets from spending Social Security surpluses.\n  These procedures included a point of order against on-budget deficits \nand an amendment calling for reducing the debt ceiling by the amount of \nthe Social Security surplus--the lockbox provision.\n  The Senate voted in favor of both the point of order and the lockbox \nby unanimous votes during the budget resolution.\n  In addition, the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft lockbox legislation, which \nis still pending in the Senate, would put these procedures into law, \nand ensure that Congress could not spend the Social Security surpluses \non non-Social Security purposes.\n  Unfortunately, the supplemental appropriations package before us \nwould undo some of the good work that we have already done this \nsession.\n  By not offsetting $13 billion of the spending, the supplemental takes \nmoney from the Social Security surpluses, money that is necessary to \nprotect the Social Security trust funds.\n  Thus far, Congress has been committed to stopping the raid on Social \nSecurity. This Congress has passed a budget that is balanced without \nusing Social Security funds.\n  This conference report, however, not only spends Social Security \nfunds, but also contains $1.2 billion in traditional pork spending.\n  I refer to such spending as $45 million for Census funding, $3.76 \nmillion for the House page dormitory, and $1.8 million for the O'Neill \nHouse building.\n  If this bill were just for Kosovo and true emergency spending, I \nwould vote for it. If this bill were fully offset, I would vote for it. \nBut this bill is neither all emergency nor all offset. This bill, like \nthe $21 billion omnibus appropriation last fall, is an abrogation of \nour responsibility to protect the Social Security surplus.\n  Mr. President, this is not the way that we should handle Congress' \nresponsibility over the federal purse\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\nstrings. If we face real emergencies, we should fund those emergencies.\n  But funding those emergencies is not free. We need to pay for all \nspending, emergency or not. This is why I support Senator Enzi's \nattempt to make sure that this entire appropriation is offset.\n  If we do not offset our spending, the money comes out of the Social \nSecurity surplus. There is no getting around this fact. We must pay for \nany new funding. If we do not pay for it, it comes out of the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  The Social Security program is too important to be raided. While I \nrecognize the importance of emergency funding, particularly for Kosovo, \nI also recognize that spending needs to be paid for.\n  Mr. President, this request is not unreasonable. All across this \ngreat land, when families face unexpected expenses, they must offset \ntheir spending by readjusting their priorities. No family in America \nwould react to an unexpected crisis by going out and spending more \nmoney on other discretionary, non-budgeted items. All I am asking is \nthat the Congress do the same.\n  This supplemental spends too much money and offsets too little of it. \nIf we are to keep our financial house in order, and to protect the \nSocial Security trust funds, it is time that we in Congress started to \nchange our behavior.\n  If we are to maintain our Social Security obligations, we need to \nlearn how to spend less money, and offset more. It is with regret that \nI feel obligated to oppose this conference report.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support this supplemental emergency \nappropriations bill. It is far from perfect, and I have serious \nreservations about some provisions. At the same time, the legislation \nwould provide vitally important funding for our operations in Kosovo, \nas well as several other important provisions. So, on balance, I have \nconcluded that the bill deserves my support.\n  Mr. President, of the $15 billion in new spending this bill contains, \n$12 billion is to support our important mission in Kosovo, to punish \nSlobodan Milosevic for his brutal policy of ethnic cleansing, compel a \npolitical settlement, and facilitate the return of the Kosovar Albanian \nrefugees to their homeland. The tragedy in Kosovo represents a turning \npoint for NATO, European security, and American leadership in the 21st \ncentury. I am glad that Congress has shown its support for the \nPresident with the funding contained in this bill for the military \noperation and the humanitarian assistance.\n  The bill also contains funds to ensure that the International \nCriminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia can effectively investigate and \nprosecute the perpetrators of the atrocities committed in Kosovo and \nthose in Belgrade who ordered them to carry out this campaign of \nterror. They must be brought to justice.\n  I am also glad that after a long delay we have provided the necessary \nassistance for Central American countries to recover from the \ndevastation imposed last fall by Hurricanes Mitch and Georges.\n  Mr. President, this bill also contains a provision that helps family \nmembers of the victims of the terrible Pan Am 103 bombing to attend the \ntrial of the charged criminals before the Scottish court in the \nNetherlands. As you know, Mr. President, many New Jersey natives were \non that flight. These families have waited too long for justice to be \nbrought, and I am glad that they will be able to see it rendered \nfirsthand.\n  The bill also provides $100 million for Jordan, to help support its \nrole in advancing the Middle East peace process. The region stands at a \ncritical juncture after the death of King Hussein and the election of \nEhud Barak as Israeli Prime Minister. I am glad we provided this down-\npayment for Jordan. Now we must follow through on our commitment for \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority per the Wye River Memorandum the \nU.S. helped broker.\n  Mr. President, despite these positive elements, the bill before us \nhas many flaws.\n  It contains more than $6 billion in unrequested defense spending, far \nin excess of what it will take to prosecute the air war against \nMilosevic. It stretches the definition of what constitutes an \n``emergency'' to such an extent that it mocks the notion of fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  This year's concurrent resolution on the budget established five \nexplicit criteria to guide the use of the emergency designation, which \nallows funding beyond the discretionary caps. These criteria relate to \nwhether an item is (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely \nuseful or beneficial); (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not \nbuilding up over time; (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need \nrequiring immediate action; (iv) unforeseen, unpredictable, and \nunanticipated; and (v) not permanent, temporary in nature.\n  Unfortunately, it is difficult to see how some of this defense \nspending constitutes an emergency. For example, while increasing \nmilitary compensation may be a laudable goal, it hardly represents an \nemergency under these criteria.\n  I also am disturbed by the apparent disparate treatment of offsets. \nAs my colleagues know, under the Budget Act, funding for emergency \nspending does not count against the discretionary caps and therefore \ndoes not have to be offset. For some reason, however, the Majority \nfeels that offsets are necessary--but for only for the agriculture and \nhumanitarian emergencies, not the military portion. This double \nstandard defies logic. If something is an emergency, no offsets should \nbe required. If it is not an emergency, then we should not use the \nemergency designation and we should pay for it with spending \nreductions.\n  However, of all the problems with this bill, I am most disappointed \nin the provisions related to the recent multi-state tobacco settlement. \nThese provisions waive the Federal government's right to recoup its \nshare of recovered tobacco Medicaid costs without any guarantees that \nState governments will spend even a penny of these settlement funds on \ntobacco control programs.\n  Mr. President, these provisions--stuck into this large emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill--hand the tobacco industry a big \nvictory. The tobacco lobby wanted to avoid an effective, nationwide \nanti-youth smoking effort. And unfortunately, it looks like their wish \nwas granted.\n  Mr. President, some have characterized this recoupment of Federal \nMedicaid dollars as a Federal ``money grab'' of State dollars. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth.\n  It is without question that a large portion of the state settlements \nwith the tobacco industry represents a recovery of Federal funds. I \nshould know, because I have been working with the state attorneys \ngeneral on these cases since they were filed.\n  In fact, I introduced the first ``Tobacco Medicaid Waiver'' bill back \nin 1996. At that time, I was joined by Mississippi Attorney General \nMike Moore and Minnesota Attorney General Skip Humphrey at the \nintroduction of a bill that would allow States to keep part of the \nFederal share of Medicaid. At the time, there were only ten states \nsuing, and my bill was aimed at urging more States to bring claims.\n  Mr. President, back then, none of these pioneering state officials \never said that the Federal Government had no right to Medicaid \nrecoupment. It is a preposterous argument. The states sued under the \nFederal Medicaid statute--they knew that then and they know that now.\n  Mr. President, there is no question under current law that a portion \nof these settlements are Federal funds. It is also important to note \nthat the tobacco settlement signed by the States blocks the Federal \ngovernment from seeking reimbursement for Federal Medicaid costs caused \nby tobacco company misconduct in the future. So, in other words, the \nStates waived our rights too.\n  Let me be clear: I think we should ultimately give this money back to \nthe States--but we must have guarantees that a portion of this tobacco \nrecoupment will be used to reduce youth smoking, assist children and \npromote public health.\n  Mr. President, the provisions stuck into this bill are bad policy and \nprimarily benefit one party: the tobacco industry. The losers will be \nAmerica's children. Because of this provision, more young people will \nbegin to smoke. And many of them, ultimately, will die as a result.\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\n  Mr. President, that's not right. And I hope Congress will reconsider \nthis decision in the future.\n  Still, Mr. President, this conference report does contain several \nother important provisions, including funding for our operations in \nKosovo. So, while I do so with some reluctance, I will support it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from \nMississippi for managing the bill for us as we had a distinguished \nvisitor in the Appropriations Committee room.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of controversy about this bill, but I \nthink this bill represents the best of America. We have reacted to \ncrises abroad and crises in this country.\n  There are items in this bill that are not emergencies. While many \npeople are saying they should not be here because they are not \nemergencies, they are here because this is a supplemental and an \nemergency bill. It is a bill that we can all vote for in good \nconscience, and I hope there will be an overwhelming vote for this.\n  Again, I point out for the Senate that the men and women of the armed \nservices are aware of this bill. It means a great deal to them. It is a \nsymbol of our commitment to the pay raise for which we have already \ngone on record.\n  It is a symbol that we are going to step forward to modernize the \narmed services. It is a symbol that we are going to provide the money \nto assure these people when they are sent overseas, whether it is \nKosovo or in the area of Iraq or in South Korea, or in Bosnia--wherever \nit may be in those 93 countries of the world that the American service \nmen and women are now serving--we are going to stand behind them and \ngive them all the support they need not only for their safety but for \ntheir comfort.\n  The passage of this bill will mean that we can now go ahead with the \nbalance of our necessary actions in the Appropriations Committee. We \nhave 13 full bills that come forward. I hope this will be the last \nsupplemental of this year. I join the majority leader in not welcoming \nsupplemental bills. But I know there are times when it is necessary; \nand this one is necessary.\n  Anyone who looks at our involvement in the world knows that we cannot \ncalculate in advance the costs of events, such as the Kosovo operation, \nboth militarily and in regard to refugees. These were things that came \nup after we planned expenditures for 1999 in the fall of last year.\n  I urge the Members of the Senate to vote for this bill. I urge that \nwe, as quickly as possible, get it to the President so he can sign it \ntoday.\n  I yield back any time I have and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the supplemental appropriations \nconference report stands, it is currently $13.3 billion out of balance. \nOnly $2 billion of the spending in this bill is offset and my bill will \nensure that Congress follows the rules and not dip into the Social \nSecurity surplus to fund all the truly non-emergency items in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The legislation that I have introduced imposes much needed fiscal \ndiscipline. I have been working for a balanced budget since I was first \nelected to the Senate and the supplemental begins the process of \nundoing that work. Congress must not go back to the old spending \nrules--just because we have a surplus that does not mean that the \nbattle has been won. It means that we must continue to be watchful and \nensure that the surplus continues to grow.\n  Some of the items in this bill are true emergencies such as disaster \nrelief in Oklahoma, livestock assistance and Hurricane Mitch relief. \nHowever, there are many items that are not emergencies, like $48 \nmillion for a new satellite for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \nand $3.75 million for renovations to the House page dormitory. There is \n$45 million for unanticipated costs associated with the census, to an \naccountant it seems that there needs to be better cost control to \nprevent such things. There are millions of dollars in examples of items \nthat are not emergencies but have been designated as such. Many of \nthese items should have been debated in the fiscal year 2000 \nappropriations process.\n  Even while the economy is strong, I remain concerned about the debt \nthat we are in danger of passing on to our children and our \ngrandchildren. In the past, it seemed we were so tied to the immediate \ngratification we receive from spending money that we didn't see the \ndanger that looms in the not too distant future--the risk associated \nwith spending ``on credit'' with reckless abandon. We still don't \nacknowledge that danger.\n  The genesis of this bill was to pay for the current military conflict \nin Kosovo. I fully support the troops and I was prepared to vote to pay \nfor the costs of supporting our men an women in uniform, but the \nsupplemental goes far beyond what I was prepared to support. Many of \nthese items are best left to the Department of Defense authorization \nbill or the Soldier's, Sailor's and Airman's Bill of Rights, which \npassed the Senate and contained a much needed pay raise for the armed \nservices. The pay raise contained in the supplemental jumps the gun. \nThe House should have the opportunity to consider the authorizing \nlegislation before the money is appropriated.\n  Just passing a balanced budget resolution is not enough. Congress \nmust continue to be on watch for attempts to violate not just the \nletter of resolution, but the spirit through spending bills that are \nnot offset. This Legislation will ensure that the bill fits under the \nspending caps and that the surplus is protected.\n  As a body, we have been seriously debating locking up the Social \nSecurity surplus to ensure that the money will be there to honor \nAmerica' contract with our senior citizens. Now we have a bill that \ndips into the surplus to pay for a Christmas tree of items under the \nfalse pretenses of an emergency. This is exactly what the lock box was \ndesigned to prevent. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1097\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OFFSET OF EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING.\n\n       Not later than 15 days after Congress adjourns to end the \n     first session of the 106th Congress and on the same day as a \n     sequestration (if any) under sections 251 and 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall \n     cause, in the same manner prescribed for section 251 of that \n     Act, a sequestration for fiscal year 2000 of all non-exempt \n     accounts within the discretionary spending category \n     (excluding function 050 (national defense)) to achieve a \n     reduction in budget authority equal to $13,303,000,000 minus \n     the dollar amount of reimbursements identified in the report \n     required by section 2005 (efforts to increase burden-sharing) \n     of the 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Enzi's \nbill to offset all of the nonemergency funding in the supplemental with \nan across the board cut in non-defense discretionary accounts.\n  As one who vigorously opposed the omnibus appropriations bill of last \nyear which resulted in spending far above our commitments, I was \nsurprised that here we have yet another attempt to circumvent our \nbudget principles--and to spend part of the Social Security surplus \nnearly all of us pledged to devote only to Social Security.\n  While there are true emergencies in the supplemental I support, such \nas the agriculture spending and funds directly related to our Kosovo \noperation, I strongly oppose inclusion of other defense spending that \nclearly should be considered in the normal appropriations process. And \nI oppose beefing up the FEMA budget three times over the President's \nrequest as well. What all of this is about is just a gimmick to claim \nwe are not breaking the caps as we proceed into the fiscal year 2000 \nappropriations process by providing some funding now. The last estimate \nI saw indicated only $2.5 billion of this funding will be outlayed in \nthis fiscal year. So--why are we appropriating $15 billion?\n  Mr. President, I have no objection to this additional spending--if we \npay for it. Senator Enzi's legislation, which I have cosponsored does \npay for it. This is the responsible thing to do, since most of this \nbill--over $13 billion is not emergency spending.\n  Those who believe in integrity of our budget process and in the need \nto preserve Social Security will vote for this bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Enzi's bill \nto offset the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Senator Enszi's bill is consistent with my belief that we must pay \nfor this emergency supplemental bill with offsets.\n  Mr. President, under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress, the \nPresident, and the American people agreed to cap the growth of our \nGovernment's spending programs. In doing this we were able to balance \nthe budget and head down the path of fiscal responsibility. We have \nagreed under the law to these spending caps. We should not now turn our \nbacks on the commitment we made to the American people, by going back \non our word and breaking this agreement with them.\n\n  Because of this commitment to the American people, Congress must not \nbust these spending caps.\n  In that same vein, at the zenith of our success to have finally \nbalanced the Federal Government's budget for the first time in 29 \nyears, we ought not look to spend $13 billion we don't have. We can ill \nafford to use our first wave of surpluses, especially the surpluses \ngarnered from the Social Security trust fund to pay for this \nsupplemental. We can ill afford at this critical juncture to break our \npledge to our seniors over social security, not to the public over \nkeeping our budgets balanced.\n  In closing Mr. President, I believe Senator Enzi's bill, of which I \nam an original cosponsor, is right on the mark. We need to use common \nsense in budgeting in our Nation's Capitol.\n  Granted we have several emergencies confronting us, from the \ndisasters that have hit our constituents across the land, the need to \nincrease FEMA's funding to meet these needs, desperately needed funds \nfor our farmers--including my provision to the bill that will help our \nfarmers to qualify for disaster funds, up to the need to support our \ntroops in Kosovo. But--we must pay the bill. I support Senator Enzi and \nour other cosponsors, by calling for reduced spending in other federal \nprograms in order to fund these necessary emergencies. This is truly \nthe only way this Congress can justify spending money we don't have.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to make a couple \nof unanimous consent requests.\n  First, I want to commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor his work on the supplemental appropriations. It is never easy for \nhim, but it is easy for us to second-guess and be judgmental. In his \nunique way he does a magnificent job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5683-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5683-S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the procedure is that Senator Harkin would be \nentitled to the floor, but this unanimous consent agreement will take \ncare of that problem and we will be able to move forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Ashcroft-Frist amendment, No. 355, after 20 minutes of \ndebate to be equally divided in the usual form; following that vote, if \nagreed to, the Senate immediately agree to an amendment to be offered \nby Senator Harkin. I further ask that following the disposition of the \nabove two mentioned amendments, if the Ashcroft-Frist amendment is \nagreed to, the following be the only amendments remaining in order and \nunder a time agreement equally divided, and all other provisions of the \nprevious consent of May 14 still be in place.\n  The amendments are as follows: The Bond amendment regarding the film \nindustry, 30 minutes; the Biden amendment, 45 minutes, with 30 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Biden and 15 minutes under the control of \nSenator Hatch.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the above-listed \namendments, the bill be advanced to third reading and passage occur, \nall without any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot because I think we need to move quickly here, I want to thank all \nthose who are responsible for getting us to this point. This has taken \nsome cooperation on the part of both sides. I especially want to thank \nSenators Harkin, Ashcroft, Frist, Biden, Wellstone and others who have \nbeen very helpful.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, I am sorry that I did not \nhear the entire request, but the situation, as I understand it, prior \nto right now, was that after the supplemental, we were coming back to \nthe Frist-Ashcroft amendment and I was to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What does this do to that?\n  Mr. LOTT. This would obviate that and we would move forward with the \nprocedure that is outlined. We would proceed to vote on or in relation \nto the Ashcroft amendment with time equally divided for 20 minutes, and \nthen the Senate would immediately agree to the amendment offered by \nSenator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand it, what you are saying is right now we \nwould have 20 minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Right. Equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then you would vote up or down on the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment, and then there would be--then what?\n  Mr. LOTT. Then we would go directly to the agreement to accept the \nHarkin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK. I am OK with that.\n  I must be very honest with you. I have been waiting some time to be \nable to at least make my case on the floor. I have been more than \nwilling to set everything aside and to let the process go ahead since \nyesterday. But I must tell you that since yesterday I have been waiting \nto get at least 15 to 20 minutes where I could just lay out my\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\ncase on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment on IDEA, the background of it. I \njust believe I have to. I want to be able to fully make my case against \nthe amendment. I do not want to take a lot of time, I do not want to \nfilibuster it, but I would like to have 15 or 20 minutes just to lay \nout my case. That is all.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, perhaps I could amend the unanimous consent \nrequest to this effect, that we have 30 minutes on the Ashcroft and the \nHarkin amendments, with each side getting 15 minutes. The Senator would \nhave 15 minutes, Senators Ashcroft and Frist would have 15 minutes, and \nthey would split it up between themselves. I modify my request to that \neffect.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, I support \nthat request. Just for clarification purposes, Senator Biden wants to \nbe sure that the other part of the arrangement we had, which was an up-\nor-down vote on his amendment, would occur. I just would clarify that \nfor the record. I understand that to be the case.\n  Mr. LOTT. That will be the way the vote will occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the unanimous consent \nagreement is agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank all involved. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just ask the majority leader, we had one \nMember's request; Senator Kerry asked if he could have a period of \ntime--I suggest 10 minutes--prior to final passage, for him to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would it be possible he could do that after final passage? \nThe reason why, and I understand--I would like any Senator to be able \nto do that--we do have a number of Senators who would like to be able \nto leave by 6. You are talking about airplanes. You are talking about a \nson's athletic event. It is the usual thing. To admit we have these \nsorts of requests is not always easy.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Perhaps we can consult with Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. LOTT. Perhaps we will not use all the time and we could stick it \nin there, but if he would be willing to at least consider it after \nfinal passage it would help a number of his colleagues. We will work on \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 355\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now back on the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment. I am not going to proceed until we have order. I cannot even \nhear myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will the \nconversations in the aisles be taken somewhere else.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know the recent school tragedies--again, \neven another this very morning--are a call to action to us as families \nand churches and schools, as communities, as leaders in government, to \ntake positive, constructive steps to make our schools places of \nlearning and not of fear. But let's not use these tragedies of \nLittleton and other schools to take emotional, unfounded--although \nwell-intentioned-actions which actually will make our schools and \ncommunities more unsafe and less secure.\n\n  I want to make this point very, very clear. The Frist-Ashcroft \namendment is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous amendment. The Frist-\nAshcroft amendment guts IDEA. It actually will make our communities and \nour schools more unsafe.\n  The purpose of this bill is to help make our schools and communities \nsafer. That is the purpose of the bill in front of us. I must ask, is \nputting a child with a disability on the street and cutting off all \nservices to that child something that will make our communities more \nsafe? Frankly, it will have the opposite effect.\n  This amendment, would, for example, lead to a child with an emotional \ndisturbance being put on the street and end the counseling and \nbehavioral modification services they had been receiving--end, them, \ncold turkey. No more counseling or behavioral modification services. \nAnd this kid is now on the street. Tell me, is that community safer? \nObviously not, but that is just what this amendment would lead to. \nTroubled children out on the street with no supervision, no tracking, \nno education, no mental health services.\n  This amendment targets a group of students who are more likely to be \nvictims of school violence than perpetrators. Again I want to point \nout: Not any of the nine--now nine school shootings--in the last 39 \nmonths was done by a child in special education. Not one. Yet we have \nthis amendment that targets kids with disabilities. This amendment is \nscapegoating--and I use that word, ``scapegoating''--scapegoating kids \nwith disability. And it is destroying an important safety feature of \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  The supporters of the amendment say they need it because the law \nerected barriers that kept them from taking students who had guns in \ntheir possession out of schools. We showed yesterday--and the authors \nof this amendment agreed with me on this point--that a child with a \ndisability who brings a gun to a school can be removed from that school \nimmediately, just like any other child. We settled that yesterday. For \na kid with a disability who brings a gun or firearm to school, right \nnow, the principal can call up the sheriff or the police. They can come \nhaul him away, book him, put him in jail, whatever the law is.\n  So I hope no Senator votes on this amendment thinking that under the \nlaw as it exists today, a kid with a disability who comes to school \nwith a gun can't be kicked out immediately. That is simply not true. \nNothing in Federal law limits them from immediately removing him and \nkeeping him out as long as that child is a threat to himself or others. \nLet me repeat that, the school can remove that child immediately and \nkeep them in an alternative setting indefinitely as long as that child \nis a threat to himself or others. It couldn't be more clear than that.\n  We worked long and hard, 3 years of hearings, hammering out the IDEA \nbill in 1997. And we passed it here in the Senate by a vote of 98 to 1, \n98 to 1. We have had no hearings on this amendment, none whatsoever. \nBut we had plenty of hearings to set up a framework in IDEA to make \nsure our schools and communities were safe. First, we wanted to make \nsure the schools were safe. Second, we wanted to make sure the \ncommunities were safe. Third, we wanted to make sure students with \ndisabilities were held accountable for their actions and that schools \nhave the flexibility to take appropriate and timely actions. Last, we \nwanted to make sure that decisions were based on facts relevant to the \nchild, not just on emotions.\n  Right now under the law, school authorities can unilaterally remove a \nchild with a disability, first of all, for the first 10 days, and \nprovide no services whatsoever. Second, if it is found that their \nactions were not a manifestation of their disability, then of course he \nis treated in the same manner as nondisabled children, and can be kept \nout in an alternative setting forever.\n  If it is found by that the child's action was a manifestation of \ntheir disability, that child then is put into an alternative setting \nfor up to 45 days. That alternative setting is determined by the local \nschool districts.\n  Now we heard yesterday that after 45 days the kid will be put back in \nschool. That is just not so--only if he or she is no longer a danger. \nIf that kid continues to pose a danger to himself or others, the school \ncan repeat that 45 days again and again and again--for as long as it \ndeems necessary.\n  Finally, as I said, there is no way the law prohibits anyone from \ncalling the police to come take any student out who has a gun. I also \nwant to point out, IDEA specifically provides that school officials may \nobtain a court order anytime to remove a child with a disability from \nschool or to change a child's current educational placement if they \nbelieve that maintaining the child in the current educational placement \nis substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. So \nit is clear, current law addresses the issue. Frankly, we have a \ncommonsense structure now. And, again, it was carefully designed to \nmake schools and communities safer.\n  The Senator from Missouri yesterday put up a chart showing the \nmanifestation determination process, how you\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nhave to go through all these processes. Why do we do that? He made it \nseem like it was some bureaucratic maze, or jungle. The reason that we \nhave this manifestation determination is so we can address the behavior \nof the child with the disability, to determine why that child acted the \nway the child did, and then to have the proper interventions so that \nchild does not behave that way in the future. That's just common sense \nand it should not be eliminated as this amendment would do.\n  Who does that process help, and who does that protect? Does it not \nprotect the school? Does it not protect the local community? Of course, \nit does. If we can intervene and provide the proper kind of \npsychological help, maybe even medical help, educational help so that \nthe child with a disability modifies his or her behavior, it seems to \nme that is what we want.\n  Or are we saying under the Frist-Ashcroft amendment: We do not care; \nif a kid with a disability brings a gun to school, we do not care about \nthat behavior; kick him out, put him out on the street, cut off all his \nservices?\n  Is that going to make our community safer? Is that going to make our \nschools safer? Is that going to protect students? If there is a \nquestion about that in anyone's mind, I point to the fact that the \nshooting in Oregon where students were tragically killed was committed \nby a kid who had been suspended without services from school. He went \nhome, got a gun, and came back to school. I ask, what if a child in \nthat circumstance was put in an alternative setting with supervision, \nwith appropriate psychological help, behavior modification, supporting \nservices? Would that kid have gone home to get the gun and come back to \nschool? I think the odds would have been great that that kid would not. \nBut instead he was put on the street unsupervised--just as this \namendment allows for. That is the ``level playing field'' the \nsupporters of this amendment advocate.\n  Mr. President, that is why over 500 police leaders from this country \nare opposed to the Frist-Ashcroft amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from Fight \nCrime, Invest in Kids. The board of directors includes the president of \nthe Fraternal Order of Police. It encompasses 500 police leaders--many \nof them the police chiefs in major cities from around the country. It \nsays in part:\n\n       . . . we urge you to oppose the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, \n     and support the [amendment] to be offered by Senator Harkin.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      Fight Crime,\n\n\n                                               Invest in Kids,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: should we really give kids who bring firearms \n     to school more unsupervised time? Senators Frist and \n     Ashcroft's amendments to S. 254 would have precisely that \n     impact.\n       As an organization of more than 500 victims of violence, \n     sheriffs, district attorneys, police chiefs, leaders of \n     police organizations and violence prevention scholars, we \n     urge you to oppose the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, and support \n     the substitute to be offered by Senator Harkin.\n       Regardless of whether students have disabilities or not, \n     schools already can suspend or expel students who bring \n     weapons to school. Nothing in the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) prohibits schools from \n     removing immediately a child who brings a gun to school. At \n     the same time, the law recognizes sending the child home or \n     out on the street without educational services is not the \n     answer. That's why IDEA simply requires states to continue \n     education services. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment would \n     eliminate this requirement for any child who brings a gun to \n     school.\n       We should have tough sanctions for kids who bring a weapon \n     to school. The safety of other students in the school must be \n     paramount. The Frist-Ashcroft Amendment may sound tough to \n     those who think all kids love school. But giving a gun-toting \n     kid an extended vacation from school and from all \n     responsibility is soft on offenders and dangerous for \n     everyone else. Please don't give those kids who most need \n     adult supervision the unsupervised time to rob, become \n     addicted to drugs, and get their hands on other guns to \n     threaten students when the school bell rings.\n       Anti-truancy programs are often an important part of \n     successful efforts to reduce juvenile violence. The Frist-\n     Ashcroft amendment encourages mandatory truancy.\n       To minimize the threat these youngsters pose, we should \n     require continued adult supervision as well as participation \n     in mental health and behavioral modification programs, and \n     continued school attendance in an appropriate setting, to \n     learn the skills needed to make an honest living. The Harkin \n     Amendment is consistent with this approach. Otherwise \n     expulsion often becomes a graduation to a life of crime that \n     threatens the public immediately and for many years to come.\n       Please let me know if we can be of help in advising on what \n     really works to keep kids from becoming criminals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Sanford A. Newman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, these are the policemen talking. Do you \nknow why they are saying this? Because they know if Frist-Ashcroft is \nadopted, they are going to dump these kids on the streets--kids with \nproblems, emotional problems, kids with mental problems and behavioral \nproblems, kids who are mentally retarded and may have other problems. \nThey are going to dump them out on the street. That is safe? That is \ngoing to make our schools and our communities safe? Please, someone \ntell me how that is so. That is why the police are opposed to this \namendment.\n  I will read a portion of another statement:\n\n       As police chiefs in America's largest cities, we know that \n     investments today to help kids get the right start are among \n     America's most powerful weapons against crime. Quality child \n     care, parenting, coaching, and afterschool programs can help \n     kids learn the values and skills they need to become good \n     neighbors instead of criminals. We, therefore, call on all \n     our public officials to adopt the policies described in Fight \n     Crime, Invest in Kids. Help schools identify troubled and \n     disruptive children and provide children and their parents \n     with the counseling and training that can help get the kids \n     back on track.\n\n  These are not social scientists; these are policemen from around the \ncountry.\n  Let me also read from the testimony of the Police Executive Research \nForum--a leading national organization of police chiefs and senior law \nenforcement officials. Gil Kerlikowski, who at the time was president \nof this group and the police chief in Buffalo, New York testified at a \nrecent congressional hearing on this topic. He said:\n\n       Students who are expelled or suspended from school and left \n     at home or on the street become my problem, and the problem \n     of police across this country. They have greater opportunity \n     to commit crimes, abuse drugs, or engage in disorderly \n     behavior that affects the quality of life in any given \n     neighborhood. They are also vulnerable to gangs and predators \n     who can victimize and exploit them in ways that will impede \n     any later efforts to put them on the right track. Today's \n     police forces are ill-prepared to deal with these \n     individuals--the rest of the criminal justice system even \n     less so.\n\n  I also have a letter from the Correctional Educational Association \nagain stating that the Frist-Ashcroft amendment is more dangerous to \nour schools and our communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           Correctional Education Association,\n\n                                         Lanham, MD, May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist. On behalf of the teachers who labor in \n     the nation's prisons, jails and juvenile facilities, let me \n     implore you to withdraw your amendment and support the Harkin \n     amendment to S. 254. There are enough provisions in the \n     current IDEA to deal with problems related to violent \n     behaviors, such as carrying or threatening to carry weapons \n     into the school environment. In fact, your bill offers no \n     remedy, whatsoever, for changing the behavior which it seeks \n     to punish. It removes the procedural safeguards designed to \n     assist the offending child to find the necessary help he or \n     she needs. Finally, it punishes the child for his or her \n     disability, not for the offending behavior. It is akin to \n     taking medicine from a sick person because he or she has an \n     obnoxious personality.\n       One of the strengths of IDEA is the procedure for dealing \n     with behavior problems. Carrying a weapon to school is a \n     terrible behavior problem needing immediate action by the \n     whole school community. Dismissal from school services denies \n     a solution to the problem. Why not require the IDEA procedure \n     for any student with a behavior problem, whether or not the \n     student is in special education or not? We need strong \n     procedure to deal with potential and real violence. Doing \n     nothing solves nothing.\n       Those of us in criminal justice realize that providing \n     special education students with appropriate instructional \n     services is one of the keys to change their negative \n     behaviors. Punishing a student without positive and \n     appropriate assistance changes nothing. In\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\n     fact, it just makes things worse. In attempting to help avoid \n     future tragic situations like Littleton, we must be careful \n     to find ways to locate, calm and help potentially violent \n     kids change. Please rescind your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Stephen J. Steurer,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a letter from the Council for \nExceptional Children saying:\n\n       While we . . . strongly support the removal of a student \n     who endangers the safety or well-being of themselves or other \n     students, we strongly oppose the cessation of services for \n     any student.\n\n  The Frist-Ashcroft amendment ceases those services. What they say is \nthat the school districts may provide the services--may. We already \nheard one Senator yesterday say how much this costs. It may cost too \nmuch, and schools will say: It costs too much money; we are not going \nto do it; let somebody else provide the services. And the kid falls \nthrough the cracks. That is what happens.\n  If you do not think the police know what they are talking about or \nthe Council for Exceptional Children or the Correctional Education \nAssociation, how about the Parent Teacher Association? Do you honestly \nbelieve that the National PTA wants more dangerous schools? Here is a \nletter from the National PTA strongly--strongly--opposing the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment:\n\n       The National PTA supports Sens. Ashcroft's and Frist's goal \n     of keeping children safe in school. Their amendment, however, \n     would allow for the expulsion of special education students \n     who possess a handgun in school, without ensuring alternative \n     education services are provided. National PTA supports \n     removing students who bring guns to school, but believes \n     students should receive education services in an alternative \n     setting.\n       National PTA supports Senator Harkin's amendment, which \n     clarifies that schools have the authority to remove any child \n     who brings a gun to school [and continues to provide them \n     services].\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the National PTA letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 National PTA,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, May 17, 1999.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: National PTA opposes amending the Individuals \n     with Disability Education Act (IDEA) as proposed by Sens. \n     Ashcroft and Frist. The amendment will be offered to S. 254, \n     the juvenile justice bill currently being debated in the \n     Senate. National PTA asks that you vote NO on Ashcroft/Frist \n     amendment and vote YES to support an alternative amendment \n     sponsored by Senator Harkin.\n       The National PTA supports Sens. Ashcroft's and Frist's goal \n     of keeping children safe in school. Their amendment, would \n     allow for the expulsion of special education students who \n     possess a handgun on school, without ensuring alternative \n     education services are provided. National PTA supports \n     removing students who bring guns to school, but believes \n     students should receive education services in an alternative \n     setting.\n       National PTA supports Senator Harkin's amendment, which \n     clarifies that schools have the authority to remove any child \n     who brings a gun to school. The amendment also states that \n     all students should be provided education services in an \n     alternative setting. Further, students would receive \n     immediate and appropriate intervention services, and thereby \n     minimize the possibility of future violations by the student.\n       The National PTA asks that you oppose the Ashcroft/Frist \n     amendment and vote for the Harkin alternative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Shirley Igo,\n                                   Vice President for Legislation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a number of other organizations \nwhose letters in opposition to this amendment I want to print in the \nRecord: the United Cerebral Palsy Association, Learning Disabilities \nAssociation of America, the ARC of the United States, the American \nAssociation of Mental Retardation, the Easter Seals of Missouri, the \nEaster Seals of Tennessee, and a number of others. I ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   The Council for\n\n\n                                         Exceptional Children,\n\n                                          Reston VA, May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ascroft,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft, On behalf of all students in special \n     education and general education, we ask you to withdraw your \n     amendment to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     Amendments of 1997 (IDEA 1997). Amendment No. 348 would \n     seriously jeopardize the integrity of this historic piece of \n     legislation.\n       While we at the Council for Exceptional Children strongly \n     support the removal of a student who endangers the safety or \n     well-being of themselves or other students, we strongly \n     oppose the cessation of services for any student. Past \n     incidents, such as the tragic story of Kip Kinkle from \n     Springfield, Oregon, prove that when a student is immediately \n     suspended without any type of service, further tragedy is \n     imminent.\n       The final IDEA regulations, released March 12, 1999, offer \n     schools substantial opportunities and strategies for \n     addressing problem behavior of students with disabilities \n     including behavior that is dangerous or involves drugs or \n     weapons. When it is stated that children with disabilities \n     cannot be disciplined, that is absolutely not the case. The \n     statute and the regulations clearly state that when the \n     behavior is not a manifestation of their disability, those \n     children can be disciplined in the same manner as children \n     without disabilities. Furthermore, the statute and \n     regulations state that a child who commits an offense \n     involving drugs or weapons that is a manifestation of their \n     disability, the child can be removed from the classroom and/\n     or building for up to 45 days. There is nothing in the \n     statute or regulations that prohibit another 45 day removal \n     if that is appropriate. The only difference is that child \n     will receive educational services.\n       This amendment will not result in safer schools or \n     communities. In fact, every major law enforcement agency \n     reports that expelling or suspending troubled children \n     without education services only increases juvenile crime. \n     Drop out rates, incarceration rates and drug use rates also \n     increase when children are expelled or suspended without \n     education services.\n       On the other hand, we support Senator Harkin's amendment to \n     the juvenile justice legislation which is presently being \n     debated. The Harkin amendment, not an amendment to IDEA, \n     clarifies that schools can and should remove children who \n     bring guns to school and that schools should provide them \n     with immediate appropriate intervention and services, \n     including mental health services in order to maximize the \n     likelihood that such child does not engage in such behavior \n     or such behavior does not reoccur. The Harkin Amendment also \n     reaffirms that nothing prohibits a school from reporting a \n     crime to appropriate authorities.\n       Please reconsider your amendment and the negative effect it \n     will have to the carefully constructed IDEA Amendments of \n     1997. We need to implement IDEA, not amend it. Your amendment \n     will seriously undermine the benefits and protections of \n     IDEA. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                B. Joseph Ballard,\n     Associate Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Missouri Planning Council\n\n\n                               for Developmental Disabilities,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     Russell Senate Office Building\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: On behalf of the Missouri Planning \n     Council for Developmental Disabilities, I am writing this \n     letter to support the Harkin Amendment to the Juvenile \n     Justice Bill. We believe this bill will result in safer \n     schools since it clarifies the schools' roles in removing \n     children who bring guns to school. We also support the \n     provision of intervention and services, including mental \n     health services, to reduce the possibility of such behaviors \n     reoccurring.\n       We have supported IDEA, formerly the Education for All \n     Handicapped Children's Act of 1975, since it was introduced \n     and believe that because of this strong legislation many \n     children are now receiving the education to which they are \n     entitled. Because of this we cannot support legislation that \n     would weaken this most important special education law.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment. Please \n     call our office if you have questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Don Jackson,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Easter Seals,\n\n                                                     May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: On behalf of Easter Seals Missouri, \n     I write to you today to inform you of our opposition to your \n     legislation, the School Safety Act.\n       While proposed as a solution to the rising problem of \n     violence in our schools, this legislation will only \n     contribute to juvenile crime in our communities. Simply \n     removing a child from school does little to address long-term \n     behavioral problems. In fact, suspensions and expulsions \n     without education services only transfer the problem from the \n     school setting to the community setting.\n       Parents of children with disabilities want safe schools. \n     They know that their children are too often the victims of \n     inappropriate conduct. Under the 1997 amendments to the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, any truly \n     dangerous child can and should be readily removed by school \n     authorities. Moreover, the 1997 amendments add numerous\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\n     new discipline provisions that strengthen the ability of \n     school personnel to maintain a safe and orderly environment, \n     conducive to learning.\n       Easter Seals Missouri urges you to withdraw the Safe \n     Schools Act. Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Patricia Jones,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    State Boards of Education,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 19, 1999.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of State Boards of \n     Education (NASBE) is a private nonprofit association \n     representing state and territorial boards of education. Our \n     principal objectives are to strengthen state leadership in \n     education policymaking, promote excellence in the education \n     of all students, advocate equality of access to educational \n     opportunity, and assure responsible governance of public \n     education.\n       NASBE would like to express its opposition to an amendment \n     proposed by Senators Ashcroft and Frist that will \n     significantly alter the discipline provisions within the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which \n     will be considered by the Senate during debate on the \n     Juvenile Justice bill S. 254 this morning. Currently, \n     students with disabilities who bring a weapon to school can \n     be shifted to an alternative setting for up to 45 days. The \n     Ashcroft/Frist amendment would change this policy so that \n     students with disabilities could be expelled for an entire \n     year. While we certainly support strict disciplinary measures \n     for all students, we must oppose this proposal on the \n     following grounds:\n       Cessation of educational services, particularly to those \n     most in need of intervention, is not an appropriate response. \n     Simply removing the offending student from school merely \n     shifts the problem to the neighborhood and streets \n     surrounding the school.\n       A weapons offense is best handled by law enforcement and \n     the judicial system. The current IDEA law does not preclude \n     school personnel from referring student violations to the \n     police where state and local laws would apply.\n       The amendment undermines the comprehensive compromise \n     reached on IDEA in 1997, of which the current disciplinary \n     policies were a major consideration. During the final Senate \n     vote on IDEA, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott warned that \n     any attempt to modify the legislation would cause the \n     agreement to collapse. Changes made now would only encourage \n     others to attempt to revise other sections of the carefully \n     crafted IDEA law in the future.\n       Again, we urge you to oppose changing the IDEA disciplinary \n     provisions under the Ashcroft/Frist amendment to the Juvenile \n     Justice bill. If you have any questions, please have your \n     staff contact David Griffith, Director of Governmental \n     Affairs, at 703/684-4000, ext. 107. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Brenda Lilienthal Welburn,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      The Arc,\n\n                                      Arlington, TX, May 20, 1999.\n     Anne L. Bryant,\n     Executive Director, National School Boards Association, \n         Alexandria, VA.\n       Dear Ms. Bryant: The Arc of the United States is very \n     concerned with your May 17 letter to Members of the U.S. \n     Senate, in which you state that the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (P.L. 105-17) prevents schools \n     from removing students who bring firearms to school. This \n     statement is totally incorrect and very misleading. The \n     newly-reauthorized I.D.E.A. allows school authorities to \n     immediately remove all children, including children with \n     disabilities, from the school setting for any violation of \n     school discipline codes for up to ten days. In cases when a \n     child has brought a weapon to school or school function, \n     school authorities can unilaterally remove a child with a \n     disability from the child's regular placement for up to 45 \n     days at a time. In addition, if school officials believe that \n     it would be dangerous to return the child after the 45 day \n     period, they can ask an impartial hearing officer to order \n     that the child remain in the interim alternative setting for \n     an additional 45 days and can request subsequent extensions.\n       It is incomprehensible to The Arc why the National School \n     Boards Association would want to mislead the Senate about \n     this important civil rights law. As a result of these \n     misperceptions, the Senate is considering an amendment to \n     I.D.E.A. that would make communities more dangerous, not \n     safer. The Frist/Ashcroft Amendment currently being debated \n     as part of the Juvenile Justice legislation (S. 254) would \n     allow schools to cease educational services to children with \n     disabilities. Every major law enforcement agency reports that \n     expelling or suspending troubled children without educational \n     services only increases juvenile crime. Drop out rates, \n     incarceration rates and drug use rates also increase when \n     children are expelled or suspended without educational \n     services.\n       The current I.D.E.A. law and the final regulations, just \n     released by the Department of Education in March of this \n     year, already provide adequate protections to schools. The \n     new law, which your organization agreed to, should be given a \n     chance to work. I.D.E.A. has provided millions of students \n     with disabilities the opportunity for a free and appropriate \n     public education enabling them to become independent and \n     productive citizens. The Arc is extremely disturbed that your \n     organization would use children with disabilities as the \n     scapegoat for recent school shootings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Brenda Doss,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n        National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives,\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the National Organization \n     of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), this letter is \n     to support your substitute amendment to S. 254. NOBLE \n     represents more than 3000 minority law enforcement managers, \n     executives, and practitioners at the local, state and federal \n     levels. We believe that students who are suspended from \n     school for carrying weapons must be placed in a supervised \n     alternative to school and be required to participate in an \n     appropriate mental health and behavioral modification \n     program. Suspending these students from school and putting \n     them out onto the streets would only serve to magnify the \n     crime problem that currently exists. Your efforts to ensure \n     that this does not happen are strongly supported by NOBLE.\n       Our organization urges you to continue your efforts to \n     ensure that your substitute amendment is incorporated into S. \n     254.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert L. Stewart,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   The Secretary of Education,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to an amendment that Senator Frist has offered to \n     S. 254, the juvenile crime bill that the Senate is now \n     considering. This amendment, which is similar to S. 969, \n     Senator Ashcroft's bill to which I expressed my opposition \n     last week, would allow school personnel to suspend or expel \n     children with disabilities from their schools for unlimited \n     periods of time, without any educational services, including \n     behavioral intervention services, and without the impartial \n     hearing now required by the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA), for carrying or possessing a gun or \n     other firearm to, or at, a school function.\n       The Congress need not address the particular issue that is \n     the subject of the Frist amendment, because it amended the \n     IDEA just two years ago to give school officials new tools to \n     address the precise issue of children with disabilities \n     bringing weapons to school or otherwise threatening teachers \n     and other students. For example, school officials may remove, \n     for up to 45 days, a child with a disability who takes a \n     weapon to school, and may request a hearing officer to \n     similarly remove a child who is substantially likely to \n     injure himself or others, if the child's parents object to a \n     change in the child's placement. Furthermore, the IDEA allows \n     hearing officers to keep these students out of the regular \n     educational environment beyond 45 days if they continue to \n     pose a threat to the rest of the student body. I am convinced \n     that these new tools will be effective if given a chance to \n     work.\n       I am firmly committed to ensuring that all our schools are \n     safe and disciplined environments where all our children, \n     including children with disabilities, can learn without fear \n     of violence. But we should not let the tragic school \n     shootings in Littleton, Colorado, and other communities lead \n     us to responses, such as the Frist amendment, that will harm \n     children with disabilities.\n       First, the Frist amendment would deny vital educational \n     services to children with disabilities who are removed from \n     school, including behavioral interventions that are designed \n     to prevent dangerous behavior from recurring. Continued \n     provision of educational services, including these behavioral \n     interventions, offers the best chance for improving the long-\n     term prospects for these children. Discontinuing educational \n     services is the wrong decision in the short run and, in the \n     long run, will result in significant costs in terms of \n     increased crime, dependency on public assistance, \n     unemployment, and alienation from society. We cannot afford \n     to throw away a single child.\n       Second, the Frist amendment would undo vital protections in \n     the IDEA that were included to protect children with \n     disabilities from widespread abuses of their civil rights. \n     Under this amendment, for example, the IDEA would no longer \n     require schools to determine, when suspending or expelling a \n     child with a disability, whether the behavior of the child in \n     carrying or possessing a firearm is related to the child's \n     disability. Such a determination, which can currently be made \n     while the child has been removed from school, is needed to \n     ensure that children are not unjustly denied educational \n     services during their removal without considering the effects \n     of the child's disability on their behavior. The \n     manifestation determination required by the IDEA is an \n     important tool schools use to appropriately understand the \n     relationship between a child's behavior and their disability \n     in order to best implement behavior intervention strategies.\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\n       We should be making every effort to appropriately reach out \n     to our children and help prevent them from endangering \n     themselves and others. It is equally important that we \n     appropriately address the needs of children who have gone \n     astray, violated the rules, and put others at risk. The \n     exclusion of children with disabilities from school--without \n     the impartial due-process hearing and the continued services \n     that the IDEA now requires--is the wrong response.\n       I urge you to vote against the Frist amendment.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Richard W. Riley.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Tennessee, Department of Mental Health and \n           Mental Retardation, Developmental Disabilities Council,\n                                      Nashville, TN, May 17, 1999.\n     Senator Bill Frist,\n     Dirksen Building\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The recent path of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has been an arduous one, as \n     you well know. We at the Tennessee Developmental Disabilities \n     Council and many others, especially parents of students with \n     disabilities and the students themselves, remember your \n     outstanding efforts to achieve a fair compromise around \n     complex issues during the recent IDEA reauthorization \n     process. Because of your interest and attention, IDEA still \n     ensures children with disabilities access to a free \n     appropriate public education.\n       The procedural safeguards contained in IDEA are critical in \n     protecting the right of children with disabilities to receive \n     a free appropriate public education. Therefore, we are \n     distressed about your recent effort to amend IDEA concerning \n     the suspension or expulsion of students with disabilities who \n     carries or possesses a gun or firearm to or at a school, on \n     school premises, or to or at a school function. This is not \n     to say that we believe that any student who carries or \n     possesses a gun or firearm should not be disciplined. Just as \n     the positive principles of the IDEA should work for all \n     students as schools are encouraged to include students with \n     disabilities in regular classrooms and to afford them every \n     opportunity for education, so should such egregious behavior \n     by any student have consequences.\n       However, we do not believe that the consequences enumerated \n     by your amendment to IDEA will have the desired outcome. They \n     will not result in safer schools or communities. In fact, \n     every major law enforcement agency reports that expelling or \n     suspending troubled children without education services only \n     increases juvenile crime. Drop out rates, incarceration rates \n     and drug use rates also increase when children are expelled \n     or suspended without educational services.\n       We believe that a better approach, for all students, is \n     articulated in Senator Harkin's amendment to the juvenile \n     justice bill. It will assist schools to maintain safe \n     environments conducive to learning. It clarifies that schools \n     can and should remove children who bring guns to school and \n     that schools should provide them with immediate appropriate \n     intervention and services including mental health services to \n     maximize the likelihood that such child does not engage in \n     such behavior or such behavior does not reoccur. The Harkin \n     amendment also reaffirms that nothing prohibits a school from \n     reporting a crime to appropriate authorities.\n       Senator Harkin's amendment seems very consistent with the \n     aim of IDEA and with the very compromise that you worked so \n     hard to achieve in 1997. Therefore, we ask that you support \n     Senator Harkin's amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lana Kile,\n       Chair.\n     Wanda Willis,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                        On Mental Retardation,\n\n     To: Senator Thomas Harkin.\n     From: M. Doreen Croser, Executive Director.\n     Re: Opposition to IDEA Amendments.\n     Date: May 17, 1999.\n       Thank you for all your hard work to maintain the integrity \n     of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). \n     Your efforts are greatly appreciated by the members of the \n     American Association on Mental Retardation!\n       We also want you to know that we oppose the Ashcroft/Frist \n     Amendment because we do not believe it will result in safer \n     schools or communities. Drop out rates, crime, incarceration \n     and drug use increases when children are expelled or \n     suspended from school without education services. Clearly, \n     such suspensions or expulsions are not in our society's best \n     interest.\n       Your proposed amendment to the juvenile justice legislation \n     rather than to IDEA seems to be a sensible approach and we \n     support it.\n       Please share our support with your colleagues and, again, \n     thank you for all work on behalf of children with \n     disabilities.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Learning Disabilities\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                     Pittsburgh, PA, May 17, 1999.\n       Dear Senator: As President of LOA, the Learning \n     Disabilities Association of America, a national non-profit \n     volunteer organization dedicated to a world in which all \n     individuals with learning disabilities thrive and participate \n     fully in society, I ask you on behalf of all children with \n     disabilities to:\n       Oppose the Ashcroft/Frist Amendment to the Mental Health \n     Juvenile Justice Act (S254) now being debated on the Senate \n     floor. This amendment, which would allow local schools to \n     deny educational services, including special education, to a \n     child with a disability who carries to or possesses a gun or \n     firearm in school or a school function, would not reduce \n     violence in schools and society. Testimony of law enforcement \n     agencies during the IDEA reauthorization process pointed out \n     that expelling or suspending troubled children without \n     educational services results in increased juvenile crime in \n     the short term and increased drop out rates, incarceration \n     rates, and drug use in the long term.\n       Support the Harkin Amendment to the Mental Health Juvenile \n     Justice Act (S254) which clarifies that, under IDEA 97, \n     school can and should remove students with disabilities who \n     bring guns to school. Moreover after being in an alternative \n     educational placement for up to 45 days, the IEP team may \n     decide to move the child to a placement other than the school \n     in which the infraction occurred. The Harkin Amendment also \n     reaffirms that nothing in IDEA prohibits a school from \n     reporting a crime to appropriate authorities.\n       I would like to point out that none of the children \n     responsible for the eight school tragedies in the past two \n     years was a special education student being served under \n     IDEA. However, it is also apparent that appropriate mental \n     health interventions might have prevented some of these \n     tragedies.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harry Sylvester,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 7 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have used up 14 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  This will be the last few minutes that I have to speak on the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment and, thus, I want to, for the sake of my colleagues \nand others who are listening, explain what the amendment is about.\n  This amendment is very simple. It is about two things: No. 1, the \nsafety of all students; and No. 2, equal treatment of children.\n  I have a letter from the National School Boards Association. As most \npeople know, it represents 95,000 local school board members.\n  I will read from the first paragraph of the letter:\n\n       On behalf of the Nation's 95,000 local school board \n     members, the National School Boards Association urges you to \n     support the Frist-Ashcroft amendment to S. 254 that would \n     enhance the safety of all students from gun violence. The \n     amendment provides school officials with the discretion to \n     suspend or expel students covered by the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act in the same manner as other \n     students in cases where they bring firearms to school.\n\n  My colleagues, this amendment is about the safety of all students and \nthe equal treatment of children.\n  Yesterday, we had a very good debate, I thought, on the substance of \nthe amendment. I gave my remarks yesterday, and I wish to also refer \ntoday to some statistics that I obtained not too long ago from my own \ncounty, Davidson County.\n  For the 1997-1998 school year there were eight children in my home \ncounty who brought either a gun or a bomb to school, eight in that 1 \nyear. Of those eight, six were special education students. What \nhappened? The two who were not special education students, because of \nthe zero tolerance policy in Tennessee, were expelled. They were out \nfor the remainder of the year.\n  Of the six special education students, three were back in class. \nThese are individuals who brought a bomb or a gun into the classroom \nalready.\n  Three of them were kept out of school. Why? Because their disability \nand bringing a gun to school were unrelated. But three of the eight had \nthis manifestation process, and because of the disability, they were \ntreated in a special way and allowed back into the classroom.\n  Yesterday I was caught a little off guard, and I do not like that, I \nreally do not like that. And I do not think the\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\nSenator from Iowa meant to say what he said. But he said those \nstatistics don't count. And then I said, well, let's look at 1999, He \nsaid, no those statistics don't count. And I said Why? And he said \nbasically because the regulations just came out and we fixed that \nloophole.\n  That bothered me, so what I did was go back and call to see really \nwhen this law took place, the law that is operating today. I found \nsomething very different, exactly the opposite of what the Senator from \nIowa told all of his colleagues. And I want to straighten that out for \nthe Record. It is very, very important.\n  The Senator from Iowa argued yesterday that the statistics where \nindividuals with disabilities ended up back in the classroom within 45 \ndays of having brought a gun to the schoolroom don't apply and that \nloophole had been fixed. I found something very, very different.\n  In fact, the IDEA amendments of 1997 were signed into law on June 4, \n1997. The Senator from Iowa and I were both there. It was a good day. \nWe were both there. Yes, the regulations were written. And it really \ntook too long, they just came out a few months ago. The implication \nyesterday by the Senator from Iowa was that they were written only \nrecently and, therefore, so they could not apply.\n  In looking a little closer, the IDEA amendments were signed into law \non June 4, 1997. And on June 4, 1997, section 615, the discipline \nprovisions, went into effect that day. So every statistic that I have \ngiven for the last 2 years shows repetitively individuals with \ndisabilities, because of this special treatment, it is not their fault, \nit is the fault of the law that they are ending up back in the \nclassroom. These are individuals who brought a gun or a bomb to school.\n  Again, I was very disappointed, because again and again he said on \nthe floor yesterday and I went back to the Record again last night and \nfound that the Senator from Iowa said: ``I say to the Senator from \nTennessee, that the school he is talking about was still operating \nunder the old system.''\n  Not true. Not true. We talked to the director of high schools for \nNashville, Davidson County, and the director stated very specifically \nthat every school in the Davidson County was operating under the IDEA \namendments of 1997 under advisement of their lawyers. In fact, let me \nread from the bill that we signed last year. The 1997-1998 school year \napplied on June 4.\n  This is from the bill that we signed on a great day, on June 4, 1997. \nIt says: ``Effective dates, these shall take effect upon enactment of \nthis act,'' on that day in June 1997.\n  So all the statistics of eight individuals were relevant. Two were \nexpelled because they did not have a disability and of the six who had \na disability, three were back in the classroom within 45 days. That is \nthe loophole. Why am I concerned? Just because somebody has not been \nkilled yet because of this loophole, I am not going to wait around \nuntil somebody has been killed. I want to prevent that from happening. \nThis amendment is about the safety of all students and to have all \nstudents treated fairly.\n  The amendment closes the loophole that I just pointed out. I have \ndemonstrated factually it is occurring in this legislation. So I want \nto dismiss all of the arguments the Senator from Iowa made yesterday \nwhen he said it is not a problem.\n  This amendment will, in its ultimate passage, end the mixed message \nthat the Federal Government, that we in this body, send to American \nstudents on the issue of guns in school.\n  Under IDEA, a student with a disability who is in possession of a \nfirearm at school is treated differently from anybody else. Our \namendment says very simply that if you bring a gun or a firearm to the \nschool, you, as a student, are going to be treated the same, and you \nare going to be treated by the local principal or other authorities in \nthe school.\n  Our amendment allows principals or other qualified school personnel \nthe flexibility to treat every student who brings a gun or a firearm or \na bomb into the classroom the very same.\n  Our amendment does not enforce any sort of uniform policy. We might \nlike to think that we in Washington can set good school policy, but \nthis shows how dangerous that can be by trying to set a uniform policy \nhere for some subset of students.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has used 8 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the amendment is a simple amendment: Equal \ntreatment for each and every student who brings a firearm, a gun or \nbomb, to school. It is an amendment which will have an impact, I \nbelieve, help individuals in terms of safety in our schools.\n  The amendment closes a loophole, a loophole that I have definitively \ndemonstrated does occur in our schools. If a student brings a gun to \nschool, they, if our amendment is agreed to, will be treated the same \nregardless of their educational status.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 18 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this issue. \nI began to be concerned about students carrying guns in and out of our \nschools quite some time ago. On the Ed-Flex bill, which passed this \nSenate just a couple months ago, I put an amendment to close another \nloophole which would allow students who possessed guns in school--not \njust carried guns to school--to be removed from the school environment.\n  This responsibility for us to close these loopholes is a serious one. \nIt is a responsibility that relates to school safety. That is what we \nare talking about here. School safety is a responsibility that we can \nwork hard on, and I am glad Senator Frist of Tennessee and I have been \nable to join on this amendment.\n  It should not have taken this long. This is a simple amendment. This \namendment merely allows local schools to treat all children who bring \nguns to school in the same manner. It does not target children with \ndisabilities--simply not so. It protects children with disabilities. \nThis is not a matter of scapegoating. This does not say that any group \nof students is subject to more severe punishments than any other group \nof students.\n  This is a bill that provides for equity, simply saying that \nprincipals and superintendents should have the power, without \ninterference from the Federal Government, to remove students from \nschool who come to school with a firearm, an explosive or a gun. I \nbelieve we need to make sure we close the loophole in the Federal law \nthat made it very difficult to discipline certain students who came in \nthat setting.\n  There are those who say: Well, the law is this way and the law is \nthat way. And they will argue about how the law is applied here in the \nSenate Chamber. We have a lot of experience from around the country \nabout how the law is applied in the schools. The Senator from Tennessee \nhas eloquently spoken to the fact that as applied in the schools, you \nfrequently find that individuals who, if they were not the subject of \nan individualized education program, would be gone for a year because \nof a mandated expulsion, are back in the classroom within 45 days, in \nspite of the fact that they brought a gun or a bomb to school.\n\n  It is simply our intention to let local school boards and school \nofficials decide how they should be able to make the school a safe \nplace and not to reinsert a student in the school environment who has \nthreatened the safety and security of the school by bringing a bomb or \na gun to school. We must have zero tolerance for guns in school. I \nthink we must let school officials decide on discipline policies.\n  We should not have taken this long on this amendment, but I am glad \nthat we are at this point.\n  After we vote on this amendment, there is a consent decree which is \ngoing to allow the Harkin amendment to be voted on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of the \nremaining 3 and ask to be notified.\n  The Harkin amendment makes the current law even worse by imposing a \nnew requirement upon schools that they couldn't remove any child for \nbringing a gun to school unless they provide special services to the \nchild. I will oppose this amendment.\n  When you tell people that you will make them special for bringing a \ngun to school, I think you do a great disservice. You are not making \nvictims out of people by pulling them out of school. You are not making \nthem unsafe. If you tell them clearly that if they bring a gun to \nschool that they are not going to be allowed to stay in school, you \nwill make them safer, and you will make the school safer.\n  This is a school safety issue. It is an issue that requires our \nattention. The simple fact of the matter is, the current law, as \napplied and as implemented, is a real impediment to school safety.\n  There will be arguments that we have yet to have a student shoot \nsomeone under these circumstances. I can tell you that we have come \nvery close. I talked to one school superintendent in my State who had \nsuch a student threaten seven other students in the classroom, to kill \nthem. When the student finally shot one of the other students, it \nwasn't in the classroom. It was off the school premises so that it \nreally didn't qualify under IDEA. But we don't have to wait until there \nis blood on the blackboard or on the floor of the classroom in order to \ntake steps to make sure we don't have guns in the classroom.\n  The truth of the matter is, we should simply and clearly make it \npossible on an equal footing to say that no matter who the student is, \nthere are no excuses, there are no special exceptions; if you bring a \ngun to school, the local school authority should have the opportunity \nto take that student and to remove that student without regard to other \nstatus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 4 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  There is no loophole here. The equity they keep talking about is an \nequity for danger. We keep hearing they are for safety in schools. We \nall are for safety, of course.\n  Why is the National PTA opposed to this amendment? Why are 500 police \nleaders around the country opposed to this amendment? Why is the \nNational Association of the State Boards of Education opposed to this \namendment? Because they all know that the amendment we are about to \nvote on is a recipe for disaster.\n  It will increase crime. It will increase drug use. It will increase \nthe dropout rate. Why? I am really disappointed that anyone would say \nthat we can take these kids who have severe problems, kick them out of \nschool and cut off all supporting services and make communities safer. \nThe police chiefs who have to deal with the aftermath know better. That \nis why they are opposed to this amendment. We know more than they do, \nand the Parent Teacher Association? Why are they opposed to the \nAshcroft-Frist amendment? Because they realize it is a formula for \ndisaster. That is what it is.\n  This is a dangerous, dangerous amendment and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. President, after the vote on this amendment--by unanimous \nconsent--the Senate will adopt the Harkin amendment. This is an \namendment I have drafted and is cosponsored by the distinguished \nranking member of the HELP committee, Senator Kennedy. Our amendment is \nsupported by the police and other groups who oppose the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment because it would make schools and communities safer. I'd like \nto say a few words about it and its intent.\n  Passage of our amendment is very important. It is very important, \nbecause it requires that all children--whether they have a disability \nor not--are not just dumped in the streets after they commit an act of \nviolence, including bringing a gun or firearm to school. Our amendment \nwould require that schools provide immediate and appropriate \nsupervision, tracking, educational, behavioral, health and related \nservices to these children in order to reduce the likelihood that the \nchild will repeat their anti-social and dangerous behavior. The \ninterventions would be tailored to the individual child. This is \nabsolutely critical and is demonstrated to actually make a difference. \nIt will save lives and money in the long run. It makes common sense.\n  The Harkin amendment also authorizes the funds necessary to assist \nour schools in providing this critical intervention.\n  So passage of the Harkin-Kennedy amendment--which will occur by voice \nvote after this roll call vote on the Frist-Ashcroft amendment--is a \nvery important amendment. Its adoption puts the Senate on record as \nsupporting the recommendations and pleas of the police, parents and \nteachers.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment pertaining to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA. I respect my colleagues' intentions. They want to \nmake schools safer. Their amendment would not make schools safer, nor \nthe sidewalks leading to the schools, nor their communities.\n  Their amendment would allow a child with a disability caught with a \ngun or a firearm, whether he knew what he was doing or not, to be \nsuspended or expelled without educational services.\n  If a child with a disability--if any child for that matter--is \nsuspended or expelled for having a gun or firearm in school and \nsubsequently not provided with educational services and adult \nsupervision--Would schools be safer? Would communities be safer? Given \nwhat happened outside of Atlanta today, we must shift the debate. \nYesterday, our colleagues from Tennessee, Missouri, and Iowa debated \nif, and for how long, a child with a disability could be removed from \nhis school if he brought a firearm to school. I think they agreed that \nunder IDEA and under the Frist-Ashcroft amendment a child with a \ndisability could be removed from his school.\n  The crux of the remaining disagreement was services--why a child with \na disability who brings a gun to school should get services, while his \npeer without a disability in the same situation, would not get \nservices. We don't solve anything by kicking any child out of school \nwithout educational services.\n  There are two letters of opposition to the Frist-Ashcroft on your \ndesk. One is from the National Association of State Boards of Education \nand one from the National Parent Teacher Association. They make that \nsimple point very well.\n  Ask yourself this question--If you could prevent a child from \ncommitting a violent act for the first time or a second time, by \nproviding appropriate services, what would you do? The answer is \nobvious. You would provide the services--to make your school safe, to \nmake your community safe, but most importantly, to save the child.\n  In the rare instances when it occurs, IDEA provides schools with the \ntools to control and prevent gun and firearm use by children with \ndisabilities. IDEA recognizes and promotes school safety. IDEA \nrecognizes and promotes teaching consequences for wrongful behavior. \nIDEA recognizes and promotes adult supervision of, engagement with, and \nresponsibility for children who break school rules or criminal laws.\n  I would like to review some key facts about IDEA. IDEA permits school \nofficials to immediately suspend a child with a disability with a gun \nor firearm for 10 days without educational services. During that time, \na manifestation determination review must be conducted. First, to \ndetermine if the child with a disability understood the impact and \nconsequences of having a gun or firearm. Second, to determine if the \nchild's disability did or did not impair the child's ability to control \nhis behavior.\n  In effect, if the child knew what he was doing, the law allows the \nchild to be disciplined in the same manner as other children caught \nwith guns or firearms. One distinction applies. This child with a \ndisability, perhaps unlike his peers, would continue to receive \neducational services. However, school\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\nofficials have total discretion over the details associated with \nproviding these educational services.\n  If a manifestation determination review establishes that the child \ndid not know what he was doing, the child could still be removed from \nhis classroom and school and placed in an interim alternative \neducational setting for 45 days. After 45 days, if the child continued \nto be dangerous, the child's placement in the interim alternative \neducational setting could be extended with the concurrence of a hearing \nofficer.\n  In the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, in the wake of \nAtlanta, hearing officers will give substantial deference to claims \nfrom school officials that a child with disabilities continues to be \ndangerous. Concurrence of a hearing officer at 45 day intervals is a \nreasonable standard and an appropriate check and balance on the \ncontinued use of an interim alternative educational setting.\n  There is no forum or procedures for due process in the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment. How is a child with a disability to prove his innocence? If \nexpelled without education services for 12 months, what will be the \nimpact on the child's family? What will be the reaction of the child's \nnext teacher? What will be the impact on the child's neighborhood? What \nwill be the impact on this child as an adult?\n  The real driving force behind the Frist-Ashcroft amendment is the \nobligation to provide services, and not school safety. Local school \ndistricts do not want the responsibility for paying for new services. \nIf school districts do not now have interim alternative educational \nsettings that can accommodate children with disabilities, they do not \nwant to spend money to create them. If school districts do not now have \nhome-based programs or alternative school programs, they want \nadditional money to have them.\n  School districts do not see a windfall of new Federal dollars on the \nhorizon. So in the name of school safety, they bless the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment. In the name of school safety, school districts say it is \nacceptable for Federal policy to close the school house door on the \nback of a child with a disability, whether the child knew why the door \nslammed shut or not. In the name of school safety, they say it is \nacceptable for Federal policy to leave open whether any agency gives \nthe child and the child's family help, so that they can recover from a \ngun or firearm episode that profoundly altered their lives.\n  Helping children and their families in these situations is a \ncommunity responsibility. Schools are part of communities. They must do \ntheir part. Other agencies and organizations must do their part. To \nabdicate responsibility or shift responsibility is not acceptable. It \nmakes no sense.\n  All parents want their children to be safe in school and out. All \nparents want their children to have due process when they are accused \nof wrong doing. All parents want their child's education to continue, \neven if their child did wrong.\n  Are we going to disregard some of America's most vulnerable children \nin the name of political expediency, by pretending that the Frist-\nAshcroft amendment will make schools and communities safer.\n  In an ideal world, we would find a way to work together to develop or \nexpand, and fund, local agencies and organizations that would work \ncollaboratively to assist families and children in crisis, so that the \ncrisis does not reoccur.\n  In an ideal world, teachers and administrators in America's schools \nwould be thoroughly versed in the referral procedures associated with \nIDEA; and, if IDEA were fully funded, tragedies with guns and firearms \ncould be prevented.\n  We don't have an ideal world, but we must try to make a positive \ndifference, one day at a time, especially in the lives of children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself such time as I have remaining.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa indicates there is not a \nloophole here. Well, it is strange to me, but the statistics indicate \notherwise.\n  One county in Tennessee, clear evidence, Davidson County, the home of \nthe Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, four people who squeezed through \nthe nonexistent loophole were back in class within 45 days in that \nsetting.\n  I think we have to make sure that that nonexistent loophole, if that \nis what we are talking about, gets closed. It is impossible to have \npeople coming through a door that is not there. There is a loophole \nthat needs to be shut.\n  Last but not least, it is no accident that the National School Boards \nAssociation wants us to pass this. This isn't discriminating against \none class of students or in favor of another. It simply says our \npriority for learning has to be a safe and secure school environment. \nThis particular amendment would enhance the safety of all students from \ngun violence, according to the National School Boards Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in our amendment, which we just passed \nin the Senate, Senator Frist and I proposed important changes to \nfederal law to give schools more authority to remove from the classroom \nany student who brings a gun or firearm to school. Schools need current \nfederal barriers removed so that they can preserve a safe and secure \nclassroom for our children.\n  The Senator from Iowa has proposed an amendment which makes it even \nmore difficult for schools to remove any dangerous student--including \none who brings a gun to school--from the classroom. I rise to state my \nopposition to the Harkin amendment.\n  The Harkin amendment makes the current law even worse by imposing a \nnew requirement upon schools when they desire to remove any child--\ndisabled or non-disabled--from the classroom for bringing a gun or \nfirearm to school, or for committing any act of violence.\n  The Harkin amendment takes the unprecedented step of telling schools \nacross the country that if they want to remove any child from school--\neven a nondisabled student--for possessing a weapon, or for committing \nany act of violence, schools must provide the child with ``immediate \nappropriate interventions and services, including mental health \ninterventions and services,'' in order to ``maximize the likelihood \nthat such child shall not engage in such behaviors, or such behaviors \ndo not reoccur.''\n  This amendment would overturn the discipline policies of schools \nacross the nation, and intrude upon the right of parents, teachers, \nschool administrators, school boards, to set their own discipline \npolicies regarding weapons and violence in schools. Not only this, but \nit jeopardizes the ability of schools to remove any student from class \nwho has a gun or firearm, and prevents them from keeping their schools \nsafe.\n  The Harkin amendment would also handcuff schools even more than the \ncurrent IDEA law does regarding removal of disabled students who \npossess weapons.\n  The Harkin amendment says that a school that takes action to remove a \nchild with a weapon from school ``shall ensure that immediate \nappropriate interventions and services, including mental health \ninterventions and services,'' are provided to the child. This is a new \nrequirement in addition to current IDEA law.\n  Current IDEA law requires that a school that removes a child from the \nregular classroom for 45 days for a weapons possession must already \nconduct a series of procedures in connection with the removal. Let me \ndescribe some of these procedures.\n  First, a school must conduct a functional behavioral assessment. \nSecond, it must implement or modify a behavioral intervention plan for \nthe child. Included in this is the requirement that the IEP team must \nmeet to develop or modify an assessment plan to address the behavior at \nissue. Third, the school must conduct a manifestation determination \nreview to determine if the child's disability caused the behavior at \nissue.\n  The Harkin amendment adds yet another requirement to the list of \nprocedures that a school must undertake when removing a child with a \nweapon from the classroom, by requiring that schools ``ensure that \nimmediate appropriate intervention and services, including mental \nhealth interventions and services,'' are provided to the child. Why do \nwe need to handcuff schools even more with another procedure?\n\n  Additionally, the amendment says that these additional interventions \nand services must be provided ``in order to maximize the likelihood \nthat such child will not engage in such behaviors, or such behaviors do \nnot reoccur.'' We are not simply asking the schools to try to reduce \nthe likelihood of reoccurring behavior: we are requiring them to \nmaximize that likelihood.\n  School principals, administrators, teachers, school boards, and \nparents have told me about how difficult the current IDEA makes it to \ndiscipline students, and especially in the case of guns and firearms.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment adds yet another layer of procedure. \nRather than providing schools with more authority to take actions \nschool officials deem appropriate to maintain a safe and secure \nclassroom free from guns and firearms, Senator Harkin's amendment is \ngoing backwards from current law by imposing more federal \nresponsibilities.\n  The Harkin amendment's attempt to provide funding for the new \nprocedures required under the amendment is disingenuous.\n  The amendment authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary for each of \nthe fiscal years 2000 through 2004'' to pay for the ``interventions and \nservices'' that schools must conduct before they can remove a student \nwith a gun from school. If the Senator from Iowa and others were \nunwilling to vote for giving schools more IDEA funding during debate on \nthe ed-flex bill earlier this session, what makes us think they really \nwould provide more funding at this time?\n  In conclusion, the Harkin amendment actually makes current law worse \nby imposing a new set of requirements on schools when they need to \nremove any child with a firearm from the classroom. He would require \nschools to provide ``interventions and services'' to non-disabled \nstudents who are expelled for bringing a gun to school. And, he imposes \na new requirement upon schools that take action to remove IDEA students \nfrom school for weapons possession.\n  At a time when parents, teachers, school officials, and our children \nare asking for help in keeping our classrooms safe, we cannot afford to \ntake a step backward and further handcuff schools from taking steps to \nget guns out of schools. We need to move forward by giving schools more \nauthority to get--and keep--firearms out of the classroom. For these \nreasons, I oppose the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Harkin in his \namendment to reduce juvenile crime by helping schools to maintain safe \nenvironments while ensuring that troubled students get the help they \nneed.\n  Students who bring guns or other dangerous weapons to school should \nbe removed. But they should also be provided with the appropriate \ninterventions and services.\n  This amendment clearly supports the removal of a child from school \nwho carries or possesses a weapon, including a child with a disability.\n  This amendment clearly supports an agency reporting a crime committed \nby a child, including a child with a disability, to the appropriate \nauthorities.\n  This amendment clearly supports law enforcement and judicial \nauthorities in exercising their responsibilities with regard to crimes \ncommitted by a child, including a child with a disability.\n  But this amendment, unlike the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, will ensure \nthat immediate, appropriate interventions, including mental health \nservices, are provided to a troubled child.\n  We know that when educational services for students are stopped, \nthose students show increased drop out rates, increased drug abuse, and \nincreased rates of juvenile crime and incarceration.\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the Harkin-Kennedy \namendment. It will help to ensure that our schools remain conducive to \nlearning and our communities remain safe.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator Harkin and Senator Wellstone in offering an amendment that will \nhelp reduce crime and violence in our nation's schools.\n  This amendment specifically addresses the issue of our children's \nemotional well-being, and what we as a nation, can do to provide \nschools with the necessary resources to help our kids.\n  The lives of America's children are very different than they were 20, \n30 or 40 years ago. Before our children reach their teenage years, \nthey've already been exposed to drugs, alcohol, violent movies and a \ngeneral culture of violence that influences their thoughts and actions.\n  Many have expressed that they are even desensitized to violence in \ntheir everyday lives.\n  And today's students bring more to school than just backpacks and \nlunch boxes. They bring severe emotional problems.\n  They disrupt classes, they have difficulty learning, they suffer from \ndepression, and they fight with teachers and students.\n  And when they do not know how to deal with their feelings of anger \nand rage, they may even kill.\n  Since the school shooting a year ago in Jonesboro, I have been \ngrappling with ideas to ensure that this type of tragedy never happened \nagain. Unfortunately, it did happen again and we as a nation have got \nto act.\n  Children should not be afraid to go to school in the morning and \nparents should not be scared to send them there. Studies show that 71% \nof children ages 7 to 10 say they are worried they will be stabbed or \nshot while at school.\n  The Department of Education reported that in 1997, there were \napproximately 11,000 incidents nationally of physical attacks or fights \nin which weapons were used.\n  I don't claim to have all the answers on how to help our children, \nbut I do think we should do more to get to the root of the problem.\n  We've got to look at the source of this problem; we must come up with \nsome kind of preventive medicine, rather than using a haphazard Band-\naid approach.\n  Metal detectors and controlling access to guns can hinder their \nability to act out, but doesn't address their illness to begin with.\n  And as the tragedies in Jonesboro, Paducah and most recently as the \nhorror in Colorado has shown us--while much of our country is \nprospering economically, we cannot allow our country's economic success \ncause us to ignore our social ills.\n  We can train our children to use computers, to analyze stocks and to \nmeet the economic challenges of the new millennium. But if we do not \naddress their emotional needs or teach them the value of human life, \nthen what have we accomplished?\n  As Theodore Roosevelt said, ``To educate a man in mind and not in \nmorals is to educate a menace to society.''\n  Together, we must call for improvements, changes and accountability. \nThis can be done, and it must be done.\n  We can install more metal detectors and surveillance cameras in \nschools, but we won't get to the root of the problem. The youth of \nAmerica are suffering and all the increased security in the world may \nease our minds, but it won't solve their problems.\n  The United States Congress can lead the way. We can take common-sense \nsteps to see that tragedies like those in Colorado and Jonesboro become \na distant, painful memory.\n  I've traveled all over my home state of Arkansas talking with \neducators and school administrators about what's happening in our \nschools.\n  The one common denominator--the one thing they all tell me is--``We \nneed more counselors in our schools. We need more qualified mental \nhealth professionals to adequately deal with the enormous and \noverwhelming problems kids have today.''\n  The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that although 7.5 \nmillion children under the age of 18 require mental health services, \nfewer than 1 in 5 receive it.\n  The Harkin/Lincoln/Wellstone amendment calls for $15 million in \nauthorizing funds for FY 2000. In order for these services to reach \nchildren at a younger age, this money must be spent in elementary \nschools.\n  Only qualified mental health professionals may be hired with this \nfunding. Fortunately, these funds are eligible to urban, suburban and \nrural local school districts. As we all know, rural and suburban areas \nneed our help as much as inner city schools.\n  The additional school counselors, psychologists and social workers \nwill work hand-in-hand with an advisory board of parents, teachers, \nadministrators and community leaders to design and implement counseling \nservices.\n  School counselors will involve the parents of children who receive \nservices so parents can be more involved in the development and well-\nbeing of their children.\n  This legislation will help accomplish that and will allow teachers to \nfocus more on a student's skills at writing and arithmetic, rather than \non his or her potential for violence.\n  I will fight to see that this legislation passes, so we can begin to \nmake changes happen in my home state and across our country now, and \nnot wait until the next tragedy. I hope my colleagues will work with me \nin that effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Doug Peters \nof the Arkansas Democrat Gazette regarding teen death be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Arkansas Democrat Gazette, May 18, 1999]\n\n          State's Teen Death Rate Near Top in U.S., Study Says\n\n                            (By Doug Peters)\n\n       Being a teen-ager is risky, no matter where you are.\n       In Arkansas, it can be downright dangerous.\n       Only two states and the District of Columbia had higher \n     rates of teen-age deaths by accident, homicide or suicide in \n     1996, according to a study of childhood risk factors released \n     today by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.\n       According to the Kids Count 1999 study, 181 Arkansas teen-\n     agers between 15 and 19 died of such causes in 1996, for a \n     rate of 94 deaths per 100,000. Arkansas' rate is more than 50 \n     percent higher than the national rate of 62 deaths per \n     100,000 teen-agers.\n       And while the national rate decreased slightly between 1985 \n     and 1996, Arkansas' rate increased by 16 percent.\n       Only Mississippi, Wyoming and the District of Columbia had \n     higher teen-age death rates in 1996, the most recent year \n     statistics were available for all states and the District of \n     Columbia.\n       Dr. Bob West, a pediatric medical consultant for the state \n     Department of Health, said Arkansas' increase appeared to be \n     caused by increasing numbers of teen suicides and homicides.\n       Between 1985 and 1989, Arkansas averaged 18 suicides and 15 \n     homicides a year among 15 through 19-year-olds, according to \n     Health Department statistics. In 1996, 32 Arkansans in that \n     age group committed suicide. Another 32 were murdered.\n       Arkansas traditionally has a high rate of accidental deaths \n     among teen-agers, West said. And although the number of \n     traffic deaths among 15 through 19-year-olds dropped from an \n     average of 95 a year between 1985 and 1989 to 85 in 1996, the \n     state's rate remains significantly higher than the national \n     average.\n       Traditionally, Arkansas accidental death rates run about 40 \n     percent above the national average, West said.\n       West said that accidents in rural areas sometimes turn \n     fatal because of a lack of nearby trauma services. But \n     location isn't the only factor, he said. Attitude also may \n     play a role.\n       Some people, he said, simply don't see accidents as being \n     preventable.\n       ``I think there are a lot of folks who think, `If it \n     happens, it happens,' '' West said. ``There doesn't seem to \n     be the willingness to do the kind of things that will keep \n     you safe'' such as wearing seat belts or installing smoke \n     detectors.\n       The dismal teen-age death rate helped Arkansas slip to 43rd \n     overall in the Kids Count rating, an annual state-by-state \n     ranking of risk factors to children's well-being. Arkansas \n     ranked 41st last year.\n       The survey wasn't all bad news, though.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, four weeks ago, an unspeakable act of \nviolence occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado when \n12 innocent students, a heroic teacher and the two student gunmen were \nkilled. This incident was the 8th deadly school shooting in 39 months.\n  The tragedy at Columbine High School is still very fresh in our minds\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\nand our hearts. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of \nLittleton, Colorado.\n  The students of Columbine have returned to classes in a neighboring \nschool. They have taken an important first step in the healing process. \nUnfortunately, the scars of this tragedy will remain with them, their \nfamilies, the Littleton community and the nation for a long time to \ncome.\n  In the aftermath of this most recent school shooting, we must examine \nthe causes of the outbreak of violence and work on initiatives that \nwill prevent such occurrences in the future.\n  During the course of the debate on the pending legislation, Juvenile \nJustice Bill we have already discussed many of the issues related to \nviolence. We must examine the impact that movies, music, television and \nvideo games have on outbreaks of violence. We must also curtail the \neasy access to guns that enable individuals to commit such acts of \nviolence.\n  We must also talk about how we can prevent such heinous acts from \nhappening again. I would like to take a few moments to discuss one \ninnovative program that can help us prevent violent acts from happening \nin the first place.\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, of which I am a member, held a hearing on the important \ntopic of school safety. We heard testimony from many experts about the \nextent of the problem and began an important search for solutions so \nthat it will never, ever happen again.\n  One of the witnesses was Jan Kuhl, the Director of Guidance and \nCounseling for the Des Moines School District. Jan talked about an \ninnovative elementary school counseling program called Smoother Sailing \nand the impact the program has had on students in the Des Moines \nschools.\n  Smoother Sailing operates on a simple premise--get to kids early to \nprevent problems rather than waiting for a crisis. As a result, the \ndistrict more than tripled the number of elementary school counselors \nto make sure that at least one well-trained professional is available \nin every single elementary school building.\n  Smoother Sailing began in 1988 as a pilot program in 10 elementary \nschools. The program increased the number of counselors in the \nelementary schools so there is one counselor for every 250 students--\nthe ratio recommended for an effective program. The participating \nschools began seeing many positive changes.\n  After two years, the schools participating in Smoother Sailing saw a \ndramatic reduction in the number of students referred to the office for \ndisciplinary reasons.\n  During the 1987-88 school year, 157 students were referred to the \noffice for disciplinary action. After two years of Smoother Sailing, \nthe number of office referrals in those schools dropped to 83--a 47% \nreduction in office referrals.\n  During the same period, Des Moines elementary schools with a \ntraditional crisis intervention counseling program had only a 21% \nreduction in office referrals.\n  There were other changes as well. Teachers in Smoother Sailing \nschools reported fewer classroom disturbances and principals noticed \nfewer fights in the cafeteria and on the playground. The schools and \nclassrooms had become more disciplined learning environments. It was \nclear that Smoother Sailing was making a difference so the counseling \nprogram was then expanded to all 42 elementary schools in Des Moines in \n1990.\n  Smoother Sailing continues to be a success.\n  Smoother Sailing helps students solve problems in a positive manner. \nAssessments of 4th and 5th grade students show that students can \ngenerate more than one solution to a problem. Further, the types of \nsolutions were positive and proactive. We know that the ability to \neffectively solve problems is essential for helping students make the \nright decisions when confronted with violence or drugs.\n  Smoother Sailing gets high marks in surveys of administrators, \nteachers and parents. They report a high degree of satisfaction with \nthe program.\n  95% of parents surveyed said the counselor is a valuable part of my \nchild's educational development. 93% said they would seek assistance \nfrom the counselor if the child was experiencing difficulties at \nschool.\n  Administrators credit Smoother Sailing with decreasing the number of \nstudents suspensions and referrals to the office for disciplinary \naction. In addition, principals report that the program is responsible \nfor creating an atmosphere that is conducive to learning.\n  Experts tell us that to be effective, there should be at least one \ncounselor for every 250 students. Unfortunately, the current student-\ncounselor ratio is more than double the recommended level--it is 531:1. \nThat means counselors are stretched to the limit and cannot devote the \nkind of attention to children that is needed.\n  In most schools, the majority of counselors are employed at the \nmiddle and secondary levels. Therefore, the situation is more acute in \nelementary schools where the student to counselor ratio is greater than \n1000:1. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this table be inserted \nin the Record at this point.\n  Smoother Sailing was the model for the Elementary School Counseling \nDemonstration Act, a section of the Elementary and Secondary School \nAct.\n  It reauthorizes the program and authorizes $15 million to establish \nmore effective elementary school programs.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senators Lincoln and Wellstone is \nsupported by several organizations--the American Counseling \nAssociation, the American School Counseling Association, the American \nPsychological Association the National Association of School \nPsychologists, the School of Social Work Association of America and the \nNational Association of Social Workers.\n  Mr. President, CNN and USA Today recently conducted a public opinion \npoll of Americans. They asked what would make a difference in \npreventing a future outbreak of violence similar to those that have \noccurred over the past 39 months.\n  The leading response was to restrict access to firearms. The second \nmost popular response--a response selected by 60% of those polled--was \nto increase the number of counselors in our nation's schools.\n  We should heed the advice of the American people. We have a desperate \nneed to improve counseling services in our nation's schools. Our \namendment is an important first step in addressing this critical issue \nand I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent a table of U.S. counselor-to-students ratios \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                    U.S. COUNSELOR-TO-STUDENT RATIOS\n                   [Maximum recommended ratio (250:1)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Number of--         Counselor-\n           U.S. States            --------------------------  to-student\n                                     Students    Counselors   ratio \\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama..........................      780,999        1,688        463:1\nAlaska...........................      136,196          231        590:1\nArizona..........................      864,226        1,046        826:1\nArkansas.........................      482,590        1,213        398:1\nCalifornia.......................    6,157,320        5,208      1,182:1\nColorado.........................      723,591        1,121        645:1\nConnecticut......................      569,268        1,123        507:1\nDelaware.........................      126,870          221        574:1\nDistrict of Columbia.............       74,395          225        331:1\nFlorida..........................    2,455,079        4,855        506:1\nGeorgia..........................    1,398,787        2,472        566:1\nHawaii...........................      213,404          544        392:1\nIdaho............................      256,946          558        460:1\nIllinois.........................    2,240,199        2,838        789:1\nIndiana..........................    1,083,851        1,735        625:1\nIowa.............................      539,413        1,332        405:1\nKansas...........................      505,870        1,097        461:1\nKentucky.........................      706,820        1,272        556:1\nLouisiana........................      888,620        2,703        329:1\nMaine............................      227,590          593        384:1\nMaryland.........................      911,929        1,825        500:1\nMassachusetts....................    1,033,899        2,125        487:1\nMichigan.........................    1,849,721        2,943        629:1\nMinnesota........................      925,347          915      1,011:1\nMississippi......................      551,418          869        635:1\nMissouri.........................    1,025,704        2,410        426:1\nMontana..........................      175,563          411        427:1\nNebraska.........................      327,982          757        433:1\nNevada...........................      293,979          560        525:1\nNew Hampshire....................      219,006          656        334:1\nNew Jersey.......................    1,408,761        3,231        436:1\nNew Mexico.......................      362,001          650        557:1\nNew York.........................    3,211,827        5,467        587:1\nNorth Carolina...................    1,316,796        3,025        435:1\nNorth Dakota.....................      125,666          263        478:1\nOhio.............................    2,082,841        3,247        641:1\nOklahoma.........................      647,533        1,730        374:1\nOregon...........................      591,539        1,268        467:1\nPennsylvania.....................    2,117,697        3,707        571:1\nRhode Island.....................      170,732          307        556:1\nSouth Carolina...................      692,743        1,546        448:1\nSouth Dakota.....................      150,243          345        435:1\nTennessee........................      953,463        1,525        625:1\nTexas............................    3,879,363        8,359        464:1\nUtah.............................      490,706          594        826:1\nVermont..........................      110,228          352        313:1\nVirginia.........................    1,172,672        3,202        366:1\nWashington.......................    1,047,132        1,804        580:1\nWest Virginia....................      313,685          604        519:1\nWisconsin........................    1,004,584        1,884        533:1\nWyoming..........................      101,652          285        357:1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Calculated ratio is based on 1996 data, counting guidance counselors\n  as full-time equivalents.

Mr. President, we have heard a lot about gun shows, pawn \nshops, and ammo clips these past few days. We have been told that if we \njust tweak the law a little here, or add another provision making \nsomething else illegal that somehow people who gun down others in cold \nblood won't do it anymore.\n  It's as if wishing would make it so.\n  Thirty years ago we had very few gun laws, and surprisingly, no high \nschool shooting sprees to document every few days, every few weeks, or \nevery few months.\n  But thirty years ago we also had stricter discipline in schools, no \nschool officials worried about lawsuits if they expelled a violent \nchild, and parents who also exerted more control.\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\n  Now we have a new gun law a year. We have school officials who fear \nlawsuits, and federal law which seems designed to keep violent kids in \nclassrooms, rather than removed--although I hope the Frist-Ashcroft \namendment will make some improvements. And we have an industry--in the \nname of entertainment--that produces violence and violent pornography \nat such a pace that no one has any idea of the breadth and width of \nexposure our kids now have to it.\n  Movies, television, videos, music, computer games. Killing, maiming, \nand destruction--all in the name of entertainment.\n  Why is anyone surprised in this new topsey-turvy world, that some \nstudents plan mass murders rather than planning their graduation party.\n  Today I thought it time to inject a little dose of reality into these \nproceedings, and get us started down a road which I believe needs to be \nexplored. My amendment empanels an independent commission to study the \nmotion picture industry--from top to bottom--to see if the federal \ngovernment is subsidizing, facilitating or otherwise encouraging the \nproduction of violent, or pornographic materials. And if so, to make \nrecommendations to Congress and the President to promote accountability \nin the motion picture industry in order to reduce juvenile access to \nviolent, pornographic, or other harmful material in motion pictures. \nSimply put, we want to discourage, not encourage access to these \nmaterials.\n  At the outset, let's make it clear that a great deal of what kids see \non the big screen is not harmful and it is done by talented people who \nare just as concerned about our young people as anyone else. However, \nthere are hundreds, if not thousands of releases each year that have \nprofound effects on teens who see them.\n  Let us be very clear about one other thing before we continue, \nbecause we have head a lot about the gun industry and their so-called \npolitical power.\n  Mr. President, they don't hold a candle to the movie industry. \nHollywood has the money, the glamour, the lifestyle of the rich and \nfamous. They have Beverly Hills, they generate publicity for a living, \nand they have access to the Lincoln Bedroom. In fact, the NRA actually \nbrought in a famous actor in order to have some hope of getting a fair \nhearing for its position.\n  But the most disturbing, and least discussed these past few days, is \nexactly who it is in this country that has glamourized guns and \nviolence. It is certainly not everyone's favorite bogeyman the NRA. It \nis not the biathletes who compete in the Olympics. Quite simply, it is \nthe entertainment industry. Guns, gore, and violence, targeted not at \nsoccer moms--but to their sons.\n  And worse yet, it is not just gun use, but gun misuse which is \nglorified. Gun-toting murders as heros, out to right some perceived \nwrong. Who even knew what an Uzi or Tech 9 was until they saw it in \nsome show?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a May 11, 1999, \narticle by Michael Atkinson entitled ``The Movies Made Me Do It.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [The Village Voice, May 11, 1999]\n\n                        The Movies Made Me Do It\n\n                         (By Michael Atkinson)\n\n       On March 5, 1995, Sara Edmondson, the 18-year-old scion of \n     one of Oklahoma's most prominent political clans, holed up \n     with her 17-year-old boyfriend Ben Darras in her family's \n     cabin with a video Copy of Natural Born Killers, a Smith & \n     Wesson .38, and a reported 17 tabs of acid. It's clear \n     neither how many times they watched the film nor what the \n     timetable had been for dropping all that dope, but, over the \n     next two days, the teenagers road-tripped south, first \n     shooting Hernando, Louisiana, cotton-gin manager Bill Savage, \n     and then, the following day, convenience-store clerk Patsy \n     Byers. Initially they had intended to go to a Grateful Dead \n     concert in Memphis, but got the date wrong. Edmondson got 35 \n     years; Darras got life.\n       Savage was DOA, and his hometown friend John Grisham raised \n     a public stink over the Oliver Stone film, threatening to sue \n     for product liability but never filing. Luckless, Byers was \n     left a quadriplegic and later died of cancer, but her \n     family's lawyer has filed a civil suit against Edmondson, \n     Darras, Edmondson's parents, Stone, and Time Warner, \n     maintaining that the film's creators ``knew. . . . or should \n     have known'' that violence would result from its being shown. \n     In March, after bouncing around Louisiana courts, the case \n     went to the Supreme Court and was seen as good to go.\n       Here comes the flood. This April, the families of three \n     Kentucky girls left dead after the prayer-group shooting \n     spree of 14-year-old Michael Carneal in 1997 have filed a \n     $130 million lawsuit against no fewer than 25 parties, \n     including five film companies involved with the film The \n     Basketball Diaries; a single scene allegedly incited Carneal \n     to action. The dream sequence, of Leonardo DiCaprio gunning \n     down his classmates, should be immediately familiar to even \n     those who haven't bothered seeing the film, thanks to the \n     news coverage of the Littleton rampage. Littleton itself is \n     destined to become the nation's mother lode of hydra-headed \n     copycat--crime civil suits directed at the manufacturers of \n     pop culture, just as the Klebold-Harris scenario immediately \n     became something to mimic in high schools from coast to \n     coast. Copycat crimes have attained front-burner notoriety, \n     and some day soon Hollywood's liberty will be pitted against \n     the perceived welfare of America children.\n       It's an old but neglected dynamic, and wherever you stand \n     on the issue, itemizing the carnage attributed to the \n     influence of movies is chilling business. After The Birth of \n     a Nation hit big in 1915, the KKK enjoyed a huge resurgence \n     and lynching stats shot up. James Cagney's psycho gangster in \n     White Heat (1949) was blamed for inspiring Brit Chris Craig's \n     1952 shooting of a policeman. A clockwork Orange's 1971 \n     release was followed by several rapes in England accompanied \n     by the rapists' renditions of ``Singin' in the Rain,'' after \n     which Stanley Kubrick permanently removed the film from \n     British circulation. Magnum Force's murder-by-Drano was \n     reenacted in Utah, The Deer Hunter precipitated a rash of \n     fatal Russian roulette duels, a fierce love of First Blood \n     sent a deranged Englishman named Michael Ryan tearing through \n     his village commando-style, killing randomly. Taxi Driver \n     spoke to John Hinckley; RoboCop gave ideas to two separate \n     killers, each of whom admitted that their evisceration \n     methods were adopted from the film. Just days after its \n     premiere, Money Train, itself based in part on real \n     incidents, inspired token-booth thieves to incinerate the \n     clerk inside. High school footballers were maimed and killed \n     lying down on busy highways after viewing The Program. \n     Child's Play and it first two straight-to-tape sequels hold \n     the record for the sheer number of dead: besides two-year-old \n     Jamie Bulger, stoned to death by a pair of 10-year-old Chucky \n     fans in Liverpool, and 16-year-old Suzanne Capper, burned \n     alive in Manchester by Chucky fans who played lines of the \n     movies' dialogue to here as she was being tortured, there is \n     the dizzying slaughter of 35 Tasmainian vacationers by Martin \n     Bryant, a mental patient ``obsessed'' with Chucky.\n       But for sheer inspirational force, and the highest number \n     of captured impulse killers who have directly credited the \n     film Natural Born Killers might be the one plus ultra of \n     copycat-killing source material. Besides the Edmondson-Darras \n     road trip, there have been killings in Utah, Georgia, \n     Massachusetts, and Texas (where a 14-year-old boy decapitated \n     a 13-year-old girl), all involving children who afterward \n     quoted the film to firends and authorities. In Paris, a pair \n     of young lovers, Florence Rey and Audry Maupin, led the \n     police on a chase that killed five; supposedly, Rey said, \n     ``It's fate,'' a la Woody Harrelson's character Mickey, when \n     caught. Another pair of Parisians, Veronique Herbert and her \n     boyfriend Sebastien Paindavoine, lured a 16-year-old to his \n     stabbing death with promises of sex; a scene right out of \n     Stone's film. Herbert has even named the Stone film in ther \n     defense\n       There are scores of other examples--even Beavis and Butt-\n     head has its ghosts, innocent bystanders killed by child-lit \n     fires or child-tossed bowling balls. Hunt-and-kill computer \n     games, which provide ersatz combat training, have also \n     been cited in the Carneal suit. Of course, in each case, \n     the precise psychological role media played is never \n     clear--nor can it be, until we can map a brain like a \n     computer hard drive. In fact, some of what the press has \n     reported about the similarities between particular murders \n     and particular films is flat-out wrong--scores of scenes \n     that never occurred in Child's Play 2 were said to have \n     been reenacted in the Bulger murder. Still, when a Georgia \n     teen yells out ``I'm a natural born killer!'' to news \n     cameras after being arrested for killing an elderly man, \n     the tie-in is hard to ignore.\n       Legally, it may be impossible to prove intent on behalf of \n     a filmmaker or a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt cause-and-effect \n     affiliation between specific movies and specific violence. \n     How do you account for the millions of unaffected consumers? \n     What's equally at issue is the common cultural presupposition \n     that the entertainment media bear no culpability for those \n     who wreak havoc in imitation of it. Movies are movies, \n     homicidal nuts are homicidal nuts, the crimes would occur \n     with or without a movie's sensationalized prodding. So the \n     wisdom goes. But is our relationship with movies so simple, \n     or is there in fact something deeper, darker, going on? Could \n     it be that visual media aren't merely a harmless, ephemeral \n     diversion from reality, but a powerful factor in that reality \n     bearing consequences we haven't foreseen?\n       Since most of the incidents we're aware of have children at \n     their centers, this may prove to be true. According to \n     University of Michigan professor L. Rowell Huesmann, an \n     expert researcher on the relationship between violent media \n     and violent behavior, ``It's been well established that media \n     violence makes kids behave more aggressively.\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\n     Of course, there's no scientific way to evaluate how media \n     violence may have or many have not caused real violence, but \n     there's definitely a relationship, a ``priming'' or \n     ``curing'' of behavior for certain individuals. The reasons \n     are well understood in psychology: even as toddlers, if we \n     see other kids push and hit to get what they want, we imitate \n     it, we begin to learn scripts for that behavior. In addition, \n     there have been studies: you show images of gore to young \n     children, they have a universally negative reaction: their \n     heartbeat goes up, their palms sweat, and so on. You show it \n     to them again and again, and those indications go away. They \n     adapt, they become desensitized.''\n       Dr. Carole Lieberman, a Beverly Hills-based ``media \n     psychiatrist,'' blames parental patterns of consumerism. \n     ``There's no question that parents see it happen. The Ninja \n     Turtles were a significant sign: everyone could see how \n     specific violent behaviors were derived directly from that \n     show. But they still buy the kids the computer, the violent \n     CD games. It's cognitive dissonance--they know, but they \n     don't want their kids to be left out, to be unarmed.''\n       It seems the entertainment complex knows, too: Last week, \n     MGM announced they'd like to recall every copy of The \n     Basketball Diaries from store shelves but can't thanks to a \n     prohibitive rights agreement that lasts until June 30. Even \n     within the Hollywood chambers, the cattle can get spooked: \n     Money Train scriptwriter Doug Richardson was voted down for \n     membership in the Academy thanks to the subway-booth \n     torching. ``Nobody would say it was because of that \n     incident,'' Richardson says, ``but no one would deny it. So, \n     as a writer, am I supposed to wonder if what I'm doing is \n     drama or pornography? Science is going to have to get in up \n     to its elbows in this, I think. It's a very complicated \n     issue, and doesn't deserve sound-bite answers. Especially \n     since there's so much suffering.\n       And the suffering, not of Hollywood filmmakers told they \n     shouldn't make ultraviolent movies but of families with \n     murdered children, may be what the debate should be about. \n     ``We could make a great step forward by simply restricting \n     the amount of violence to which children are exposed,'' \n     Huesmann says. ``That's no great constitutional dilemma. I \n     wouldn't be surprised if at this point Oliver Stone came \n     forth and said, `Yes, the film obviously affects some people \n     in a certain way,' and if he did, that would be a significant \n     first step.'' (Oliver Stone declined to comment.)\n       ``Every study indicates a relationship,'' Huesmann \n     concludes. ``Here's a not greatly known fact: that the \n     statistical correlation between childhood exposure to \n     violence in media and aggressive behavior is about the same \n     as that between smoking and lung cancer.''\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it outlines ``copycat'' acts of violence who \nfashion their criminal actions--murder and rape--off brilliant ``how \nto'' works of theater such as ``Natural Born Killers'' and ``Basketball \nDiaries.''\n  We know that merchants of violence profit handsomely from some \nproducts which hurt our children and cost our society. Who for a second \nbelieves that the 40,000 murders that our children witness on the TV \nscreen during their childhoods does not have some terrible numbing \neffect. We can't stop Hollywood from producing the insanity, but we can \nattempt to discourage it and to help them share in the burden that \ntheir ``profiteering at any cost'' imposes on society.\n  Now I don't believe we need any more studies outlining the numbing \neffects that movie and television violence have on our children. What \nwe need to know is--are the American taxpayers subsidizing this numbing \ndown of American youth? And if so, what can and should we do about it?\n  That is why our Commission looks to people who are independent of the \npower and influence of the motion picture industry.\n  Clearly, advertising is directed at attracting all audiences \nincluding our young. These wealthy and talented industry people have a \nright to produce this material but we should not extend them every \ncourtesy when it comes to polluting the minds of our young. There is \nalways parental responsibility, but that does not excuse others from \nacting responsibly as well.\n  Does it, or does it not, take a village to raise a child? Last I \nlooked, Hollywood is part of our village. So where is the \nresponsibility of those who produce the harmful material?\n  Though the power of the motion picture industry is great, we should \ntake a turn listening to parents instead of actors and show leadership \ninstead of cowardice. Some may object on behalf of the wealthy \nmerchants of carnage and smut saying they have a constitutional right \nto pollute the minds of our children and have no responsibility as an \nartist or producer to use their power to try and help our nation's \nparents. But I think they are wrong. Short-sighted and wrong.\n  Thus if we adopt the Bond-Domenici amendment, we will be saying it is \ntime that parents, and grandparents--not just Hollywood moguls--will \nhave an opportunity to participate in the debate on how best to protect \nour children. And if this notion offends the Hollywood crowd and their \nubiquitous presence in Washington--so be it. We should make quite \ncertain that the public is not contributing or facilitating the \nproduction of this sort of material and not facilitating its marketing \nto our young people. Of, that if we are, people understand it and \ndecide it is good use of national resources.\n\n  Now there are other thoughtful amendments to this underlying bill \nwhich call on Clinton Administration agencies to study advertising or \nanti-trust provisions. My amendment is designed to get the best minds \noutside of the Clinton Administration and Hollywood--and if you have \nany serious questions why, I think this past weekend's multi-million \nfund-raising trip to Beverly Hills answers those immediately.\n  It is with a great sense of frustration that I come to you and that \nis because I am tired of telling parents that there is nothing we can \ndo to help shield their kids beyond relying on the good will and tender \nmercies of the same ones making blood money off the trash.\n  If the government can't do anything about it at this time, I think it \nis worth letting someone on the outside see if it is possible to bring \nsome discipline and responsibility to those who are producing and \nmarketing the insanity. As you all know, not everyone in the film \nindustry is proud of what their colleagues produce for the public. I \nhave no intention of painting with a broad brush, but the ones without \ndiscipline--the ones that don't care about our children, should not be \nshielded from scrutiny just because they may be some of the best people \nto invite to parties, vacations and fund-raisers.\n  The Commission is proposed to be made up of 12 members appointed by \nthe President, the Majority Leader and the Speaker and review the \nfollowing:\n  (1) How the government, through the tax code or otherwise, \nsubsidizes, facilitates or otherwise reduces the cost of the production \nof violent, pornographic, or harmful materials and changes necessary to \ncurtail such assistance;\n  (2) How the movie industry markets to children and how such marketing \ncan be regulated;\n  (3) What standard of civil and criminal liability currently exists \nand what standard is sufficient to allow victims to seek legal redress \nagainst motion picture productions in cases where content leads to \ndestructive behavior;\n  (4) Whether federal regulation of content is appropriate;\n  (5) What other federal action might be taken to reduce the quantity \nof and juvenile access to movies containing violent, pornographic, or \nharmful materials.\n  The amendment requires that a majority report be made within a year \nof enactment and requires that a minimum number of parents be appointed \nto the commission. Further, it authorizes a budget for professional \nstaff to assist on these very complex issues.\n  This would be a powerful commission with a broad mandate that could \nrecommend that we make merchants of death liable for their work, that \nwe make the polluter pay; or outline ways to discourage advertising to \nour children. We may not enact their recommendations but I think it is \ntime we hear the truth from parents--parents without connections to \nHollywood.\n  It is a balanced commission and the President will get his \nopportunity to make appointments. He must appoint a parent of a child \nbut he can also appoint a first amendment absolutist and he can appoint \nOliver Stone to the commission if he so desires.\n  I know Members on both sides of the aisle share my frustration. They \ntoo have had parents tell them that each year it gets harder and harder \nto keep the violent images out of their kids lives. Not only movies and \nvideos, but television, CDs, video games, radio, and even print ads.\n  The images are starker, the violence more pronounced, the mayhem more \ngraphic. No parent can keep it all out because it comes from \neverywhere. What I am saying here today is that it is time to start \nholding people responsible for their choices, and that at a\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\nminimum, we should know if the parents of America are paying taxes to \nsubsidize the filth they then try to keep out of their homes.\n  The Bond-Domenici amendment is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might not even take that long.\n  I want to compliment the Senator from Missouri for his proposal and \njust speak a little bit about a word that is on a lot of people's minds \nthese days. In fact, many people are saying: Boy, it sure would be \ngreat if we could get responsibility back into our schools so our \nchildren could learn what responsibility means.\n  I think it would be great if we could get the entertainment industry \nto show a little responsibility. Some responsibility from those who \nmake films and produce TV shows, produce advertisements, produce many \nof the vile computer games our young people are using so they become \nexcellent sharpshooters, excellent killers. In fact, some of these \ncomputer games have made our children proficient at shooting people \nright through the head, one after another, because they learned it on \nthe computer game.\n  Everyone seems to be saying that our children need to learn greater \nresponsibility. Actually, Hollywood and those who produce television \nshows and movies, they are the ones in need of a new sense of \nresponsibility. I do not know any way, under our Constitution, to stop \nwhat is happening. I do not know if I would be wise enough to figure it \nout. But I tell you, the adults who are in the entertainment industry \nhave to, sooner or later, look at themselves and say: What is our \nresponsibility to the young people of this country?\n  Right now it seems there is none, other than to make money. If the \nadults in the entertainment industry continue to refuse to produce \nfilms that are good for our young people, even if it is more difficult \nto sell them, if they refuse to go out and get innovative people to \nwrite the kinds of things that are salutary and healthy and helpful, \nthen I believe they are irresponsible. I believe they need a lesson in \nresponsibility. Instead, they hide admirably behind the Constitution.\n  I believe, if our forefathers who put the First Amendment in the \nConstitution, the freedom of speech that the entertainment industry \nhides behind, could see what they produce, what they feed to our young \npeople, what they feed to our society under the alleged protection of \nthat Amendment, I believe they would reconsider and try to figure some \nway to make sure we had a bit more responsibility built into this \naspect of the American free enterprise system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have to oppose this $1 million study of \n``how the Federal Government and State and local governments, through \ntheir taxing power or otherwise'' helps support or subsidize the cost \nof producing ``violent, pornographic or other harmful materials.'' Even \nthough this is just a study, I have serious concerns about researching \nthe need for more taxing power.\n  Second, the juvenile crime bill already contains a package of \namendments regarding the study of the motion picture industry. Third, \nthe causes of teen violence are complex and difficult to handle with \ntax policy. Fourth, the amendment provides broad subpoena powers.\n  I appreciate that Senator Bond modified his amendment by taking out \nthe study of how another tax, an excise tax, might be structured for \n``violent, pornographic, or other harmful motion picture materials.'' \nWhat is considered harmful in Tulsa, may not be considered harmful in \nNiagara Falls, or Boise, or Key West. But in terms of the ``power to \ntax'' language still in the amendment it is not clear if the Federal \nGovernment, or towns or states, would tell movie producers what content \nthey considered ``harmful'' or ``violent.'' Thus while the ``excise \ntax'' language was just taken out the study of the ``power to tax'' is \nstill in the amendment. And that raises a lot of issues.\n  If this power to tax authority were used what would that mean? It is \nnot at all clear how that would work. I do not see why we should spend \n$1 million to study the ``power to tax.'' There were major fights years \nago about whether to censor the line in ``Gone with the Wind''--\n``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' In many towns, that line \ncould have been taxed under a ``power to tax'' if they had it then. \nNow, that line caused enormous numbers of debates and editorials. I \nsuspect that could have gotten a whopping tax back then. Or Clark Gable \ncould have just said: ``Frankly, my dear, I am really annoyed.''\n  How would a new ``power to tax'' given to local, state or the Federal \ngovernment work? The earlier ``excise tax'' idea that was recently \ndropped raised lots of questions also. I do not know what editing of \nmovies local governments might have ended up doing.\n  Concerning the excise tax language, now dropped, I wondered would the \nlocal or the Federal government have imposed the tax before the movie \nwas produced, after the movie was produced, or during the editing of \nthe movie? Or, would the States or the Federal Government have told the \nproducers ahead of time how much they would tax them on each scene? If \nthey were to do it that way, could they take some scenes out or pay the \nextra tax, like a gas-guzzler tax? I understand there are a lot of \nviolent battle scenes in the new Star Wars movie. That would have had a \npretty big gross to tax. Fortunately, the ``excise tax'' language was \ntaken out by the sponsor of the amendment, but the ``power to tax'' \nlanguage remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the ranking member for \nyielding. I hope he will stay on the floor just a moment because I \nwanted to ask him something. In this amendment, on page 4, is something \nthat completely astounds me. This commission is going to look at \nwhether the regulation of the content of motion pictures is \nappropriate.\n  Federal regulation--is this the Soviet Union? What are we doing? I \nask my friend if this disturbs him that we would be considering the \nFederal Government regulating the content of motion pictures.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from California, what I also worry \nabout is how you determine what it is. I heard one Senator on the floor \nspeak of having more wholesome movies. I am all for that. There are a \nlot of movies that I consider absolutely classic. I like the ``Quiet \nMan'' with John Wayne. It was filmed near the part of Ireland from \nwhere my father's family came. But there is violence, fighting, \ndrunkenness a little bit here and there. What do you determine it is? \nDoes the market carry that? There are a lot of wholesome films that \nmake it.\n  I see some things that might be considered wholesome. One very \npopular with children are Teletubbies, but yet we heard one leading \nconservative religious leader say that it should be taken off the air \nbecause he objected to one of the Teletubbies.\n  Maybe we have Teletubbies on one side and televangelists on the \nother. Somebody suggested in one cartoon: Teletubby Tinky Winky; \nTelevangelist Dopey Wopey. But that is what I read in the paper.\n  Do we take that off or tax it? Maybe after the $1 million this \namendment refers to we might have a better idea. I am not too sure I \nwant even my own communities to determine what tax they will impose and \nthe Federal Government determine what tax they will impose and then \nhave censor boards all over the place determining this one we will tax \na little itty-bitty, and this one we will tax biggie bitty-bit.\n  I point out, we do already have in the juvenile justice bill a \npackage of amendments regarding the study of the motion picture \nindustry, so that is going to be done anyway.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I point out to my friend, who is such an advocate of the \nConstitution, that this is the third one. We have investigation mania \ngoing on here. This is the third investigation of the entertainment \nindustry that is going to be voted on in this Senate; the third \ninvestigation. Fortunately, on the first one, we expanded it to include \nthe gun industry. So there is one investigation of the gun industry and \nhow it peddles its products to kids, and then\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nthere are three investigations of the entertainment industry. But this \nis the very first one where it says in this bill--and I say to my \nfriends, read it. They are going to look at whether there should be \nFederal regulation of the content of motion pictures.\n  Maybe the Senator from Missouri is interested in writing movies, but \nI am not. This is what it is about. None of us was elected to be a \nmovie writer. There is no bureaucrat I know who ought to sit around and \nwrite movies. We now have three investigations of the motion picture \nindustry in this bill.\n  Let me tell you what they are. The first one was the Brownback \namendment. I actually supported it. Everybody did. I thought: OK, we \nwill have a commission; it will look at youth violence. That commission \ncalls for the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General, with \nall the powers of their offices, to look at the marketing tactics of \nthe motion picture industry, the entertainment industry, and the video \ngames industry and see if they are, in fact, taking advantage of our \nchildren.\n  Then we have the Lieberman Commission, which is part of the managers' \namendment, which sits in this bill. I have it in front of me. Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. McCain, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Landrieu, et \ncetera. They are establishing a national youth violence commission and \nit refers to the various powers of that commission. That is \ninvestigation No. 2.\n\n  Now comes along, in case we did not do enough of this, investigation \nNo. 3. Duplicative, I add, of the others, but a lot more frightening, \nbecause it includes the possibility of Federal regulation of the \ncontent of motion pictures.\n  It refers to changing the law to seek legal redress against \nproducers. My friend from Missouri can take comfort in the fact that we \nare already doing what he wants to be done, with the exception of \nlooking at the content.\n  I do not know whether this is going to be accepted or if there is a \nvote. More than likely it is going to be adopted. Set up a commission. \nHow about doing something that will help? How about keeping our kids \nbusy after school? Oh, no, I only got two people from the other side of \nthe aisle. Keep our children busy after school so they are not sitting \nin front of the television? Oh, no, we couldn't do that, even though we \nhave a million children waiting in line to get into afterschool \nprograms.\n  But, oh, let's have a third commission and beat up on the \nentertainment industry and that is going to help keep our kids out of \ntrouble.\n  Look at the FBI statistics. That is when there is juvenile crime. \nThis is a juvenile justice bill. We do a little something for \nafterschool in this bill, but it is just that, a little something. It \nwill not take care of the backlog of all the children who are waiting, \nbut, oh, we can feel real good and set up a third investigation of the \nentertainment industry.\n  This is amazing to me. And this one is frightening to me, to think \nthat the Federal Government may now begin to regulate the content of \nmovies. I simply think that the American people do not want to see \ntheir Government regulating what can be said in a movie. If you do not \nlike a movie, don't go see it, as Senator Leahy said yesterday. Don't \nspend your dollars on violence. Turn the movie channel. But to set up \nnow a third commission on the entertainment industry, this is just \ngoing over the top. And suggesting that they look at ways to regulate \ncontent, that is a frightening thought to me.\n  I do not have much hope that this will be defeated because it seems \nto be something we are getting used to here: Let's have an \ninvestigation; it's easy; it's easy; have an investigation.\n  By the way, it is going to cost $1 million. Do you know how many \nslots that could take care of for kids waiting in line to get in \nafterschool programs? Let's use it on something that works. A million \ndollars on this commission. I know my friend is a fiscal conservative. \nI hope when this bill gets to conference, they can take these three \ninvestigations and put them into one, because this is simply amazing to \nme.\n  I have every belief that the Senator's commission will be adopted. \nThe Senate is in the mood to launch yet another investigation, point \nanother finger and, ``Yes, I voted against afterschool, but I voted for \nthat commission; I am going to save our kids.''\n  I am very surprised we are looking--as a matter of fact, I did not \neven know this was coming up until somebody said it. I thought: Wait a \nminute, that is confusing; we already have two investigations. Now we \nhave yet a third.\n  I know what I am saying is not popular around here, but I worry when \nwe start talking about the Government regulating content. That reminds \nme of the old Soviet Union. That is gone. Let's not follow that model.\n  I hope people vote against this. Again, I do not hold out much hope, \nbut I hope people vote against this. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. One always is impressed with the ability of Hollywood and \ntheir obfuscation. We have heard some responses from the Hollywood \ncommunity. They said this is a massive tax bill. That is not what the \npurpose was. We amended the amendment so it does not even refer \ndirectly to taxes.\n  The Senator from Vermont mentioned and gave a wonderful rendition of \n``Gone With The Wind'' and ``Star Wars.'' We are not worried about \n``Star Wars.'' We are not worried about ``Gone With The Wind.'' We are \nworried about parents who cannot stop all of the mayhem and violence \nand murder that is being marketed to their kids, to their kids' \nfriends, to their kids' neighbors every time they turn around.\n  We think it is time that somebody looked at how we hold Hollywood \naccountable. I am asking not that we investigate. I believe there is \nenough evidence of these teenage killers, citing the fact that they \nhave been inspired by movies, to know that something has to be done.\n  My good friend from California said, we are regulating content. I \nbelieve she was one of the leaders who argued for regulating the \ncontent of tobacco advertising and said we are going to eliminate \ntobacco advertising. That is content. That is regulation. That is \nregulation of speech.\n  Incidentally, you can regulate what is going to children. We do \nregulate speech. We do not allow pornography to go to kids. We do not \nallow tobacco advertising to go to them. I will tell you something, \nwhen I see ``Basketball Diaries,'' with Leonardo DiCaprio as a teenage \nhero walking into a classroom in a black trenchcoat, with a gun, and \nmurdering his fellow students, I see there is a message that Hollywood \nhas sent to our kids. If I could regulate it, if I could stop it, I \nwould like to stop it.\n  I want to get a national debate going and ask and see how we can stop \nthis filth being targeted at our kids. Does anyone think ``Basketball \nDiaries'' is designed to attract older movie viewers like me? I do not \nthink so. That is targeted directly to kids. How do we deal with that? \nThat is what the Domenici-Bond amendment asks. All of the obfuscation \nand all of the misleading arguments put up by the good folks in \nHollywood are not going to take attention away from the fact that they \nare responsible.\n  Just in the last couple days the President of CBS said he was going \nto withdraw a violent drama called ``Falcone.'' I quote Leslie Moonves.\n\n       While it's not fair to blame the media for the rampage, \n     Moonves said that ``anyone who thinks the media has nothing \n     to do with this is an idiot.''\n\n  I suggest that tells the tale.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. All the Senator wants to do is set up a Commission to \nreview these matters. We have plenty of work in this bill to take care \nof it.\n  Now look, the first amendment is not absolute. There are a lot of \nlimitations on the first amendment recognized by the courts: obscenity, \npornography, fighting words, time restrictions, such as nudity in \ntelevision programming--that may be stopped, television programming \nthat may be aired--indecent speech, exposure to children, and we could \ngo on and on. It isn't like this is something unprecedented.\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\n  I think we have to look at these matters and see what we can do to \nchange the culture in this society, because that is what is wrong. It \nis a lot more important than guns or anything else.\n  We have made it possible for these kids to see all kinds of filth and \nviolence coming out of their ears. After a while, they get so that it \nbecomes part of their lives. That is why this bill is so important. It \nis a lot more important than some of the assertions by some people on \nbehalf of their amendments. But this is an amendment that I think we \nought to vote for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this side has how many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of their \ntime.\n  Mr. BOND.

With respect to the amendment offered today by Senator \nHelms, which amends the Gun Free Schools Act of 1994, I must say that I \nsupport this effort to make our schools gun and drug free.\n  The amendment would require an educational agency that receives \nfederal funds to expel for not less than one year a student determined \nto be in possession of felonious quantities of illegal drugs. We're \ntalking about quantities that indicate hard-core drug use, or drug \ntrafficking. We're talking about dangerous, and predatory, behavior. \nWe've simply got to get the people who bring these things into our \nschools out of our schools.\n  Now, I know that some of my colleagues may be concerned with the \nconsequences of turning disruptive students out onto the streets for \none year. I assure everyone that I understand that concern and direct \ntheir attention to the Alternative Education Grant provision found in \nthe underlying bill. This demonstration grant provides funding to state \nand local education agencies to set up alternative education in \nappropriate settings for disruptive or delinquent students. These \nservices are designed to improve the academic and social performance of \nthese students and to improve the safety and learning environment of \nregular classrooms. This three-year demonstration project will provide \nalternative education to juveniles in trouble with or at risk of \ngetting in trouble with the law, such as students who are expelled for \ncarrying firearms or drugs to school.\n  I applaud the efforts of Senator Helms for continuing to seek \neffective ways to curb the spiraling increase in drug abuse among our \nnation's youth. Anyone familiar with my record on combating illegal \ndrug use knows that I am in favor of stiff penalties designed to deter \ncriminal behavior, and never more so than when we are talking about \nbehavior that harms our school children. I think this amendment, which \ncontains a specific exception to the one-year expulsion rule by \nallowing the chief administering officer of the local educational \nagency to modify the expulsion requirement for students on a case-by-\ncase basis, is a measured and principled response to the scourge of \ndrugs in our schools.\n  Like the original Gun Free Schools Act, this amendment is motivated \nnot only by a desire to punish those who bring illegal objects into \nschools, but also to address the immediate threat to the entire student \npopulation created by the presence of those objects. As with guns, \nfelonious quantities--drug-trafficking quantities--of illegal drugs \npresent a direct and serious hazard, both to the individual possessors, \nand to the other students as well. For this reason, it is appropriate \nthat sanctions be the same in both cases.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be accepted en \nbloc and that any statements relating to the amendments be printed at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 369 and 370), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I send this amendment on behalf of the primary \nsponsors: The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter; the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer; the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer; and the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl; and others.\n  This is a pretty straightforward amendment. My amendment extends for \nanother 5 years the COPS Program which was created in the 1994 crime \nbill. As we all know, the COPS Program has put over 100,000 police \nofficers on the--well, they are not all on the street yet, but it \nfunded 100,000 police officers, of whom about 11,000 are in training \nnow. I have put on the desk of every Member of the Senate a list of the \nnumber of police officers, State and local police officers, that have \nbeen funded under the COPS Program in their States.\n  I have put on the desk of every Member of the Senate the reduction in \nviolent crime, in property crimes, that has occurred in their State \nsince the crime bill of 1994, which was passed, and I would make the \nargument that we do not have to reinvent the wheel here; it works. Cops \non the street through the COPS Program work.\n  The COPS Program is going to expire next year. Our amendment \nauthorizes $1.15 billion per year through the year 2005.\n  Let me explain what it does. There is $600 million more for police on \nthe streets every year, which would give the States up to another \n50,000 police officers over the next 5 years. This money, though, can \nalways be used to retain current officers hired under the COPS Program; \nit can be used to pay overtime; it can be used to reimburse current \ncops for college and graduate school courses up to a percentage of the \ntotal money here.\n  Since the original crime bill was the Biden crime bill that became \nthe 1994 crime bill--we put in this COPS amendment. At the time, we \nwere told by everyone, whether it was liberal newspaper editorials \nsaying, we have tried this before and more cops don't work, or \nconservatives arguing that this was just a great big social welfare \nprogram--it was going to hire a bunch of social workers--we have \ndemonstrated that it had never been done before and it works when it is \ndone.\n\n  I am reminded of the quote attributed to G.K. Chesterton. He said, it \nis not that Christianity has been tried and found wanting; it has been \nfound difficult and left untried.\n  The truth of the matter is, up to the time of the crime bill of 1994, \nwe had never made a full blown major commitment to help local law \nenforcement officers increase their number. We have, in fact, increased \nthe number of cops wearing uniforms--of local police officers, not \nFederal cops--by 100,000 cops. The crime rate has plummeted, not solely \nbecause of that but, I would argue, in large part because of that.\n  Now, I have been here long enough to know that one of the dangers of \nbeing here long enough and having worked hard on setting up a \ngovernment program, which you thought about and conceived and worked on \nfor years and years to get adopted, is that you become a captive of \nyour own program. So the Senator from Pennsylvania and I would talk, \nback in the early days when he got here and I got here, about community \npolicing and how important it was.\n  Cops didn't want community policing. Mayors did not want community \npolicing. No one wanted it. My friend from Pennsylvania talked about \ncareer criminals and pointed out that only 6 percent of the criminals \nin America committed over 60 percent of the violent crimes in America. \nTo both of us, it didn't seem like rocket science. If you focused on \ngoing after that 6 percent and you put more cops on the street and you \ntook them out of patrol cars and put them on a beat, that would have a \npositive impact.\n  I didn't have the experience my friend from Pennsylvania had of being \na prosecutor. I might add, the office he was the chief prosecutor of in \nPhiladelphia tries more criminal cases in 1 year than the entire \nFederal system tries in a year. The entire Federal system tries fewer \ncases than are tried in the Philadelphia prosecutor's office, the \nPhiladelphia DA. I didn't have the experience, but I was smart enough \nto listen to him. And I was smart enough to listen to enough people who \nhave been out there and had the experience. So as hard as it is to \nbelieve, it took us about 6 years to convince people that putting local \ncops on the beat made sense.\n  I have spent, as has the Senator from New Mexico who was on the \nfloor, a long time in this body. I think we both agree that if you take \nthis job seriously and you sit in hearings year after year, day after \nday, month after month, unless you are an absolute idiot, you \neventually learn something. Every single, solitary criminologist, every \nsingle expert, every single person who testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee in the 16 years I chaired it or was a ranking member, said, \nwe don't know a lot about crime but one thing we know: If there is a \ncop on this corner and no cop on the other corner and a crime is going \nto be committed, it is going to be committed where the cop is not.\n  The second thing we know: If you have a cop in a neighborhood and \nthey get to know the folks in the neighborhood, a simple thing \nhappens--trust gets built. They know the cop's name. If they know who \nthe cop is, they are going to be more inclined to call the officer \naside when a crime has been committed and say, Officer John, I know who \ndid that. If it is a wave-by and a cop is going by in a car and he is \nnot a community cop, they don't want to take the chance of putting them \non the line.\n  I realize these are very simple, basic, trite-sounding things I am \nsaying, but this program works. It works well.\n  There are a lot of ideas here that ended up being rejected because \nthey do not pass the test of ``not invented here.'' I realize there are \nsome concerns, on the part particularly of my Republican colleagues, \nthat this may be--and I am not talking about the Senator from \nPennsylvania or anyone in particular--a program that is viewed as being \nidentified with the Democratic Party, the President; therefore, why do \nwe keep it going for another 5 years?\n  I respectfully suggest that there have been some incredibly good \nideas that have come out of the Republican caucus, including the block \ngrant notion for police departments, including more flexibility to be \ngiven to local law enforcement officers. I want my colleagues to know--\nand I understand the limitations my friend from Utah had in being able \nto reach an agreement here--I was prepared to accept the community \nblock grant portion of the Republican program in order to get a \nconsensus in this process. We didn't get there. I hope that when this \npasses, if it passes, we can still, as we move on through this year, \nmove on to that good idea as well. I didn't try to incorporate it here \nbecause it is not my idea, it is the idea of the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and others on the Republican caucus with whom I \nhave to agree.\n  Now, let me say this: One of the things we learned from the COPS \nProgram and its functioning is that, as well as it works, it can be \nmade to work better. I say to my friend from New York, Senator Schumer, \nhe has\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\nbeen deeply involved. He carried this load in the House when we did \nthis in 1994. He was a leader on the COPS Program. What he and I have \nboth found out from our local law enforcement officers is that they \nneed more flexibility. They need to be able to use this COPS money in \nways that go beyond hiring a new shield, to be able to keep cops who \nare on the beat and use this money. They also want to be able to pay \novertime, because they get the same coverage as they would if they \nhired a new cop, if they are allowed to pay overtime. So we built into \nthis extension of the COPS Program more flexibility.\n  To the best of my knowledge--my staff is behind me; I don't have it \nin front of me--I believe every major police organization has endorsed \nthis and endorsed it on this bill, because it works.\n  The second thing--and I will shortly yield to my friend from \nPennsylvania, and then I want to reserve time for my friend from New \nYork as well--is that there is $350 million in here for law enforcement \nto get new technologies to enhance crime fighting, such as better \ncommunications systems so cops in different jurisdictions can \ncommunicate, and even the ability to target hot spots, and new \ninvestigative tools like DNA analysis. The cops have come to me and \nthey have said, this is what we need; this is what we need.\n  I am one who believes that as long as they keep doing the job as well \nas they have been, we should give them the tools they need.\n  There is one last piece, and then I will yield. The cops have been \ndoing such a good job that the prosecutors in Senator Specter's old \noffice are overwhelmed. They are overwhelmed. You put 100,000 more cops \non the job, 545,000 cops who have already been on the job and who had \nnot been in community policing but are all now community police, and \nyou have had a phenomenal impact on crime, but also a phenomenal impact \non putting more pressure on the court systems in the State and local \ngovernments.\n  So there is in this bill $200 million for community prosecutors to \nexpand the community policing concept to engage the whole community in \npreventing crime. These cops, as I said, have been so successful with \ntheir jobs that the next piece of the puzzle, the new bottleneck, is \nState prosecutors. Local prosecutors, they need help. So the next major \npiece of this bill is $200 million for community prosecutors.\n  Lastly, you are only allowed to use a portion of the COPS money for \nthis, but one of the things the cops have come to us and said is, we \nhave a lot of cops who want to increase their education; we have a lot \nof cops who want to go back to college, who want to be better cops. If \nyou are a schoolteacher in most districts and you go off and teach \nschool and you go off and get your graduate degree, the school district \nhelps you pay for that. I think we should be allowing the cops to take \na portion of the money they get and pay for the continuing education of \nlaw enforcement officers. I still believe that the greatest safety lies \nin educated police officers who fully understand the Constitution, who \nincrease their educational background. So that is another innovation in \nthis bill.\n  There is much more in it that I will not bore the floor with at this \ntime. I know a lot of people are trying to get through this bill. I \nrespectfully suggest--and it is imprudent of me to say this--I think \nthis is, in a substantive sense, the single most important amendment we \ncould add to this bill.\n  I guarantee you--and I am willing to bet anybody in this body \ndinner--that if we add another 50,000 cops out there and this \ntechnology, we are going to have a significantly greater impact on \nreducing juvenile crime than we would without it. It works, folks. \nLet's not reinvent the wheel.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time remains \nin control of the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 33 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes to my friend from \nPennsylvania and 9 minutes to my friend from New York. I will reserve 2 \nminutes for myself to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 9 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for \nyielding me the time and for submitting this amendment, which I have \ncosponsored. I believe that police on the street constitute a very \nsignificant deterrent effect--and that the 95,000 or 100,000 police who \nhave been added across America have been a factor in reducing the crime \nrate--which we have noted in the past several years. I think that is \none factor.\n  The additional prison space, the fact that more men and women are \nincarcerated--regrettably, but necessarily--I think has been a \ncontributing factor. The armed career criminal bill, which provides for \na sentence for 15 years to life for those found in possession of a gun \nand have committed three or more serious offenses has been a \nsignificant contributing factor.\n  I would like to offer a comment or two about the bill. I compliment \nSenator Hatch and Senator Leahy, the managers of the bill, for the work \nthey have done. I am hopeful that within the authorized portions of \nthis bill comes to the appropriations process, there will be an even \n50/50 split on measures designed for prosecution and incarceration, \ncontrasted with measures for rehabilitation, job training, and \neducation.\n  When we deal with juvenile offenders, we deal with a category of \noffenders who will one day get out. I believe--based on the experience \nI had being district attorney of Philadelphia for 8 years where the \nprincipal job was prosecution, tough sentences for tough criminals, and \ndealing with career criminals--that when we deal with offenders who are \ngoing to be released, we ought to have rehabilitation. It is no \nsurprise when a functional illiterate, without a trade or a skill, \nleaves incarceration will go back to a life of crime. It is not only in \nthe interest of the individual to have rehabilitation, but also in the \ninterest of law-abiding citizens to avoid having that individual become \na repeater.\n  The same thing, candidly, applies to first and second offenders. \nWhere we have a career criminal--somebody who has three or more major \noffenses--then I think life imprisonment and throwing away the key is \nthe appropriate consequence. When we deal with juveniles, we ought to \nbe aware of the so-called seamless web, to apply 50 percent of the \nfunding which, of course, comes to the attention of the appropriators. \nI considered submitting an amendment which would have called for a 50/\n50 split between the tough aspect of prosecution and incarceration \ncontrasted with rehabilitation, literacy training, and job training. I \ndecided not to do that since it really is within the function of the \nappropriators.\n  I have a comment on the vote in the Senate to defeat the provision \nthat was offered as an amendment yesterday. This would have imposed, in \nthis bill, a mandatory requirement on the States that all those 14 \nyears and older be tried as adults on a category of serious offenses. \nThat was defeated soundly. A majority of Republicans voted against it, \nand I voted against it, and I was glad to see that amendment rejected \non a number of grounds. One is that we ought not to be dictating to the \nStates how they construct their juvenile justice system. And we ought \nnot to condition Federal funding, which would be the stick to dictate \nthe States as to how they operate.\n  The other concern I had was that being tough on crime is very, very \nimportant, but there are a lot of variations on juveniles. The theory \nof the juvenile court was to treat an adjudication of delinquency as \nthose under 18. There is ample discretion in the juvenile court to have \na juvenile tried as an adult for a serious offense. That flexibility \nought to be left to the juvenile courts, and that flexibility and that \ndetermination ought to be left to the States.\n  Overall, I think this bill will be a step forward. The legislation \nthat has been enacted with respect to guns, I think, has to be viewed \nas only a part of the picture. My own reluctance on the restrictions on \nguns has come from the fact that there has not been an appropriate \nresponse by the courts on tough sentences for tough criminals.\n\n  There are three layers that we have to attack on this line. I have \ndiscussed two. One is the life sentences and the long periods of \nincarceration for career criminals. Second, is realistic rehabilitation \nfor juveniles and other offenders\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\nwho will be released from jail. Third, is the violence that has gripped \nAmerica--juvenile violence especially.\n  After Littleton, CO, I called Dr. Koop, former Surgeon General, who \ncommented to me that he had--as early as 1982--filed a report \nidentifying juvenile violence as a medical problem. I conferred with \nSurgeon General Satcher on the issue. We are trying to structure \nhearings on the Appropriations subcommittee I chair on health and human \nservices which funds the Office of Surgeon General. Those three lines, \nI think, have to be studied very closely--the sentencing for career \ncriminals and rehabilitation for those who will be released and an \neffort to understand and try to deal with the culture of violence we \nhave in our society today.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Delaware. I yield \nthe floor, releasing the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 9 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the \nSenator from Delaware not only for his generous use of the time--which \nI will not need all of--but, more importantly, for his leadership on \nthis issue in 1994, and again today. And I thank my friend from \nPennsylvania, as well, for both of those things.\n  I have been in this Congress a long time; this is my 19th year. I \nhave rarely seen a program be as effective as the COPS Program. It has \nworked. It has brought police officers and, just as important, new \npolicing techniques from the largest city to the smallest rural hamlet. \nBefore this bill passed, America, from one end of the country to the \nother, was crying out: Do something about ending crime.\n  Some said it is a local issue, not a Federal issue. But the average \nperson didn't care about that. The average person just said to his or \nher government: Please, in God's name, do something. Stop the \nrobberies, stop the burglaries, stop the auto thefts, and stop the \nmurders.\n  A number of us who were concerned about this issue, including the \nSenator from Delaware, the Senator from Pennsylvania, and myself when I \nwas then in the House, just scoured the country. We tried to find out \nwhat worked--not ideological, but something where we could have \nprevention or punishment. We found out that community policing worked \njust about better than anything else. Yes, we should have incarcerated \nmore criminals--now we are--and had tougher penalties. Yes, we needed \nafterschool programs and things to help.\n  The bill Senator Biden and I authored--he in the Senate and myself in \nthe House--was called ``tough on punishment, smart on prevention.'' \nThat was our credo. Probably the most important and best program in \nthat bill was the COPS Program. As I say, I have seen it work in every \npart of my State.\n  Violence is down, property theft is down, police officers are more \nfulfilled in the job that they do. In my own home State, in Buffalo, \ncrime has been slashed more than 30 percent; in Albany, 24 percent; in \nNassau County, 24 percent; in New York City, 44 percent. Talk to police \nchiefs, talk to ordinary cops, talk to criminologists; they will all \npoint to the COPS Program.\n  My colleagues, this program expires in the year 2000. If it is so \nsuccessful, and if we want to continue our fight against crime, we \nshould be doing this. Keep up tough punishment, keep up smart \nprevention, but continue to fund this successful program.\n  My colleague from Delaware is not being hyperbolic when he says this \nis one of the most important programs that we passed. We need to \ncontinue it. And putting 30 to 50 new officers on the beat, \nparticularly the middled-sized and small cities, which have not applied \nbecause they haven't had the chance that the larger cities have had, is \nvital. It will help economically distressed communities, which all of \nus represent--no matter what part of the country we are in--to absorb \nsome of the long-term costs of new police hires. And when crime goes \ndown, which it does, because of the COPS Program, there are more jobs \nin a community, there is better health in a community, and the \neducational system works better in a community. It is good in every \nway.\n  COPS isn't the only reason crime has gone down. But, just the same, \nno one can reasonably claim it is not a good part of the reason.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest of terms to support this \namendment to continue this magnificently successful program.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to reserve the remainder of \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves 9 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The time the Senator from Delaware so generously yielded \nto me I yield right back to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nOklahoma desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Biden, who is on the floor. Maybe he can \nanswer a couple of questions.\n  I am trying to find out how much this amendment costs. Can you tell \nme how much it costs a year?\n  Mr. BIDEN. It will cost over 5 years $1.15 billion--total cost for 5 \nyears.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Maybe I am reading the amendment wrong. The way I am \nreading the amendment, it says----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I beg the Senator's pardon. It is $1.150 billion per year.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just a few billion dollars.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Over 5 years--it is over $1 billion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. $1.150 billion each year.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is to hire how many cops?\n  Mr. BIDEN. It could hire up to 50,000 cops.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One-hundred and fifty thousand, or fifty thousand?\n  Mr. BIDEN. It could fund 50,000 cops for the entirety of the 5 years. \nBut it could also only hire 30,000 cops, if in Oklahoma City they \ndecide to use the COPS money for overtime instead of hiring new \nshields.\n  Mr. NICKLES. What is the estimated cost, or subsidy, or the Federal \npayment per cop?\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is roughly $50,000.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The first year?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The first year--per year.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me back up. I will reclaim my time, but please \ncorrect me if I am wrong. I asked staff how much this subsidy cost, and \nthey said the old program cost a total of $75,000 over 3-year period--\n$50,000 the first year, $15,000 the second year, and $10,000 the third \nyear--for a total over a 3-year period of $75,000 in a Federal subsidy.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The staff tells me that under the proposed new \nauthorization that cost rises from $75,000 to $125,000 per police \nofficer. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I don't know how they get that number.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am just getting it from staff. My point is that this \nis an enormously expensive program.\n  Let me ask the question a different way. If I can have the Senator's \nattention, I only have 7 minutes and I have to go kind of quick.\n  Can he tell how much the cost is per cop per subsidy per year? It is \ngraduated--100 percent the first year, and some other reduced \npercentage over the next 2 years. Can the Senator give us those \npercentages?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The same as the existing COPS Program.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me reclaim my time. On page 10 of the amendment, it \nsays ``hiring cops.'' It says the bill is amended by striking $75,000 \nand inserting $125,000.\n  The cost of this program--the subsidy of this program right now of \nthe current program, the one we have had for the last 5 years--has been \na Federal subsidy per cop of $75,000. That is a pretty generous \nsubsidy. I believe the first year subsidy is $50,000. In Oklahoma that \nmay pay the entire salary of a cop. Maybe it doesn't in some places. \nBut it does in my State. Then the subsidy is reduced the next couple of \nyears so that by the fourth year, the total cost of the program needs \nto be borne by the city.\n  This subsidy is much greater. The Senator's amendment says the \nsubsidy increases from $75,000 to $125,000. For\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\n$125,000, you can pay, frankly, probably the entire 3-year salary in \nmany areas--certainly in rural areas. And some people said we purported \nto help them particularly.\n  I just question the wisdom of doing it.\n  I have just two more comments. We are having the Federal Government \nprovide for police in cities, and that is not a Federal responsibility. \nI think it is a mistake.\n  I also think it is kind of gratuitous to say this program is \nresponsible for the decline in crime rates. I think that might be a lot \nmore attributable to a change in political leadership in the states and \nin the Congress. I know the mayor in New York City has had a different \nphilosophy on crime which is greatly responsible for the reduction in \ncrime. Now he may take advantage of this program. In a lot of cities \nthey are going to say: Hey, if you will help pay for our police force, \nthank you very much.\n  But why should we be doing it? Is that a Federal responsibility?\n  The whole purpose of the program initially, if I understand it, was \nthat we were going to put 100,000 cops on the street, but then phase it \nout. This was not going to be an addiction for cities. We would phase \nit out where the Federal Government may pay 100 percent the first year, \nbut by the fourth year the subsidy is reduced to zero. Put another way, \nwhere the Federal Government was paying most of the subsidy to get this \nthing started to hire new cops, but by the fourth year the cost would \nbe totally borne by the city. Now we are saying let's extend it. Let's \njust keep this thing going. Let's have more Federal cops.\n  Then we passed an amendment yesterday, for the information of my \ncolleagues, over my objection. But it passed by unanimous consent, \nunfortunately. It said that we have a COPS Program, and some of these \ncops are going into schools, and we will waive the requirement of local \nmatching funds. In other words, the cops will be paid for 100 percent \nby the Federal Government. That is now part of this bill. We will waive \nthe local contribution. So it won't be just a partial Federal subsidy, \nit will be a total Federal subsidy.\n  Is that the Federal Government's responsibility? I don't think so.\n  If we want to subsidize cities, subsidize cities. We are saying: \nWell, let's have the Federal Government do it. We have a problem. Let's \njust write a check. We don't think the city should be able to decide \ntheir own needs.\n  Maybe they need computers and cars, and not cops. Maybe they need a \ndifferent training program. But we are saying, no: you are going to \nhave the cops.\n  There is a study that was done by the inspector general, the IG. \nMaybe the Senator from Utah will allude to it. The IG's research said--\nin just one example--52 out of 67 grantees are receiving more grants; \n78 percent either could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers, \nor could not demonstrate they had a system in place to track the \nredeployment of officers into community policing. At that point, the \nCOPS office counted 35,852 officers under more programs toward the \nPresident's goal of adding 100,000: we hadn't made it to 100,000. It \nsays 60 of 147 grantees--41 percent--showed indicators of using Federal \nfunds to supplement local funding instead of using grant funds to \nsupplement local funding.\n  In other words, hey, Federal Government, thank you very much. You are \nhelping meet our budgets, and we appreciate the contribution. \nMeanwhile, it just so happens that we have a Federal Government that \ndoesn't have a surplus, if you do not include the Social Security \nsurplus.\n  I don't think we should be subsidizing cities. I don't think we \nshould get cities addicted to this program that will never end, \nespecially when you are talking about increasing the cost from $75,000 \nper police officer to $125,000. I don't think we can afford that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I recommend to the Senator from Delaware \nthat what we should have done is consider this amendment--that is, the \nSenator's legislative proposal--on the Department of Justice \nreauthorization bill, and deal with this issue at that time, but only \nafter hearings to see whether we can resolve some of these problems \nraised by the Inspector General. The Biden amendment reauthorizes the \nClinton administration's COPS Program. This amendment would cost in the \nneighborhood of $7 billion. It doubles the cost of this bill. I don't \noppose more money to hire police and have law enforcement, but we need \nto ensure flexibility in our grant programs. The Biden amendment does \nnot provide for adequate flexibility. The Congress has provided \nflexible grants to law enforcement through the local law enforcement \nblock grants.\n  Ironically, the President's budget zeros out funding for the block \ngrant program. Here we are debating a $7 billion amendment. The \nDepartment of Justice is proud of this program, but the Department of \nJustice's Inspector General does not share their view. The Department \nof Justice's Inspector General found serious mismanagement and \ninappropriate use of funds.\n  Let me cite a few examples that the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma referred to:\n  20 out of 145 grantees, 14 percent, overestimated salaries and or \nbenefits in their grant application. I won't read all of this, but let \nme cite just a few more.\n  74 of 146 grantees, 51 percent, included unallowable costs in claims \nfor reimbursement; 52 out of 67 grantees receiving COPS MORE grants, 78 \npercent, either could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers or \ncould not demonstrate they had a system in place to track redeployment \nof officers in community policing; 60 of 147 grantees, 41 percent, \nshowed indications of using Federal funds to supplant local funding, \ninstead of using grant funds to supplement local funding; 83 of 144 \ngrantees, 58 percent, either did not develop a good-faith plan to \nretain officer positions or said they would not retain the officer at \nthe conclusion of the grant.\n  I believe there are some positive aspects to the COPS Program, but a \n$7 billion program with serious questions concerning the management of \nthe program and the use of grants by recipients should not pass the \nSenate with only a 45-minute debate.\n  I want to work with my colleagues on the law enforcement grant \nprograms, but we should not try to do it on this bill. I will work with \nanyone who wishes to join me, but not on this bill. I plan to move a \nDepartment of Justice reauthorization bill later this year. If my \ncolleagues truly wish to work with me, I suggest to them we do this on \nthat authorization bill.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I reserve my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 9 minutes and \nthe Senator from Utah has 5 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Hatch chairs the Judiciary \nCommittee. It would be the responsibility of that committee to give \noversight to the COPS Program. It has been a 5-year program and \nrequires a reauthorization.\n  We just received, within the last month or 6 weeks, an inspector \ngeneral's report from the Department of Justice. This is President \nClinton's Department of Justice. It raised serious concerns about how \nthis program is being managed and administered.\n  When 78 percent of the recipients could not demonstrate they \nredeployed officers, or could not demonstrate they had a system in \nplace to track the redeployment of officers in the community policing, \nthen we have a problem, since the whole COPS Program was sold as a \nprogram to further community policing. It was supposed to bring new \npolice officers on line.\n  We found 41 percent of the programs inspected by President Clinton's \nDepartment showed indicators of using Federal funds to supplant local \nfunds instead of using grant funds to supplement local funding.\n  I am reading directly from the report.\n  These are very serious allegations. To pass this amendment, $7 \nbillion to reauthorize this program, in the dead of night without any \nhearing would be a colossal blunder. It would be an abdication of our \nresponsibility, especially\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\nin light of this scathing report by the inspector general's office. The \nthought of it boggles my mind. I can't believe it would be even \nsuggested.\n  We ought to review, as we were supposed to when the program passed 5 \nyears ago, how it has worked. We haven't had any hearings on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden. I \nwould like to take this moment to highlight one element of Senator \nBiden's amendment, the extension and expansion of the Community \nOriented Policing Services (COPS) Program.\n  I have heard one consistent theme throughout the debate on this \njuvenile justice bill: a desire to stop, once and for all, the \nsenseless schoolhouse shootings like those that occurred in Littleton, \nJonesboro and Paducah. There is a growing sense among Americans that we \nare no longer safe in our homes, in our schools, in our communities. \nBut while we have heard sharply disparate views about issues like gun \ncontrol and content of video games in the debate so far, one sure way \nto reduce crime and restore peace of mind is through community oriented \npolicing.\n  As you are aware, the COPS Program was established in 1994 to put \nmore police officers on the streets and to encourage police interaction \nwith the communities in which they work. This program is a shining \nexample of an effective partnership between local and federal \ngovernments. It provides federal assistance to meet local objectives. \nIt does not interfere with local prerogatives; it does not impose \nmandates. The program provides funding to counties, towns and cities to \nenable communities to put more police on the street. Individual police \nand sheriff's departments have discretion over how those funds are \nused, because they know what problems their communities face and the \nplaces they need help most.\n  COPS has had a positive, and very tangible, impact on communities \nthroughout the country, including in my home state of Wisconsin, by \nputting more police officers on our streets and making our citizens \nsafer. In the state of Wisconsin alone, COPS has funded over 1,100 new \nofficers and contributed more than $70 million to communities to make \nit happen. The COPS Program has succeeded because it helps individual \nofficers to be a friendly and familiar presence in their communities. \nThey are building relationships with people from house to house, block \nto block, school to school. This community policing helps the police to \ndo their job better, makes the neighborhoods and schools safer and, \nvery importantly, gives residents peace of mind.\n  Let me illustrate the strong causal relationship between community \noriented policing and a reduction in the crime rate. I would like to \nshare with you the story of Chief Jeff Lieberman of Fountain City, \nWisconsin. Chief Lieberman polices a small town with big city crime \nproblems. Chief Lieberman moved to Fountain City in 1992 and was faced \nwith an alarming juvenile crime rate. What could he do to decrease the \njuvenile crime rate? While jails were being built and sentences were \nbeing stiffened, Chief Lieberman reached out to the community. He \nembarked upon a crusade to visit classrooms and teach children about \nlaw enforcement and safety. To allow the children to relate to him as \nthey would to any other person and feel comfortable talking to him, he \nwould sometimes dress in shorts and bring his dog to class. Not only \nhas he won their respect, the children now show greater respect for \ntheir community. This success is reflected by the fact that during his \ntenure, he has reduced the juvenile crime rate by an astonishing 99%.\n  Chief Lieberman has earned a reputation in the community as a caring \nand compassionate citizen, as well as an outstanding law enforcement \nofficer. I might add that Chief Lieberman was recently recognized for \nhis effective community oriented policing by the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial Fund as the March 1999 Officer of the \nMonth.\n  I do not believe the answer to the tragedies in Littleton, Jonesboro \nand Paducah is one extreme or the other--a ban on all guns or \ncensorship of the entertainment industry. The answer is to educate our \nyoung people, nurture them, protect them and give them thousands more \n``Chief Liebermans'' across this country. Senator Biden's bill does \njust that. It provides for expanding the much-lauded COPS Program to \nensure that we have 30,000 to 50,000 ``Chief Liebermans'' in schools, \ntowns and cities across, not only Wisconsin, but the entire nation. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and \ncontinuing our drive to put more police officers on the streets and in \ntouch with their communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me make just a few more comments on this amendment. It \nhas been suggested by the amendment's sponsors that the COPS program is \nresponsible for the decline in crime in our country. Now, crime rates \nare still far too high, and are very high by historical standards. Be \nthat as it may, we have seen some improvement in the past several \nyears. But has the COPS Program been responsible for even the modest \nimprovements we have seen? The evidence certainly suggests not.\n  First of all, the program's grants have always been too spread out to \nhave more than a marginal impact on crime rates. Second, law \nenforcement authorities themselves have been skeptical. For instance, \nin 1995, Chicago experienced sizable reductions in murder, robbery, and \nassault well before the COPS Program ever got off the ground. The \nChicago Police Department cited a number of local initiatives that made \na difference, including tracking every gun used by juvenile offenders, \nand using a towing ordinance in effect for narcotics and prostitution \nenforcement.\n  Time and time again, the factor cited by the successful police \nexecutives traced the roots not to the Federal Government, but to local \ninstitutions, citizens, and police chiefs imposing accountability on \ntheir local police departments.\n  Perhaps the best example of all is New York City, where a new police \nchief successfully attacked quality-of-life crimes and enforced \naccountability for the officers of the New York Police Department by \nsetting standards of performance backed by a system of incentives and \ndisincentives. New York City's murder rate fell so fast its decrease \nalone accounted for over 25 percent of the total nationwide drop in \nhomicides in 1996.\n  In 1997, the 21.7-percent drop in murders in New York City \nrepresented 14.8 percent of the total national decrease in murders. \nYet, in New York City, which had 38,189 police officers in 1996, they \nadded precisely 342 Clinton cops by 1995. Only 28 of the 342 new cops \nwere actually new hires.\n  I would like hearings on this matter. I would like another full \nauthorization bill. I hope our colleagues will not vote to double the \ncosts of this bill with this particular amendment, as well intended as \nit is.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware knows that I have great \nfeelings for him and for what he is trying to do, but I also believe we \nought to do it in the right way.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Benjamin Disraeli says there are three kinds of lies: \nlies, damn lies, and statistics.\n  I don't know where my friends have been. Every major police agency in \nthe United States of America strongly endorses this particular bill. \nThe National Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations.\n  You all ought to go home and speak to your chiefs. Find me in your \nState more than a handful of police officers who will come and say this \nis a bad idea. Find me anybody in this country who will say adding \n92,000 cops on the street has not had an impact on crime.\n  Where have you been? What are we talking about here? This doesn't \neven pass the smell test. Those cops don't matter? Ask Rudy Giuliani, \nwho picks up the phone and calls me and says, Joe, great idea, when the \nCOPS bill passed.\n  Mr. Riordan, a Republican mayor in Los Angeles: Great bill.\n  I wonder if anybody goes home to their States. My Lord, I don't know \nwhere you all are. I look at these numbers.\n  Let's talk about that report. Remember, I said there are three kinds \nof lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics.\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\n  That report referred to by the inspector general says 1.2 percent of \nthe COPS Program could have been spent better. Name for me a \nmultibillion-dollar program the Federal Government has ever conceived \nthat has a 1.2-percent problem.\n  Come on. As my daughter's friends would say, Get real. What are we \ntalking about here?\n  I was so amazed by the assertions being made, I lost my train of \nthought here. The inspector general's report, ``Summary of the Findings \nof the IG,'' page II:\n\n       In considering our COPS audit results it should be kept in \n     mind that they may well not represent the overall universe of \n     grantees because, as a matter of policy, the COPS program has \n     referred to us for review those riskiest grantees.\n\n  Do you get this? Unlike the Defense Department, the Department of \nEducation, any other Department, the Attorney General's Office said, we \nthink maybe some of what we put out there may not be being used \nproperly, so you go out and investigate for us. Give me a break.\n  When is the last time you heard someone at the Defense Department \nsay: You know, we may have overpaid a contract; you ought to go \ninvestigate.\n  When is the last time you heard someone at the Department of \nEducation say: You know, we think we may have given a school district \ntoo much money; go investigate.\n  With the Attorney General of the United States of America, in the \nCOPS Program, there is a department called COPS. They said: We want you \nto look at this. We could have made some mistakes here. We are not \ncertain that every municipality used this money for cops the way we \nwanted to use it. Go look at it.\n  Now these guys are trying to hoist them on their own request?\n  By the way, 1.2 percent? I ask my friend from Oklahoma, let's look at \nthe Defense Department; 1.2 percent? I will lay you 8 to 5 I can find a \n50-percent waste of money in half the programs you support: 1.2 \npercent, what an indictment. Come on. You do not like the COPS Program \nbecause it was not invented there.\n  By the way, I find it fascinating. One of my friends said: You know, \npart of the problem here is this has nothing to do with COPS. It had to \ndo with political leadership.\n  Guess who has been in charge. A guy named Clinton. That is the first \nadmission I have heard: Clinton reduced crime, more than the COPS \nProgram. More than the COPS Program. I find that not true, but kind of \nencouraging.\n  Look, COPS makes a difference. Ask your folks back home, ask the \npeople in the gallery, ask the people out in the street, where would \nthey rather have their money being spent? This works. This works.\n  By the way, this bill has a little provision Barbara Boxer has in \nhere. It says we will pay for all the money it costs to put a cop in a \nschool. Go home and tell the folks you do not want to do that. Go home \nand tell the folks that is simply a local requirement.\n  Inflexibility? The reason it is under $25,000 is flexibility. We want \nto give them more flexibility to use the moneys they can use, still \nrequiring the local municipality, the State, to put up their own money \nto do this. Come on, name a program that has worked this well. Name a \nprogram that has had this much success. Name a program that has this \nlittle amount of waste. Name a program that has fewer Federal strings \nattached to it. Name a program.\n  By the way: Oversight; oversight. We have had 5 years to have \noversight. One of the reasons we have not had oversight hearings, I \nsuspect, is you do not want to hear the results. Call in your mayors, \ncall in your chiefs of police, call in your citizens, call in the PTA, \ncall in the Marines. Call in anybody you want. Say: ``By the way, I'll \ntell you what we are going to do. We are going to cut funding for COPS, \nthat's what we're are going to do.'' I dare you. Come on.\n  In New York City--I do not know how many New York received. I will \ntell you what, New York State over this period received--I bring up the \nsubject because New York was mentioned --New York State has 10,550 \ncops. ``But they did not make any difference, by the way. New York is \nsafer because there is a Republican mayor. That is the reason. COPS had \nnothing to do with this, nothing to do with this. I want you all to \nknow that, COPS had nothing to do with crime going down.''\n  Does everybody hear that? Is everybody listening? ``The additional \ncops have nothing to do with this.'' That is the Republican position. \nCOPS do not have anything to do with this. If they do, the Federal \nGovernment should not be involved.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. My friend says, why should the \nFederal Government be involved? Because Federal policy is part of the \nproblem. The drug problem in America is a Federal problem, not just a \nlocal problem. A significant portion of the crime is caused as a \nconsequence of the international drug problem, and it is a Federal \nproblem, Federal responsibility.\n  I thank my friend. I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I note the distinguished Senator did not \ndispute the findings of the inspector general.\n  I ask unanimous consent an editorial from USA Today entitled \n``100,000-cops program proves to be mostly hype'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Apr. 13, 1999]\n\n             100,000-Cops Program Proves To Be Mostly Hype\n\n       Nassau County, N.Y., needed more police, or so it said. So, \n     Uncle Sam ponied up $26 million from President Clinton's \n     much-vaunted Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) \n     program to help it add 383 police to the beat.\n       And what happened? In an audit being compiled for the \n     Justice Department, its Office of Inspector General found \n     that the actual number of county-funded police officers went \n     from 3,053 in May 1995 to 2,835 in May 1998--a decline of \n     218.\n       What's going on? A lot of funny number crunching at the \n     expense of taxpayers and possibly crime-fighting.\n       When President Clinton initiated the $8.8 billion program \n     in 1994, he promised it would put 100,000 more police on the \n     street after five years. Then, communities pay their own \n     tabs.\n       But Nassau County is one of more than 100 communities where \n     federal auditors found costly problems. A final report \n     detailing them is expected this week. And initial research \n     for that report paints a bleak picture.\n       Richmond, Calif., for example, received $944,000 in COPS \n     grants from 1995 to 1997 to add nine officers. It used the \n     money to fund vacant positions instead. Atlanta, federal \n     auditors found, used COPS money to replace it own police \n     funds, too. And auditors looking at $400,000 in grants for \n     Alexandria, Va., found no documentation that equipment \n     purchased with the grant money put more officers on the \n     street as pledged.\n       Many of the communities have excuses. For instance, Nassau \n     County is in fiscal crisis.\n       The discrepancies, though, indicate much of the hype for \n     COPS is misleading.\n       Two weeks ago, Vice President Al Gore claimed COPS had \n     already added 92,000 police, who were playing ``a significant \n     role in reducing crime,'' Yet, as the audits indicate, the \n     numbers don't add up. Many of the new police are fictitious. \n     In addition, the administration counted 2,000 police hired \n     with prior federal grants toward the 100,000 goal.\n       Finally, a third of the counted positions have come from \n     grants funding new civilian positions and equipment, not \n     police. Spokane, Wash., which wasn't audited, says it added \n     only a couple of dozen officers, though it was credited with \n     adding more than 90. The reason: a $2.5 million equipment \n     grant.\n       As for the claim that more police equals less crime, the \n     evidence isn't clear.\n       Nassau County, despite its drop in police, has seen its \n     crime rate drop as much as in New York City, which has \n     increased its force by a third since 1992. And many \n     communities that didn't accept any COPS grants saw crime \n     decline precipitously, too.\n       The COPS program has done little to explain these \n     discrepancies. It instead points to support from police \n     chiefs and national crime statistics as proof the program \n     works.\n       The public naturally wants safer streets, and the Clinton \n     administration is trying to politically cash in again by \n     pushing a new $6.4 billion plan to add up to 50,000 more \n     police on the beat. But before Congress gives it the money, \n     it should demand that the administration better monitor its \n     grants and results. Taxpayers shouldn't be asked to pay for \n     police who may not even be there.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the report of the \nIG be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\n  Police Hiring and Redeployment Grants Summary of Audit Findings and \n    Recommendations, October 1996-September 1998--Executive Summary\n\n\n                             i. background\n\n       In 1994, the President pledged to put 100,000 additional \n     police officers on America's streets to promote community \n     participation in the fight against crime. He subsequently \n     signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n     1994 (Crime Act), authorizing the Attorney General to \n     implement over six years an $8.8 billion grant program for \n     state and local law enforcement agencies to hire or redeploy \n     100,000 additional officers to perform community policing.\n       The Attorney General established the Office of Community \n     Oriented Policing Services (COPS) to administer the grant \n     programs and to advance community policing across the \n     country. Management of the COPS grants entails both program \n     and financial management. The COPS office is responsible for: \n     (1) developing and announcing grant programs, (2) monitoring \n     programmatic issues related to grants, (3) receiving and \n     reviewing applications, and (4) deciding which grants to \n     award. The Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs \n     (OJP) is responsible for financial management of the COPS \n     program and is charged with: (1) disbursing federal funds to \n     grantees, (2) providing financial management assistance after \n     COPS has made an award, (3) reviewing pre-award and post-\n     award financial activity, (4) reviewing and approving grant \n     budgets, and (5) financial monitoring of COPS awards.\n       In order to meet the President's goal of putting 100,000 \n     additional police officers on the street, COPS developed six \n     primary hiring and redeployment grant programs for state and \n     local law enforcement agencies. Hiring grants fund the hiring \n     of additional police officers and generally last for three \n     years. Redeployment grants are generally one-year grants and \n     fund the costs of equipment and technology, and support \n     resources (including civilian personnel) to free existing \n     officers from administrative duties and redeploy them to the \n     streets. At the end of the grant period, the state or local \n     entity is expected to continue funding the new positions or \n     continue the time savings that resulted from the equipment or \n     technology purchases using its own funds.\n       According to COPS, as of February 1999, COPS and OJP had \n     awarded approximately $5 billion in grants under the six \n     programs to fund the hiring or redeployment of more than \n     92,000 officers, of which 50,139 officers had been hired and \n     deployed to the streets. COPS obtains its ``on the street'' \n     officer count by periodically contacting grantees by \n     telephone.\n\n\n                          ii. summary findings\n\n       From October 1996 through September 1998, the Office of the \n     Inspector General (OIG) performed 149 audits of COPS and OJP \n     hiring and redeployment grants totaling $511 million, or 10 \n     percent of the funds COPS has obligated for the program. We \n     continue to perform additional grant audits as our resources \n     permit. Executive summaries of these audits are available for \n     public review on our website: . A \n     comprehensive program audit of COPS' and OJP's administration \n     of the overall $8.8 billion Community Policing Grant Program \n     is nearing completion and should be issued in the next few \n     months.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ In addition to expanding on issues contained in this \n     summary report, the program audit will report on COPS' \n     ability to meet the President's goal to put 100,000 \n     additional police officers on the street by 2000. The exact \n     nature of the goal has become confused because of conflicting \n     statements made by Administration officials, who state that \n     the goal is to put 100,000 new officers on the street by the \n     year 2000, and recent statements made to use by COPS \n     officials, who state that the goal is to fund 100,000 new \n     officers. The program audit addresses that issue at length \n     and also addresses COPS' and OJP's monitoring of grantees and \n     the quality of guidance provided to grantees to assist them \n     in implementing essential grant requirements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Our audits focus on: (1) the allowability of grant \n     expenditures; (2) whether local matching funds were \n     previously budgeted for law enforcement; (3) the \n     implementation or enchantment of community policing \n     activities; (4) hiring efforts to fill vacant sworn officer \n     positions; (5) plans to retain officer positions at grant \n     completion; (6) grantee reporting; and (7) analyses of \n     supplanting issues. For the 149 grant audits, we identified \n     about $52 million in questioned costs and about $71 million \n     in funds that could be better used. Our dollar-related \n     findings amount to 24 percent of the total funds awarded to \n     the 149 grantees.\n       In considering our COPS audit results, it should be kept in \n     mind that they:\n       (1) Are snapshots as of the grant report's issuance date. \n     Subsequent communication between the auditee and COPS/OJP may \n     result in correction to, or elimination of, the issues noted \n     during our audit; and\n       (2) May well not be representative of the overall universe \n     of grantees because, as a matter of policy, COPS has referred \n     to us for review what it believes to be its riskiest \n     grantees. During FY 1998, we began supplementing COPS \n     requests for audits by selecting about one-half of the \n     grantees ourselves. Our results to date, however, may still \n     be skewed because of the number of audits conducted on COPS-\n     requested grantees and because our selections were not \n     entirely random. Some of our audits were also intended to \n     be targeted at suspected problem grantees. (Of the 149 \n     audits we performed through September 30, 1998, 103 were \n     referred to us by COPS or OJP. Although we selected only \n     46 of the 149 audits summarized in this report ourselves, \n     our results to date do not differ markedly from the \n     results in the COPS/OJP referred audits.) It should also \n     be noted that COPS and OJP do not always agree with our \n     findings and recommendations. Upon further review and \n     follow-up, COPS and/or OJP may conclude that, in their \n     judgment, a grant violation did not occur.\n       Other findings include:\n       20 of 145 grantees (14 percent) overestimated salaries and/\n     or benefits in their grant application. The COPS office \n     depends primarily on the information provided by the law \n     enforcement departments that submit the grant applications. \n     When grantees overestimate salaries and/or benefits, COPS \n     overobligates funds that could be available for use \n     elsewhere. Also, grantees may be using the excess grant funds \n     for purposes that are unallowable.\n       74 of 146 grantees (51 percent) included unallowable costs \n     in their claims for reimbursement. Types of unallowable costs \n     include overtime, uniforms, and fringe benefits not \n     previously approved by OJP. When grantees overstate costs, \n     COPS program costs are overstated and taxpayer money is at \n     risk.\n       52 of 67 grantees receiving MORE grants (78 percent) either \n     could not demonstrate that they redeployed officers or could \n     not demonstrate that they had a system in place to track the \n     redeployment of officers into community policing. The COPS \n     office counts 35,852 officers under the MORE program towards \n     the President's goal of adding 100,000 additional officers.\n       60 of 147 grantees (41 percent) showed indicators of using \n     federal funds to supplant local funding instead of using \n     grant funds to supplement local funding. The findings \n     included budgeting for decreases in local positions after \n     receiving COPS grants (27 grantees), using COPS funds to pay \n     for local officers already on board (7 grantees), not filling \n     vacancies promptly (22 grantees), and not meeting the \n     requirements of providing matching funds (35 grantees). When \n     grantees use grant funds to replace local funds rather than \n     to hire new officers, additional officers are not added to \n     the nation's streets. Instead, federal funds are used to pay \n     for existing police officers.\n       83 of 144 grantees (58 percent) either did not develop a \n     good faith plan to retain officer positions or said they \n     would not retain the officer positions at the conclusion of \n     the grant. COPS and OJP started awarding community policing \n     grants in FY 1994 and most grants last for about three years. \n     If COPS positions are not retained beyond the conclusion of \n     the grant, then COPS will have been a short-lived phenomena, \n     rather than helping to launch a lasting change in policing.\n       106 of 140 grantees (76 percent) either failed to submit \n     COPS initial reports, annual reports, or officer progress \n     reports, or submitted these reports late. The reports are \n     critical for COPS to monitor key grant conditions such as \n     supplanting and retention.\n       137 of 146 grantees (94 percent) did not submit all \n     required Financial Status Reports to OJP or submitted them \n     late. Without these reports, OJP cannot monitor \n     implementation of important grant requirements.\n       33 of 146 grantees (23 percent) had weaknesses in their \n     community policing program or were unable to adequately \n     distinguish COPS activities from their pre-grant mode of \n     operations. The findings suggest a need for COPS to refine \n     its definition of the practices that constitute community \n     policing as well as those that do not.\n       After we issue our grant reports, COPS, OJP, and the \n     grantee are responsible for ensuring that corrective action \n     is taken. By agreement with COPS, OJP is our primary point of \n     contact on follow-up activity for the grants, although COPS \n     works with OJP to address our audit findings and \n     recommendations, particularly those that indicate supplanting \n     has occurred. The options available to COPS and OJP to \n     resolve our dollar-related findings and recommendations \n     include: (1) collection or offset of funds, (2) withholding \n     funds from grantees, (3) bringing the grantee into compliance \n     with grant terms, or (4) concluding that our recommendations \n     cannot or should not be implemented. To address our non \n     dollar-related findings and recommendations, COPS and OJP \n     can, in addition to other options, bring the grantee into \n     compliance with grant requirements or waive certain grant \n     requirements. When OJP submits documentation to us showing \n     that it has addressed our recommendations, the audit report \n     is closed.\n       The report consists of the body of the report; a detailed \n     matrix setting forth the audit findings made during the 149 \n     audits; the response of COPS and OJP to a draft of the \n     report, and our reply to their response.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to Senators Hatch, Allard, \nAshcroft, and Sessions who have spent countless hours over the past two \nCongresses addressing the complex issues of school safety and juvenile \nviolence.\n  And, needless to say, I deeply appreciate their accommodating my \nconcerns regarding a bill that I regard as among the most significant \npieces of legislation to be considered this Congress--and for their \nhaving included three of my amendments in the manager's education \npackage.\n  When enacted, these provisions will improve access to public school \ndisciplinary records by other schools; expand the authority of schools \nto run a national criminal background check on their employees; and \nencourage State and local governments to run such checks on all school \nemployees who are charged with providing educational and support \nservices to our children.\n  Together, these provisions will make sure that local public, private, \nand parochial schools are able to make informed decisions about these \nindividuals--whether a student, a teacher, or other school employee--\nwho pose an unreasonable risk to the safety and security of our \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, we all share a common responsibility to protect our \nchildren and a common hope that our children will have a bright future. \nThough we disagree on the wisdom of creating more gun control laws, \nthere are things that we ought to agree are necessary and in our \nchildren's best interests.\n  In this spirit, I introduced a bill in the past two Congresses \nseeking to extend the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act to illegal \ndrugs. This amendment is based on that bill and is cosponsored by the \ndistinguished Assistant Majority Leader, Mr. Nickles, and the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond. I trust that \nthis amendment will be looked upon favorably by Senators on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will strike an important blow in the \nwar against drugs by helping to protect America's school-children from \nthe scourge of drugs in their classrooms. It does this by requiring \nStates to adopt a low mandating ``zero tolerance'' for illegal drugs at \nschool in order to qualify for Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n(ESEA) funds. Zero tolerance is defined as requiring any student in \npossession of a felonious quantity of this contraband at school to be \nexpelled for not less than one year. Its adoption will finally send a \nclear unambiguous message to students, parents, and teachers--drugs and \nschools do not mix.\n  Anybody who questions the necessity of this measure should consider \nthese excerpts from the 1998 CASA National Survey of Teens, Teachers \nand Principals. This outstanding report was\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nprepared by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at \nColumbia University under the direction of President Carter's former \nHEW Secretary, Joseph Califano. Under the heading ``Drug Dealing In Our \nSchools'', the report states:\n\n       For too many kids, school has become not primarily a place \n     for study and learning, but a haven for booze and drugs. . . \n     . Parents should shutter when they learn that 22 percent of \n     12- to 14-year-olds and 51 percent of 15- to 17-year-olds \n     know a fellow student at their school who sells drugs. . . . \n     Indeed, not only do many of them know student drug dealers; \n     often the drug deals take place at school itself. Principals \n     and teachers may claim their schools are drug-free, but a \n     significant percentage of the students have seen drugs sold \n     on school grounds with their own eyes. . . . In fact, more \n     teenagers report seeing drugs sold at school (27 percent) \n     than in their own neighborhoods (21 percent).\n\n  In other places, the report details that students consider drugs to \nbe the number one problem they face and that illegal drugs are readily \navailable to students of all ages. Exacerbating this terrible \nsituation, illegal drugs are not cheaper and more potent than ever \nbefore. The CASA report goes on to state that ``one in four teenagers \ncan get acid, cocaine or heroin within 24 hours, and given enough time, \nalmost half (46 percent) would be able to purchase such drugs.'' \nClearly, eliminating drugs from America's classrooms is a necessary \nfirst step to the restoration of order in our schools.\n  The harm that illegal drugs causes our students in incalculable. \nThough its' ill effects, disruptions, and the violence associated with \nit are not limited to those actually involved in the drug trade. The \nPRIDE survey, conducted by the National Parents' Resource Institute for \nDrug Education, found a link between school violence and drugs when it \ndemonstrated that:\n\n       Gun-toting students were 23 times more likely to use \n     cocaine;\n       Gang members were 12 times more likely to use cocaine; and\n       Students who threatened others were 6 times more likely to \n     use cocaine than others.\n\n  Clearly, the connection between drugs and school violence is an \nirrefutable as it is frightening.\n  Mr. President, it should seem obvious that many children take guns to \nschool because they are either involved in illegal activity or because \nthey seek to defend themselves from those who are. It is clear that any \nfurther effort to eliminate guns and violence from schools must focus \nnot merely on the gun but on the reasons why students choose to arm \nthemselves. My amendment does precisely that.\n  My home state of North Carolina has not been immune to the ravages of \nillegal drugs. In fact, ``possession of a controlled substance'' has \nbeen either the first or second most reported category of school crime \nin North Carolina for the past four years. That's according to North \nCarolina State University's Center for the Prevention of School \nViolence, an outstanding organization that tracks the incidence of \nschool crime and suggests ways to prevent it.\n  As bleak as the picture is, there are immediate steps that we can \ntake to reverse course. Those who are on the ``front lines'' of our \ncountry's drug war have important things to contribute to the \ndiscussion. Overwhelmingly, students, teachers and parents support the \nadoption of a zero tolerance policy for drugs at school.\n  Among those surveyed, the CASA study found broad support for the \nadoption of firm policies on random locker searches, drug testing of \nstudent athletes, and zero tolerance policies. Regarding zero \ntolerance, 80% of principals, 79% of teachers, 73% of teenagers and 69% \nof parents voiced support for the adoption of such a policy at their \nschool.\n  Additionally, 85% of principals, 79% of teachers and 82% of students \nbelieve that zero tolerance policies are effective at keeping drugs out \nof schools and that they would actually reduce drugs on their campus. \nQuoting from the CASA report again:\n\n       If these students believe them [zero tolerance policies] so \n     effective, these policies must make an impact on their \n     decisions to not bring drugs on campus. Given this, it seems \n     that schools . . .  should implement and strictly enforce \n     zero tolerance policies. Perhaps in doing so they can \n     increase their likelihood of eradicating drugs on their \n     school grounds.\n\n  It is not my position that this amendment, by itself, will eliminate \nall drugs from our schools but it is clear that this is a long overdue \nstep in the right direction.\n  This policy is firm but fair. The drug trade and the violence \nassociated with it have no place in America's classrooms. Schools \nshould foster an environment that is conducive to learning and \nsupportive of the vast majority of students who want to learn. Children \nand teachers deserve a school free of the fear and violence caused by \ndrugs.\n  Removing drugs and violence from our schools is a goal that we should \nall agree on. The President, in his 1997 State of the Union address, \nsaid ``we must continue to promote order and discipline'' in America's \nschools by ``remov[ing] disruptive students from the classroom, and \nhav[ing] zero tolerance for guns and drugs in school.'' I could not \nagree more with the President on this point: it is time that the Senate \ngo on record in support of removing illegal drugs from America's \nclassrooms, by approving this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there was yet another tragedy in Atlanta \nthis morning. This is one more violent act that brings America together \nin sorrow. We hope that it is also an opportunity to bring us together \nto learn some important lessons. What are people--young people \nespecially--saying to us all when they turn to violence to address \ntheir problems?\n  This is an American challenge. We all have to do our part--in \npartnership. We must each do our job, but we must all work together. We \nin Congress are trying to do our part--passing bills, appropriating \nfunds. But the Congress, like all of us, will do a better job when it \nreally listens to the American people, and listens to young people. \nEvery young person has the capacity to grow up to be a constructive \ncitizen or a violent criminal. It's our job--all of us--to listen \nbetter.\n  When we do listen, we find two issues at the core: working in \npartnership, and improving the tools to help build the adult/child \nrelationship.\n  How do we work together? There are many people who have answered this \nproblem in communities all over the Nation. They abandon turf issues \nand special interests, they listen, and they remember that the child is \nat the center of the work. There are specific things we can learn in \nCongress from these communities--where to find the money and time and \nenergy to get the work done together.\n  How do we improve the relationships and connections that young people \nmake with adults?\n  It frustrates me that we cannot do some fairly obvious things--for \nyoung people, families, teachers, and communities.\n  What can we do for students? Why is it that we can't figure out ways \nof building meaningful roles for young people in their own education, \nand in their own community? Why is it that if you are too young to \nvote, you are not taken seriously or treated as a citizen? Why is that \nwhen a child's hand goes up in the classroom, that child can't get the \nattention he or she needs from a teacher?\n  We can do some simple things. We can ask young people what they think \nabout how to prevent violence. We can reduce class size. We can make \nsure that when we hire more teachers, we have better and smaller \nschools in which to put them. We all have a role in making these things \nhappen.\n  What can we do to better support parents and families? We all know \nthat a strong family unit is the engine that drives our economy, and \nthat when it works well, it is the best and cheapest prevention program \nout there. So why is it so difficult to improve the tools and \ninformation available to parents?\n  All parents want to do their best, so why is it off limits to talk \nabout the problems with our economy, to talk about how parents spend \ntoo much time at work and not enough time with kids? Why can't we do \nthe simplest things to make life easier for people who work harder and \nharder to provide for their family and spend less and less time with \ntheir kids?\n  We can start with something simple, like making sure parents don't \nsuffer at work just because they want unpaid leave time to go to a \nschool conference, or take care of an emergency at their child's day \ncare. We should improve the Family and Medical Leave Act. Again, there \nare things we all can do to make these things happen.\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\n  What can we do for teachers and other educators? Why can't we give \nthem a small enough class so they get to know each child, and can find \n5 extra minutes with the child who needs the most help that day? Why do \nwe expect our teachers to deal with every educational and social issue \nunder the Sun, but we can't treat them as professionals?\n  We need to reduce class size. We need to improve teacher training. We \nneed to improve teacher pay and professionalism. And, we need to think \nabout one thing we can each do to act as a resource to that classroom. \nIs there a phone call we could make? An educational tool we could buy \nfor the class? A day we could give to working for the passage of the \nschool levy? There are things we all can do.\n\n  What can we do to help communities support the adult-child \nrelationship, and build connections for young people? Why is it that we \ndon't have more adults participating in the lives of young people? Why \nis it that a student can walk from home to school to the mall to the \nquickie-mart and back home again and feel invisible and anonymous? Why \ncan't we allow our communities into our public school buildings at \nnights and on weekends?\n  We should expand community education opportunities, and when we offer \ntax incentives, they should be the right ones that help communities \ninvest in young people. We should each make sure to smile at young \npeople, to keep an eye on them, to set high expectations, and to give \nthem meaningful opportunities. Again, there are things we all must do.\n  All over America, there is a conversation going on around the kitchen \ntable, and on the school bus, and at the mall, and around the water-\ncooler. We need to listen carefully to this conversation--to what is \nbeing said and asked for, and what is not. We need to act carefully, \nand invest wisely. But, most importantly, each of us need to keep this \nconversation going--to find out what to do and do it--until we create \nthe America we want for our children and young people. And you know one \nof the best, most overlooked resources for building the America we all \nwant? The young people themselves. Let's start by listening to them.\n  The juvenile justice bill fails to fully address these problems. \nWhile many amendments have been adopted that focus on the right \nsolutions, we failed to achieve support for most of those that would \nhave focused this legislation on those things that could best solve \nyouth violence. With that said, I will vote for the bill because I \nbelieve it has many positive provisions that combat youth violence.\n  The bill provides important block grants to States to assist them in \ntheir efforts to address juvenile crime. While I prefer a high \npercentage of these funds be required for prevention, I know my State \nof Washington intends to continue to invest in steering kids away from \ncrime through proven community-based prevention programs. The bill also \nprovides for Internet filtering and screening software that will allow \nparents to regulate what their children are viewing over the Internet. \nIt also made transfers of several types of firearms to children \nillegal.\n  As I have already said, I agree with many of my colleagues who have \nsaid that there is no legislative ``quick fix'' to this terrible \nproblem that is destroying so many young lives. The issue of youth \nviolence involves complex and interrelated factors. From prevention \nprograms that involve parents, teachers and communities, to strong law \nenforcement measures, there are many different tools we must use to \nattack the problem from all angles and prevent further tragedies like \nthe one in Littleton.\n  We must punish those who commit crimes, but we must also do all we \ncan to prevent crimes before they happen, to intervene before small \nproblems grow to crisis proportions. We must give schools and law \nenforcement officers the tools they need to identify the warning signs \nthat lead to juvenile violence and to let youth know that crime is not \nan acceptable answer.\n  While the bill does contain a ``prevention block grant,'' there is no \nguarantee the money will be used for prevention. Dollars from these \ngrants could be used to build more prisons or increase enforcement. \nWhile these are laudable goals, without a guaranteed set-aside for \nprevention, a State could fail to attack youth violence before it \nstarts. We must reach out to prevent at-risk youth from starting down a \npath of crime in the first place. While we were unable to secure \nspecific amounts for prevention, I am hopeful that States will use \ntheir discretion and undertake prevention programs. An ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  Some of my colleagues have offered amendments to provide resources \nfor effective violence prevention, and I am disappointed they have not \nbeen adopted. Last week, Senator Robb offered an amendment that would \nhave provided funds for schools and law enforcement to identify and \neffectively respond to juvenile violent behavior. It would have \nestablished a National Clearinghouse of School Safety Information and \nprovided an anonymous hotline to report criminal behavior and a support \nline for schools and communities to call for assistance.\n\n  In addition, the Robb amendment would have provided treatment \nprograms that identify and address the symptoms of youth violence to \nsteer juveniles away from criminal behavior. It also would have \nprovided authorization for afterschool programs, which have been very \neffective at keeping high-risk youth off the street and involved in \nactivities that assist in their education and growth.\n  I am hopeful that similar legislation will be offered again and that \nmy colleagues will reconsider and give it their support.\n  In addition to my disappointment at the lack of adequate resources \nfor violence prevention, I have other concerns about this bill.\n  I am very concerned about the fate of our youth serving time in \nprisons and other detention facilities. While we must certainly punish \nthose who have committed crimes, we must make a serious attempt at \nrehabilitation and not allow juveniles to turn into hardened criminals \nin the course of their incarceration. It is well-known that juveniles \nwho have contact with adults in prison are further indoctrinated into a \nlife of crime or worse, assaulted or even killed. Current requirements \nprohibit juveniles, whether they were tried as adult or juveniles, from \nbeing kept in any adult jail or corrections institution where they have \nregular contact with adult inmates.\n  The Hatch bill weakens that standard by allowing ``incidental'' \ncontact and permitting construction of juvenile facilities on the same \nsite as those for adults. Even convicted juveniles should be protected \nfrom hardened criminals. Those youth who are the most successful in a \nmixed juvenile-adult environment will be the ones we will least want \nback on the streets once they have served their time. It is my \nunderstanding that the Feinstein-Chafee amendment improved this \nprovision, for which I am thankful, increasing protection of our \nchildren while they are in state custody.\n  I also feel the Hatch bill critically weakens measures to address \ndisproportionate minority confinement. The legislation replaces \nreferences to ``minority'' or ``race'' with the vague phrase ``segments \nof the juvenile population.'' Further, the Hatch bill is less \ninstructive on what must be done to address the problem of \ndiscrimination, essentially making the issue a mere concern rather than \na problem we must correct. This is the wrong direction to be heading if \nwe truly seek to achieve fair and unbiased treatment of all people \nwithin the judicial system. An amendment to correct this problem was \ndefeated.\n  The Hatch bill also contains very troublesome provisions to allow the \nprosecution of children as young as 14 as adults, and gives \nprosecutors--not judges--the discretion to try a juvenile as an adult. \nJudges make judgments; prosecutors prosecute. It is obvious who is \nbetter qualified to render an unbiased decision on whether a 14-year-\nold should be considered an adult.\n  There is another idea missing from this bill. To solve youth violence \nwe must all talk to the true experts: young people themselves. We need \nto listen to more than the student body presidents and the class \nvaledictorians. We need to hear from ``regular'' kids.\n  I know that I have learned a tremendous amount from doing that. Two \nweeks ago, I met with 10th graders in Kent, WA who told me some \nshocking\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\nthings. They said that nearly all of them knew where they could get a \ngun within a day. That is a sad statement abut the lives of our youth. \nThey are afraid and they are thinking about how to defend themselves \nwith a gun.\n  In the end, we were able, through the Lautenberg amendment on gun \nshows, to close one of the more glaring loopholes that allow young \npeople and children to get guns. After much flip-flop on the issue by \nRepublicans, a handful of their courageous Members lent enough support \nto this amendment by Senator Lautenberg to close some of these guns \nshow loopholes, but this was not until they had tried two amendments of \nsubstance on the issue. Furthermore, it took the Vice President of the \nUnited States, acting in his role as the President of the Senate, to \ncast the final vote to break the tie that will help keep kids and guns \nseparate.\n  Overall, S. 254 does much to tackle the tough questions surrounding \njuvenile justice. But as I have stated, there are a number of ways we \ncould have improved this bill. We need to focus on preventive measures \nthat bring together parents, kids, counselors and teachers; provide \nresources to enable people to identify and intervene in potentially \ndangerous situations; and give law enforcement the tools it needs to \ndeal with the symptoms of youth violence not just the results of the \nviolence.\n  I hope in the future we can pass legislation that will address the \nremaining problems and can come up with even better solutions. We owe \nthat much to our children.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of the juvenile crime \nbill, S. 254, because on balance it comes close enough to promoting the \nkind of approach that we need to reduce juvenile violence--the type of \nplan that is already working to reduce crime in cities like Milwaukee \nand Boston, and the type of strategy that will help us prevent future \ntragedies like the recent school shootings in Jonesboro, AR, Peducah, \nKY, Springfield, OR, Conyers, GA and Littleton, CO. There are many \ncauses of juvenile crime--poverty, a deterioration of American families \nand family values, increased youth access to firearms, and the \nexplosion of violent images in our culture, just to name a few--and it \nwould be naive to presume there is a simple solution. Indeed, we need a \ncomprehensive crime-fighting strategy to address all of these root \ncauses and the entire range of juvenile offenders and potential \noffenders, from violent predators to children at-risk of becoming \ndelinquent. That is the approach this bill takes, more or less.\n  Let me explain the four keys to this balanced, proven strategy: \nkeeping guns out of the hands of kids and of criminals; punishment; \nprevention; and reducing kids' exposure to violence in our culture.\n  First, this bill will help keep firearms out of the hands of young \npeople. It promotes gun safety with the Kohl/Hatch/Chafee amendment to \nrequire the sale of child safety locks with every new handgun. Child \nsafety locks can help save many of the 500 children and teenagers \nkilled each year in firearms accidents, and the 1,500 kids each year \nwho use guns to commit suicide. Just as importantly, they can help \nprevent some of the 7,000 violent juvenile crimes committed every year \nwith guns children took from their own homes. This measure passed with \nan overwhelming 78 votes, twice the number of votes a virtually \nidentical proposal received last year.\n  The bill also helps identify who is supplying kids with guns, so we \ncan put them out of business and behind bars. Through the ``Youth Crime \nGun Interdiction Initiative,'' the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms has been working closely with cities like Milwaukee and Boston \nto trace guns used by young people back to the source. Using ATF's \nnational database, police and prosecutors can target illegal suppliers \nof firearms and help stop the flow of firearms into our communities. \nWhile I served as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for Treasury \nAppropriations, we provided funding to expand this initiative to 27 \ncities. This measure will expand the program to up to 200 other cities \nand, with the increased penalties outlined above, help stanch illegal \ngun trafficking.\n  And not only will this bill prohibit all violent criminals from \nowning firearms, no matter what their age, through ``Project CUFF'' it \nalso encourages aggressive enforcement of this federal law by \ndedicating federal prosecutors and investigators to this task. This \nbuilds on a successful program, supported by the NRA, that has helped \nreduce gun violence in Richmond, Va., and Boston through increased \nfederal prosecution, close coordination with state officials, public \noutreach and fewer plea bargains. Still, to be truly effective, this \nmeasure needs to be improved, so that we don't force it on \nuncooperating cities where it's unlikely to succeed.\n\n  Unfortunately, the bill fails in its stated intent to close an \ninexcusable loophole that allows violent young offenders to buy guns \nlegally when they turn eighteen. Under current law, violent adult \noffenders can't buy firearms, but violent juveniles can--for example, \neven the kids convicted of the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, \nArkansas--once they are released at age eighteen. Simply put, this has \nto stop, and the bill tries to do this--sort of. A provision declares \nthat all violent felons are disqualified from buying firearms, \nregardless of whether they were 10, 12, or just a day short of their \n18th birthday at the time of their offense. However, although the bill \ntechnically closes this loophole, because it only applies to violent \ncrimes committed once juvenile records become ``routinely available'' \non-line, its indefinite effective date merely opens another loophole in \nits place. This provision may never take effect. When juvenile records \nare all ``on-line'' is a long way away, and in the meantime many young \ncriminals will continue to have the ability to get a gun at 18 once \nthey get out of jail.\n  Each of these provisions was addressed in my juvenile crime bill, the \n21st Century Safe and Sound Communities Act. In addition, after much \nback-and-forth--and forth-and-back--we finally agreed to close the gun \nshow loophole once and for all. I am pleased to see a bipartisan \nconsensus start to emerge over taking these steps to keep guns out of \nyoung hands.\n  Second, we need to lock up the worst offenders, including dangerous \nviolent juveniles. Naturally, we can't even begin to stop violent kids \nunless we have police officers on the street to catch them, and the \nstate and local prosecutors, defense attorneys and courts we need to \ntry them. To that end, this bill provides $100 million per year for \nstate and local prosecutors, defense attorneys and courts for \njuveniles. Unfortunately, we missed an opportunity to extend the highly \nsuccessful COPS program--which is due to expire after next year--in \nthis bill. Extending the COPS program will make it easier to lock up \ndangerous juveniles, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto make that happen.\n  Of course, we can't keep criminals off the streets unless we have a \nplace to send them. So this measure dedicates funding for juvenile \nprisons or alternative placements of delinquent children--a long-needed \nmeasure for which I have advocated since before the 1994 Crime Act.\n  This proposal also helps rural communities keep dangerous kids behind \nbars. Now, although the closest juvenile facility may be hundreds of \nmiles away, federal law prohibits rural police from locking up violent \njuveniles in adult jails for more than 24 hours. This means that state \nlaw enforcement officials either have to waste the time and resources \nto criss-cross the state even for initial court appearances, or simply \nlet dangerous teens go free. In my view, that's a no-win situation. \nThis measure gives rural police the flexibility they need by letting \nthem detain juveniles in adult jails for up to 48 hours, or longer with \nparental consent, provided they are separated from adult criminals. \nWorking with Wisconsin's rural sheriffs, I first proposed a similar \nextension three years ago.\n\n  Moreover, this measure will help lock up gun-toting kids--and the \npeople who illegally supply them with weapons. It builds on my 1994 \nYouth Handgun Safety Act by turning illegal possession of a handgun by \na minor into a felony. And the same goes for anyone who illegally sells \nhandguns to kids. Both of these provisions were in my juvenile crime \nbill. Kids and handguns don't mix, and our Federal law needs to make \nclear that this is a serious crime.\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\n  In addition, this measure makes it easier to identify the violent \njuveniles who need to be dealt with more severely--by strongly \nencouraging states to share the records of juvenile offenders and \nproviding the funding necessary for improved record-keeping. The fact \nis that law enforcement officials need full disclosure to make informed \njudgments about who should be incarcerated, but current law allows too \nmany records to be concealed or to vanish without a trace when a teen \nfelon turns eighteen.\n  Finally, this measure includes my proposal, cosponsored by Senator \nDeWine: the Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999, which will \npromote the use of modern DNA technology to resolve unsolved crimes \ncommitted by both juveniles and adults. Our measure will reduce the \nbacklog of hundreds of thousands of unanalyzed DNA samples from \nconvicted offenders by providing the funding necessary to analyze them \nand put them ``on-line,'' so they can be shared between states and \nmatched with crime scene DNA evidence. And, while all 50 states \nauthorize collection of DNA samples, it closes the loophole that allows \nDNA samples from Federal and Washington, D.C. offenders to go \nuncollected. The Department of Justice estimates that upgrading our DNA \ndatabases alone could solve a minimum of 600 crimes tomorrow.\n  Third, a balanced approach also requires a significant investment in \ncrime prevention, so we can stop crime before it's too late. In fact, \nno one is more adamant in support of this approach than our nation's \nlaw enforcement officials. For example, last year more than 400 police \nchiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors nationwide endorsed a call for after-\nschool programs for all children. And in my home state of Wisconsin, 90 \npercent of police chiefs and sheriffs I surveyed agreed that we need to \nincrease federal prevention spending.\n  This proposal promotes prevention by concentrating funding in \nprograms that already have a record of success and those that rely on \nproven strategies, like the ones that give children a safe place to go \nin the after-school hours between 3 and 8 p.m., when juvenile crime \npeaks.\n\n  For example, it includes my amendment to expand the Families and \nSchools Together (FAST) program, a successful program that finds \ntroubled youth and reconnects them with their schools and families. \nFAST, which was created in my home state of Wisconsin and is already \nbeing implemented in 484 schools in 34 States and five countries, helps \nensure that youth violence does not proliferate to our schools and \ncommunities by empowering parents, helping to improve children's \nbehavior and performance in school, preventing substance abuse, and \nproviding support and networking for families by linking them to \ncommunity resources and services.\n  The bill also promotes innovative prevention initiatives by \nreauthorizing and expanding the Prevention Challenge Grant program \n(formerly known as Title V), which former Senator Hank Brown and I \nauthored in 1992. This program encourages investment, collaboration, \nand long-range prevention planning by local communities, who must \nestablish locally tailored prevention programs and contribute at least \n50 cents for every federal dollar. And, in response to concerns I \nraised about the risk of watering down this program with non-prevention \nuses, 80 percent of its funding is reserved for prevention--that is, \nprograms addressing at-risk kids before they ever enter the juvenile \njustice system.\n  It also builds on our support for the valuable work of Boys & Girls \nClubs by continuing to dedicate funding to the Clubs and expanding \nfunding to other successful organizations like the YMCA. And it \nrequires that at least 25 percent of $450 million juvenile \naccountability block grant be dedicated to prevention.\n  Of course, we shouldn't blindly invest in prevention programs, just \nbecause they sound good. Quality matters. And it would foolish to throw \ngood money after bad. That's why this measure requires at least 5 \npercent of all Prevention Challenge Grant funds--and more than 15 \npercent of FAST funds--be set aside for rigorous evaluations, so we can \nkeep funding the programs that work, and zero out programs that don't.\n  Finally, this bill also aims to provide us with a better \nunderstanding of how violence in our culture is marketed to children, \nand it encourages industry to take self-regulatory steps to reduce this \nviolence. For example, the Brownback amendment, which I consponsored, \norders a joint FTC/DOJ study of the marketing practices of the video \ngame, motion picture, and television industries to determine whether or \nnot the industries are peddling violence to kids. In particular, it \nwill help us determine whether or not the industries are peddling \nviolence to kids. In particular, it will help us determine whether the \nvideo game industry is marketing the same ultraviolent games to \nchildren that are rated ``adults only.''\n  Mr. President, while explaining what causes a tragedy like Littleton \nremains a mystery, the question about how to reduce juvenile crime no \nlonger is. We have a good idea about what works. And this bill overall \nis a step in the right direction. Like any piece of legislation, of \ncourse, it isn't perfect. For example, we need to really close the \nloophole that allows violent juvenile offenders to buy guns. We need to \nextend the COPS program so that we have enough police officers on the \nstreets to catch and lock up dangerous juveniles and criminals. We \nshould restore the so-called ``mandate'' requiring states to make \nefforts to reduce disproportionate minority confinement. This \nrequirement, which I helped write in 1992, at most simply encourages \nstates to address prevention efforts at minority communities. And it \nmay be most important for its symbolic recognition of continuing racial \ndivisions that dominate our society and our justice system, whether or \nnot the justice system is actually discriminatory. Still, it makes no \nsense to cast away this provision without any hearings, any organized \nopposition, or any constitutional challenges to it over its seven-year \nhistory. I am hopeful that the House, which has always been supportive \nof this provision, will insist on restoring it in Conference.\n\n  And while the bill is a step forward for prevention, we can still do \nbetter. Although some suggest that as much as 55 percent of the $1 \nbillion in spending at the heart of the bill goes toward prevention, in \nreality less than 30 percent is dedicated to prevention ($160 million \nthrough the 80 percent set-aside of the Prevention Challenge Grant, \n$112.5 million through the 25 percent earmark from the Accountability \nBlock Grant, and $15 million for mentoring). To effectively reduce \njuvenile crime, the ratio of prevention spending to enforcement \nspending has to be a lot higher.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senators Hatch \nand Leahy, and their staffs--Beryl Howell, Manus Cooney, Rhett DeHart, \nMike Kennedy, Bruce Cohen, Ed Pagano, Craig Wolf, and, of course, Brian \nLee, Jessica Catlin, Kahau Morrison and Jon Leibowitz of my staff--for \ntheir hard work in putting together this balanced bill, which is \nsignificant improvement from where we were headed last Congress. I look \nforward to continuing to work with them when we move to conference.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of final \npassage and explain why I plan to vote for final passage of S. 254, the \nViolent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation \nAct of 1999. At the outset, I must make clear that I do not support \nevery provision in this bill. There is much in this bill that is simply \nextraneous--provisions that do not address the problem of youth \nviolence. Moreover, there are items included in this bill by amendment \nthat I opposed. There are also items that were included through the \nmanager's amendment, such as the creation of new federal judgeships, \nthat I oppose.\n  However, there are many provisions in this bill that I have long \nchampioned and have worked hard to include in the bill. Let me briefly \nsummarize these key provisions of this law:\n\n\n                     ashcroft provisions in S. 254\n\n  There are four main Ashcroft initiatives in the core Senate juvenile \njustice bill, S. 254. Those provisions are: (1) Trying juveniles as \nadults on the federal level, (2) targeting adults who use juveniles \nthrough increased penalties, (3) funding for improving juvenile record \nsystem and incentives for\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\nrecordsharing, and (4) Charitable choice--preventing discrimination \nagainst faith-based organizations that stand ready to provide \ncounseling to troubled youth.\n  First, the core bill makes it easier for federal prosecutors to try \njuveniles as adults in federal court. Specifically, the bill provides \nlocal United States Attorneys with new authority to try juveniles 14 \nand older who commit violent federal crimes and federal drug crimes as \nadults. This provision is an important improvement in the law. Violent \nfederal crimes and major federal drug crimes are not youthful \nindiscretions or juvenile pranks--these are serious adult crimes. The \nbill makes important steps to ensure that in the federal system \njuveniles who commit adult crimes do adult time.\n  Second, the core bill also targets adults who would exploit children \nand ensnare them into a life of crime. One sad consequence of a \njuvenile justice system that treats juvenile crime less seriously than \nadult crime is that adults try to game the system by using juveniles to \nperform criminal tasks with the greatest risk of detection. Adults use \nchildren as drug runners or couriers precisely because the children are \nlikely to end up back on the street even if they are caught. The core \nbill addresses this problem by including two provisions from my Protect \nChildren from Violence Act, S. 2023, from the last Congress. \nSpecifically, section 202 increases the mandatory minimums for adults \nwho use juveniles to commit drug crimes from 1 year to 3 years for \nfirst-time offenders and from 1 year to 5 years for repeat offenders. \nSection 203 doubles the penalties on adults who use juveniles to commit \ncrimes of violence and trebles penalties for repeat offenders.\n  The core bill also includes important provisions to facilitate the \nsharing of juvenile criminal records. This legislation encourages \nStates to keep records on violent juveniles that are the equivalent of \nthe records kept for adults committing comparable crimes. In addition, \nthe bill conditions the availability of federal funds on States' \nparticipation in a nationwide system for collecting and sharing \njuvenile criminal records. Under the bill, state authorities must make \nthese criminal records available to federal and state law enforcement \nofficials and school officials to assist them in providing for the best \ninterests of all students and preventing more tragedies. Providing \njudges and school officials with accurate records is a critical step in \npreventing tragedies. School officials and judges have a right and a \nneed to know when they are dealing with dangerous juveniles. Providing \naccurate records is not only an important role for the government, it \nis a role that only the federal government can fulfill. Violent \njuveniles routinely cross state lines. The federal government has an \nimportant role in ensuring that their criminal records cross state \nlines with them.\n  Finally, the core bill includes my provision ensuring that faith-\nbased organizations have an equal opportunity to provide services to \nat-risk youth. The experience of the past decade has made clear that \ngovernment does not have all the answers for what ails our culture. No \norganizations should be excluded from the process of trying to heal our \nviolent culture, let alone faith-based organizations. The ``charitable \nchoice'' provisions in the bill do not provide for any special \ntreatment for faith-based organizations, but they do ensure that faith-\nbased groups will not be arbitrarily excluded when the government turns \nto non-governmental organizations to deal with at-risk juveniles.\n  The bill in its current form also includes a number of important \nprovisions that were added by amendment. These include:\n  Semi-automatic assault rifles ban for juveniles. The Senate \noverwhelmingly adopted this Ashcroft amendment. The amendment had three \nmajor provisions:\n  (1) Ban on juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault rifles. This \nprovision extends the current limitations (subject to the current \nexceptions) on youth possession of handguns to semi-automatic assault \nweapons. The provision does not affect a juvenile's right to possess \nhunting rifles.\n  (2) Requirement that juveniles be tried as adults for weapons \nviolations in a school zone. Juveniles who commit firearms violations \nnear a school zone must be sent a clear message--such actions will not \nbe tolerated and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  (3) Increased penalties for unlawfully transferring a firearm to a \njuvenile with knowledge that it will be used in a crime of violence.\n\n\n                       Ashcroft education package\n\n  The Senate overwhelmingly approved this comprehensive amendment which \nreflects not only specific Ashcroft initiatives but the work product of \nthe Republican Education Task Force, which Senator Ashcroft chaired. \nThe major Ashcroft initiatives in the package include:\n  (1) Flexibility for local schools to address school violence. This \nprovision provides schools with the flexibility to use existing \neducation funds, and the new education funds included in the Republican \nbudget, to address security concerns as they see fit. Permissible uses \ninclude everything from the installation of metal detectors, to the \nformulation of inter-agency task forces, to the introduction of school \nuniform policies.\n  (2) School uniforms. Another Ashcroft provision makes clear that \nnothing in federal law prevents local school districts from instituting \nschool uniform policies.\n  (3) School records. Another provision makes clear that student \ndisciplinary records should follow students to a new school, without \nregard to whether it is public or private. Teachers and administrators \nneed to know who they are dealing with and whether they have security \nrisks in their midst.\n\n\n                     frist-Ashcroft idea amendment\n\n  This amendment removes a loophole in federal law that prevents States \nfrom disciplining an IDEA student in the same manner as a non-IDEA \nstudent, if an IDEA student brings a gun to school. The Senate passed \nthis common sense amendment 74-25. A number of my colleagues also added \nmy initiatives to the bill through their own amendments. These include:\n\n\n                hatch/craig comprehensive crime package\n\n  This amendment included a number of Ashcroft mandatory minimums. \nSpecifically, Ashcroft provisions in the bill raised mandatory \nminimums:\n  (1) From 1 to 3 years for distributing drugs near a school zone (from \n1 to 5 years for subsequent offenses). This provision was adopted from \nAshcroft's Protect Children from Violence Act, S. 2023.\n  (2) From 1 to 3 years for distributing drugs to a juvenile (1 to 5 \nyears for subsequent offenses). This provision was adopted from \nAshcroft's Protect Children from Violence Act, S. 2023.\n  (3) From 7 to 10 years for brandishing a firearm during the \ncommission of a federal crime. This provision was adopted from \nAshcroft's Juvenile Misuse of Firearms Prevention Act, S. 994.\n  (4) From 10 to 12 years for discharging a firearm during the \ncommission of a federal crime. This provision was adopted from \nAshcroft's Juvenile Misuse of Firearms Prevention Act, S. 994.\n  The amendment also included two new Ashcroft mandatory minimum \nsentences also adopted from S. 994:\n  (1) A 15-year mandatory minimum for maiming or injuring someone with \na firearm during the commission of a federal crime\n  (2) A 5-year mandatory minimum for transferring a firearm with \nknowledge that it will be used in a crime of violence.\n\n\n                     hatch/feinstein gang amendment\n\n  The Senate also overwhelmingly passed the Hatch-Feinstein amendment \ndesigned to target and punish gang violence. The amendment included \nmany provisions long-championed by Ashcroft, including almost the \nentirety of the gang subtitle of Ashcroft's ``Protect Children from \nViolence Act,'' S. 538, introduced on March 4, 1999.\n  Specifically, the amendment included the following Ashcroft \nprovisions: enhanced sentences for crimes committed as part of gang \nviolence, new crimes for interstate gang activities, the treatment of \njuvenile crimes as adult crimes for purposes of the federal laws \nimposing severe penalties on armed career criminals, and increased \npenalties for witness tampering. All of these provisions were included \nin the ``Combating Gang Violence'' subtitle of Ashcroft's Juvenile \nCrime bill.\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\n  In summary, this is not a perfect bill. There is much that is \nextraneous and some that is misguided. I am hopeful some of these \nprovisions will be removed in conference. On balance, however, this \nbill will help make our schools places of learning, not places of fear.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong \nopposition to final passage of S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile \nOffender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. I do so because \nI believe that the gun control amendments to this bill that have been \nadopted by the Senate will do lasting damage to the fundamental right \nto keep and bear arms, which is guaranteed by the Second Amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  I am outraged, Mr. President, that the gun control lobby in this \ncountry has taken advantage of the tragedy last month at Littleton, \nColorado, as well as the incident today in Georgia, to mount an \nunprecedented assault on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun \nowners. They cast blame on law-abiding gun owners, while leaving the \nmovie moguls and video game makers who promote wanton violence to \nchildren virtually unscathed.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I am also disappointed by some of my \ncolleagues in my own political party here in the Senate. I have spent a \ngreat deal of time, over the past two weeks as the Senate has debated \nthis bill, arguing privately with these colleagues and trying to \npersuade them to hold the line against this onslaught of gun control \namendments. Sadly, Mr. President, I have not been successful. \nNevertheless, I am proud to have stood up for the Second Amendment, \neven, in one case, when I was only one of two Senators to vote against \na gun control amendment to this bill.\n  I am particularly angered, Mr. President, by what the Senate has \nvoted to do with respect to gun shows. Sadly, it seems evident to me \nthat the practical effect of the Lautenberg Amendment, adopted earlier \ntoday when Vice President Gore cast the tie-breaking vote, will be \neffectively to ruin gun shows--to put them out of business. This, \nunfortunately, seems to me to be the aim of the Lautenberg Amendment.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the effects of the so-called \n``trigger lock'' amendment. Even though the amendment appears only to \nrequire trigger locks to be sold with guns, the legal effect of the \namendment may well be to do great damage to the Second Amendment rights \nof law-abiding gun owners. This is because courts may construe the \namendment as creating a new civil negligence standard under which gun \nowners will be seen as having a legal obligation to use their trigger \nlocks or face legal liability if their gun is misused by some third \nparty.\n  If, in fact, the law develops such that gun owners have a legal \nobligation to use trigger locks, these law-abiding gun owners may be \nforced to put their safety, and that of their families, at risk. It is \ncertainly not unreasonable to imagine a single mother of small \nchildren, depending on her gun for safety, panic-stricken as she \nstruggles unsuccessfully with her trigger lock in the middle of the \nnight after hearing a burglar break into her home.\n  Mr. President, these are but two examples of the grave harm that the \ngun control amendments adopted to this bill by the Senate have done to \nthe Second Amendment rights of Americans. When the heat of this moment \nis gone, and the passions so shamelessly stirred up by the gun control \nlobby have subsided, I am afraid that many of those who supported these \namendments will realize that they have done the Second Amendment \nserious and lasting harm. Sadly, though, it will be too late.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 322\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue raised \nby the Hatch amendment number 322, which the Senate agreed to on \nTuesday, May 11. While I support both the underlying bill and this \namendment, I am concerned about a portion of this amendment which is \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on the Budget. The \nHatch amendment contained language which amends that portion of the \n1994 Crime Bill which created the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund.\n  This portion of the amendment does two things: (1) it extends the \nfund through fiscal year 2005 and (2) it extends the discretionary \nspending limits (albeit indirectly) through fiscal year 2005 for the \nviolent crime reduction category. As a result, the amendment was \nsubject to a point of order pursuant to section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 because it contained matter within the \njurisdiction of the Budget Committee and was offered to a bill that was \nnot reported by the committee. I chose not to challenge this provision \nbecause I support the underlying legislation and I have been assured by \nthe Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator hatch, that my \nconcerns will be addressed when the bill goes to conference.\n  Let me begin by saying that I support full funding for crime fighting \nefforts. I am, however, troubled by this amendment because--in its \nattempt to ensure funds are available for these important programs it \nhas stumbled into a series of, as yet, unresolved issues regarding the \nbudget process: should the discretionary spending limits be extended \nbeyond fiscal year 2002? If yes, should there be limits within the \noverall cap for items such as defense, highways and mass transit, and \ncrime? Current law (section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act of 1985) provides limits on discretionary spending \n(the ``caps'') through the end of fiscal year 2002.\n  When the issue of the caps was last addressed during deliberations on \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress decided that the overall caps \non discretionary spending would end after 2002, that the defense cap \nwould end after 1999, and that the crime cap would end after 2000. This \nwas decided as part of a very carefully crafted compromise between the \nCongress and the President, involving both mandatory and discretionary \nspending, that has now led us to a balanced budget. Our ability to live \nwithin these discretionary caps has played a significant role in \nproducing not only a balanced budget, but surplus for the foreseeable \nfuture. Thus I feel it is not appropriate at this time to extend only \nthe crime cap without addressing the broader issue of the appropriate \nlevel of discretionary spending. Moreover, I fear that raising the \nissue of the caps at this time will unnecessarily complicate the \npassage of this important juvenile justice legislation.\n  I know that I do not have to remind my colleagues how difficult it is \ngoing to be both this year and next to pass all 13 appropriations bills \nand stay within the caps which we currently have in place for the next \nthree years. While I am supportive of funding for criminal justice \nprograms, I am concerned that extending the crime cap will only make an \nalready difficult task that much harder. I might also point out to my \ncolleagues that by extending only the crime cap and not the overall \ncap, this legislation has the effect of limiting crime spending for \nfiscal years 2003 through 2005 when there will be no such limits upon \nany other type of discretionary spending.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, for recognizing my \nconcern with this amendment and I look forward to working with him on \nthis issue when the bill is in conference.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the distinguished \nmanagers of this bill, Senators Leahy and Hatch, for including the \nFeinstein-Chafee amendment regarding separation of juveniles from \nadults in custody in the managers' ``technical amendment.'' I also wish \nto thank Senators Akaka, Feingold, Kohl, and Jeffords, who agreed to \nco-sponsor our amendment, for their support.\n  This amendment resolves a major concern that many, many people had \nwith this bill, and will help speed the way to its final passage.\n  Our amendment is designed to strengthen the bill's requirements for \nseparating juveniles in custody from adult criminals. We should not be \ncounter-productive by allowing juvenile detention to be a school for \ncrime, nor should we be cruel in permitting the victimization of youths \nby hardened adult criminals.\n  Under current law, juveniles cannot have any contact with adult \ninmates. None whatsoever. When a juvenile is in an adult facility, that \njuvenile cannot be within ``sight or sound'' of any adult--ever!\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\n  Why is that one of the four so-called ``core'' requirements?\n  Because I remind my colleagues that we are talking about children.\n  Children who may or may not have committed a violent offense.\n  Children who may have been arrested for the first time.\n  Children who perhaps are on the wrong path but most likely never \ncommit another offense ever: statistically, over two-thirds of \njuveniles arrested never commit another crime.\n  In the early 1970s, before there were protections for children who \ncame into contact with our court system, a number of studies found that \nchildren in adult jails were subject to rape, assault, sodomy, murder, \nand other acts which sometimes, frankly too often, led to suicide.\n  The Judiciary Committee at the time learned of numerous tragedies and \noutright atrocities, including a report on practices in Philadelphia \nwhich estimated that 2,000 sexual assaults occurred inside adult jails \nor ``sheriff's vans'' used to transport juvenile and adults to court \nover a 26-month period. One juvenile was raped five times while inside \nsuch a van.\n  The numbers tell the story. Children in adult jails are 8 times more \nlikely to commit suicide; 5 times more likely to be sexually \nassaulted; twice as likely to be assaulted by staff; and 50 percent \nmore likely to be attacked with a weapon than are children in juvenile \nfacilities, according to studies by the Justice Department and others.\n\n  In my state of California, we passed our laws to keep juveniles out \nof adult jails in the mid-1980s in the wake of tragedies such as the \ncase of Kathy Robbins, a 15-year-old girl who hung herself when she was \nplaced in an adult jail in Glenn County for violating a juvenile \ncurfew.\n  After those reports were released, Congress enacted the Juvenile \nJustice Delinquency Prevention Act and subsequent renewals of the law \nto ensure that children would be treated fairly by the juvenile justice \nsystem and be kept safely away from adults in jail.\n  Kentucky chose to forgo Federal money and continue placing juveniles \nin adult jails. This chart shows the result: four suicides, one \nattempted suicide, two physical assaults by other inmates, two sexual \nassaults by other inmates, and one rape by a deputy county jailer.\n  Let me give you some of the names behind the numbers:\n  In Oldham County, 15-year-old Robert Lee Horn, Jr. was put in jail \nfor truancy and beyond parental control. He was paraded through the \njail in front of adult inmates who called out to him for sex. He hung \nhimself.\n  In McCracken County, a 16-year-old Todd Selke was put in adult jail \nfor being a runaway and disorderly conduct. He committed suicide.\n  In Franklin County, a 16-year-old runaway was raped by a deputy \ncounty jailer.\n  The core protections help to prevent these tragedies elsewhere around \nthe country.\n  Yet, this bill as introduced would have weakened the core protections \nfor children. I was puzzled by why the authors felt the need to weaken \nthe current standard. According to the latest figures from the Justice \nDepartment, 48 of the 50 states are in compliance with the current \nstandard for separating children from adults, including such large, \nrural states as Alaska and Montana.\n  And yet this bill would have allowed for juveniles to be in close \nproximity to adult inmates. While it generally prohibits physical \ncontact between juveniles and adults in custody, there is an exclusion. \nAnd the exclusion to the definition of prohibited physical contact said \nthat the term ``does not include supervised proximity between a \njuvenile and an adult inmate that is brief and incidental or \naccidental.''\n  In other words, it permitted regular contact, planned contact, \nbetween delinquent juveniles and adult criminals, as long as it is \ndeemed to be ``brief and incidental.''\n  Senator Chafee and I were concerned that this standard would have \nallowed juveniles to be paraded in front of adult inmates as they are \nbeing transported from one area of a facility to another. That means \nthat every day the same youth could be required to walk by the adult \ncell block.\n  Adult inmates would have a chance to tease, taunt, harass, use \nsuggestive body language, expose areas of their private parts, spit, \nand otherwise scare juveniles as they are being transported through the \nfacility.\n  Now some might think that's OK. That to scare a child by exposing \nthem to adults may reduce the likelihood of the child committing \nanother crime.\n  But, actually, these young children who might be tough on the \noutside, but not so tough on the inside, could be scared to death--\nmeaning scared enough to commit suicide--just as Robbie Horn was in \nOldham County, Kentucky.\n  Older gang members, or veteranos, could pass messages on to younger \ngang members to coordinate criminal activities, or to intimidate them \nfrom turning state's evidence.\n  The amendment which we have agreed upon remedied this. In fact, it is \neven better than what Senator Chafee and I originally proposed. It \nmakes two changes, which bring the bill into line with the current \nJustice Department regulations:\n  1. It eliminates any planned or regular contact between juvenile \ndelinquents and adult criminals by changing the exception to ``brief \nand inadvertent, or accidental,'' contact. The minority report to last \nCongress' juvenile crime bill, S. 10, erroneously stated that the \nJustice Department's regulations, like the bill, excepted ``brief and \nincidental'' contact. However, there is a world of difference between \n``incidental'' and ``inadvertent.'' Changing this exception to the \nJustice Department standard has the same effect as the amendment which \nSenator Chafee and I originally proposed, and will provide much greater \nprotection for juveniles in custody.\n  2. The amendment passed in the manager's package then goes even \nfurther, limiting even this exception to nonresidential areas only. In \nother words, there is no exception at all in residential areas to the \nprohibition on physical contact between juveniles and adults. \nSpecifically, the amendment provides that the inadvertent/accidental \nexception applies only ``in secure areas of a facility that are not \ndedicated to use by juvenile offenders and that are nonresidential, \nwhich may include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health \ncare, entry areas, and passageways.'' This language is taken almost \nverbatim from the Justice Department regulations.\n  This amendment ensures that a juvenile cannot be in close proximity \nsuch as supervised ``brief and incidental'' parades by adult cells or \nother planned or spontaneous actions by adults to transport children \nfrom one area of a jail to another.\n  Our amendment was endorsed by: The Department of Justice; the \nChildren's Defense Fund; the National Network for Youth; and the \nNational Collaboration for Youth, an alliance of 28 youth service \ngroups, including Boy Scouts, 4-H, Girl Scouts, American Red Cross, \nNational Urban League, United Way and YMCA.\n  A coalition of 22 other organizations wrote to the Majority Leader, \nasking that the standard for separating delinquent juveniles and adult \ncriminals be strengthened, including: Minorities in Law Enforcement, \nNational Association for School Psychologists, National Council of \nChurches of Christ-Washington Office, the Alliance for Children and \nFamilies, Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy, and Covenant House.\n  With the passage of this amendment, we have provided this protection, \nand substantially improved this bill. Coupled with the passage of other \namendments that I offered, including banning imports of large-capacity \nammunition magazines, the Federal Gang Violence Act, the James Guelff \nBody Armor Act, and anti-bombmaking legislation, this bill now \nrepresents a great step forward in the effort to reduce juvenile and \nviolent crime. I ask that I be added as a co-sponsor of the bill, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.\n\n\n                      early childhood development\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator Kerry's amendment on \nearly childhood development. The nation's highest priority should be to \nensure that all children begin school ready to learn. Our governors \nrealized this a decade ago when they said that the country's number one \ngoal should be to prepare all children to enter\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\nschool ``ready to learn.'' We aren't going to meet our school readiness \ngoals by the year 2000, but we must do all we can to reach this \nobjective soon. We cannot afford to let another decade pass without \ninvesting more effectively in young children's educational development.\n  As we debate how to prevent youth violence, it is gratifying that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle are recognizing the importance of \ninvesting in children while they are young. During these early, \nformative years, constructive interventions have the potential to make \nthe greatest impact. Early learning programs--including pre-\nkindergarten, Early Head Start, Head Start, and other activities for \nyoung children--are building blocks for success. Scientific research \nconfirms that in the first few years of life, children develop \nessential learning and social skills that they will use throughout \ntheir lives.\n  Quality early education stimulates young minds, enhances their \ndevelopment, and encourages their learning. Children who attend high \nquality pre-school classes have stronger language, math, and social \nskills than children who attend classes of inferior quality. Low-income \nchildren are particularly likely to benefit from quality programs.\n  These early skills translate into greater school readiness. First \ngraders who begin school with strong language and learning skills are \nmore motivated to learn, and they benefit more from classroom \ninstruction. Quality early education programs also have important long \nrange consequences and are closely associated with increased academic \nachievement, higher adult earnings, and far less involvement with the \ncriminal justice system.\n  Investments in these programs make sense, and they are cost effective \nas well. Economist Steven Barnett found that the High/Scope \nFoundations' Perry Preschool Project saved $150,000 per participant in \ncrime costs alone. Even after subtracting the interest that could have \nbeen earned by investing the program's funding in financial markets, \nthe project produced a net savings of $7.16--including more than $6 in \ncrime savings--for every dollar invested.\n  At risk 3 and 4 years olds in the High/Scope program were one-fifth \nas likely, by age 27, to have become chronic lawbreakers, compared to \nsimilar children randomly assigned to a control group. In other words, \nfailure to provide these services multiplied by 5 times the risk that \nthese infants and toddlers would grow up to be delinquent teenagers and \nadults.\n  Over 23 million children under 6 live in the United States, and all \nof these children deserve the opportunity to start school ready to \nlearn. To make this goal a reality, we must make significant \ninvestments in children, long before they ever walk through the \nschoolhouse door. Our children cannot wait, nor can we.\n\n  In March, Senator Stevens and I introduced a bill, S. 749, \ncosponsored by Senators Dodd, Jeffords, and Kerry, to create an ``Early \nLearning Trust Fund'' to improve funding for early education programs. \nThis bipartisan bill provides states with $10 billion over 5 years to \nstrengthen and improve early education programs for children under 6. \nBy increasing the number of children who have early learning \nopportunities, we will ensure that many more children begin school \nready to read. The ``Early Learning Trust Fund'' will provide each \nstate with resources to strengthen and improve early education.\n  Governors will receive the grants, and communities, along with \nparents, will decide how these funds can best be used. Grants will be \ndistributed based on a formula which takes into account the relative \nnumber of young children in each state, and the Department of health \nand Human Services will allocate the funds to the states. To assist in \nthis process, governors will appoint a sate council of representatives \nfrom the office of the governor, other relevant state agencies, Head \nStart, parental organizations, and resource and referral agencies--all \nexperts in the field of early education. The state councils will be \nresponsible for setting priorities and approving and implementing state \nplans to improve early education.\n  One of the great strengths of the ``Early Learning Trust Fund'' is \nits flexibility. States will have the flexibility to invest in an array \nof strategies that give young children the building blocks to become \ngood readers and good students. Essentially, our proposal does four \nthings: (1) it enhances educational services provided by current child \ncare programs and improves the quality of these programs; (2) it builds \non the momentum of states like Georgia and New York, which are \nexpanding their pre-kindergarten services; (3) it expands Head Start to \ninclude full-day, full-year services to help children of working \nparents begin school ready to learn; and (4) it ensures that children \nwith special needs have access to as wide a range of these services as \npossible.\n  This legislation will give communities what they have been asking \nfor--funding for coordinated services to ``fill in the gaps.'' \nCommunities needs this so-called ``glue'' money to strengthen their \nearly education services, and this approach will give them much needed \nsupport. As a result, many more children will benefit and begin school \nready to learn, ready to reach their full potential.\n  The nation's future depends on how well today's children are prepared \nto meet the challenges of tomorrow. If we are serious about improving \nour children's lives, I urge my colleagues to support the Early \nLearning Trust Fund that Senator Stevens and I will bring to the floor \nsoon.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, in the past week the Republican majority in \nthe Senate finally has begun to show signs of understanding that \nAmericans want reasonable gun control policies in this country. We have \nmade some progress by passing a ban on juvenile possession of \nsemiautomatic assault weapons and a ban on the importation of high-\ncapacity ammunition clips. We saw most Republicans join all Democrats \nin voting to require that child safety devices be sold with all \nhandguns. And finally, this morning, with a tie-breaking vote by the \nVice President, we passed the Lautenberg amendment to firmly close the \ngun show loophole.\n  These are the kinds of measures that Democrats in Congress have been \nadvocating for years, and it is unfortunate that it took a tragedy like \nLittleton to bring our colleagues in the majority around to our way of \nthinking, but we welcome even these small steps in the right direction.\n  But small steps they are, Mr. President, and we need to do much more. \nWe should reinstate the Brady waiting period, which expired last \nNovember, to provide a cooling off period before the purchase of a \nhandgun. We should pass a child access prevention law to hold adults \nresponsible if they allow a child to gain access to a firearm and that \nchild then uses the firearm to harm another person. And we should \nfirmly close the Internet gun sales loophole, something the Senate \nfailed to do last week.\n  I also believe that we should apply the same consumer product \nregulations which apply to virtually every other industry and product \nin this country to guns. If toy guns, teddy bears, lawn mowers and hair \ndryers are subject to regulation to ensure that they include features \nto minimize the danger to children, why not firearms? I plan to \nintroduce legislation to allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nto regulate firearms to protect children and adults against \nunreasonable risk of injury. I know my friend Senator Torricelli has \nintroduced a bill to allow the Treasury Department to regulate \nfirearms. Whichever agency ultimately has oversight, the important \nthing is that guns should no longer be the only consumer product exempt \nfrom basic safety regulations.\n  Mr. President, the NRA's own estimate is that there are over 200 \nmillion guns in this country. That's nearly one for every American. But \nlet's remember that most Americans don't own guns. For most Americans, \nespecially in urban areas, a gun in a public place in the possession of \nanyone other than a law enforcement officer usually brings on a sense \nof fear, not a sense of protection.\n  As the President said a few weeks ago, this fundamental difference in \nperspective is at the heart of this gun debate. If we are to solve the \nproblem of gun violence in this country, we have to come to a meeting \nof the minds between gun owners and non-gun owners, between rural and \nurban America.\n  Americans who live in urban and suburban communities need to \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\nthe legitimate use of firearms for hunting and sports activities. But \nat the same time, members of Congress from mostly rural states must \nrecognize the immense pain and suffering that guns cause in our \nnation's urban areas, and they should work with us to convince their \nconstituents that reasonable, targeted gun restrictions can make a \nworld of difference by saving lives in America's cities and suburbs.\n  I would also add that this is not simply an eastern vs. western \nstates issue. For example, the Washington Post recently reported that \nin Florida, six of the state's most urban counties have adopted \nmeasures to require a waiting period and background checks on all \nfirearm sales at guns shows, while the rest of the state has not. Every \nsenator, from every region of the country, has some constituents who \nlegally use firearms, and others who want nothing to do with them and \nsee them as a deadly threat. My state is no different, and I recognize \nthat many of my constituents are decent people who hunt or sport-shoot \nsafely.\n  While much more needs to be done, and while we are still far from \npassing comprehensive gun safety legislation, we have seen in the past \nweek at least a few limited examples of how, working together, we can \nbridge the gap and approve reasonable, targeted restrictions on gun \naccess without taking away a law-abiding, adult citizen's ability to \nown a gun.\n  I also believe that gun dealers should be held responsible if they \nviolate federal law by selling a firearm to a minor, convicted felon, \nor others prohibited from buying firearms. Currently, there are over \n104,000 federally licensed firearms dealers in the United States. While \nmost of these dealers are responsible small business people, recent \ntracing of crime-related guns by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms (ATF) has found substantial evidence that some dealers are \nselling guns to juveniles and convicted felons. This direct diversion \nof weapons from retail to illegal markets is taking place both through \noff-the-book sales by corrupt dealers and through so-called straw \npurchases, when an ineligible buyer has a friend or relative buy a \nfirearm for him or her.\n  To remedy this situation, I have introduced legislation, the Gun \nDealer Responsibility Act, that would provide a statutory cause of \naction for victims of gun violence against dealers whose illegal sale \nof a gun directly contributes to the victim's injury. I believe this \nlegislation will make unscrupulous gun dealers think twice about who \nthey are selling weapons to, particularly minors, convicted felons, or \nany other ineligible buyer, either directly or through straw purchases.\n  Our nation's federal juvenile justice programs establish four core \nprinciples that have served as the foundation of federal juvenile \njustice policy for years. States are required to uphold these \nprinciples in order to receive federal grant funds for juvenile justice \nactivities. These four core principles include:\n  (1) Juveniles may not be within sight or sound of adult inmates in \nsecure facilities. The evidence is overwhelmingly clear that youth held \nin adult prisons are frequently preyed upon by adult inmates. Compared \nto juveniles in juvenile facilities, they are 8 times more likely to \ncommit suicide, 5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted, and 50% \nmore likely to be attacked by a weapon.\n  (2) States should not confine juveniles for so-called ``status'' \noffenses, such as truancy, that would not be punishable if committed by \nan adult.\n  (3) States should remove juveniles from adult jails and lockups: For \nthe same reasons I just mentioned, juveniles should not be held in \nadult jails and lockups, with very narrow exceptions and even then for \nvery limited periods of time. And,\n\n  (4) States should address the problem of disproportionate minority \nconfinement.\n  This last issue is one I want to talk briefly about today, because it \nis the area where I believe the bill before us most dramatically \nchanges federal policy and clearly fails to uphold the longstanding \nprinciples of our juvenile justice system. Nearly seven out of ten \njuveniles held in secure facilities in this country are members of \nminority groups.\n  African-American juveniles are twice as likely to be arrested as \nwhite youth. There is, without question, a continuing need to address \nminority over-representation in the juvenile justice system. We should \nkeep the incentives in current law that encourage states to do so. \nUnfortunately, the bill before us would replace those incentives with \nlanguage that encourages states to reduce disproportionate \nrepresentation of, quote, ``segments of the population,'' an ambiguous \nand unlimited phrase that could be interpreted to mean men, urban \ngroups, or virtually any ``segment'' of the population. The effective \nresult is that over-representation of minorities would no longer be the \nfocus of our efforts, and one of the pillars of our federal juvenile \njustice policy would therefore be undermined. I was disappointed that \nthe Senate yesterday failed to pass the Wellstone amendment to ensure \nthat states continue to address disproportionate minority confinement \nissues. We have been making some progress in this area, and we need to \ncontinue that effort.\n  Another area where I think we can do much more is in the provision of \nmental health services for young people who come into contact with the \njuvenile justice system. My friend and fellow member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Wellstone, spoke \neloquently on this subject earlier this week. As he and I have \ndiscussed many times, you cannot have a meaningful discussion about \njuvenile justice without talking about mental health. The two are \nintimately intertwined.\n  Studies find that the rate of mental disorder is two to three times \nhigher among the juvenile offender population than among youth in the \ngeneral population. According to a 1994 Department of Justice study, \n73% of juveniles in the juvenile justice system reported mental health \nproblems, and 57% reported past treatment for those problems. In \naddition, over 60% of youth in the juvenile justice system may have \nsubstance abuse disorders, compared to 22% in the general population.\n  I have prepared legislation to authorize the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in cooperation with the \nDepartment of Justice, to award grants to state or local juvenile \njustice agencies to provide mental health services for youth offenders \nwith serious emotional disturbances who have been discharged from the \njuvenile justice system. I believe it is critical that we help local \norganizations to do several things to assist young offenders: (1) \ndevelop a plan of services for each youth offender; (2) provide a \nnetwork of core or aftercare services for each youth offender, \nincluding mental health and substance abuse treatment, respite care, \nand foster care; and (3) provide planning and transition services to \nyouth offenders while these youngsters are still incarcerated or \ndetained. I hope that in the context of this bill or the SAMHSA \nreauthorization we can find room for this important program.\n  I believe that a community-based network of mental health services \nwill reduce the likelihood that troubled youth will end up back in the \njuvenile justice system. By combining this innovative grant program \nwith strong prevention programs to reach out to at-risk youth before \nthey come into contact with the juvenile justice system in the first \nplace, we can attack the problem of juvenile delinquency from both \ndirections.\n  In closing, let me say that we all recognize that the problem of gun \nviolence among our young people is caused by many factors, some of \nwhich we may not fully understand. We need more resources for \nprevention programs to reach at-risk youth before they come into \ncontact with the juvenile justice system in the first place, and we \nhave seen an increased willingness on the other side of aisle to \nprovide those resources; we need a greater focus on mentoring and \ncounseling for troubled youth, and we've seen some movement on that \nfront as well; and yes, we need better enforcement of firearms laws and \nmore effective prosecution of gun criminals, and there is no question \nthat we will see more resources provided to make that happen.\n  But anyone who honestly considers the tragic events in Littleton one \nmonth ago, and the thirteen children who die every day in this country \nfrom gun violence, must concede that one of\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\nthe biggest problems of all is that our young people have far too easy \nand unlimited access to guns. We must do more to keep guns away from \nkids and criminals by making sure that Brady Law background checks are \napplied across the board, by reinstating the Brady waiting period, by \npassing a child access prevention law, by firmly closing the Internet \ngun sales loophole, by holding dealers responsible for illegal sales, \nand by applying to firearms the same consumer product safety \nregulations that apply to virtually every other product in this \ncountry.\n  Let's do the right thing and pass a juvenile justice bill that \nincludes every means possible to protect our children and all of our \ncitizens from youth violence.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, prior to being elected to the Senate, I \nserved the people of Ohio for two terms as governor. Before that, I \nserved for 10 years as the mayor of Cleveland. I have also been \nLieutenant Governor, a County Commissioner, a County Auditor and a \nState Legislator.\n  I have 33 years of experience at every level of government, which I \nbelieve gives me wonderful insight into the relationship of the federal \ngovernment with respect to state and local government.\n  It is the main reason why, over the length of my service to the \npeople of Ohio, I have developed a passion for the issue of \nfederalism--that is, assigning the appropriate role of the federal \ngovernment in relation to state and local government.\n  That passion remains with me to this day, and I vowed when I got to \nthe Senate that I would work to sort out the appropriate roles of the \nfederal, state and local governments.\n  I have committed myself to find ways in which the federal government \ncan be a better partner with our nation's state and local governments.\n  One of my concerns has been the overreaching nature of the federal \ngovernment into areas I have always felt properly belong under the \npurview of state and local government. Another of my concerns has been \nthe propensity of the federal government to pre-empt our state and \nlocal governments. In many cases, the federal government mandated \nresponsibilities to state and local governments and forced them to pay \nfor the mandates themselves.\n  In regard to unfunded mandates, I, and a number of other state and \nlocal elected officials finally got fed up enough to lobby Congress to \ndo something about it, and in 1995, Congress passed the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act. I was pleased to be at the Rose Garden \nrepresenting our state and local governments at the signing ceremony by \nthe President.\n  And while we now know the cost of what the federal government is \nimposing on the state and local governments, Congress has still got to \ndo more to reverse the tide of ``command and control'' policies in \nareas intrusive which are the proper responsibility of state and local \ngovernments.\n  Indeed, as syndicated columnist David Broder pointed out in a January \n11, 1995 article, ``the unfunded mandate bill is a worthy effort. But \nin the end, the real solution lies in sorting out more clearly what \nresponsibilities should be financed and run by each level of \ngovernment.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree.\n  It is imperative that we delineate the proper role of government at \nthe federal, state and local level.\n  Our forefathers referred to this differentiation as federalism, and \noutlined this relationship in the 10th Amendment:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are \n     reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\n\n  The importance of the 10th Amendment was inherent to the framers of \nthe Constitution, who sought to preserve for the states their ability \nto pass and uphold laws that were specific to each individual state. In \nthis way, states would keep their sovereignty over what we consider the \n``day to day'' running of society, reserving the more comprehensive \nfunctions of the nation to the federal government.\n  This was envisioned by James Madison, who defined the various roles \nof government in Federalist Paper #45. He wrote:\n\n       The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the \n     federal government are few and defined. Those which are to \n     remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. \n     The former will be exercised principally on external objects, \n     as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce . . . The \n     powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the \n     objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the \n     lives, liberties, and property of the people and the internal \n     order, improvement and prosperity of the state.\n\n  In a speech before the Volunteers of the National Archives in 1986 \nregarding the relationship of the Constitution with America's cities \nand the evolution of federalism, I raised a concern about the trend in \nAmerican government that I had witnessed since the 1960's. I said:\n\n       We have seen the expansion of the federal government into \n     new, non-traditional domestic policy areas. We have \n     experienced a tremendous increase in the proclivity of \n     Washington both to pre-empt state and local authority and to \n     mandate actions on state and local governments. The \n     cumulative effect of a series of actions by the Congress, the \n     Executive Branch and the U.S. Supreme Court have caused some \n     legal scholars to observe that while constitutional \n     federalism is alive in scholarly treatises, it has expired as \n     a practical political reality.\n\n  Mr. President, we have made progress since I spoke those words 13 \nyears ago. Not to the level sought by Madison, but progress just the \nsame. As I mentioned earlier, Congress has passed the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act. We've also passed Safe Drinking Water Act reforms in 1996. \nIn addition, states are making the difference in Medicaid reform and \nbecause of the efforts of state leaders working with Congress, we now \nhave comprehensive welfare reform.\n  Also, just this year, we've seen the passage and signing into law of \nthe ``Ed-Flex'' bill, which gives our states and school districts the \nfreedom to use their federal funds for identified education priorities \nand today we passed legislation preventing the federal government from \nrecouping the tobacco settlement funds back from the states.\n  But we must still do more.\n  Today, we are voting on juvenile justice legislation that would \nimpose certain new federal laws on what is now and has traditionally \nbeen a jurisdiction of our state and local governments.\n  I have great respect for the managers of this legislation; they have \nworked incredibly hard to put together this bill which contains a \nnumber of good provisions meant to fight juvenile crime and a \nsmorgasbord of other things that on the surface look very appealing.\n  Unfortunately most of them deal with things that are the proper \nresponsibility of state and local government and violate in spirit and \nin substance my interpretation of the 10th Amendment and frankly, the \ninterpretation of Alexander Hamilton.\n  Hamilton, who was the greatest proponent in his day of a strong \nnational government, saw law enforcement as a state and local concern. \nIf Hamilton were alive today, he would be appalled at the use of the \npolice power by federal agencies.\n  And to emphasize Hamilton's view, we need only look at Federalist \nPaper #17:\n\n       There is one transcendent advantage belonging to the \n     province of the state governments, which alone suffices to \n     place the matter in a clear and satisfactory light. I mean \n     the ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice.\n\n  Crime control is a primary responsibility of local and state \nofficials. They are on the front lines and they are best suited to \ntackle the specific problems in their jurisdictions.\n  Juvenile crime control measures are being enacted and carried out in \nthe various states across the country. And sometimes it does take a \ntragedy such as the one that occurred in Littleton, Colorado or the \nshooting this morning in Atlanta to spur states on, but they fully \nrecognize their responsibility to provide for the safety of their \ncitizens.\n  The states understand their role and the need to prevent any further \nincrease in juvenile crime. They are responding to that need.\n  Involvement by the federal government in this matter often duplicates \nthe efforts of our state and local governments.\n  I'll never forget, in 1996, when I was Governor and I went to a crime \ncontrol conference in Pennsylvania with then-Majority Leader Bob Dole. \nHe was running for President at the time. The\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\nhead of the conference suggested 5 things the federal government should \ndo to reduce juvenile crime. It made sense to me, but when I looked at \nthe recommendations, I realized that in Ohio, we were already doing the \nthings that were recommended.\n  In 1994, we instituted a program called ``RECLAIM Ohio'' which is an \ninnovative approach to juvenile corrections. This program stresses \nlocal decision-making and the creation of more effective, less costly \ncommunity-based correction alternatives to state incarceration.\n  Under ``RECLAIM Ohio,'' local juvenile court judges are given the \nflexibility to provide the most appropriate rehabilitation option. \nSince 1992, the population of juvenile offenders in Ohio's youth \ncorrection facilities has dropped 20% as a result of this and other \ninnovative local and state programs.\n  Mr. President, the success we have had in Ohio might never have come \nabout if we had to divert our resources towards a federally mandated \nprogram. We have seen results with ``RECLAIM Ohio;'' it is best suited \nfor us.\n  In fact, our ``RECLAIM Ohio'' program was selected as one of the top \nten innovative programs in government by the JFK School of Government \nat Harvard University--worthy of replicating elsewhere in the United \nStates.\n  In 1995, Ohio crafted its own comprehensive juvenile crime bill. This \nbill imposed mandatory bind-over provisions for the most heinous crimes \nand longer minimum sentences.\n  I believe we should heed the words of Senator Fred Thompson, who gave \nan eloquent speech about this bill last Wednesday. He said ``Among \nother things, [this bill] makes it easier to prosecute juveniles in \nFederal criminal court. We have about 100 to 200 prosecutions a year of \njuveniles in Federal court. It is a minuscule part of our criminal \njustice system.'' To put that in perspective, Senator Thompson pointed \nout that in 1998, there were ``58,000 Federal criminal cases filed \ninvolving 79,000 defendants.''\n  Think about what Senator Thompson says--58,000 total federal criminal \ncases filed; some 200 prosecutions a year of juveniles in Federal \ncourt. Do we honestly think that we'll have an extraordinarily dramatic \nincrease in juvenile prosecutions under this bill? I have to ask: why \non earth are we doing this?\n  He further stated, ``[This bill] would allow juveniles as young as 14 \nyears of age to be tried as an adult for violent crimes and drug \noffenses--drug offenses, again, that are of the street crime category, \nwhere we have laws on the books in every State of the Union.''\n  In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the leaders of the National Governors' Association said \n``the nation's governors are concerned that attempts to expand federal \ncriminal law. . .into traditional state functions would have little \neffect in eliminating crime but could undermine state and local anti-\ncrime efforts.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the American Bar Association's Task \nForce on the Federalization of Criminal Law in its report issued at the \nend of last year stated that ``more than 40% of the federal criminal \nprovisions enacted since the Civil War have been enacted since 1970.'' \nAs a footnote, the report indicates that more than a quarter of the \nfederal criminal provisions were enacted over the sixteen year period \nof 1980-1996.\n  Some change in the responsibility is legitimate, based upon the scope \nof particular offenses. However, many changes have simply evolved from \ncurrent state and local laws that the federal government has either co-\nopted or the Congress has directed federal agencies to carry-out.\n  As we continue to assign a greater involvement for the federal \ngovernment in law enforcement, the impact on other resources is also \nstrained, primarily the federal court system.\n  And for those who understand the traditional role of state and local \nlaw enforcement, it becomes increasingly frustrating to see the shift \nin prosecuted crimes.\n  Earlier this month in testimony before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Federal Appeals Court Judge Gilbert S. Merritt said that his \nCourt's docket and the case load of the U.S. Attorney's office for his \njurisdiction consists of ``mainly drug and illegal possession of \nfirearms cases and other cases that duplicate state crimes'' and that \n``federal prosecution of drug and firearms crime is having a minimal \neffect on the distribution of drugs and illegal firearms.''\n  Most compelling, Judge Merritt said ``our law enforcement efforts \nwould be much more effective if Congress repealed most duplicate \nfederal crimes and tried to help local and state street police, \ndetectives, prosecutors and judges do a more effective job.''\n  Judge Merritt suggested that before we federalize crime enforcement, \nwe should ``concentrate federal criminal law enforcement in only the \nfollowing core areas:\n  (1) Offenses against the United States itself;\n  (2) Multi-State or international criminal activity that is impossible \nfor a single state or its courts to handle;\n  (3) Crimes that involve a matter of overriding federal interest, such \nas violation of civil rights by state actors;\n  (4) Widespread corruption at the state and local levels; and\n  (5) Crimes of such magnitude or complexity that federal resources are \nrequired.''\n  Mr. President, based on what I can see, this legislation does not \nmeet these criteria.\n  So, if we are truly concerned about lowering the incidences of \nviolent crime in America, I believe our focus should be not only on the \nsymptoms of juvenile crime, but on the root causes as well. We have to \nact first, and not react later, if we wish to benefit our kids.\n  To be sure, there are just plain, bad juveniles who need to be locked \nup. And, we need better information about juvenile offenders, profiles \nthat will help our courts deal with rough kids and get them off the \nstreets.\n  But, I think part of the problem is youngsters aren't getting the \nmoral and family and religious training at home, responsibilities that \nare falling more and more on our schools.\n  In Ohio, we established a mediation and dispute resolution program in \nour kindergartens and first grades to get kids to talk out their \nproblems so they don't resort to violence.\n  We did this because I am concerned, Mr. President, about how we can \nreach our kids, to help make them become decent, productive members of \nsociety.\n  What we need to do is draw a line in the sand, and proclaim that we \nare not going to allow another generation of children to fall by the \nwayside. We have to say ``This is where it stops.''\n  We need to become a better partner with state and local government \nand invest in our children at the most critical juncture of their \nlives--pre-natal to three--the time when parents and young children are \nforming life-long attachments and when parents and other care-givers \nhave an opportunity to construct lasting values.\n  I believe putting our efforts towards creating this powerful, \nenduring impact on a young child's physical, intellectual, emotional \nand social development will do more to end the cycle of crime and \nviolence in America than anything else the Senate could do.\n  Mr. President, once more, I would like to congratulate the managers \nof this bill for the time and energy that they have put into this bill, \nbut juvenile crime control is not the responsibility of the federal \ngovernment.\n  Again, we need only look as far as the Constitution to determine \nwhich crimes fall within the purview of the federal government--\n  1. Article 1, Section 8--To provide for the punishment of \ncounterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States;\n  2. Article 1, Section 8--To define and punish piracies and felonies \ncommitted on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations; \nand\n  3. Article 3, Section 3--To declare the punishment for treason.\n  For the remainder of crime that impacts our nation, the 10th \nAmendment spells out quite clearly how we should deal with it:\n  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \nnor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states \nrespectively, or to the people.\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\n  Mr. President, we should follow the wisdom of our forefathers.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy: As the Senate \n     considers juvenile crime legislation, the nation's Governors \n     believe that the federal government should improve its \n     support of states in combating youth violence. This endeavor \n     requires the development and implementation of programs and \n     policies that strive to prevent delinquency, eliminate the \n     presence of violence wherever children congregate, and ensure \n     strong punishment for those responsible for exposing young \n     people to delinquency, drugs, and violence. The first line of \n     defense against youth violence is responsible parenting. \n     Having recognized this fact, the states' priority in this \n     area should be to establish comprehensive services and \n     programs that prevent youth from committing crime. Prevention \n     programs that build self-esteem through achievement of \n     worthwhile goals and offer an alternative to violent and \n     criminal activity are critical to the successful reduction of \n     juvenile crime.\n       There should be a safe environment for children to grow and \n     develop. This includes schools, parks, playgrounds, and any \n     place youth congregate. The rise in handgun violence \n     especially in and around schools is of concern to Governors. \n     There should be swift and certain punishment for individuals \n     who illegally provide a firearm to a minor, or knowingly \n     provide a firearm to a minor for illegal use. Furthermore, \n     there must be immediate seizure of guns illegally possessed \n     by minors. Also, there should be strict penalties for \n     children below the age of eighteen who illegally possess a \n     firearm.\n       S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \n     Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999 will be among \n     the legislative initiatives considered regarding juvenile \n     crime. We would like to address some of the provisions in \n     this legislation.\n       Federalization: The nation's Governors are concerned that \n     attempts to expand federal criminal law (Title I of S. 254) \n     into traditional state functions would have little effect in \n     eliminating crime but could undermine state and local \n     anticrime efforts. Further, the Governors are concerned that \n     federal concurrent jurisdiction in criminal justice efforts \n     can be used by the federal government as a means to impose \n     undue mandates on state and local crime control and law \n     enforcement officials.\n       Another federalism issue is raised by section 1802 the \n     ``Juvenile Criminal History Grants.'' It needs language \n     clarifying what information will be contained in the national \n     data bases, who will have access to the data, how the data \n     will be used, and to affirm states' right to ultimately \n     control access to their own data under our federal system.\n       Waiver: The formula in the accountability block grant of S. \n     254 (Part R--Juvenile Accountability Block Grants, Subtitle \n     B) requires states to pass-through money to local units of \n     governments handling juvenile justice functions. In many \n     states, including Utah and Vermont, the juvenile crime \n     function is administered at the state level of government, \n     working with the locals. S. 254 would allow the Attorney \n     General to waive the pass-through requirement for these \n     states. We support this provision.\n       Flexibility: The current language in S. 254 offers some \n     discretion to Governors over appointments to state advisory \n     boards overseeing implementation of state programs under the \n     Juvenile Justice Act. Governors should have sole discretion \n     over creation, make-up and appointments to state advisory \n     boards. Some states have existing boards that can fulfill \n     this requirement. Furthermore, states should be given maximum \n     flexibility to implement the spirit and purposes of the \n     statute for the goals of delinquency prevention, \n     intervention, and protection of juveniles from harm. Also, S. \n     254 eases the monitoring requirements for state \n     implementation of the Juvenile Justice program.\n       Program participation with core requirements: Governors \n     believe that rules, regulations, definitions, \n     responsibilities, and reporting requirements authorized in \n     the legislation should be reasonable and not impede states' \n     ability to effectively administer the programs promoted in \n     the legislation. Further, the statute should be designed to \n     encourage full participation in the program by all the \n     states, but not penalize states that choose not to \n     participate in some or all programs.\n       The recent tragic events in Colorado, Oregon, Arkansas, \n     Kentucky, and Mississippi and other areas of the country have \n     focused the nation's attention on the need for juvenile \n     justice reform. We appreciate your taking our concerns under \n     consideration as you debate S. 254.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Thomas R. Carper,\n       Chairman.\n     Governor Michael O. Leavitt,\n       Vice Chairman.\n     Governor James B. Hunt, Jr.,\n       Chairman, Human Resources Committee.\n     Governor Mike Huckabee,\n       Vice Chairman, Human Resources Committee.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 254, \nthe Juvenile Justice Bill. I oppose this bill because it does far more \nharm than good to the fundamental interests of our nation's children.\n  The bill fails to do what the Littleton tragedy screams out loudly \nand clearly we should do: strive to prevent future schoolhouse \ntragedies and all juvenile violence. The bill is long on prosecution \nand detention but short on prevention.\n  During debate on this bill, I was glad to see that some of my \nconcerns were resolved. After a contentious debate, the Senate finally \nclosed the gun show loophole. The Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment is a \nsensible regulation on the sale of guns at gun shows. It does not \nprevent law-abiding citizens from selling and buying guns at gun shows.\n  The Senate's debate on guns in the last week had what I believe to be \na sensible outcome. But I do want to point out one thing about the \ndebate we have had on various amendments to this bill dealing with the \ntopic of gun control. Obviously, there are very strong feelings about \ngun-related amendments on both sides, and the issues are complex. But \nthe vast majority of campaign contributions from groups interested in \nthese amendments to the Senators who are voting on them is coming from \none side. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, gun rights \ngroups, including the National Rifle Association, gave over $9 million \nto candidates, PACs, and parties from 1991 to 1998. The NRA gave $1.6 \nmillion in PAC contributions to federal candidates last year. Handgun \nControl, Inc. gave a total of $146,000.\n  With respect to Senator Lautenberg's amendment to close the gun show \nloophole last week, the Center found that those who voted against that \namendment had received an average of over $10,478 from gun rights \ngroups, while those who voted for it averaged only $297. I say this not \nto cast aspersions on any Senator's vote, but because I think the \npublic record of our debate on these issues would be incomplete without \nthis information.\n  There have been other improvements made in the bill as a result of \nthe debate here on the floor and negotiations among Senators and the \nManagers. The final bill now reasonably protects the privacy of \njuvenile offender records. The amendment to ensure the separation of \nchildren from adult prisoners in mixed prison settings also was \nadopted.\n  This good work, however, is not enough to undo the harm that this \nbill will do to our nation's children.\n  We have strong evidence that prevention reduces crime. According to \nthe Children's Defense Fund, in the first year after the Baltimore \nPolice Department opened an after-school program in a high-crime area, \ncrime in that neighborhood dropped 42%. Cincinnati's crime rate dropped \n24% since it instituted violence prevention, education, social and \nrecreation programs. And in Fort Worth, Texas, gang-related crime \ndropped by 26% as a result of a gang reduction program.\n  Now, the Hatch-Biden amendment takes us part of the way there by \nallowing 25% of funding for juvenile block grants to be allocated to \nprevention efforts. But frankly, that's not enough. We need to do more. \nOur children's future demands that we do more.\n  The Juvenile Justice bill emphasizes detention and intervention after \njuveniles have already gotten into trouble. The bill, however, does not \nprovide sensible, adequate funding for prevention programs. Programs \nthat will help to ensure that kids will not turn to crime and violence \nand will never have to experience handcuffs slapped on their wrists or \nthe inside of a detention center.\n  This bill also deeply troubles me because it will put a halt to \nefforts to reduce discrimination in our juvenile justice system. The \nbill ignores reality: we are throwing African-American kids into jails \nat a higher rate than white kids who commit the exact same offense. \nThis phenomenon is called disproportionate minority confinement.\n  Our Nation has come a long way toward achieving racial harmony and\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\nequality, but we still have a long way to go. In nearly every state, \nchildren of minority racial and ethnic backgrounds are over-represented \nat every stage of the juvenile justice system and receive harsher \ntreatment by the system. A California study has shown that black \nyouths consistently receive harsher punishment and are more likely to \nreceive jail time than white youths convicted of the same offenses. \nCurrent law requires states to identify disproportionate minority \nconfinement in their states, to analyze why it exists and to develop \nstrategies to address the causes of disproportionate minority \nconfinement. The law does not require and has never resulted in the \nrelease of juveniles. Nor does the law provide for quotas. And no \nstate's funding under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct has ever been reduced as a result of non-compliance.\n\n  In fact, the current law has been very effective. Forty states are \nimplementing or developing intervention plans to address \ndisproportionate minority confinement. This bill will bring to a halt \nthis good work conducted by the states. These states have just begun to \naddress the disturbing reality of disproportionate minority \nconfinement. But under this Juvenile Justice bill, the law enforcement \ncommunity will no longer be required to address the problem of \ndiscriminatory treatment of minority juvenile offenders. This is \noutrageous.\n  I am outraged, and this body should be outraged, that we are \npunishing black kids more harshly than white kids for the exact same \noffenses. The debate on this issue illustrated how much more work we \nstill need to do on civil rights. Many of my colleagues would have you \nbelieve that there is no longer a race problem in this country. I beg \nto differ. To those colleagues, I ask you to look around this chamber \nand identify for me the Senator of African descent. You cannot because \nthere is not one. I am troubled that on this and other important civil \nrights issues, we do not have a member of the African-American \ncommunity as one of our colleagues. I cannot help but think that our \ndebate would have been better informed if we had the voice of an \nAfrican-American Senator speaking at one of our podiums. I cannot help \nbut think that the vote on the Wellstone-Kennedy amendment would have \nhad a different outcome if we had the vote of an African-American \nSenator cast on this floor.\n  We have come a long way toward ridding our nation of discrimination \nagainst African Americans and other minorities. But we need to keep \nforging ahead for the good of our children and the future of our \ncountry. Let us not turn back the clock.\n  The bill also does more harm than good by shifting the burden to the \nchild to show why he or she should be tried in a juvenile court, not as \nan adult. Under current law, federal judges, not prosecutors, decide \nwhether a child will be tried as an adult after a full hearing. If the \nprosecutor believes that a child should be charged as an adult, the \nprosecutor goes to court and puts on evidence to establish why the \nchild should be tried as an adult. This is called a ``waiver'' hearing. \nThe prosecutor must show reason for the judge to waive the child into \nadult court.\n  Now, under the Juvenile Justice bill, the prosecutor would be able to \ncharge children as young as 14 as adults if they have allegedly \ncommitted a felony. The child--not the prosecutor--would request a \nhearing to prove to the judge that he or should be treated as a child.\n  There is great wisdom in the current law. The decision to prosecute a \nchild as an adult is a serious one that will profoundly impact that \nchild's life and the sentence that will follow conviction. It is better \nto leave that decision to an impartial judge, not the prosecutor.\n  Finally, I must cast my vote against this bill because it creates yet \nanother federal death penalty. The Senate unfortunately passed the \nHatch-Feinstein amendment, which will allow imposition of the death \npenalty against persons who cause the death of another person during an \nact of animal enterprise terrorism. I have been, and continue to be, a \nstrong, steadfast opponent of the death penalty. In my view, the death \npenalty is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits \ncruel and unusual punishment. And it is morally wrong for a civilized \nsociety to continue to impose this penalty. We should lock up offenders \nfor life, but we should not take their lives.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to heed the advice of \nskilled professionals who work with our youth every day. Organizations \nlike the Children's Defense Fund, the Youth Law Center, the National \nNetwork for Youth have expressed their serious opposition to the bill. \nThese organizations represent the thousands of people who are \nconducting effective after-school programs, providing counseling to \ntroubled youth and other necessary services to our children at risk. In \nother words, these organizations are the experts. The experts believe \nthat, although the bill is much improved over last year's juvenile \njustice bill and corrects some problems in the original bill as it came \nto the floor last week, the final bill is still a regressive solution \nto juvenile crime.\n  Let us put aside our partisanship for the sake of our children's and \nour Nation's future. I must oppose this juvenile justice bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senate bill 254 does not, in my opinion, \nwarrant passage. I will vote against the bill because it is \nfundamentally fraudulent. First, it wrongly assumes that Washington, DC \nhas the answers to juvenile crime and the right to impose its will over \nthat of state and local communities. Second, it is fraudulent because \nit promises billions of dollars for new programs that will not be \nimplemented because the money is simply not available.\n  To hold out the false hope that the federal government can, through \nthe passage of yet another law, offer an easy solution detracts from \nthe important, and admittedly difficult, work that must continue in our \nhomes, schools and communities.\n  As difficult as it may be for many of my colleagues to accept, the \ncure for the violence and disrespect for life that is prevalent in our \nsociety, particularly in our younger generations, will not be found in \nthis body by passing another federal law. I wish it were that easy. The \ncure will be found after a great deal of soul-searching by our nation \nat all levels. Parents must re-engage in their children's lives. \nSchools must work harder to spot the warning signs displayed by our \ntroubled youth and take action before tragedy occurs. And those who \nmarket gratuitous violence--whether it be through television, movies, \nvideo games or the Internet--must consider the responsibility they have \nto society, as well as to their bottom line. Most decisions should be \nmade in our communities, not in the Congress. States should be allowed \nto experiment with a wide range of programs, not told what to do by \nWashington D.C.\n  I recognize some positive elements in this bill. The relaxation, for \nexample, of the strict sight and sound separation requirements between \njuvenile and adult prisoners is a common sense change consistent with \nthe views expressed by law enforcement officials in my state. Although \nI support the Ashcroft Amendment that gives local educators the \nflexibility to treat equally all students who bring guns to schools, \nthe law it amends is fundamentally flawed and requires more thorough \ndebate. I intend to have this debate later this year.\n  The positive elements in S. 254, however, are outweighed by the \nnegative: the bill usurps state, local, and private sector authority, \nboth in spirit and in practice. For example, although S. 254 makes \nfederal juvenile adjudication and conviction records available to \nschools in certain circumstances, thus permitting school officials \nknowledge of the conceivable monstrous acts of a prospective student, \nit then prohibits all schools, once privy to that information, from \nusing it in admissions decisions.\n  The bill makes promises we cannot keep and creates expectations we \ncannot meet.\n  S. 254 authorizes prodigious amounts of federal funds for numerous \nprograms, and the promise of these monies has led to considerable \nfighting over their allocation, particularly over earmarking funds for \ncrime prevention programs. While the debate between prevention and \npunishment is an important one, it is, unfortunately, also\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nhollow in this case: it is extremely unlikely that many of the programs \nauthorized in S. 254 will be funded at anywhere near the levels \nauthorized, if at all.\n  Much to my dismay and those of other appropriators, it is unclear \nwhether we will be able this year to meet current commitments to \njuvenile justice and law enforcement. In the budget he sent to \nCongress, the President eliminated numerous federal grant programs and \ngutted others. The Byrne Grants that have been put to such good use in \nWashington state to, among other things establish multi-jurisdictional \ndrug task forces, were reduced by more than 20% in the President's \nbudget. Local law enforcement block grants, for which $523 million was \nappropriated in 1999, and which are used for a range of law enforcement \nneeds, from putting more officers on the streets to improving law \nenforcement communications systems, were eliminated entirely. Grants to \nstates for prison construction, a $720 million program in 1999, was \nreduced to $75 million in the President's FY2000 budget. Put another \nway: our first priority ought to be funding our current crime \nprevention programs, rather than adding a passel of new ones we frankly \ncannot afford.\n  Regrettably, many of the philosophical and practical concerns I have \nwith this legislation simply were not addressed during the many long \ndays it has been on the floor because we have spent so much time \ndebating gun amendments. I firmly believe in common sense gun safety \nprocedures as long as they do not infringe on the Second Amendment \nfreedoms of law abiding adults. Several times this week I voted for \namendments that would help to promote gun safety or keep guns out of \nthe hands of criminals, and just as often I voted against amendments \nthat infringed on second amendment rights that would not effectively do \nthis. Never, however, did I vote on an amendment that I thought would \nhave prevented the recent tragedies in Georgia and Colorado.\n  And so, with regret, I cannot join my colleagues in misleading the \nAmerican people in promising that through this, or any other, bill, we \nwill make their communities and schools safe again.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased that my amendment to the \npending Juvenile Justice bill was included in a package of amendments \ncleared by the managers. I would like to talk briefly about why this \nprovision is crucial to combatting school violence.\n  As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, the Holland Woods \nMiddle School in Port Huron, Michigan, made national news this past \nweek. Four children, the youngest of them 12 years old, were arrested \nfor plotting to do ``something worse'' than the tragedy that occurred \nin Littleton, Colorado. Police in Port Huron believe that the plot was \nmore than a prank. They believe the students planned to rob a gun store \nfor the weapons needed to carry out their plan.\n  Here we have yet another sign, Mr. President, of the epidemic in this \ncountry of violence and fear in our schools.\n  All across the country, schools are experiencing bomb threats and \nstudents and teachers are beginning to fear entering the classroom. The \nDetroit News front page headline from yesterday summed it up: ``Fear, \nthreats invade Metro classrooms.'' The News went on to report that one-\nthird of the 560 students at Holland Woods Middle School stayed home \nMonday, the first day of classes since police discovered the plot to \nmassacre students there.\n  Mr. President, students should not fear for their lives when they \nenter the school building. Indeed, they have a right not to be put in \nthis kind of fear, particularly on school grounds.\n  I believe we must do more to help schools deal with threats of \nviolence. We must give schools more options to prevent the type of \ntragedy that occurred in Littleton and that also might have occurred in \nPort Huron.\n  Following the incident in Holland Woods Middle School, Assistant \nSuperintendent Thomas Miller outlined the school system's response to \nincreasing security at their schools. The school system's plan would \ninclude 24-hour security guard surveillance at all schools and a bomb-\nsniffing dog. Other proposed security measures could include metal \ndetectors, the elimination of coats in classrooms and photo \nidentification badges for pupils and teachers.\n  Mr. President, my provision would allow schools facing these serious \nsecurity problems to access Safe and Drug Free School money to address \ntheir security needs and to truly keep their schools ``safe.''\n  In light of the growing number of violence in our schools and an \nincrease in the number of threats, we must provide local school \ndistricts with further, effective options in combatting the \nproliferation of guns, explosives, and other weapons in our schools.\n  My provision will also help schools deal with the scourge of drugs, a \nscourge which not only ruins individual lives but also breeds the kinds \nof isolation, maladjustment and violence we have seen so often in \nrecent years.\n  Currently, school districts may use funds allocated under the Safe \nand Drug Free Schools Act for a variety of programs aimed at reducing \ndrug use and school violence. School districts need additional options. \nMy amendment would allow local school districts to access funding under \nthe Safe and Drug Free Schools Act for use in conducting locker \nsearches for guns, explosives, other weapons, or drugs and for the drug \ntesting of students.\n  Drug use constitutes a full-fledged epidemic in our schools, Mr. \nPresident. In a recent Luntz survey, three fourths of high school \nstudents said that their schools are not drug free. 41 percent reported \nseeing drugs sold on school grounds. And now the drug menace is moving \ninto our middle schools. 46 percent, almost half of our middle school \nkids, go to schools that are not drug free.\n  With the explosion in drug use we also have seen a massive \nproliferation of guns in our schools. The Departments of Education and \nJustice report that 6,093 students were expelled for bringing guns to \nschool during the 1996-97 school year alone.\n  This is the situation supposedly addressed by the Safe and Drug Free \nSchools Act. So, what is this act, written into law in 1986 and with \ncurrent funding levels at $566 million, accomplishing? Tragically \nlittle, Mr. President.\n  Congress passed the Safe and Drug Free School Act allocating funds to \nfight drug use and the violence it breeds. But that money is not being \nspent wisely, on programs that actually succeed in reducing drug use \nand gun violence in our schools.\n  Instead, Mr. President, a report in the Los Angeles Times has found \nthat grant money is being used to pay for questionable activities like \nmotivational speakers, puppet shows, tickets to Disneyland, dunking \nbooths and magic shows. Surely we can use this law for something more \nthan what President Clinton's own drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, \ncalls a program to ``mail out checks.''\n  Our children and their teachers deserve better. Indeed, Mr. \nPresident, they are demanding better. For three years running, teens in \nthe Luntz survey have deemed drugs the most important problem they \nface. Most teens favor random locker searches and drug testing of all \nstudents.\n  And their teachers agree. Four out of five teachers favor locker \nsearches and a zero tolerance policy on drugs. Two thirds favor at \nleast some form of drug testing.\n  Mr. President, our teachers and our children have recognized the \nobvious: we must find those who are bringing guns and explosives into \nour schools if we are to stop gun and other forms of violence affecting \nour kids\n  By the same token, Mr. President, you must find those who are using \nand dealing drugs before you can effectively deal with the drug problem \nin our schools.\n  My amendment accepts the common sense logic expressed by our teachers \nand students.\n  My amendment does nothing to alter the availability of funds for \nother options in the fight against drugs and gun violence in our \nschools. It merely adds to the list the option of using these funds for \nlocker searches and drug testing. It, rightly in my view, leaves the \nfinal decision on these issues to those who know the needs of their \nschools best--local authorities. But it adds an important option to the \nlist from which they can choose.\n  I am pleased that this common sense proposal has been cleared by the \nmanagers.\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with the passage of the Juvenile Justice \nbill today the Senate took a positive step forward in addressing the \nyouth violence that we have sadly seen far too much of in recent weeks.\n  One month ago today, we watched in horror as children turned violent \nagainst other children, and we asked ourselves why? Today, again, we've \nseen the horror of a high school student firing a weapon at his \nschoolmates. There is no one cause of this youth violence, the causes \nare many but the common denominator in all of these school shootings \ncannot be ignored or denied: the easy access our young people have to \nguns.\n  If there is one silver lining in what happened at Littleton it's that \nthis event has become a catalyst for the Senate to finally begin to \novercome the disproportionate influence of the gun lobby and to close a \nfew of the gaping loopholes in our federal gun laws which give our \nyouth such easy access to guns.\n  Over the last few weeks, with the Juvenile Justice bill on the floor \nof the Senate, we have taken important steps to strengthen our current \nlaws. We have passed legislation to prohibit juveniles from owning \nsemiautomatic weapons and large capacity ammunition devices. We have \nbanned the importation of big ammunition clips, which have been \nflooding into the United States by the millions. The Senate passed an \namendment requiring that handguns be sold with trigger locking devices \nto protect children. And just this morning, the Senate, by one vote, \nthe deciding vote cast by Vice President Gore, passed legislation to \nregulate the sale of firearms at guns shows, ensuring juveniles and \nothers cannot use these shows as a convenient way to circumvent the \nsafeguards applied to normal sales through licensed gun dealers.\n  Mr. President, I believe it's clear that the American people support \nthe actions we have taken. In fact, I am hopeful that we will build on \nthese first steps, for example, to ban semiautomatic assault weapons \nand handguns for persons under 21 years of age. This may be one of our \nmost important tasks yet. According the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms' Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, the two most \nfrequent ages at which crimes are committed with gun possession are 18 \nand 19. In 1997, 22% of those arrested for murder were 18, 19 or 20 \nyears old.\n  This legislation clearly falls short of closing all of the loopholes \nwhich allow our youth easy access to deadly weapons. However, in the \nwake of the tragedy at Littleton, the Senate has taken critical steps \nforward. This is a victory for the good sense of the American people \nover the entrenched interests of NRA lobbyists in Washington.\n  Mr. President, in addition to preventing our youth from having access \nto deadly weapons, we must also ensure that schools have access to \nproven violence prevention programs designed to meet the particular \nneeds of the students. The bill provides $250 million in grants for \nprojects that allow schools to partner with the U.S. Department of \nJustice and police officers in crime prevention; $113 million for \ncreative on-site school violence prevention programs and alcohol nd \ndrug counseling; and amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nto make funds available for training in school safety and violence \nprevention, crisis preparedness, mentoring and anti-violence programs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the passage of this Juvenile Justice Bill \nrepresents an important step forward for those of us who have expressed \nconcern for the safety and well-being of America's young people. I am \npleased that in spite of the tensions and the controversies that have \nmarked these past weeks in the United States Senate, we are, in the \nfinal analysis, able to come together as a Senate in support of certain \nprinciples that we know are absolutely essential if we are to reform \nour nation's juvenile justice policy to reflect modern life and the \nneeds of all our children in this nation.\n  The aftermath of the tragic school shootings in Littleton and even \nthe violence today in Atlanta underscored for all of us the importance \nof getting serious about juvenile justice. In this debate here in the \nSenate about juvenile justice, we heard a great deal about efforts to \nkeep guns out of the hands of violent students, we heard about efforts \nto try juvenile offenders as adults, about stiffer sentences, about so \nmany answers to the problem of kids who have run out of second and \nthird chances--kids who are violent, kids who are committing crimes, \nchildren who are a danger to themselves and a danger to those around \nhim. I was a prosecutor in Massachusetts before I entered elected \noffice. I have seen these violent teenagers and young people come to \ncourt, and let me tell you, there is nothing more tragic than seeing \nthese children who--in too many cases --have a jail cell in their \nfuture not far down the road, children who have done what is, at times, \nirreparable harm to their communities.\n  I am pleased we are passing a bill today which demonstrates we don't \nonly begin to care about these kids at that point --after the violence, \nafter the arrest, after the damage has been done, when it may be too \nlate--when we could have started intervening in our kids' lives early \non, before it was too late. We can say that we have had a real debate \nabout juvenile justice because we are passing a bill that makes some \ncritical investments in vital early childhood development efforts, but \na great deal of work remains undone.\n  The truth is that early intervention can have a powerful effect on \nreducing government welfare, health, criminal justice, and education \nexpenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can reduce later \ndestructive behavior such as dropping out of school, drug use, and \ncriminal acts like the ones we have seen in Littleton and Jonesboro. We \nare doing that in this bill--but we should be doing far more.\n  A study of the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool found that at-\nrisk toddlers who received pre-schooling and a weekly home visit \nreduced the risk that these children would grow up to become chronic \nlaw breakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse University Family \nDevelopment Study showed that providing quality early-childhood \nprograms to families until children reached age five reduces the \nchildren's risk of delinquency 10 years later by 90 percent. It is no \nwonder that a recent survey of police chiefs found that nine out of ten \nsaid that ``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested \nmore'' in these early intervention programs.\n  I know it can work. I visited an incredible center, the Castle Square \nEarly Childhood Development Center in Boston, and I saw kids getting \nthe attention they need during the day while their parents work, \nchildren being held and read to, and cared for, children who aren't \nraising themselves, parents who come in and volunteer in the evening \nand take classes there so they can better take care of their kids when \nthey're sick or when they need special attention. But you know what, \nfor the sixty kids in that program, there are six hundred on a waiting \nlist.\n  There is the Early Childhood Initiative in Allegheny County, PA--one \nof the first pilot programs in this country which gave life to the kind \nof legislation we're passing here today--an innovative program which \nhelps low-income children from birth to age five become successful, \nproductive adults by enrolling them in high quality, neighborhood-based \nearly care and education programs ranging from Head Start, center-based \nchild care, home-based child care, and school readiness programs. ECI \ndraws on everything that's right about Allegheny County--the strengths \nof its communities-- neighborhood decision-making, parent involvement, \nand quality measurement. Parents and community groups decide if they \nwant to participate and they come together and develop a proposal \ntailored for the community. Regular review programs ensure quality \nprogramming and cost-effectiveness. We're talking about local control \ngetting results locally: 19,000 pre-school aged children from low-\nincome families, 10,000 of which were not enrolled in any child care or \neducation program. By the year 2000, through funding supplied by ECI, \napproximately 75% of these under-served pre-schoolers will be reached. \nEarly evaluations show that enrolled children are achieving at rates \nequivalent to their middle income peers. And as we know, without this \nleveling of the playing field, low-\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nincome children are at a greater risk of encountering the juvenile \njustice system. That's a real difference.\n  These kinds of programs are successful because children's experiences \nduring their early years of life lay the foundation for their future \ndevelopment. But in too many places in this country our failure to \nprovide young children what they need during these crucial early years \nhas long-term consequences and costs for America.\n  Recent Scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing \nchildren's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development \nwill result in tremendous benefits for children, families, and our \nnation. The electrical activity of brain cells actually changes the \nphysical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating \nenvironment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain \ncontains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are \nstars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons \ndevelops over time. Children who play very little or are rarely touched \ndevelop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n  Reversing these problems later in life is far more difficult and \ncostly. We know that--if it wasn't so much harder, we wouldn't be \nhaving this difficult debate in the Senate.\n  I think it is time we talked about giving our kids the right start in \ntheir lives they need to be healthy, to be successful, to mature in a \nway that doesn't lead to at-risk and disruptive behavior and violence \ndown the road.\n  We should stop and consider what is really at stake here. Poverty \nseriously impairs young children's language development, math skills, \nIQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also \nare at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. \nOf the 12 million children under the age of 3 in the United States \ntoday, 3 million--25 percent--live in poverty. Three out of five \nmothers with children under three work, but one study found that 40 \npercent of the facilities at child care centers serving infants \nprovided care of such poor quality as to actually jeopardize children's \nhealth, safety, or development. In more than half of the states, one \nout of every four children between 19 months and three years of age is \nnot fully immunized against common childhood diseases. Children who are \nnot immunized are more likely to contract preventable diseases, which \ncan cause long-term harm. Children younger than three make up 27 \npercent of the one million children who are determined to be abused or \nneglected each year. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and \nneglect in 1995, 85 percent were younger than five and 45 percent were \nyounger than one.\n  Unfortunately, our Government expenditure patterns have been inverse \nto the most important early development period for human beings. \nAlthough we know that early investment can dramatically reduce later \nremedial and social costs, our nation has spent no more than $35 \nbillion over five years on federal programs for at-risk or delinquent \nyouth and child welfare programs.\n  That is a course we are taking some steps to change today. We are \nstarting to talk in a serious and a thoughtful way--through a \nbipartisan approach--about making a difference in the lives of our \nchildren before they're put at risk. We are starting to accept the \ntruth that we can do a lot more to help our kids grow up healthy with \npromising futures in an early childhood development center, in a \nclassroom, and in a doctor's office than we can in a courtroom or in a \njail cell. But we could be doing much more.\n  These issues are now a part of this juvenile justice debate. But they \nneed to be a bigger part of every debate we have about our kids' \nfuture. My colleague Kit Bond and I reintroduced yesterday our Early \nChildhood Development Act which we had previously introduced in the \nlast Congress, and which had passed as part of the tobacco legislation \nlast summer. That bill moves us forward in a bipartisan way towards a \ndifferent kind of discussion about juvenile justice--and towards \nactions we can take to provide meaningful intervention in the lives of \nall of our children. I am appreciative of the deep support we've found \nfor our approach in this legislation by Senator Stevens, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Dodd, Senator Kennedy and all of the cosponsors of \nthe original Kerry Bond bill: Senator Hollings, Senator Johnson, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Levin, Senator Moynihan, Senator Wellstone, \nand my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Bob Torricelli. I am pleased \nto join Senators Stevens and Kennedy in supporting parenting, but as we \nexpressed in our sense-of-the-Senate amendment there is much more we \nneed to be doing in terms of broader early childhood development \nefforts--we need a more comprehensive approach.\n  In this legislation we have taken an important step towards \nrecognizing the importance of early childhood development programs for \nour children, as well as the responsibility of the Congress to make \nearly childhood investments a priority in our budget process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 5 minutes be given \nto myself and Senator Leahy, in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the past, time seemed to roll past \nschool shootings and similar tragedies. The public was quickly \ndistracted. Yet, Littleton was different. The need to do something \nabout the serious problem of youth violence has always been apparent. \nThe tragedy of a month ago gave us the ingenuity and dedication to \nfollow through.\n  I have said since the outset of this debate that this issue is a \ncomplex problem and one which requires dedication and a spirit of \ncooperation. I felt that we needed to examine this and other acts of \nschool violence and not single-out one politically attractive interest \nas a cause. In doing what's right for our children and in doing what's \nright for the public at large, our personal interests had to take a \nback seat. While I believe the cooperative spirit was lacking on \noccasion, I believe that the Senate has crafted a consensus product and \none which I intend to support.\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\n  At the start of this debate, I along with several of my colleagues \nannounced a comprehensive plan to respond to the problem of violent \njuvenile crime. Our Youth Violence Plan contains four main components:\n  1. Prevention and Enforcement Assistance to State and Local \nGovernment;\n  2. Parental Empowerment and Stemming the Influence of Cultural \nViolence;\n  3. Getting Tough on Violent Juveniles and Those Who Commit Violent \nCrimes with a Firearm; and\n  4. Providing for Safe and Secure Schools.\n  Each element of this plan--all of it--is included in S. 254 as \namended.\n  I. Prevention & Enforcement Assistance to State and Local Government: \nThe first tier of this plan involved passage of the underlying bill--S. \n254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender and Accountability Act. \nWe have provided a targeted infusion of funds to State and local \nauthorities to combat juvenile crime. S. 254 provides over $1 billion a \nyear to the States to fight juvenile crime and prevent juvenile \ndelinquency. We need to reach out to young children early in life, \ninsure that parents are empowered to do what they believe is best for \ntheir children, and take meaningful steps to give local education and \nenforcement officials the tools they need to hold violent juveniles \naccountable. S. 254 accomplishes this goal.\n  II. Parental Empowerment and Stemming the Influence of Cultural \nViolence: The second tier of our plan involved Congress taking steps to \nempower parents, educators and the entertainment industry to do more to \nlimit the exposure of America's children to violence in our popular \nculture. We offered several amendments to the underlying bill which \nfurthered this leg of our plan and all of them passed the Senate. For \nexample, this bill gives parents the power to screen undesirable \nmaterial from entering their homes over the Internet. We have given the \nentertainment industry the tools it needs to develop and enforce pre-\nexisting ratings systems so that children are not exposed to material \nthat the industry itself has deemed unsuitable for children. And we \nhave established a National Commission on Youth Violence. It is time \nfor us to hold Hollywood--and the rest of the entertainment industry--a \nbit more accountable.\n\n  III. Getting Tough on Violent Juveniles and Enforce Existing Law: A \nthird tier of our plan insured that violent juveniles--teenagers who \ncommit violent crimes--will be held accountable. Part of the solution \nis to insure that when a teenager brings a gun to school, he or she is \nheld accountable by school authorities and the criminal justice system. \nWe take care of this in the bill. We also extend the Youth Handgun \nSafety Act to semi-automatic assault rifles. The bill before the Senate \ncontains reforms like the juvenile Brady provision--a measure which \nwill prohibit firearms possession by violent juvenile offenders. We \nincrease penalties for transferring a gun to a minor and other \ncorrupting acts.\n  Most importantly, we respond to the biggest of gun law loopholes--the \nClinton Administration's failure to enforce the gun laws already on the \nbooks. We insure that the Department of Justice will fulfill its \nobligation to enforce the law. Prosecuting violent gun offenders will \nbe made a priority for this Administration whether they like it or not.\n  IV. Safe and Secure Schools: The fourth element of our plan revolves \naround the basic right that all students share--the right to receive \nthe quality education they deserve. Our teachers and students need to \nknow that their school is safe and that, should they take action to \ndeal with a violent student, the teacher will be protected. Our bill \npromotes safe and secure schools, free of undue disruption and \nviolence, so that our teachers can teach and our children can learn. We \nprovide greater flexibility to local communities in how they use \nfederal education funds. We also provide teachers with limited civil \nliability protection should they take action to remove a problem child \nfrom school.\n  These are just some of the many, many reforms contained in this bill. \nThere has been a sense among many Americans that we are powerless to \nreverse the trend of violence. People believe we are powerless to deal \nwith violent juvenile crime and that we are powerless to change our \nculture. It is this feeling of powerlessness which threatened our \ncollective ambition for meaningful, penetrating solutions in the wake \nof the Littleton tragedy. I believe the Senate has taken a meaningful \nstep towards shedding this defeatism.\n  Do I agree with everything in this bill? No. For example, I oppose to \nthe gun show regulatory and taxing amendment. But addressing this gun \nshow issue has been evolutionary. Both sides have moved on this and--\nperhaps--we can find common ground as the bill moves  through the House \nand conference.\n\n  Given the seriousness of our youth violence problem--and the number \nof warning signs that tragedies will continue unless all of us come \ntogether--we must move forward. We should join together and pass this \nbill.\n  Finally, in closing I want to end this debate with a reminder. We \nhave been on this bill for two weeks talking about violent juvenile \ncrime, about the events in Littleton, about kids who use guns, and \nabout kids influenced by violence in the media. Unfortunately, all of \nthat is very true.\n  But let us not lose sight of the fact that there are millions of kids \nin this country, hundreds of thousands in Utah, who are really good \nyoung people. We give a lot of attention and this bill focuses even \nmore of it on young people who get into trouble with the law. Let's not \nforget that about the kids who fly straight. As we wrap up \nconsideration of this bill, let's thank the millions of young people \nacross this land that work hard, study long hours, respect and love \ntheir parents and friends, and care for others around them.\n  Mr. President, I would like added as cosponsors of this bill and have \ntheir names appear as cosponsors immediately following my name: Senator \nLeahy, Senator Sessions, Senator Biden and Senator Feinstein. I am very \nproud to be able to be the prime sponsor with these wonderful \ncosponsors.\n  Senator Biden was one of the first cosponsors on this bill. I am more \nthan pleased that my ranking member, Senator Leahy is a cosponsor and a \nprime cosponsor.\n  S. 254 is a testament to those who worked on it and a product which, \non the whole, will help our young people and do something significant \nabout the problems of juvenile crime.\n  I want to thank a few of the people who have worked on this bill. Let \nme first acknowledge the Majority Leader who worked with me to keep \nthis bill alive. Given the demanding Senate schedule, it would have \nbeen easier for him to have refused to take up the bill or pull it \ndown. We have a bill passing the Senate because he wanted to do what's \nright.\n  Let me also acknowledge Ranking Member, Senator Leahy. He and I \nreached agreement on this important bill after much discussion and he \nably managed the bill for his side of the aisle.\n  I also want to commend Senator Sessions--the Chairman of the Youth \nViolence Subcommittee. S. 254 became the vehicle for quite of bit of \npolitically charged legislation but it was Senator Sessions who stayed \non me for more than two years and who never lost sight of the need to \nmake the juvenile justice reforms we make in the underlying bill.\n  Also, let me commend Senator Biden who came on this bill as a \ncosponsor when others were unwilling. A leader on crime control issues, \nhe was instrumental in setting a cooperative tone which helped get this \nbill moving.\n  Senator Allard, Senator Craig, Senator Brownback, and Senator \nAshcroft are to be commended for their leadership and counsel. Senator \nFeinstein should be applauded for her cooperation. There are many \nothers but I will end it there.\n  At the staff level, I want to commend several people.\n  First, on the Judiciary Committee staff, let me acknowledge a few \npeople who have worked very hard on this bill. Committee Counsels Rhett \nDehart and Mike Kennedy are to be commended for their lead work on this \nimportant bill. When others were skeptical about its prospects they \nwere there to make the substantive case for moving this bill.\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\nThey worked very hard, for several years, to get this bill introduced, \nreported, and passed. This bill's passage is a testament to their \ntireless efforts.\n\n  In addition, I want to acknowledge and thank Kristi Lee, the Chief \nCounsel of the Youth Violence subcommittee for her work.\n  I also want to commend a few others on the Committee Staff: Sharon \nProst, Anna Cabral, Ed Haden, Craig Wolf, Catherine Campbell, David \nMuhl- \nhausen, Leah Belaire, Makan Delrahim, Jeanne Lopatto, Alison Vinson, \nJoelle Scott, Elle Parker, Krista Redd, and Luke Austin. They all \nworked around the clock on this bill. The amount of preparation that \ngoes into these bills is significant and they were given little time to \nprepare for the floor. They are a great staff and I thank them for \ntheir efforts. Thanks as well should be given to the Committee's Chief \nCounsel and Staff Director, Manus Cooney. He is one of the first staff \ndirectors in the committee's history.\n  On Senator Leahy's committee staff I want to acknowledge the Minority \nChief Counsel--Bruce Cohen for his cooperative efforts and leadership. \nBeryl Howell, Senator Leahy's General Counsel should also be commended \nfor her substantive work on the underlying Hatch-Leahy substitute and \nmanagers' package. Ed Barron is a true gentleman and an able lawyer.\n  Let me also acknowledge the Youth Violence Subcommittee's Minority \nChief Counsel, Sheryl Walter and Glen Shor with the Criminal Justice \nOveright Subcommittee.\n  Others I would be remiss in not mentioning include:\n  Dave Hoppie, Robert Wilkie, and Jim Hecht of the Majority Leader's \nstaff;\n  Stewart Verdery and Eric Euland of the Whip's office;\n  Ken Foss, Candi Wolff, and Jade West of the Policy Committee;\n  Mike Bennett, Karen Knutson, Kris Ardizzone, David Crane, and Paul \nClement.\n  Let me acknowledge the hard work of Mary Kay MacMillan, Tony Coe, \nBill Jensen, and Tim Trushel of the Senate Legislative Counsel's \noffice, who all put in extraordinary effort in preparing this bill and \nmany amendments.\n  And finally, I would be remiss if I did not express thanks to our \nwonderful floor and cloakroom staff: Elizabeth Letchworth, Dave \nSchiappa, Tripp Baird, Malloy McDaniel, Marshall Hiton, Dan Dukes, \nLaura Martin, and Myra Baron. These folks keep things running during \nour hectic debates, and we appreciate them.\n  I am very grateful to finally have this ordeal over. It has been a \nvery, very difficult bill, as all of these crime bills usually are. I \nthink if anybody tries to make this just a gun bill, they have missed \nthe point of what we have accomplished here.\n  Sure, there have been some amendments on guns that are very crucial \nand very important in the eyes of many people on the floor, but this \nbill is so much more--ranging from accountability, calling on youth to \nbe responsible for their actions, to prevention moneys. For the first \ntime in years, we have balanced prevention and accountability and law \nenforcement. The law enforcement aspect will help bring the law down on \nviolent juveniles and others who aid them in committing these \ncrimes. We have made real inroads and we have taken a number of very \nimportant steps with regard to changing the culture of violence in our \nsociety. That is important. Yes, we faced some tough amendments on \nguns. I don't like all of the results on this bill. But the fact of the \nmatter is, they were votes, they were voted up and down, the Senate has \nspoken, and we need to recognize that for what it is.\n\n  At this point I again express my appreciation to my friend, Senator \nLeahy, for the patience he has had with me, the patience he has had on \nthe floor, the assistance he has been. It has been a real privilege to \nwork for him. I respect and admire him and hope to do a lot of \nconstructive things with him in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Utah for his kind remarks. We have worked very closely together on \nthis. We have seen a bill go through a major evolution on the floor. \nFrankly, that is what the Senate should do in working its will through \na bill. But I must say to my friend from Utah, I do not think that \nwould have been possible if he and I had not been able to work \ntogether, if we had not been in constant contact, day by day, hour by \nhour and, perhaps to his regret at times, minute by minute.\n  I once said Senators are merely constitutional impediments to their \nstaff--maybe I said it more than once. If we had not had superb staffs \nworking on this, I do not know what we could have done.\n  We had Senators who came together, even though they normally seem \npolitically far apart. The distinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator \nSessions, an original cosponsor of this bill; the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden; myself and Senator Hatch--coming \ntogether, bringing so many other Senators together.\n  One need only look at the major managers' package we passed. I say to \nmy friend from Utah, I think when we introduced our managers' amendment \nthat, as much as anything, broke the logjam and made passage of this \nbill possible. We tried to accommodate many Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle who had legitimate matter of concern. In that process we came \ntogether to shape a bill. The managers' amendment agreement was more \nthan just saying what is good for one Senator or another Senator. This \nis a juvenile justice bill and the managers' amendment helped shape the \ncontours of that collective product.\n  As a parent, I think back to the time when my children were going to \nschool. I thought what a happy and wonderful time in their life it was. \nI knew it was one place where they were safe. We did not have to worry \nabout anything more than, did they study enough for their geometry test \nor history test or did they get their English assignment in on time? \nThe worst injury you might worry about was if somebody in the \nplayground was to slip and fall and bruise an arm or a leg.\n  Parents should not have to worry about their children going to \nschool. But even today as we debated this--as we talked about \nColumbine, where the President and the First Lady were traveling \ntoday--we saw, again, on the TV, pictures of another school shooting by \nanother juvenile in Georgia, leaving children injured and being flown \nto a hospital. Every parent in this country is reminded, again, that \noften today our children are not safe, even when we send them off to a \nplace where they should be. That is not the way it should be.\n\n  We have worked tirelessly on this bill. I think it is a better bill \nthan when it began. The intentions were always the same: To make sure \nour juveniles are safe, our people are safe, that we choose the right \ncourse for juveniles when they do commit crimes.\n  The Senate has improved this bill. It is more comprehensive and more \nrespectful of the core protections in the Federal juvenile legislation \nthat served us well in past decades. It is more respectful of the \nprimary role of the States in prosecuting these matters. We do \nrecognize that no legislation is perfect, legislation alone is not \nenough to stop youth violence.\n  I hope parents, teachers, and juveniles themselves will stop and say: \nCan we not do better? Can we not have time together? Can we not love \nour children as we should? Can we not love each other as we should? Can \nwe not look at some of the principles I knew so well when I was growing \nup, given to me by my parents, principles I hope my wife and I passed \non to our children?\n  Can we not go to those basic principles and understand, even in a \ncountry of a quarter of a billion people, that we do not need the \nviolence we see in this country?\n  It is not just a question of gun control. It is not just a question \nof more courts or more police. It is not just a question of more laws. \nBut it is a question of, what do we want to be as a nation? We are \nblessed in this nation. We are the most powerful, wealthiest nation \nhistory has ever known. We live better than anybody ever could have \nimagined. We have so much going for us. Should not we stop and say, \nwhen it comes to our children, the most precious resource we have, that \nwe must do all that we can to protect them and nurture them and teach \nthem to be responsible?\n  Since we began consideration of this important legislation last week, \nwe\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\nhave gotten both good news and bad news on the crime front. We got the \ngood news at the beginning of this week when the FBI released the \nlatest crime rate statistics showing a decline in serious crime for the \nseventh consecutive year. Preliminary reports indicate that the rate of \nserious violent and property crime in this country went down another 7 \npercent in 1998, with robbery down 11 percent, murders down 8 percent, \ncar thefts down 10 percent, and declines in other crime categories as \nwell.\n  But we are all acutely aware that we also got bad news today. Yet \nanother school shooting by a juvenile--this time in Georgia--with \nchildren injured and being flown to hospitals. Every parent in this \ncountry is reminded again that our children are not safe, even when we \nsend them off to a place where they should be. The only thing parents \nshould have to worry about when they wave good-bye to their children in \nthe morning is whether their child remembered his or her homework and \nlunch money. They should not have to worry about whether they will get \nshot.\n  The growing list of schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas, \nWashington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, \nKentucky, Mississippi, last month in Littleton, Colorado, and today in \nGeorgia, is simply unacceptable and intolerable.\n\n  Each one of us wants to do something to stop this violence. We have \nbefore us a bill that reflects hard work and committed effort on both \nsides of the aisle to address the juvenile crime problem. Senator Hatch \nand Senator Sessions have worked tirelessly for several years now to \nmake a difference. While we have strongly disagreed in the past on the \nright approach to juvenile crime, I have always respected their good \nintentions. I am glad that this year we have continued the progress we \nmade in the last Congress to find common ground on this important \nlegislation.\n  In light of the significant improvements we have been able to make to \nthe bill here on the Senate floor over the last eight days, the bill is \na better, stronger and better balanced bill. It is more comprehensive \nand more respectful of the core protections in federal juvenile justice \nlegislation that have served us so well over the last three decades. At \nthe same time it is more respectful of the primary role of the states \nin prosecuting these matters. I greatly appreciate the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee adding me as a principal cosponsor of our bill.\n  I recognize, as we all do, that no legislation is perfect and that \nlegislation alone is not enough to stop youth violence. We can pass an \nassortment of new laws and still turn on the news to find out that some \nchild somewhere in the country has turned violent and turned on other \nchildren and teachers, with a gun or other weapon, with terrible \nresults.\n  All of us--whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, \npsychologists, or policy-makers--are puzzling over the causes of kids \nturning violent in our country. The root causes are likely multi-\nfaceted. We can all point to inadequate parental involvement or \nsupervision, over-crowded classrooms and over-sized schools that add to \nstudents' alienation, the easy accessibility of guns, the violence \ndepicted on television, in movies and video games, or inappropriate \ncontent available on the Internet. There is no single cause and no \nsingle legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in \nour schools or in our streets. Nevertheless, this legislation is a firm \nand significant step in the right direction.\n  I have said before that a good proposal that works should get the \nsupport of all of us. Our first question should be whether a program or \nproposal will help our children effectively, not whether it is a \nDemocratic or Republican proposal. The Managers' amendment and package \nof amendments that the Chairman and I were able to put together for \nadoption yesterday reflects that philosophy. It shows that when this \nbody rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant \nprogress. I commend the Chairman for his leadership in this effort and \nI am glad we were able to work together constructively to improve this \nbill.\n  This bill, S. 254, started out as a much-improved bill from the one \nreported by the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress. In fact, as I \nlooked through this bill I was pleasantly surprised to see that \nproposals that the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee specifically \nvoted down in 1997 were incorporated at the outset into this bill. \nThese are changes that I and other Democrats have been urging on our \nRepublican colleagues for the past few years, and that they have \nresisted until they quietly incorporated them into this bill.\n\n  Federalism. For example, I tried in July 1997 to amend S. 10 to \nprotect the State's traditional prerogative in handling juvenile \noffenders and avoid the unnecessary federalization of juvenile crime \nthat so concerns the Chief Justice and the Federal judiciary. \nSpecifically, my 1997 amendment would have limited the federal trial as \nan adult of juveniles charged with nonviolent felonies to circumstances \nwhen the State is unwilling or unable to exercise jurisdiction. This \namendment was defeated, with all the Republicans voting against it.\n  This bill, S. 254, contained a new provision designed to address \nthese federalism concerns that would direct federal prosecutors to \n``exercise a presumption in favor of referral'' of juvenile cases to \nthe appropriate State or tribal authorities, where there is \n``concurrent jurisdiction,'' unless the State declines jurisdiction and \nthere is a substantial federal interest in the case. Yet, concerns \nremained that this bill would undermine a State's traditionally \nprerogative to handle juvenile offenders.\n  The changes we make to the underlying bill in the Hatch-Leahy \nManagers' amendment satisfy my concerns. For example, S. 254 as \nintroduced would repeal the very first section of the Federal Criminal \nCode dealing with ``Correction of Youthful Offenders.'' This is the \nsection that establishes a clear presumption that the States--not the \nfederal government--should handle most juvenile offenders [18 U.S.C. \nsection 5001]. While the original S. 254 would repeal that provision, \nthe Managers' amendment retains it in slightly modified form.\n  In addition, the original S. 254 would require Federal prosecutors to \nrefer most juvenile cases to the State in cases of ``concurrent \njurisdiction . . . over both the offense and the juvenile.'' This \nlanguage created a recipe for sharp lawyering. Federal prosecutors \ncould avoid referral by simply claiming there was no ``concurrent'' \njurisdiction over the ``offense'' due to linguistic or other \ndifferences between the federal and state crimes. Even if the \njuvenile's conduct violated both Federal and State law, any difference \nin how those criminal laws were written could be used to argue they \nwere different offenses altogether. This was a huge loophole that could \nhave allowed federal prosecutors to end-run the presumption of referral \nto the State.\n  We fix this in the Managers' Amendment, and clarify that whenever the \nfederal government or the State have criminal laws that punish the same \nconduct and both have jurisdiction over the juvenile, federal \nprosecutors should refer the juvenile to the State in most instances.\n  Finally, I was concerned that, contrary to current law, a federal \nprosecutor's decision to proceed against a juvenile in federal court \nwould not be subject to any judicial review. The Managers' Amendment \nwould permit such judicial review, except in cases involving serious \nviolent or serious drug offenses.\n  Federal Trial of Juveniles as Adults. Another area of concern has \nbeen the ease with which S. 254 would allow federal prosecutors to \nprosecute juveniles 14 years and older as adults for any felony. While \nI have long favored simplifying and streamlining current federal \nprocedures for trying juveniles, I believe that judicial review is an \nimportant check in the system, particularly when you are dealing with \nchildren.\n\n  This bill, S. 254, included a ``reverse waiver'' proposal allowing \nfor judicial review of most cases in which a juvenile is charged as an \nadult in federal court. I had suggested a similar proposal in July \n1997, when I tried to amend S. 10 before the Judiciary Committee to \npermit limited judicial review of a federal prosecutor's decision to \ntry certain juveniles as adults. S. 10 granted sole, non-reviewable \nauthority to federal prosecutors to try juveniles\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nas adults for any federal felony, removing federal judges from that \ndecision altogether. My 1997 amendment would have granted federal \njudges authority in appropriate cases to review a prosecutor's decision \nand to handle the juvenile case in a delinquency proceeding rather than \ntry the juvenile as an adult.\n  Only three States in the country granted prosecutors the \nextraordinary authority over juvenile cases that S. 10 proposed, \nincluding Florida. Earlier this year, we saw the consequences of that \nkind of authority, when a local prosecutor in that State charged as an \nadult a 15-year-old mildly retarded boy with no prior record who stole \n$2 from a school classmate to buy lunch. The local prosecutor charged \nhim as an adult and locked him up in an adult jail for weeks before \nnational press coverage forced a review of the charging decision in the \ncase.\n  This was not the kind of incident I wanted happening on the federal \nlevel. Unfortunately, my proposal for a ``reverse waiver'' procedure \nproviding judicial review of a prosecutor's decision was voted down in \nCommittee, with no Republican on the Committee voting for it.\n  I was pleased that S. 254 contained a ``reverse waiver'' provision, \ndespite the Committee's rejection of this proposal two years ago. \nThough made belated, this was a welcome change in the bill. The \nManagers' amendment makes important improvements to that provision.\n  First, S. 254 gives a juvenile defendant only 20 days to file a \nreverse waiver motion after the date of the juvenile's first \nappearance. This time is too short, and could lapse before the juvenile \nis indicted and is aware of the actual charges. The Managers' amendment \nextends the time to make a reverse waiver motion to 30 days, which \nbegins at the time the juvenile defendant appears to answer an \nindictment.\n  Second, S. 254 requires the juvenile defendant to show by ``clear and \nconvincing'' evidence that he or she should be tried as a juvenile \nrather than an adult. This is a very difficult standard to meet, \nparticularly under strict time limits. Thus, the Managers' amendment \nchanges this standard to a ``preponderance'' of the evidence.\n  Juvenile Records. As initially introduced, S. 254 would require \njuvenile criminal records for any federal offense, no matter how petty, \nto be sent to the FBI. This criminal record would haunt the juvenile as \nhe grew into an adult, with no possibility of expungement from the \nFBI's database.\n  The Managers' amendment makes important changes to this \nrecord requirement. The juvenile records sent to the FBI will be \nlimited to acts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. In \naddition, under the Managers' amendment, a juvenile would be able after \n5 years to petition the court to have the criminal record removed from \nthe FBI database, if the juvenile can show by clear and convincing \nevidence that he or she is no longer a danger to the community. \nExpungement of records from the FBI's database does not apply to \njuveniles convicted of rape, murder or certain other serious felonies.\n\n  Increasing Witness Tampering Penalties. This bill, S. 254, also \ncontains a provision to increase penalties for witness tampering that I \nfirst suggested and included in the ``Youth Violence, Crime and Drug \nAbuse Control Act of 1997,'' S. 15, which was introduced in the first \nweeks of the 105th Congress, at the end of the last Congress in the \n``Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, \nand again in S. 9, the comprehensive package of crime proposals \nintroduced with Senator Daschle at the beginning of this Congress. This \nprovision would increase the penalty for using or threatening physical \nforce against any person with intent to tamper with a witness, victim \nor informant from a maximum of ten to twenty years' imprisonment. In \naddition, the provision adds a conspiracy penalty for obstruction of \njustice offenses involving witnesses, victims and informants.\n  I have long been concerned about the undermining of our criminal \njustice system by criminal efforts to threaten or harm witnesses, \nvictims and informants, to stop them from cooperating with and \nproviding assistance to law enforcement. I tried to include this \nprovision, along with several other law enforcement initiatives, by \namendment to S. 10 during Committee mark-up on July 11, 1997, but this \namendment was voted down by all the Republicans on the Committee. At \nthe end of the mark-up, however, this witness tampering provision was \nquietly accepted to S. 10 and I am pleased that it is also included in \nS. 254.\n  Eligibility Requirements for Accountability Block Grant. This bill, \nS. 254, substantially relaxes the eligibility requirements for the new \njuvenile accountability block grant. By contrast, S. 10 in the last \nCongress would have required States to comply with a host of new \nfederal mandates to qualify for the first cent of grant money, such as \npermitting juveniles 14 years and older to be prosecuted as adults for \nviolent felonies, establishing graduated sanctions for juvenile \noffenders, implementing drug testing programs for juveniles upon \narrest, and nine new juvenile record-keeping requirements. These \nrecord-keeping mandates would have required, for example, that States \nfingerprint and photograph juveniles arrested for any felony act and \nsend those records to the FBI, plus make all juvenile delinquency \nrecords available to law enforcement agencies and to schools, including \ncolleges and universities. We could find no State that would have \nqualified for this grant money without agreeing to change their laws in \nsome fashion to satisfy the twelve new mandates.\n  In 1997, I tried to get the Judiciary Committee to relax the new \njuvenile record-keeping mandates under the accountability grant program \nduring the mark-up of S. 10. My 1997 amendment would have limited the \nrecord-keeping requirements to crimes of violence or felony acts \ncommitted by juveniles, rather than to all juvenile offenses no matter \nhow petty. But my amendment was voted down on July 23, 1997, by the \nRepublicans on the Committee. Finally, two years later, S. 254 reflects \nthe criticism I and others Democrats on the Judiciary Committee leveled \nat the strict eligibility and record-keeping requirements in S. 10.\n\n  Indeed, the Senate decisively rejected this approach when it defeated \nan amendment by a Republican Senator that would have revived those \nstraight-jacket eligibility requirements. Specifically, his amendment \nwould have required States to try as adults juveniles 14 years or older \nwho committed certain crimes. As I pointed out during floor debate on \nthis amendment, only two States would have qualified for grant funds \nunless they agreed to change their laws.\n  Moreover, the current bill removes the record-keeping requirements \naltogether from the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant. Instead, S. \n254 sets up an entirely new Juvenile Criminal History Block Grant, \nfunded at $75 million per year. To qualify for a criminal history \ngrant, States would have to promise within three years to keep \nfingerprint supported records of delinquency adjudications of juveniles \nwho committed a felony act. No more photographs required. No more \nrecords of mere arrests required. No more dissemination of petty \njuvenile offense records to schools required. Instead, only juvenile \ndelinquency adjudications for murder, armed robbery, rape or sexual \nmolestation must be disseminated in the same manner as adult records; \nother juvenile delinquency adjudications records may only be used for \ncriminal justice purposes. These limitations are welcome changes to the \nburdensome, over-broad record-keeping requirements in the prior version \nof the Republican juvenile crime bill.\n  The eligibility requirements for the Juvenile Accountability Block \nGrant now number only three, including that the State have in place a \npolicy of drug testing for appropriate categories of juveniles upon \narrest.\n  Core Protections for Children. Much of the debate over reforming our \njuvenile justice system has focused on how we treat juvenile offenders \nwho are held in State custody. Republican efforts to roll back \nprotections for children in custody failed in the last Congress. These \nprotections were originally put in place when Congress enacted the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to create a \nformula grant program for States to improve their juvenile justice \nsystems. This Act addressed the horrific conditions in which children \nwere being detained by State authorities in close proximity to adult \ninmates--conditions\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nthat too often resulted in tragic assaults, rapes and suicides of \nchildren.\n  As the JJDPA has evolved, four core protections have been adopted--\nand are working--to protect children from adult inmates and to ensure \ndevelopment of alternative placements to adult jails. These four core \nprotections for juvenile delinquents are:\n  Separation of juvenile offenders from adult inmates in custody (known \nas sight and sound separation);\n  Removal of juveniles from adult jails or lockups, with a 24-hour \nexception in rural areas and other exceptions for travel and weather \nrelated conditions;\n  Deinstitutionalizaton of status offenders; and to study and direct \nprevention efforts toward reducing the disproportionate confinement of \nminority youth in the juvenile justice system.\n  Over strong objection by most of the Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee in the last Congress, S. 10 eliminated three of the four core \nprotections and substantially weakened the ``sight and sound'' \nseparation standard for juveniles in State custody. At the same time \nthe Committee appeared to acknowledge the wisdom and necessity of such \nrequirements when it adopted an amendment requiring separation of \njuveniles and adult inmates in Federal custody.\n  This bill, S. 254, as introduced was an improvement over S. 10 in its \nretention of modified versions of three out of the four core \nprotections. Specifically, S. 254 included the sight and sound standard \nfor juveniles in Federal custody reflected in a 1997 amendment to S. \n10. The same standard is used to apply to juveniles delinquents in \nState custody.\n  Legitimate concerns were raised that the prohibition on physical \ncontact in S. 254 would still allow supervised proximity between \njuveniles and adult inmates that is ``brief and incidental or \naccidental,'' since this could be interpreted to allow routine and \nregular--though brief--exposure of children to adult inmates. For \nexample, guards could routinely escort children past open adult cells \nmultiple times a day on their way to a dining area.\n  The Hatch-Leahy managers' Amendment makes significant progress on the \n``sight and sound separation'' protection and the ``jail removal'' \nprotection. Specifically, our Managers' amendment makes clear that when \nparents in rural areas give their consent to have their children \ndetained in adult jails after an arrest, the parents may revoke their \nconsent at any time. In addition, the judge who approves the juvenile's \ndetention must determine it is in the best interests of the juvenile, \nand may review that detention--as the judge must periodically--in the \npresence of the juvenile.\n  The managers' amendment also clarifies that juvenile offenders in \nrural areas may be detained in an adult jail for up to 48 hours while \nawaiting a court appearance, but only when no alternative facilities \nare available and appropriate juvenile facilities are too far away to \nmake the court appearance or travel is unsafe to undertake.\n  The Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment also significantly improves the \nsight and sound separation requirement for juvenile offenders in both \nFederal and State custody. The amendment incorporates the guidance in \ncurrent regulations for keeping juveniles separated from adult \nprisoners. Specifically, the Managers' amendment would require \nseparation of juveniles and adult inmates and excuse only ``brief and \ninadvertent or accidental'' proximity in non-residential areas, which \nmay include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, \nentry areas, and passageways.\n  I am pleased we were able to make this progress. I appreciate that a \nnumber of Members remain seriously concerned, as do I, about how S. 254 \nchanges the disproportionate minority confinement protection in current \nlaw. This bill, S. 254, removes any reference to minorities and \nrequires only that efforts be made to reduce over-representation of any \nsegment of the population. I am disappointed that Senators Wellstone \nand Kennedy's amendment to restore this protection did not succeed \nyesterday, but will continue to fight in conference to restore this \nprotection.\n  Prevention. S. 254 includes a $200 million per year Juvenile \nDelinquency Prevention Challenge Grant to fund both primary prevention \nand intervention uses after juveniles have had contact with the \njuvenile justice system. I and a number of other members were concerned \nthat in the competition for grant dollars, the primary prevention uses \nwould lose out to intervention uses in crucial decisions on how this \ngrant money would be spent. With the help of Senator Kohl, we have \nincluded in the Hatch-Leahy Managers' amendment a clear earmark that \neighty percent of the money, or $160 million per year if the program is \nfully funded, is to be used for primary prevention uses and the other \ntwenty percent is to be used for intervention uses. Together with the \n25 percent earmark, or about $112 million per year if that program is \nfully funded, for primary prevention in the Juvenile Accountability \nBlock Grant that was passed by the Senate in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions \namendment, this bill now reflects a substantial amount of solid funding \nfor primary prevention uses.\n  Prosecutors' Grants. I expressed some concern when the Senate passed \nthe Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment authorizing $50 million per year for \nprosecutors and different kinds of assistance to prosecutors to speed \nup prosecution of juvenile offenders. I pointed out that this amendment \ndid not authorize any additional money for judges, public defenders, \ncounselors, or corrections officers. The consequence would be to only \nexacerbate the backlog in juvenile justice systems rather than helping \nit.\n  The Managers' amendment fixes that by authorizing $50 million per \nyear in grants to State juvenile court systems to be used for increased \nresources to State juvenile court judges, juvenile prosecutors, \njuvenile public defenders, and other juvenile court system personnel.\n  Sense of Senate. I mentioned before that S. 254 includes a Sense of \nthe Senate resolution urging States to try juveniles 10 to 14 years old \nas adults for crimes, such as murder, that would carry the death \npenalty if committed by an adult--the resolution does not urge the \ndeath penalty for such children. While Vermont is probably one of the \nfew States that expressly allows for the trial of juveniles 10 years \nand older as adults for certain crimes, I do not believe that this is a \nmatter on which the Senate must or should opine. The Managers' \namendment correctly deletes that Sense of the Senate from the bill.\n  State Advisory Groups. S. 254 incorporates changes I recommended to \nS. 10 in the last Congress to ensure the continued existence and role \nof State Advisory Groups, or SAGs, in the development of State plans \nfor addressing juvenile crime and delinquency, and the use of grant \nfunds under the JJDPA. As originally introduced, S. 10 had abolished \nthe role of SAGs. The Judiciary Committee in 1997 adopted my amendment \nto preserve SAGs and require representation from a broad range of \njuvenile justice experts from both the public and private sectors.\n\n  While, as introduced, S. 254 preserved SAGs, it eliminated the \nrequirement in current law that gives SAGs the opportunity to review \nand comment on a grant award to allow these experts to provide input on \nhow best to spend the money. In addition, while the bill authorizes the \nuse of grant funds to support the SAG, the bill does require States to \ncommit any funds to ensure these groups can function effectively. I am \npleased that the Chairman and I were able to accept an amendment \nsponsored by Senators Kerrey, Roberts, and others, to ensure \nappropriate funding of SAGs at the State level and to support their \nannual meetings.\n  Protecting Children From Guns. Significantly, we have amended this \nbill with important gun control measures that we all hope will help \nmake this country safer for our children. The bill as now been amended: \nbans the transfer to and possession by juveniles of assault weapons and \nhigh capacity ammunition clips; increases criminal penalties for \ntransfers of handguns, assault weapons, and high capacity ammunition \nclips to juveniles; bans prospective gun sales to juveniles with \nviolent crime records; expands the youth crime gun interdiction \ninitiative to up to 250 cities by 2003 for tracing of guns used in \nyouth crime; and increases federal resources dedicated to enforcement \nof firearms laws by $50 million a year. These common-sense initiatives \nwere first included in the\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\ncomprehensive Leahy law enforcement amendment that was tabled by the \nmajority, but were later included in successful amendments sponsored by \nRepublican Senators. No matter how these provisions were finally \nincluded in the bill, they will help keep guns out of hands of children \nand criminals, while protecting the rights of law abiding adults to use \nfirearms.\n  In addition, through the efforts of Senators Lautenberg, Schumer, \nKerrey and others, we were able to require background checks for all \nfirearm purchases at all gun shows. After three Republican amendments \nfailed to close the gun show loophole in the Brady law, and, in fact, \ncreated many new loopholes in the law, we finally prevailed. With the \nhelp of Vice President Gore's tie-breaking vote, a majority in the U.S. \nSenate stood up to the gun lobby and did the right thing. This is real \nprogress. Conclusion.\n  I said at the outset of the debate on this bill that I would like \nnothing better than to pass responsible and effective juvenile justice \nlegislation. I want to pass juvenile justice legislation that will be \nhelpful to the youngest citizens in this country--not harm them. I want \nto pass juvenile justice legislation that assists States and local \ngovernments in handling juvenile offenders--not impose a ``one-size-\nfits-all'' Washington solution on them. I want to prevent juveniles \nfrom committing crimes, and not just narrowly focus on punishing \nchildren. I want to keep children who may harm others away from guns. \nThis bill would make important contributions in each of these areas, \nand I am pleased to support its passage.\n  I thank the Republican manager of this important measure for his work \nand dedication to this effort. I commend the Minority Leader and the \nMinority Whip for their assistance and attention to this debate. There \nwould not be a juvenile justice bill without them. I thank Senator \nKennedy, Senator Schumer, Senator Kohl and all the Democratic Members \nof the Judiciary Committee for helping manage this effort. Senators \nBingaman, Robb, Boxer, Wellstone and Lautenberg should also be singled \nout for their consistent efforts to improve this bill. And I would like \nto thank the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican and \nDemocrat, including Manus Cooney, Sharon Prost, Rhett DeHart, Michael \nKennedy and Anna Cabral from Chairman Hatch's staff and Bruce Cohen, \nBeryl Howell, Ed Pagano, Ed Barron, J.P. Dowd, Julie Katzman and \nMichael Carrasco from my own. In addition Michael Myers, Stephaine \nRobinson, Melody Barnes and Angela Williams from Senator Kennedy's \nstaff and Sheryl Walter, Jon Leibowitz, Brian Lee, Neil Quinter, David \nHantman, Bob Schiff, Jennifer Leach and Glen Shor, Sander Lurie and \nTony Orza were exceptional in staffing these matters. I thank them all \nfor their dedication and public service.\n  I thank Senators on both side of the aisle who worked with us, but I \nwant to congratulate the distinguished chairman and thank him for his \nhelp.\n  Mr. HATCH. I likewise congratulate the ranking member.\n  Mr. President, I ask 5 minutes be accorded to the subcommittee \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee who did more than any other single \nperson to bring the good parts of this bill to the floor. He deserves a \nlot of recognition. This is his first term in the Senate. To have such \na significant role on a bill of this magnitude I think is a great star \nin Senator Sessions' crown. I certainly recognize that and tell him \nwhat a pleasure it has been to work with him and with his staff in \ndoing this.\n  Let me just add one last thing. The Senator is right, the Senator \nfrom Vermont. We are here trying to save our children. We are here \ntrying to make this a better world for them. We are here trying to make \nit clear to people in this country there is such a thing as discipline \nand we have to abide by certain rules in society. This bill will help a \nlot of young kids out there to realize there are rules and they are \nworthy rules; if they will abide by them, we will continue to have a \ngreat society for the next 200-plus years. To the extent this bill has \ncome through, as extensive and good as it is, we owe a lot to the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  I want to end this debate with a reminder. We have been on this bill \nfor 2 weeks talking about violent juvenile crime, about the events in \nLittleton, about kids who use guns and about kids influenced by \nviolence in the media. Unfortunately for all of us, that is true. But \nlet us not lose sight of the millions of kids in this country, hundreds \nof thousands in Utah, who are really good young people.\n  We give a lot of attention, and the bill focuses even more, on young \npeople who get into trouble with the law. Let us not forget that about \nthe kids who fly straight. As we wrap up consideration of this bill, \nlet's thank the millions of young people across this land who work \nhard, study long hours, respect and love their parents and friends, and \ncare for others around them. There are millions and millions of good \nkids in this country. What we are trying to make sure is the kids who \nwere led astray, the kids who we think may not be so good, they are \ngoing to get a break--or at least they are going to understand what the \nlaw is with regard to violence. This bill, I think, will go a long way \nto solving these problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, who is a \nmaster legislator, who took this bill through storms none of us \nexpected would occur. This was an emotional time in America. It has \ngenerated an awful lot of amendments and ideas, some of which are good \nand some of which I frankly think are not healthy.\n  I believe we need to focus on prosecuting criminals who use guns. It \nalways galled me as a former Federal prosecutor myself that here this \nadministration blamed the Congress for not passing more laws when their \nown Department of Justice had allowed prosecutions of gun cases to drop \n40 percent. You wonder why we are passing laws if they are not using \nthem.\n  Those were some of the matters that came up. My vision for this bill \nfrom the beginning was to create a Federal program to assist the local \njuvenile justice systems in America. We put money where these judges \nand prosecutors and probation officers are overwhelmed by the huge \ncrush of juvenile cases. We have increased funding dramatically for \nadult programs for crimefighting but we have not done the same for \njuveniles. Those juveniles, then, come on and become adult criminals.\n\n  I hope everybody in America who cares about what is happening will \nask how their juvenile court system is doing. Does the judge in their \ntown have an option when a child is arrested to send them to prison, \ndetention, boot camp, alternative schools, drug treatment, mental \nhealth, family counseling? Can the judge impose that? Can he impose a \nprobation order and then have the resources to make sure that youngster \nis at home at night at 7 like he ordered, or do we do like most courts \nin America, because they do not have enough resources, so orders are \nwritten but nobody enforces them?\n  If we love these children, if we care about these children, when they \nare arrested, we will drug test them, because if they are using drugs, \nthey are going to continue in the life of crime. Sixty-seven to 70 \npercent of the people in America who are arrested for a felony test \npositive for an illegal drug. It is an accelerant to crime. This \nlegislation does that kind of thing.\n  It provides money for drug testing. It provides money for \nrecordkeeping. We hope every juvenile court system in America will \ninput criminal history records into the Federal NCIC, National Crime \nInformation Center, that the FBI manages. They want these records \nbecause these children move around and some of them are very violent. \nThose records need to be maintained. This bill provides for that.\n  It provides for research on which programs are working. Many of them \nare not successful, according to the Department of Justice, and we need \nto make sure these prevention programs are working well. It provides \nfor research for that.\n  I am of a belief that this legislation--and it can use some work in \nconference, and I know Senator Hatch and others will try to improve \nit--can help us create a better juvenile justice system so we can \nintervene effectively at the first arrest. We can make that youngster's \nfirst brush with the law their last because we deal with them seriously \nand not as a revolving door.\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\n  Sometimes we have to use some form of detention because some of these \nkids just will not mind otherwise. We know that. They have multiple \narrests.\n  I believe we have made some progress. I am honored to have worked \nwith Senator Leahy, Senator Biden, and certainly Senator Hatch, the \nchairman of our committee. He is an outstanding legislator, a man of \nintegrity and principle, and an outstanding constitutional lawyer who \ncares about his country and serves it well every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5732-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, consumers, motor vehicle administrators, law \nenforcement, and the automotive and insurance industries anxiously \nawait Congressional action on appropriate and workable title branding \nlegislation. Legislation that provides used car purchasers with much \nneeded pre-purchase disclosure information for severely damaged \nvehicles.\n  As a result of varying state approaches, consumers are not always \nadvised of a vehicle's damage history. The National Salvage Motor \nVehicle Consumer Protection Act, S. 655, that I introduced back in \nMarch, would help correct this problem. It provides grant funds to \nstates to encourage their adoption of uniform terms and procedures for \nsalvage and other severely damaged vehicles. While a mandatory federal \nscheme was suggested during the last Congress, there were serious \nConstitutional concerns and the real potential that Congress would \ncreate an expensive unfunded mandate on states. The approach taken in \nS.655 overcomes these problems and provides states with offsetting \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that any title branding legislation \nCongress adopts must contain a rational definition for vehicles that \nsustain significant water damage.\n  The Congressionally chartered Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration and \nSalvage Advisory Committee, whose recommendations for curtailing title \nfraud and automobile theft spurred my sponsorship of S.655, came to the \nreasoned conclusion that water damage was so potentially insidious in \nnature that a separate and distinct consumer disclosure category needed \nto be created. One that distinguished flood vehicles from salvage and \nnonrepairable vehicles.\n  S. 655, which is similar to the bipartisan measure I coauthored with \nSenator Ford during the last Congress, adopts a distinct flood vehicle \ncategory and improves upon the definition initially proposed by the \ntask force.\n  Mr. President, I am sure my colleagues are aware that the State of \nIllinois, which initially adopted the task force's recommended flood \ndefinition, subsequently revised it based on anti-consumer results. \nIllinois found that branding ``any vehicle that has been submerged in \nwater to the point that rising water has reached over the door sill or \nhas entered the passenger or truck compartment'' caused too many \nvehicles to be unnecessarily branded as ``flood'' vehicles. Vehicles \nthat were significantly devalued and lost their manufacturers warranty \nwhen the only damage the vehicle suffered was wet carpets or wet floor \nmats.\n  S.655 is a good example of the need to balance competing consumer \ninterests when establishing uniform titling definitions. Instead of \nunnecessarily and inappropriately branding vehicles with mere cosmetic \ndamage, this legislation rightly brands as ``flood'' those vehicles \nwhich sustain water damage that impairs a car or truck's electrical, \nmechanical, or computerized functions. It also requires the ``flood'' \ndesignation for vehicles acquired by an insurer as part of a water \ndamage settlement. This measure also includes an independent flood \ninspection as recommended by a working group of the National \nAssociation of Attorney's General.\n  Mr. President, I ask my collegues to heed the call of used-car buyers \nand provide them with a reasonable and workable title branding measure. \nOne that includes all of the minimal definitions needed to protect them \nfrom title fraud and automobile theft.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5732-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthat today is National Maritime Day, when the Nation pays tribute to \nthe American Merchant Mariners who have given their lives in the \nservice of their country. Throughout the history of the United States, \nour U.S.-flag Merchant Marine has always been there, providing the \nsupport that time and again has proven to be essential to victory. It \nis with the most profound gratitude for the service and sacrifice of \nAmerica's Merchant Marine veterans that we reflect upon the importance \nof our U.S.-flag fleet on this day.\n  On April 29, 1999, I was privileged to be given a very special \nmomento by a group of Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. It was \na patch, of the kind worn by Merchant Mariners during World War II, and \nit was designed in 1944 by Walt Disney Studios. Walt Disney's people \ncreated a mascot for the Merchant Marine, called ``Battlin' Pete,'' and \nthe patch shows Pete knocking out an Axis torpedo.\n  The presentation was made to express the veterans' gratitude for a \nvery important piece of legislation that the Senate passed last year. \nLast year's veterans' benefits bill ensures that those American \nMerchant Marine veterans who served our country in World War II between \nAugust 16, 1945--the day that hostilities were officially declared at \nan end by President Truman--and December 31, 1946--the cut-off day for \nWorld War II service for all other service branches--receive honorable \ndischarges for their service and are eligible for veterans' burial and \ncemetery benefits. This is the least we can do for these deserving \nveterans. I was privileged to introduce legislation during the 105th \nCongress seeking that change, and it was later incorporated into the \nveterans' benefits bill.\n  The overwhelming majority of World War II Merchant Mariners were \npreviously awarded veterans status. Now, those who served in harm's way \nthrough the war's final days are also being recognized. Although Japan \nofficially surrendered in August of 1945, harbors in Japan, Germany, \nItaly, France--indeed, across the world--still were mined. Twenty-two \nU.S.-government-owned vessels, carrying military cargoes, were damaged \nor sunk by mines after V-J Day. At least four U.S. Merchant Mariners \nwere killed and 28 injured aboard these vessels. Even as Americans at \nhome were celebrating victory, American Merchant Mariners carried on as \nthey have always done--bravely serving their country with pride and \nprofessionalism.\n  I am proud that, at that April ceremony, the first honorable \ndischarges for this previously forgotten group went to two Merchant \nMarine veterans from my home state of Mississippi: Mr. Robert Hoomes \nand Mr. Louis Breaux. Also, I was pleased that Mr. Joseph Katusa, \nNational Chairman, Merchant Marine Fairness Committee, received\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\nhis honorable discharge. The ceremony was attended by my good friend \nand colleague, Congressman Bob Stump, Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee; Mr. Rudy de Leon, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel \nand Readiness; Admiral Jim Loy, Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard; and Mr. \nGeorge Searle, National President, American Merchant Marine Veterans. I \nwould like to thank them for participating in the ceremony and \nacknowledging the service of Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hoomes, and Mr. Katusa, \nand the role that these, and all, Merchant Marine veterans played in \npreserving freedom.\n  As we mark National Maritime Day, it is important to note that our \ncountry's Merchant Mariners continue to stand ready to serve. In fact, \nthe leaders of the major maritime labor unions--the Marine Engineers' \nBeneficial Association; the International Organization of Masters, \nMates and Pilots; the National Maritime Union of America; the American \nMaritime Officers; and the Seafarers International Union of North \nAmerica--recently expressed their readiness to support America's \nmilitary effort in the Balkans. Recent reports that Greek seamen are \nrefusing to support that effort is a reminder of why the United States \nrequires its own highly capable Merchant Marine.\n  Mr. President, I will treasure that patch of ``Battlin' Pete'' from \nthe Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. It will always remind me \nof the importance of National Maritime Day, and of the sacrifices that \nAmerica's Merchant Mariner veterans have made in the service of their \ncountry. For those who braved the Murmansk run; for those who served \nthrough the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf; for \nthose who today stand ready to sail into harm's way with our Armed \nForces; we salute you on this day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5733-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXPRESSION ON VOTES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I regret that due to family business \nwhich took me out of the country, I was unable to cast several recorded \nvotes during yesterday's session. While my vote would not have altered \nthe outcome of any of the motions, I would like to express how I would \nhave voted had I been able:\n  On vote No. 120, a Cloture Motion regarding the motion to proceed to \nconsideration of S. 96, Y2K liability legislation. I would have voted \n``AYE.'' It is high time we move to consideration of this important \nlegislation. The turn of the millennium is fast approaching and we must \nwork to protect our citizens and businesses against harmful litigation \nthat benefits no one.\n  On vote No. 121, amendment numbered 351 to S. 254 offered by Senator \nAllard regarding memorials in public schools, I would have voted \n``AYE.'' This amendment will allow students and faculty members to \ngrieve for classmates and colleagues killed on school property in a way \nthat makes them most comfortable.\n  On vote No. 122, an amendment numbered 352 to S. 254 offered by \nSenators Kohl and Hatch regarding mandatory safety locks on guns, I \nwould have voted ``AYE.'' This amendment was an example of the \nimportance of bipartisan compromise. The Kohl-Hatch amendment requires \nall handguns sold or transferred by a licensed dealer to be sold with a \nlocking device. In addition, this amendment provides important \nliability protections for gun owners who use these safety devices.\n  On vote No. 13, an amendment numbered 353 to S. 254 offered by \nSenators Hatch and Feinstein I would have voted ``AYE.'' This important \namendment increased penalties for participating in a crime as a gang \nmember; makes it illegal to travel or use the mail for gang business; \nmakes it illegal to transfer firearms to children to commit a crime; \nmakes it illegal to clone pagers; prohibits the distribution of certain \ninformation relating to explosives or destructive devices; makes it \nillegal to wear body armor in the commission of a crime and donates \nsurplus body armor to local Law enforcement agencies; and strengthens \npenalties for Eco-terrorism.\n  On vote No. 124, an amendment to S. 254 offered by Senator Byrd I \nwould have voted ``AYE.''

Mr. President, yesterday I met with former Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services Louis Sullivan, who now chairs the \nprestigious Public Health Policy Advisory Board (PHPAB). Dr. Sullivan \npresented to me their new report entitled ``Health and the American \nChild: A Focus on the Mortality Among Children.''\n  I was immediately struck by the fact that the findings of the PHPAB \nreport underscore both the need for the legislation we are debating \nhere today and the tremendous importance we must place on prevention \nefforts so that we can reduce unnecessary deaths of our Nation's youth.\n  According to ``Health and the American Child,'' in the past two \ndecades, two causes of child death have dramatically increased--\nhomicide and suicide, which account for 14% and 7% respectively of all \ndeaths for children under age 19. In teenage black males, the levels \nare so striking that the report uses the term ``epidemic'' to describe \nan eight-fold increase in homicide rates among African American youth, \nnow their number one cause of death.\n  ``Homicide and suicide, the greatest new risks to children's health \ntoday, require both heightened preventive action as well as research \ninto children's mental health and the social fabric in which they grow \nand develop.'' And that is precisely what we have been talking about \nduring our debate on S. 254.\n  The PHPAB report goes on to define the contributing risk factors \nassociated with mortality in children. Homicide and suicide, as the \nmajor killers of our children, are most closely associated with \nfirearms, drug and alcohol use, and motor vehicles. These significant \nincreases in both morbidity and mortality among our youth must be \naddressed and demand aggressive preventive action on our part.\n  I commend ``Health and the American Child'' to my colleagues and \nwould be glad to make it available to any Senators who care to have the \nbenefit of its considerable findings. ``Health and the American Child'' \nis really a call to action. It shows so dramatically why this bill we \nare debating today is important, and why we must set partisan rhetoric \naside to get this legislation passed and enacted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5733-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of \ncritical importance to the domestic lamb industry and to producers in \nmy home state of Wyoming. In September 1998, a coalition of individuals \nfrom all segments of the U.S. lamb industry filed a Section 201 trade \npetition with the U.S. International Trade Commission under laws\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nembedded in the Trade Act of 1974 and every trade act this nation has \nagreed to since that time.\n  Our domestic industry filed this trade case in response to the \nsurging, record-setting levels of imported lamb meat from Australia and \nNew Zealand. These individuals, although representing different sectors \nof the U.S. lamb industry, collectively signed onto this legal battle \nbecause each entity has witnessed a drastic impact from lamb imports--\nimports that increased nearly 50 percent between 1993 and 1997 and \ncontinue at an aggressive rate still today.\n  Under a Section 201 petition, the International Trade Commission is \nrequired to conduct an investigation to confirm or dispel the claims \nasserted within the trade case. Twice the Commissioners heard arguments \nfrom both the domestic industry and the importers. Twice the \nCommissioners rejected the importers arguments. In both instances, the \nCommissioners voted unanimously--during the injury phase in February \nand again in March, when they recommended that the President impose \nsome form of trade relief. The Commission's report, and the industry's \ntrade case, now await a final determination by President Clinton.\n  According to the Commission's report, wholesale imported lamb cuts \nconsistently undercut the price of identical domestic cuts. Evidence of \nimporters underselling domestically produced lamb was found in 79 \npercent of the product-to-product comparisons with margins of 20 \npercent to 40 percent. Other comparisons have found margin disparities \nreaching as high as 70 percent. It is evident that our domestic \nindustry is suffering from the flood of cheap, imported lamb that has \nswamped the U.S. market and forced prices below break-even levels.\n  Time is of the essence in this matter as President Clinton has until \nJune 4, 1999, to render his decision on what trade relief, if any, to \nimplement. It is important to remember that under our own trade laws, \nthe requirement of demonstrating that imports are threatening serious \ninjury to the domestic industry has been met. As a result, I urge the \nPresident to impose strong, effective and temporary trade relief. More \nimportantly, I urge the President to act on behalf of our producers by \nseriously considering the undisputed facts outlined in the Commission's \nreport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5734-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5734-S5736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of all those who \nserve their fellow citizens through their active participation in the \nnation's emergency care system to make my remarks on the introduction \nof S. 9-1-1, the ``Emergency Medical Services Act of 1999.''\n  Mr. President, as a Senator who is deeply concerned about the every-\nexpanding size and scope of the federal government, I've long believed \nWashington is too big, too clumsy and too removed to deal effectively \nwith many of the issues in which it already meddles. However, I also \nbelieve there's an overriding public health interest in ensuring a \nviable and seamless EMS system across the country. By designating this \nweek as national EMS Week, our nation recognizes those individuals who \nmake the EMS system work.\n  There's no more appropriate time to reaffirm our commitment to EMS by \naddressing some of the problems the system is presented with daily.\n  I've often said that Congress has a tendency to wait until there's a \ncrisis before it acts, but Congress cannot wait until there's a crisis \nin the EMS system before we take steps to improve it. There's simply \ntoo much at stake.\n  Whether we realize it or not, we all depend on and expect the \nconstant readiness of emergency medical services. To ensure that \nreadiness, we need to make efforts to secure the stability of the \nsystem. This has been my focus in drafting the EMSEA.\n  The most important thing we can do to maintain the vitality of the \nEMS system is to compel the government to reimburse for the services it \nsays it will pay for under Medicare.\n  In the meetings I've had with ambulance providers, emergency medical \ntechnicians, emergency physicians, nurses, and other EMS-related \npersonnel, their most common request is to base reimbursement on a \n``prudent layperson'' standard, rather than the ultimate diagnosis \nreached in the emergency room.\n  While the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 [BBA] contained a provision \nbasing reimbursement for emergency room services on the prudent \nlayperson standard, I find it troubling HCFA refuses to include \nambulance transportation in its regulations as a service covered by the \npatient protections enacted as part of Medicare Plus Choice. I also \nbelieve it is unacceptable that beneficiaries participating in fee-for-\nservice are not granted the protections afforded to those in Medicare \nPlus Choice.\n  There has been a great debate in the Senate for the last year \nregarding protections for consumers against HMOs. Many of my colleagues \nwould be startled to learn of the treatment many seniors have \nexperienced at the hands of their own government through the Medicare \nfee-for-service program. The federal government would do better to lead \nby example rather than usurping powers from state insurance \ncommissioners by imposing federal mandates on health insurance plans \nalready governed by the states.\n  To illustrate how prevalent the problem of the federal government \ndenying needed care to Medicare beneficiaries is, I want to share with \nyou a case my staff worked on relating to Medicare reimbursement for \nambulance services. I mentioned this case last year, but it is worth \nrepeating. Please keep in mind that this is the fee-for-service \nMedicare program.\n  In 1994, Andrew Bernecker of Braham, Minnesota was mowing with a \npower scythe and tractor when he fell. The rotating blades of the \nscythe severely cut his upper arm. Mr. Bernecker tried to walk toward \nhis home but was too faint from the blood loss, so he crawled the rest \nof the way. Afraid that his wife, who was 86 years old at the time, \nwould panic--or worse, have a heart attack--he crawled to the pump and \nwashed as much blood and dirt off as he could. His wife saw him and \nimmediately called 911 for an ambulance.\n  He was rushed to the hospital where Mr. Bernecker ultimately spent \nsome time in the intensive care unit and had orthopedic surgery. A \ntragic story.\n  In response to the bills submitted to Medicare, the government sent \nthis reply with respect to the ambulance billing: ``Medicare \nRegulations Provide that certain conditions must be met in order for \nambulance services to be covered. Medicare pays for ambulance services \nonly when the use of any other method of transportation would endanger \nyour health.'' The government denied payment, claiming the ambulance \nwasn't medically necessary.\n  Apparently, Medicare believed the man's wife--who was, remember, 86 \nyears old--should have been able to drive him to the hospital for \ntreatment. Mr. and Mrs. Bernecker appealed, but were denied and began \npaying what they could afford each month for the ambulance bill.\n  After several years of paying $20 a month, the Berneckers finally \npaid off the ambulance bill. Medicare later reopened the case and \nreimbursed the Berneckers, but unfortunately, Mr. Bernecker is no \nlonger with us.\n  I have a few more examples I'd like to share with my colleagues to \nassure them this is not an isolated incident. In fact, I encourage all \nof my colleagues to meet and speak with their EMS providers to see \nfirst-hand how the lack of consistent reimbursement policy impacts \ntheir ability to provide services. This one provision of the Emergency \nMedical Services Efficiency Act will bring fairness and clarity for \nboth the beneficiary and the EMS provider trying to help those in need.\n\n  In Austin, Minnesota, a 66-year-old male was found in a shopping \ncenter parking lot slumped over the steering column of his car. The car \nwas in drive, up against a light pole with the wheels spinning and the \ntread burning off the tires. An Austin policeman at the scene requested \nan ambulance and the driver was transported to the emergency room. \nAmbulance transportation reimbursement was denied based on the \nassumption that the driver could have used other means to get to the \nemergency room. Apparently, since he was already in the car, he was \nsupposed to drive himself to the hospital despite being unresponsive.\n  Another case in Minnesota involved a 74-year-old male who was \ncomplaining\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nto his family about an upset stomach when he collapsed. The frightened \nfamily began CPR and summoned an ambulance via 9-1-1. The city's fire \ndepartment was the first on scene and applied an automatic external \ndefibrillator, which advised against shock. Paramedics arrived and \ncontinued CPR en route to the emergency room. The patient ultimately \ndied of cardiac arrest. Again, Medicare fee-for-service denied payment \nfor the ambulance because it was deemed unnecessary.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a 74-year-old female complained of flu-like \nsymptoms. Her family checked on her and found she was acting confused \nand strange. They summoned emergency medical services. Paramedics \narrived to find the woman awake but confused as to time and events. \nThey discovered she had a history of cardiac disease and diabetes. The \nparamedics tested her blood-sugar level and found it below 40. For \nthose of you unfamiliar with diabetes, a blood sugar level below 70 is \ndangerous and could lead to seizure. But once again, Medicare denied \npayment.\n  Mr. President, I have a stack of actual run tickets from EMS \nproviders in Minnesota, with names and other identifiers deleted, all \ndemonstrating what a problem this is for Medicare beneficiaries and EMS \nproviders. Again, I urge all of my colleagues to meet with their EMS \nproviders and ask how these denials affect them.\n  Title II of the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act creates a \nFederal Commission on Emergency Medical Services which will make \nrecommendations and provide input on how federal regulatory actions \naffect all types of EMS providers.\n  EMS needs a seat at the table when health care and other regulatory \npolicy is made. Few things are more frustrating for ambulance services \nthan trying to navigate and comply with the tangled mess of laws and \nregulations from the federal level on down, only to receive either a \nreimbursement that doesn't cover the costs of providing the service or \na flat denial of payment.\n  Mr. President, I came across this chart two years ago which \ndemonstrates how a Medicare claim moves from submittal to payment, \ndenial, or write-off by the ambulance provider. Look at this chart and \ntell me how a rural ambulance provider who depends on volunteers has \nthe manpower or expertise to navigate this mess. And, in the event it \nis navigated successfully, ambulance services are regularly reimbursed \nat a level that doesn't even cover their costs.\n  Mr. President, I have heard complaints from many individuals about \nthe cost of ambulance care. In fact, some within this very body \ncriticize ambulance providers for the high prices they charge for their \nservices. While I do not doubt there are cases of abuse, I know for a \nfact an overwhelming majority of EMTs, Paramedics, Emergency Nurses and \nEMS providers are trying to provide the best possible care for their \npatients at a reasonable price.\n  Let's talk about how much it costs to run just one ambulance. There's \nthe cost of the dispatcher who remains on the line to give pre-arrival \nassistance. The ambulance itself, which costs from $85,000 to $100,000. \nThe radios, beepers, and cellular telephones used to communicate \nbetween the dispatcher, ambulance, and hospital. The supplies and \nequipment in the ambulance, including everything from defibrillators to \nbandages. The two Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics who both \ndrive the ambulance and provide care to the patient. The vehicle \nrepair, maintenance, and insurance costs. The liability insurance for \nthe paramedics. And the list goes on.\n  Yes, the costs can be high, but it's clear to me that, with the \nuncertainty ambulance providers face out in the field each day, they \nneed to be prepared for very type of injury or condition. Mr. \nPresident, that's expensive.\n  I'm convinced those who complain about the high costs of emergency \ncare would be the first to complain if the ambulance that arrived to \ncare for them in an emergency didn't have the life-saving equipment \nneeded for treatment.\n  Let's be honest with ourselves: we want the quickest and best service \nwhen we face an emergency--and that costs money.\n  Mr. President, many of our political debates in Washington center \naround how to better prepare for the 21st century. I've always \nsupported research and efforts to expand the limits of technology and \ncontinue to believe technological innovations and advances in \nbiomedical and basic scientific research hold tremendous promise.\n  Under the new EMSEA, federal grant programs will be clarified to \nensure EMS agencies are eligible for programs that relate to highway \nsafety, rural development, and tele-health technology.\n  Emergency Medical Services have come a long way since the first \nambulance services began in Cleveland and New York City during the \n1860s.\n  Indeed, the scientific and technological advances have created a new \npractice of medicine in two short decades, and have dramatically \nimproved the prospects of surviving serious trauma. There's reason to \nbelieve further advances will have equally meaningful results.\n  Innovations like tele-health technology may soon allow EMTs, nurses, \nand paramedics to perform more sophisticated procedures under a \nphysician's supervision via real-time, ambulance-mounted monitors and \ncameras networked to emergency departments in specific service areas. \nBy not considering EMS agencies for federal grant dollars, we may cause \nsignificant delays in the application of current technologies. That \nwould be a mistake.\n  In August of 1996, the National Highway Traffic and Safety \nAdministration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nMaternal and Child Health Bureau issued a report, ``Emergency Medical \nServices: Agenda for the Future.'' The report outlined specific ways \nEMS can be improved, and one of the stated goals was the authorization \nof a ``lead federal agency.''\n  After consultation with those in the EMS field throughout the \ncountry, I believe the most appropriate action is to take our time and \nget it right by conducting a study to determine which current or new \noffice would best coordinate federal EMS efforts.\n  Those are the major provisions of the legislation I introduce today.\n  Mr. President, in 1995, there were approximately 100 million visits \nto emergency departments across this nation. Roughly 20 percent of \nthose visits started with a call for an ambulance. Each one of those \ncalls is important, especially to those seeking assistance and to the \nresponding EMS personnel. While EMS represents a small portion of \nhealth care spending overall, it is critically important. It serves as \nthe access point for the sickest among us and it would be tragic for \nCongress to deny its role in improving the system.\n\n  Over the past several years, I've been privileged to get to know the \nmen and women who dedicate their talents to serving others in an \nemergency.\n  The nation owes a great deal to the EMS personnel who have dedicated \nthemselves to their profession because they care about people and want \nto help those who are suffering. Nobody gets rich as a professional \nparamedic, and there's no monetary compensation at all as a volunteer. \nThe field of emergency medical services presents many challenges--but \noffers the reward of knowing you helped someone in need of assistance.\n  Every year, the American Ambulance Association recognizes EMS \npersonnel across the country for their contributions to the profession, \nand bestows upon them the Stars of Life Award.\n  This year, 94 individuals have been chosen by their peers to be \nhonored for demonstrating exceptional kindness and selflessness in \nperforming their duties.\n  Mr. President, Minnesota suffered a tremendous loss this year. On \nJanuary 14, while extricating a victim of an automobile accident, two \nEMTs were hit by a car. Brenda HagE, an EMT and Registered Nurse, was \ntransported in traumatic arrest to a nearby hospital where she was \npronounced dead. Ms. HagE is survived by her husband Darby and two \nchildren.\n  I ask that the Senate observe a moment of silence for Ms. HagE and \nall EMS personnel who have died in the line of duty.\n  Mr. President, I've talked with many professional EMTs, paramedics, \nand emergency nurses, and most tell me they wouldn't think of doing \nanything else for their chosen career. Similarly, volunteer EMS \npersonnel tell me of the indescribable satisfaction they feel when they \nhelp those in their community get the care they need.\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\n  So, in honoring them during this National EMS Week, I can think of no \nbetter way to recognize their service than through legislation that \nwill help them help others.\n  I ask my colleagues to support them by supporting S. 9-1-1, the \n``Emergency Medical Services Act.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the 1999 \nAmerican Ambulance Association Stars of Life honorees be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                           1999 Stars of Life\n\n       AZ--Theresa J.

A fatal crash on Route 9 \n     in Dixmont and a fuel truck crash in Augusta have further \n     raised concern; and\n       Whereas, an increase in the interstate gross vehicle weight \n     limit for 6-axle combination vehicles, from 80,000 pounds to \n     between 90,000 and 95,000 pounds, is supported by an \n     engineering review that was recently conducted by the Maine \n     Department of Transportation; and\n       Whereas, a recommendation to increase interstate weight \n     limits is also supported by the Maine State Police, the Maine \n     Department of Economic and Community Development, the Maine \n     Turnpike Authority, the Maine Better Transportation \n     Association, the Maine Chamber and Business Alliance and the \n     Maine Motor Transportation Association, now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, request that the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     amend federal law to increase the interstate gross vehicle \n     weight limits for 6-axle combination vehicles to between \n     90,000 and 95,000 pounds and maintain the current freeze on \n     longer combination vehicles; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to waive \nthe income inclusion on a distribution from an individual retirement \naccount to the extent that the distribution is contributed for \ncharitable purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      IRA Rollover to Charity Act\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to \nintroduce, along with Senator Durbin, the IRA Rollover to Charity Act \nof 1999. This legislation has the support of numerous charitable \norganizations across the United States. The effect of this bill would \nbe to unlock billions of dollars in savings Americans hold and make \nthem available to charity.\n  Mr. President, the legislation will allow individuals to roll assets \nfrom an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) into a charity or a \ndeferred charitable gift plan without incurring any income tax \nconsequences. Thus, the donation would be made to charity without ever \nwithdrawing it as income and paying tax on it.\n  Americans hold well over $1 trillion in assets in IRAs. Nearly half \nof America's families have IRAs. Recent studies show that assets of \nqualified retirement plans comprise a substantial part of the net worth \nof many persons. Many individuals would like to give a portion of these \nassets to charity.\n  Under current law, if an IRA is transferred into a charitable \nremainder trust, donors are required to recognize all such income. \nTherefore, absent the changes called for in the legislation, the donor \nwill have taxable income in the year the gift is funded. The IRA \nRollover to Charity Act lifts the disincentives contained in our \ncomplicated and burdensome tax code and will unleash a critical source \nof funding for our nation's charities. This is a common sense way to \nremove obstacles to private charitable giving.\n  Under the legislation, upon reaching age 59\\1/2\\, an individual could \nmove assets penalty-free from an IRA directly to charity or into a \nqualifying deferred charitable gift plan--e.g. charitable reminder \ntrusts, pooled income funds and gift annuities. In the latter case the \ndonor would be able to receive an income stream from the retirement \nplan assets, which would be taxed according to normal rules. Upon the \ndeath of the individual, the remainder would be transferred to charity.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will join in this effort to provide \na valuable new source of philanthropy for our nation's charities. This \nlegislation has the support of numerous universities and charitable \ngroups, including the Charitable Accord, an umbrella organization \nrepresenting more than 1,000 organizations and associations.\n  Mr. President, I have just returned from the Balkans. I have seen \nfirst hand the wonderful work that is being done by charitable groups \nin dealing with the massive refugee crisis that has occurred there. As \nterrible as this crisis has been, it would be worse if not for the \ngreat work that is being done by charitable groups. Our bill will help \ndirect additional resources to those charities and thousands of others. \nI urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 1088. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain administrative sites in national forests in the State of \nArizona, to convey certain land to the City of Sedona, Arizona for a \nwastewater treatment facility, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the arizona national forest improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the U.S. Forest Service is interested in \nexchanging or selling six unmanageable, undesirable and/or excess \nparcels of land in the Prescott, Tonto, Kaibab and Coconino National \nForests. In addition, the Forest Service has agreed to sell land to the \nCity of Sedona for use as an effluent disposal system. If the parcels \nare sold, the Forest Service wants to use the proceeds from five of \nthese sales to either fund new construction or upgrade current \nadministrative facilities at these national forests. Funds generated \nfrom the sale of the other parcels could be used to fund acquisition of \nsites, or construction of administrative facilities at any national \nforest in Arizona. Transfers of land completed under this bill will be \ndone in accordance with all other applicable laws, including \nenvironmental laws.\n  Mr. President, this bill will enhance customer and administrative \nservices by allowing the Forest Service to consolidate and update \nfacilities and/or relocate facilities to more convenient locations. It \noffers a simple and common-sense way to enhance services for national \nforest users in Arizona, and to facilitate the disposal of \nunmanageable, undesirable and/or excess parcels of national forest \nlands. This bill will also facilitate the construction of a much needed \nwastewater treatment plant for the City of Sedona.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1088\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2000 and \n2001 for the United States Coast Guard, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               THE COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act of 1999.\n  The Coast Guard provides many critical services for our nation. \nDedicated Coast Guard personnel save an average of more than 5,000 \nlives, $2.5 billion in property, and assist more than 100,000 other \nmariners in distress. Through boater safety programs and maintenance of \nan extensive network of aids to navigation, the Coast Guard protects \nthousands of additional people engaged in coastwise trade, commercial \nfishing activities, or simply enjoying a day of recreation out on our \nbays, oceans, and waterways.\n  The Coast Guard enforces all federal laws and treaties related to the \nhigh seas and U.S. waters. This includes marine resource protection and \npollution control. As one of the five armed forces, it provides a \ncritical component of the nation's defense strategy, something weighing \nheavily on all of our minds lately.\n  Last year, Congress enacted the Coast Guard Authorization Act of \n1998, which authorized the Coast Guard through Fiscal Year 1999. The \nbill I am introducing today reauthorizes the Coast Guard for the next \ntwo years--Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001.\n  It authorizes both appropriations and personnel levels for these two \nyears. It also contains various provisions that are designed to provide \ngreater flexibility to the Coast Guard on personnel administration; \nstrengthen marine safety provisions; includes sufficient funding to \nallow for a 4.4 percent pay raise; and other provisions.\n  One provision that deserves particular mention relates to icebreaking \nservices. The President's FY 2000 budget request includes a proposal to \ndecomission 11 WYTL-class harbor tugs. These tugs provide vital \nicebreaking services throughout the northern states, including my home \nstate of Maine. While I understand that the age of this vessel class \nmay require some action by the agency, I feel it would be premature to \ndecommission these vessels before the Coast Guard has identified a \nmeans to rectify any potentially harmful degradation of services. The \nCoast Guard has identified seven waterways within Maine that would \nsuffer a meaningful degradation of service should these tugs be brought \noffline now. These waterways provide necessary transport routes for oil \ntankers, commercial fishing vessels, and cargo ships. The costs would \nbe excessive to the local communities should that means of transport be \ncut off. As such, the bill I am introducing today includes a measure \nthat would require the Coast Guard to submit a report to Congress \nbefore removing these tugs from service that will include an analysis \nof the use of this class of harbor tugs to perform icebreaking \nservices; the degree to which the decommissioning of each such vessel \nwould result in a degradation of current services; and recommendations \nto remediate such degradation.\n  As part of its law enforcement mission in 1998, the Coast Guard \nseized 75 vessels transporting more than 100,000 pounds of illegal \nnarcotics headed for our shores. This bill provides funding to maintain \nmany of the new drug interdiction initiatives of the past few years. \nThe Coast Guard has proven time and again its ability to stem the tide \nof drugs entering our nation through water routes.\n  Finally, the Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for preventing \nand responding to major pollution incidents in the coastal zone. It \nresponds to more than 17,000 pollution incidents in the average year. \nThis bill includes a provision that provides the Coast Guard with \nemergency borrowing authority from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. \nThe measure would enhance the\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nCoast Guard's ability to effectively respond to major oil spills.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill that enjoys bipartisan support on \nthe Commerce Committee. I look forward to moving this bill to the \nSenate floor at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1089\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nthe Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1999. I would like to commend \nSenator Snowe, the Chair of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans and \nFisheries, for her leadership on Coast Guard issues. Earlier in the \nyear, Senator Snowe convened a hearing on the Coast Guard's fiscal year \n2000 budget request. The Commandant of the Coast Guard testified at the \nhearing and explained the priorities and challenges that the Coast \nGuard will face in the coming years and the ways that the agency will \nhandle them.\n  The Coast Guard is a branch of the armed forces and a multi-mission \nagency. The Coast Guard is responsible for our national defense, search \nand rescue services on our nation's waterways, maritime law \nenforcement, including drug interdiction and environmental protection, \nmarine inspection, licensing, port safety and security, aids to \nnavigation, waterways management, and boating safety. This bill will \nfurnish the Coast Guard with funding authority to continue to provide \nthe United States with high quality performance of its diverse duties \nthrough fiscal year 2001. I commend the men and women of the Coast \nGuard who serve their country with honor and distinction.\n  I believe the bill that we have introduced today is an important \nfirst step in providing authorizing legislation for the Coast Guard for \nfiscal years 2000-2001. The funding levels are currently based on the \nAdministration's transmitted legislative proposal. However, I am \nparticularly concerned about the Coast Guard's ability to continue to \nfight the war on drugs. The vast majority of drugs enter our country \nillegally after being transported over our waterways. As the primary \nmaritime law enforcement agency, the Coast Guard has proven that it can \neffectively stop drugs from reaching our streets. In fiscal year 1998, \nthe Coast Guard seized 82,623 pounds of cocaine and 31,365 pounds of \nmarijuana. Campaign STEEL WEB, the comprehensive, multi-year strategy \nto fight the war on drugs deserves full support and funding from both \nthe Administration and the Congress. Before the Commerce Committee \nconcludes its consideration of this bill, I intend to determine whether \nthe Administration's bill will provide an adequate level of funding for \nthe Coast Guard's drug interdiction activities. I will also seek to \nensure that funding is spent on the most effective drug interdiction \nprograms.\n  The bill also incorporates several non-controversial provisions \nincluded in the Administration's bill which would provide for a variety \nof improvements for the day-to-day operation of the Coast Guard. I look \nforward to working with Senator Snowe and other members of the Commerce \nCommittee during the Senate's consideration of the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, and Mr. \n        Lott):\n  S. 1090. A bill to reauthorize and amend the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Liability, and Compensation Act of 1980; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              the superfund program completion act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Superfund \nProgram Completion Act of 1999. This bill represents our efforts to \nfocus on the areas where bipartisan consensus is achievable this year. \nThe bill provides liability relief for many parties trapped in \nSuperfund--in fact, it exempts or limits the liability of the vast bulk \nof all parties involved in Superfund litigation. The bill includes very \nstrong provisions to facilitate the redevelopment of Brownfields, and \nit starts to wind down the Federal role in site cleanup, while \nenhancing the role of the states.\n  The bill includes many provisions that have enjoyed widespread \nbipartisan support in the Senate. The Brownfields title will provide \n$100 million in grants for state, tribal and local governments to \nidentify, assess and redevelop Brownfields sites. It protects \nprospective purchasers of contaminated sites, innocent owners of \nproperties adjacent to the source of contamination, and innocent \nproperty owners who exercised due diligence upon purchase. These \nprovisions have been included in past bills supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans over the last six years.\n  The bill exempts a number of parties from Superfund liability and \nincorporates provisions of S. 2180, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act \nof 1998, cosponsored last year by Senators Lott and Daschle, as well as \n64 other members of the Senate. Our bill exempts small businesses, \ncontributors of very small amounts of hazardous waste, and contributors \nof small amounts of municipal solid waste. The bill limits the \nliability of larger generators or transporters of municipal solid \nwaste, as well as owners or operators of co-disposal landfills where \nmunicipal solid waste is disposed. The bill limits the liability of so-\ncalled de minimis parties--generally one percent contributors or less--\nas well as municipalities and small businesses with a limited ability \nto pay.\n  It is well known that Superfund liability--retroactive, strict, joint \nand several liability--often can be terribly unfair. It does not make \nany sense to make Superfund liability even more unfair to the parties \nwho do not receive liability relief in this bill by merely shifting the \nshare of the exempt or limited parties onto those that remain liable. \nThis bill does not do that. Instead, where we grant liability relief, \nwe direct EPA to use the taxes already collected from industry to pay \nthe cost of the exemptions. This seems only fair.\n\n  The bill also requires EPA to perform an impartial fair-share \nallocation at Superfund NPL sites and to give all parties an \nopportunity to settle for their allocated amount. In performing the \nallocation, EPA is directed to use the factors first proposed by Vice \nPresident Gore when he was serving in the House. EPA is given \ndiscretion to design the process, and parties that do not participate \nor settle remain liable to Superfund's underlying liability provisions, \nwhich remain unchanged except for those fortunate parties provided the \nnew protections noted above.\n  As EPA proudly boasts, cleanup is complete or underway at over 90 \npercent of the sites on the current NPL. While it is cleaning up the \nsites at a rate of 85 per year, it has listed only an average of about \n26 per year. Last year, the General Accounting Office surveyed the \nstates and EPA about the approximately 3,000 sites identified as\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\npossible National Priority List sites, but not yet listed. Only 232 of \nthese sites were identified by either EPA, a state, or both, as likely \nto be listed on the NPL. Clearly, this program is much closer to the \nend than in the beginning.\n  This bill requires EPA to plan how it will proceed at those 3,000 \nsites still awaiting a decision regarding listing. Everyone knows that \nthe vast bulk of these sites will not be listed on the Superfund List, \nthey will be cleaned up by the states, as the GAO report confirms. \nUnder our bill, new listings on the National Priority List must be \nrequested by the Governor of the affected state, and EPA is limited to \nlisting 30 sites per year.\n  The bill provides finality at sites cleaned up in state cleanup \nprograms unless a state asks for help, fails to take action, or a true \nemergency is present. This will give greater confidence to prospective \ndevelopers that state cleanup decisions will not be second-guessed by \nEPA. The bill strengthens state programs and starts to bring Superfund \nto an end.\n  The bill makes EPA's authorization and appropriation process more \ntransparent. There are separate line items for EPA's cleanup program--\nthe heart of the program--and all other activities such as Brownfields, \nsupport for research and development, Department of Justice \nenforcement, et cetera. No longer will increases in popular programs \nsuch as Brownfields come at the expense of the cleanup program. \nAuthorization levels for the cleanup recognize that the program's \nworkload is decreasing and will ramp down over time.\n  The bill allows the program to be funded from either general revenues \nor the Trust Fund. It is my view that the Superfund taxes should not be \nreimposed, and I will strongly oppose their reimposition absent \ncomprehensive Superfund reform that includes needed improvements to \nprovisions governing natural resource damages, liability, and the \ncleanup process. To the extent that EPA improves its cost recovery \nperformance and the Trust Fund balance exceeds levels needed to fund \nthe liability relief provided in this bill, then that balance, instead \nof general revenues, can be used for Superfund cleanup.\n  It is possible that EPA can recover enough past cleanup expenditures \nto pay for the full 5-year reauthorization program. Since the program's \ninception, EPA has spent approximately $15.9 billion on cleanup, the \nvast majority of it from industry-paid Superfund taxes deposited in the \nTrust Fund. Unfortunately, EPA has only recovered $2.4 billion of this \ntotal. Even discounting nearly $6.9 billion in expenditures that have \nbeen written-off by EPA or are no longer considered recoverable, there \nis approximately $6.6 billion that EPA could recover for the Trust \nFund.\n\n  It is well known that Senator Smith and I have long advocated \ncomprehensive reform of the Superfund program. We have not abandoned \nthat goal. However, in many ways, the bill we introduce today is more \nfar-reaching than our efforts in the last two Congresses. Except for \nthe liability provisions described above, the major focus of this bill \nis how to address sites not yet in the federal Superfund program. The \nSuperfund Program Completion Act addresses the future of the Superfund \nprogram.\n  The major reforms included in our previous efforts are not a part of \nthe new bill. This bill does not address liability for damages to \nnatural resources. The bill does not include liability relief for large \nresponsible parties, such as federal funding of the fair shares \nattributed to bankrupt, defunct and insolvent parties. The bill does \nnot make changes to Superfund's provisions regarding the conduct of \ncleanups.\n  I still believe reforms are needed for natural resource damages, \nliability for large responsible parties, and the cleanup process. \nUnfortunately, the administration no longer supports legislative reform \nin these areas. Even in previous years, when the administration claimed \nto support such reforms, agreement was not possible. Given the remote \nprospects for concurrence on these issues, Senator Smith and I decided \nto set the issues aside for now and move forward with an agenda that we \nbelieve can generate bipartisan support.\n  I cannot understand why anyone would fail to support this bill. It \nwill accelerate Brownfields redevelopment. It will strengthen state \nprograms in anticipation of the day we all know is coming--the day when \nthe Superfund program becomes the small emergency program that was \noriginally intended. It limits or eliminates the liability of many \nparties who were caught in Superfund's incredibly broad liability net, \nand it does so in a manner that is fair to those that are left. It does \nnot undermine the so-called ``polluter pays'' principle, but in fact \nstrengthens it by creating an incentive for EPA to improve its cost \nrecovery performance.\n  The committee will move forward quickly on this bill. The committee \nwill hold hearings on the bill next week. We will work through the \nMemorial Day recess to address Members' concerns, then hold a markup \nwithin 10 days of returning from the recess. The bill will be ready for \nfloor action prior to the July Fourth recess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1090\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I am pleased to join the distinguished \nchairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in \nintroducing the Superfund Program Completion Act of 1999. This is a \ngood day for the environment and for the American taxpayer, because \nthis bill addresses many of the problems in Superfund that have wasted \nresources and delayed the cleanup of hazardous waste sites across the \ncountry.\n  Since I became chairman of the Superfund, Waste Control and Risk \nAssessment Subcommittee in 1995, I have had one overriding goal with \nrespect to Superfund reform: To increase cleanups by decreasing the \nunfairness of the law.\n  By now, most are well aware of Superfund's dismal history. The \nprogram was created in 1980 to clean up abandoned hazardous waste \nsites. Begun with the best of intentions, Superfund has failed to meet \neven minimal expectations. Despite public and private expenditures of \nmore than $40 billion dollars, less than 14% of approximately 1,300 \nsites have been cleaned up and removed from the National Priorities \nList over the last nineteen years.\n  The primary reason for this abysmal performance is Superfund's \nretroactive, strict, joint and several liability scheme. Under joint \nand several liability, the EPA or a private party can seek to hold any \nother potentially responsible party liable for the entire cleanup cost \nat a site--regardless of the type of contamination, when the material \nwas disposed of, or whether the activity was legal at the time. Joint \nand several liability allows the government or a larger polluter to \nlegally extort payments far in excess of a company's true share of \nresponsibility for waste at a site.\n  Most reasonable people would agree that such a liability scheme is \nsimply unfair. Worse yet, this unfairness has significantly hindered \nprogress in cleaning up sites and wasted vast amounts of taxpayer \nfunding. As one might expect, when a company is faced with paying 100% \nof the costs at a site for which their true liability may be less than \n10%, that company will delay, negotiate, and litigate at every stop of \nthe process. That, unfortunately, is the well-documented history of \nSuperfund.\n  It is important to recognize that this unfairness is not confined to \nEPA's enforcement of the law. EPA merely begins the process at most \nsites by targeting one or more large parties who are potentially \nresponsible for cleanup. Then those parties typically turn around and \nsue tens or hundreds of other parties--average citizens, small \nbusinesses, schools, churches, and others who face huge legal bills and \nyears of expensive litigation if they don't pay up.\n  My position on this issue has been constant: I believe that \nretroactive, strict, joint and several liability is fundamentally \nunfair. If I had my way, I would repeal it today. Some of my colleagues \nsee things differently, however, and the bill we introduce today \nrepresents a reasonable resolution of conflicting views on that topic.\n  While our legislation does not go as far as many would like, I \nbelieve it goes as far as we can if we are interested in passing a bill \nthis Administration will sign into law. There's an old saying around \nhere: ``Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'' That is \ncertainly the case with Superfund and the legislation we introduce \ntoday. This is a good bill. It will make a profound and positive \ndifference in the lives of millions of Americans. It is a bill that can \npass the Senate on a strong bi-partisan basis; and it is a bill that \nthe President should sign into law.\n  The Superfund Program Completion Act makes major reforms in six \nareas. Specifically, the SPCA:\n  Directs EPA to finish the job that was started nearly two decades ago \nby completing the evaluation of the 3,000 remaining sites on the CERCLA \nInformation System (CERCLIS).\n  Clearly allocates responsibility between states and EPA for future \ncleanups.\n  Protects municipalities, small business, recyclers, and other parties \nfrom unfair liability--while making the system fairer for everyone \nelse.\n  Provides states $100 million per year and full authority for their \nown cleanup programs.\n  Revitalizes communities with $100 million in annual brownfields \nredevelopment grants.\n  Requires fiscal responsibility by EPA and saves taxpayers money.\n  Our legislation will result in more hazardous waste sites being \ncleaned up--and in fewer dollars being wasted on litigation. It will \ngive much-needed and much-deserved liability relief to innocent \nlandowners, contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, \nmunicipalities, small businesses and recyclers. Unlike EPA's \nadministrative reforms, this bill does not shift costs from politically \npopular parties to those left holding the bag. Instead, it requires \npayment of a statutory orphan share and authorizes the use of the \nSuperfund Trust Fund for those shares.\n\n  For those left trapped in the Superfund liability scheme, the SPCA \nrequires an allocation process to determine a party's fair share in an \nexpedited settlement--instead of fighting it out for years in court.\n  In addition to increasing fairness, the SPCA provides much needed \nguidance and direction to a sometimes wayward EPA. It recognizes and \nbuilds upon the growth and strength of State hazardous waste cleanup \nprograms. It provides new resources to States and localities for their \ncleanup and redevelopment efforts. As many of my colleagues know, the \nfear of Superfund liability has resulted in an estimated 450,000 \nabandoned or underutilized properties, or ``Brownfields,'' that lay \nfallow because private developers and municipalities don't want to be \ndragged into Superfund's litigation quagmire. With new resources and \nappropriate liability protections, our bill will allow the cleanup of \nthose sites, spurring economic redevelopment in cities, towns, and \nrural areas across America.\n  We take a different approach to the brownfields redevelopment issue \nthan\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\nthe Administration seeks. Along with many of my colleagues, I believe \nthat economic redevelopment is primarily a State and local issue. Our \napproach provides the resources and freedom States need to make \nprogress on this front, rather than giving EPA new authority to get \ninto the commercial real estate and redevelopment business. That is not \nEPA's role, nor should it be. Where EPA does have a role is in \nidentifying and addressing risks at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. \nOur legislation ensures that EPA regains its focus on that mission.\n  Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that \n``completion of construction at existing sites'' and reducing new \nentries into the program was the Environmental Protection Agency's top \nSuperfund priority. Unfortunately, EPA's narrow focus on generating \nconstruction completion statistics appears to have diverted resources \nfrom EPA's fundamental mission--protecting human health and the \nenvironment from releases of hazardous waste.\n  GAO reported last year that there are still 3,000 sites awaiting a \nNational Priorities List decision by EPA, most of which have been in \nthe CERCLIS inventory for more than a decade. According to the report, \nhowever, more than 1,200 of those sites are actually ineligible for \nlisting on the NPL, for a variety of reasons. Some of the sites were \nclassified erroneously, while others either do not require cleanup, \nhave already been cleaned up, or have final cleanup underway. EPA's \nfailure to remove the specter of an NPL listing at these sites has \nlikely caused significant economic and social harm to the surrounding \ncommunities. EPA needs to focus on that task.\n  In addition, far too many of the sites that are still potentially \neligible for listing have received little or no attention from EPA. EPA \nadmitted taking no cleanup action at all at 336 sites and provided no \ninformation for another 48 sites. The only action taken at 719 sites \nwas an initial site assessment. EPA's inattention may be due to the \nfact that EPA and state officials together identified only 232 of the \nsites as worthy of being added to the NPL. In that case, however, the \nappropriate response is to archive the sites while ensuring that any \nnecessary cleanup occurs under some other Federal or state program. EPA \nneeds to focus on that task as well.\n  Unforfunately, there is also disagreement between EPA and state \nofficials about even those 232 sites. EPA identified 132 that may be \nlisted on the NPL in the future, but state officials agreed on only 26 \nof those. Conversely, state officials identified a different group of \n100 sites as worthy of an NPL listing in the future.\n  EPA agreed with GAO's recommendation that it ``develop a joint \nstrategy'' with the States for addressing these sites. After nearly 20 \nyears and $20 billion in taxpayer funded EPA appropriations, it is \ndisturbing that the agency only now is developing such a strategy. \nNonetheless, Congress has an obligation to provide direction and \nassistance to EPA in this effort. The Superfund Program Completion Act \nprovides that direction by:\n  Requiring EPA to finish evaluating and/or archiving old sites stuck \nin the CERCLIS inventory, correcting the current imbalance between \nevaluating uncontrolled sites and amassing construction completed \nstatistics.\n  Providing EPA with a schedule of 30 NPL listings per year, to ensure \nthat it and the States appropriately allocate sites for cleanup under \nSuperfund, RCRA, or State response programs.\n  Increasing current law limits on EPA removal actions to provide \ngreater flexibility in responding to sites that at least initially \nshould be the responsibility of the Federal government, but ultimately \ndo not require an NPL listing.\n  These provisions will ensure that the limited universe of sites \nremaining in the Superfund pipeline are dealt with quickly and safely.\n  In addition to keeping EPA focused on the task at hand, our bill \nprovides increased resources and authority to the States, in \nrecognition of the progress made by State cleanup programs in the last \ndecade.\n  Superfund is notable among the major Federal environmental statutes \nnot only for its abysmal track record, but also for its heavy reliance \non EPA action rather than state implementation. In other environmental \nprograms--RCRA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act--EPA \ntypically sets general program direction and provides technical support \nwhile leaving implementation and enforcement to the states. In the \nSuperfund program, however, EPA takes a direct role in both enforcement \nand cleanup. This leadership role was originally justified by a \nperceived inability or alleged unwillingness on the part of states to \nperform or oversee cleanups. The situation today is far different.\n  The Environmental Law Institute reported last year that States have \nnow completed 41,000 cleanups, with another 13,700 in progress. The \nAssociation of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials \n(ASTSWMO) reports that ``States are not only addressing more sites at \nany given time, but are also completing more sites through streamlined \nState programs. State programs have matured and increased in their \ninfrastructure capacity.''\n  Most now recognize that states have made great strides in their \nprograms, and even EPA in May of 1998 released a ``Plan to Enhance the \nRole of States and Tribes in the Superfund Program.'' Not surprisingly, \nwhile that plan appears to provide some increased opportunities for \nstate leadership, it also envisions a significant, on-going role for \nEPA.\n  The Superfund Program Completion Act, on the other hand, assists, \nrecognizes and builds on the growth of state cleanup programs. The SPCA \nalso responds to pleas from ASTSWMO, the National Governors Association \nand others to remove the ever-present threat of EPA over-filing and \nthird party lawsuits under Superfund when a site is being cleaned up \nunder a State program. The SPCA recognizes the fact that States should \nbe the leaders in cleaning up hazardous waste sites by:\n  Providing $100 million annually for State core and voluntary response \nprograms to allow States to build on their impressive record of \naccomplishment in this area.\n  Providing finality, except in cases of emergency or at a State's \nrequest, for cleanups conducted under State law.\n  Requiring EPA to work with the States so that sites listed on the NPL \nare those the Governor of the State agrees warrant an NPL listing.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we introduce today represents the \nculmination of years of hard work. In the four years I have been \nChairman of the Superfund Subcommittee, we have heard from more than \n100 witnesses, representing every viewpoint, in an effort to grapple \nwith the problems caused by the Superfund law. We have communicated \nwith thousands of individuals and organizations who have urged us to \nfix this law.\n  Senator Chafee and I have spent long hours with our Democratic \ncolleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and with EPA \nAdministrator Carol Browner. So far, we and our staffs have devoted \nmore than 600 hours to this effort. We have negotiated issues, \nidentified areas of agreement, eliminated many areas of controversy, \nand pinpointed those few remaining areas where our differences will \nneed to be resolved through the legislative process itself. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle during \nthat process.\n  Before I close, let me say a few words about taxes. Simply put, there \nare no taxes required to finance this bill, and I will oppose all \nattempts to attach them to it.\n  Congress has appropriated more than $20 billion to support EPA's \nSuperfund program during the past 19 years. The GAO reports that amount \nincludes more than $6 billion of unrecovered ``recoverable costs.'' \n``Recoverable costs'' are taxpayer expenditures that EPA made in \nanticipation of recovering them from individual polluters at sites. \nThat sum alone would be sufficient to finance EPA's cleanup efforts \nthroughout the life of this reauthorization. Our bill allows those \nfunds to be used for cleanup when EPA does recover them. Further, there \nshould be no doubt that Congress will continue to appropriate funds \nneeded for EPA to finish its job. More taxes are not required to \nfinance this bill or to finish the Superfund program.\n  During the last two Congresses, I was willing to support the \nreimposition of\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\ntaxes to finance Superfund legislation with major changes in the areas \nof remedy selection and natural resource damages--as well as more \nsweeping liability reforms than are contained in the bill we introduce \ntoday. There remains a real need for those reforms, and I pledge to \ncontinue my efforts in that regard.\n  The bill we introduce today, however, is designed to achieve all that \nwe can under the current Administration. It represents substantial, \nreal reform that will help thousands of communities and millions of \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator Bob Smith and Senator. John Chafee in introducing the Superfund \nProgram Completion Act. For several years Congress has worked \ndiligently to find common ground for all parties involved, common \nground that will also correct the flaws of the original law. Senator \nSmith's legislation will do just that.\n  In 1980, Congress approved the Comprehensive Environmental Response \nCompensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) which was intended to pay for \nthe cleanup of the nation's most hazardous waste sites. This law became \nknown as Superfund--a bit ironic since the law provides no funding, but \ninstead requires those who operated or used the landfill to pay for the \ncleanup.\n  There is logic and fairness in requiring the polluters to pay for the \ncleanup; however, Superfund's liability structure was so poorly planned \nexcessive litigation was encouraged. Cleanup did not occur and costs \nwere passed to small businesses across the nation. Superfund did cause \nunnecessary lawsuits and wasted valuable time, all the while leaving \nsites across America polluted.\n  Mr. President, this new legislation by Senators Smith and Chafee \nwould exempt those small businesses who acted in good faith and are \nstill being dragged into Superfund as third and fourth party defendants \nby simply throwing out their household trash. Superfund does not \ndistinguish large from small, nor does it distinguish polluters from \nresponsible businesses. In many instances, these business owners did \nnothing wrong. Yet, the law penalizes people for something that at one \ntime was legal.\n  Virtually all sides agree that some small businesses should have \nnever been pulled into the system. While this legislation would not be \nretroactive, it will save small businesses in other communities from \nfuture Superfund lawsuits. It is important to reward those who have \nacted responsibly. I believe Senator Smith's bill is responsible.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe there is one Senator who is pleased \nwith the way in which the Superfund statute has operated. Like small \nbusinesses, recyclers have also been targeted to pay for cleanup. They \nshould not be held responsible for pollution at a Superfund site. The \nAdministration agrees. A majority of the Congress agrees. The \nenvironmental community agrees. Senator Smith's bill will fix the \nrecycler's problem and remain faithful to the environment.\n  Over the past three decades, concern for our environment and natural \nresources has grown--as has the desire to recycle and reuse. This makes \nenvironmental sense. This legislation would remove an unintended yet \ntroublesome legal obstacle to recycling. This bill corrects current law \nand encourages recycling. It simply recognizes that recycling is not \ndisposal and that recyclables are not waste. Common sense tells us that \nrecycling something is not the same as disposing of it.\n  This bill will help level the playing field between the use of \nrecycled goods and competitive virgin raw materials. Currently \nsuppliers of virgin raw materials face no Superfund liability for \ncontamination caused by the consumer. This bill will supply the same \nwaiver to those who sell recyclable materials.\n  This bill also contains protections to ensure that sham recyclers are \nunable to benefit from this exemption. In order for recyclers to be \nrelieved of Superfund liability, they must act in an environmentally \nsound manner and sell their product to manufacturers with \nenvironmentally responsible business practices. Considering that most \nrecyclers are currently operating in a reasonable and conscience \nmanner, this should be an easy test.\n  Mr. President, the recycling portion of the bill is the product of \nlengthy negotiations between the federal and state governments, the \nenvironmental community and the recycling industry. It serves only one \npurpose--to remove from the liability loop those who collect and ship \nrecyclables to a third party site. These negotiations have resulted in \na provision that I believe to be both environmentally and fiscally \nsound. By removing the threat of Superfund liability for recyclers, we \nwill encourage more recycling.\n  Mr. President, while this provision is not precisely the Superfund \nRecycling Equity Act which Senator Daschle and I introduced last year--\na bill which was supported by 63 of our Senate colleagues--I look \nforward to working with all parties to ensure we pass a bill that the \nAdministration, environmentalists, and industry can support.\n  Mr. President, I will also work with my colleagues to ensure that no \nSuperfund taxes will be reinstated. After many years and millions and \nmillions of dollars spent by the government, large businesses, \nmunicipalities, schools, and small businesses, only a fraction of the \ncosts has been devoted to cleanup. This cannot continue to happen.\n  I have seen a copy of the May 14, 1999, letter from Senators Chafee \nand Smith to the Environmental Protection Agency, and I completely \nagree with its conclusions. There is no need for additional tax \nrevenue. I want to quote from their letter because the Senators said it \njust right.\n  ``Many responsible parties who have already paid for their own \ncleanups would also be liable for reimposed taxes. They are frankly \nunwilling to see the tax reinstated unless there are sweeping reforms \nin the structure of the program, as well. We find their arguments \npersuasive. We will not vote to reimpose the tax, unless it is part of \na comprehensive Superfund reform.''\n  ``There is a second reason for our opposition to a tax extension at \nthis time. As we noted in a recent letter to Administrator Browner, \nCongress has appropriated $15.9 billion for Superfund from its \ninception through 1988. The Superfund Trust Fund was created to \nfacilitate rapid cleanups carried out by the federal government's \nexpenditures would be recovered from responsible parties once the \ncleanup action was complete. This is real ``polluters pay'' \nprinciple.''\n  ``However, only a small percentage of the $15.9 billion has been \nrecovered. To date, the Agency has obtained commitments to recover $2.4 \nbillion. EPA has written off $5 billion of past expenditures and GAO \nreports that another $1.9 billion is likely unrecoverable because EPA \ndid not properly calculate its indirect costs. This is a troubling \nrecord. A good cost recovery program that actually made the real \npolluters (as opposed to the taxpaying industries) pay could have \nrecovered sufficient funds to carry Superfund through another \nauthorization cycle without the reimposition of taxes. We are reluctant \nto ask Superfund taxpayers to once again prop up a Trust Fund that EPA \nhas allowed to dwindle.''\n  Mr. President, I'm very impressed with the Chairman Chafee and \nChairman Smith have done in getting this bill drafted and introduced. \nThey are also working on a second major environmental bill in the waste \narea--RCRA. Last year we jointly requested a report from the GAO on \nwhat saving and efficiencies can be achieved with rifle shot fixes. \nThis year Senators Chafee and Smith have been diligently working on \nfinalizing a legislative approach that is compatible to this GAO study. \nI know their staffs have been consulting with all the stakeholders, and \nI look forward to seeing this bill this summer. Hopefully, both bills \nwill have a chance to advance through the legislative process so that \nthe full Senate can consider them. Both approaches are reforms that \nAmericans deserve and need.\n  As environmentalists talk about laws which protect the environment, \nCongress must determine who actually bears the burden of cost, and \ndetermine the balance. Superfund does not discriminate. The way \nSuperfund is being implemented, it attacks our neighbors, our schools, \nand even our corner grocers. The Superfund Program Completion Act makes \npositive strides toward\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\ncorrecting the balance and reflects society's progress from the 80's \nand incorporates the methods of the 90's.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1091. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a pediatric research initiative; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             the pediatric research initiative act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill increase our nation's investment in pediatric research.\n  Despite the medical breakthroughs that have been made by health \nresearchers in recent years, it is obvious that health care research is \nunder funded. I have joined with many senators to express support for \ndoubling the budget at HIH for biomedical research. I will continue to \nfight for this increased funding so that NIH can expand its research \nefforts. An increase in funding is especially needed to improve our \nknowledge about illnesses and conditions affecting children.\n  Children under age 12 represent 30 percent of the population--and \nyet, NIH devotes less than 12 percent of its budget to their needs. \nThere has been a growing consensus that children's health deserves more \nattention from the research community.\n  The bill I am introducing today would help us begin to remedy the \nneed for stronger investment in children's health research. I thank \nSenator Bond for joining with me in sponsoring this important \nlegislation. This bill would authorize the Pediatric Research \nInitiative within the Office of the Director of National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) to encourage, coordinate, support, develop, and recognize \npediatric research.\n  The bill would authorize $50 million annually for the next three \nyears. During the last three years, I worked with my colleagues to fund \nthis important Initiative and as a result, it received $5 million in \nfiscal year (FY) 1997, $38.5 million in FY 1998, and at least $38.5 \nmillion in FY 1999. I look forward to working with my colleagues again \nto continue on the path toward reaching the necessary funding level.\n  Under this bill, the Initiative would provide $45 million over the \nnext three years to encourage new initiatives and promising areas of \npediatric research. It would also promote greater coordination in \nchildren's health research. Today, there are some 20 Institutes and \nCenters and Offices within NIH that do something in the way of \npediatrics. In my view, we need to bring some level of coordination and \nfocus to these efforts.\n  In developing this Initiative, I have made sure that it would give \nthe Director of NIH as much discretion as possible. The money has to be \nspent on outside research, so that the dollars flow out to the private \nsector--but it can go toward basic research or clinical research.\n  This bill does not create any new Office, Center, or Institute. I \nwould simply authorize funding for more research and better research \ncoordination for children--not infrastructure.\n  In addition to authorizing the Initiative, the legislation would \nauthorize new funding, through the National Institutes of Child Health \nand Human Development (NICHD), for pediatric research training grants \nto provide a major increase in support for training additional \npediatric research scientists. We need to strengthen our national \ninvestment in pediatric research training.\n  The supply of pediatrician scientists needs to increase if we are to \nfulfill the new NIH policies that require the participation of children \nin NIH-funded clinical trials and the new Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) policies that require the testing of drugs for use by children \nbefore they can receive FDA approval.\n  The number of pediatricians training to become subspecialists--the \npotential supply of future pediatrician scientists--is declining. The \nnumber of medical school pediatric departments that receive significant \nNIH research training grant support is limited--fewer than half receive \nany NIH research training grants. Many pediatricians in training have \nlittle or no exposure to research.\n  Together, the Pediatric Research Initiative and the pediatric \nresearch training grants are crucial investments in our country's \nfuture--and will produce great returns. If we focus on improving health \ncare for our children, we'll set the stage for them becoming healthy \nadults.\n  This important legislation has the support of the pediatric research \ncommunity in children's hopsitals and university pediatric departments \nall over the country, including the National Association of Children's \nHospitals, Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairmen, \nAmerican Pediatric Society, and Society for Pediatric Research, as well \nas the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, March of Dimes, \nAssociation of Ohio Children's Hospitals, and many more\n  I urge my colleagues to support this investment in our children and \ncosponsor this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1091\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CRAPO:\n  S. 1092. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to regulation of pharmacists, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              PHARMACIST'S PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the \n``Pharmacist's Patient Protection Act of 1999.'' The purpose of the \nlegislation is to stop the implementation of final regulations that \nhave been issued by the Food and Drug Administration that will require \ncommunity pharmacists to provide agency sanctioned information when \ncertain prescription drugs are dispensed to a patient. Such \nregulations, commonly called ``MedGuides'', were issued in final form \non December 1, 1998.\n  Now why would Congress want to prohibit a regulation which would give \npatients written information about their medications? The answer is \nvery simple. During the 104th Congress, the House and Senate debated \nthis very same issue, and ultimately a compromise was reached whereby \nFDA agreed not to promulgate its MedGuide regulations for a period of \ntime so that the private sector would have the opportunity to work with \nthe Administration to develop a voluntary action plan to continue to \nincrease the quality and quantity of written information already being \nprovided to consumers with prescription medication. Under the agreement \nwhich was enacted into law as part of the FY 97 Agriculture \nAppropriations, FDA is prohibited from implementing any part of the \nMedGuide regulations until the year 2001. When we get to the year 2001, \nFDA would be permitted to move forward with the MedGuide initiative \nonly if voluntary efforts failed to get written information to 75 \npercent of all patients receiving a new prescription.\n  Regrettably, FDA has chosen not to live up to its part of the \nagreement. The agency's final rule to require Medication Guides for \nselected prescription drugs, which will take effect on June 1, 1999, is \nin clear violation of federal law. It appears that FDA is deliberately \nignoring the law. It would be my hope that the Administration would \nhold in abeyance the implementation of the MedGuide regulations, and \nhonor the remainder of the moratorium relating to this rule making. \nHowever, I am not confident that this will occur, and therefore this \nbill is necessary so that we can put back into place the terms of the \nagreement that were made with the Administration during the 104th \nCongress.\n  Finally, I should point out that holding off the implementation of \nthe MedGuide rule will not deny patients access to prescription drug \ninformation, nor will it preclude FDA from communicating with \npharmaceutical companies and community pharmacists about the importance \nof providing information to patients about their prescription drugs. In \nother words, nothing in this bill should be construed as restricting \nthe ability of the FDA to use its existing authority regarding the \nprovision of written patient information on a product-by-product basis \nwith certain prescription medications.\n  Let the competitive retail pharmacy marketplace continue to make \ngreat strides in providing consumers with meaningful, accurate and \neasily understood written information about prescription drugs. I urge \nmy colleagues to co-sponsor the ``Pharmacist's Patient Protection Act \nof 1999.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1093. A bill to establish the Galisteo Basin Archaeological \nProtection Sites, to provide for the protection of archaeological sites \nin the Galisteo Basin of New Mexico and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          Galisteo Basin Archaeological Protection Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \ndesigned to provide for the protection of various historical sites in \nthe Galisteo Basin. The Basin is located in and around Santa Fe County, \nNew Mexico, as depicted by this map. (See, map) To understand the \nimportance of these sites, it's important to understand the history of \nthis Basin.\n  Mr. President, when the Spanish Conquistadores arrived in New Mexico \nin 1598, they found a thriving native Pueblo culture with its own \nunique traditions of religion, architecture, and art, which was \nenriched and influenced by an extensive system of trade. The subsequent \nhistory of conflict and coexistence between these two cultures, Pueblo \nIndian and Spanish, shaped much of the language, art, and cultural \nworldview of New Mexicans today.\n  That initial history of cultural interaction in New Mexico \nencompassed a period of a little over one hundred years from the 1598, \nthrough the Pueblo revolt in 1680, and the recolonization by the \nSpanish in the early 1700s. Among these sites are examples of both the \nstone and adobe pueblo architectural styles which typified Native \nAmerican pueblo communities prior to and during early Spanish \ncolonization, including two of the largest of these ancient towns, San \nMarcos and San Lazaro Pueblos, which each had thousands of rooms at \ntheir peak. Also included in these sites are spectacular examples of \nNative American petroglyph art as well as historic missions which were \nconstructed as part of the Spaniards' drive to convert the native \npopulace to Catholicism. The twenty six archeological sites addressed \nin this bill provide cohesive picture of this crucial nexus in New \nMexican history, depicting the culture of the pueblo people, and \nillustrating how it was affected by the Spanish settlers .\n  Mr. President, through these sites, we have an opportunity to truly \nunderstand the simultaneous growth and the coexistence of these two \ncultures. Unfortunately, this is an opportunity we may soon lose. Most \nof these sites are not currently part of any preservation program and \nthrough weathering, erosion, vandalism, and amateur excavations are \nlosing their interpretive value.\n  This legislation creates a program under the Department of the \nInterior to preserve these sites, and to provide interpretive research \nin an integrated manner. While many of these sites are on federal \npublic land, many are privately owned and a few are on state trust \nlands. The vision behind this legislation is that an integrated \npreservation program at sites on Federal lands could serve as a \nfoundation for archaeological research that could be augmented with \nvoluntary cooperative agreements with state agencies and private land \nowners. These agreements would provide landowners with the opportunity \nfor technical and financial assistance to preserve the sites on their \nproperty. Where the parties deem\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\nit appropriate, the legislation would also allow for the purchase or \nexchange of property to acquire these very valuable sites. With such a \nprogram in place, we should be able to preserve the history embodied in \nthese sites for future generations.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to add that this legislation is \nsupported by Cochiti Pueblo which is culturally and historically tied \nto these sites. I have received a letter from Isaac Herrera , the \nGovernor of Cochiti Pueblo expressing his support and that of the \ntribal council. Governor Herrera notes that the tribe has already \ndonated $10,000 to the preservation of one of these sites. This \nlegislation is also supported by the State Land Commissioner.\n  Let me conclude by showing you some examples of these magnificent \nsites. These first 2 charts are from the Comanche Gap site, they are \noutstanding examples of petroglyph art. The next three charts I have \nshow three of the various pueblo sites. The first, Pueblo Blanco. As \nyou can see the drywash at the top of the picture and the road at the \nbottom, these are the types of erosion threats which I mentioned \nearlier. The next picture is Arroyo Hondo. Again, you have a drywash at \nthe top, a major road along the site, and development around the site, \nwhich shows the threats posed. Finally is the Pueblo of Colorado, once \nagain showing the threat of erosion from the drywashes above.\n  Mr. President, I want to especially thank Jessica Schultz who has \nbeen an intern in my office this past year, and has done yeoman work in \nproviding research for this bill and in helping to draft it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the \nGalisteo Basin Archaeological Protection Act of 1999 printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1093\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to extend the placed in service date for biomass and coal \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the biomass and coal facilities extension act\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I join again with my friend \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, to introduce the Biomass and Coal Facilities \nExtension Act. This legislation would extend by eight months the \nplaced-in-service date under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  We are offering the same bill we offered in the 105th Congress \nbecause the problem addressed by the bill remains uncorrected. The \nchange we propose is\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\nnecessary in order to alleviate a hardship taxpayers are suffering as a \nresult of their reliance on actions taken by Congress nearly three \nyears ago.\n  A number of taxpayers made substantial commitments of resources to \ndevelop alternative fuel technology projects in good faith reliance on \nthe incentives provided in the Small Business Protection Act of 1996. \nUnder that law, Congress intended to ensure that alternative fuel \ntechnology projects involving coal and biomass would qualify for the \ncredit provided under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code as long \nas projects were subject to a binding contract by December 31, 1996 and \nplaced in service by June 30, 1998.\n  That should have settled the matter. However, a proposal offered by \nthe Administration in February 1997 contained a proposal to shorten the \nplaced-in-service deadline by a full year for facilities producing gas \nfrom biomass and synthetic fuel from coal. The Administration was \nconcerned about what it characterized as rapid growth in the section 29 \ncredit. Congress considered that argument, but concluded that no change \nin the 1996 legislation was necessary.\n  In the tax legislative arena, even a mere proposal can have \nconsequences. When the Joint Committee on Taxation published its \nanalysis of the Administration's budget proposals in March 1997, it \nwarned Congress about just such a consequence as it observed that \n``[b]ecause the binding contract date has already passed * * * the \nproposal might place an unfair financial burden on those taxpayers who \nare bound to contracts entered into prior to the Administration's \nannouncement.''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what happened--many taxpayers who \nfound themselves in that situation lost their sources of funding \nbecause financial institutions were obligated to take into account the \npossibility that the Administration's proposal could have become law. \nBecause the tax credit plays a significant role in the financial \nexamination lenders must make, its potential loss made securing the \nnecessary financing impossible for taxpayers who were proceeding in \ngood faith under binding contracts made in reliance on the provisions \nof the Small Business Protection Act of 1996.\n  The bill would extend the placed-in-service date for a period eight \nmonths from the date of the bill's enactment. This would restore some \nof the time that taxpayers lost as a result of the confusion which \nresulted from the events of 1997.\n  Let me emphasize that the bill would not authorize any ``new \nstarts.'' The binding contract date provided in the 1996 Act would not \nbe altered. The sole purpose of this bill is to allow taxpayers who \nbegan projects under the 1996 Act to proceed in an orderly manner to \ncreate the kinds of facilities that will help increase the country's \nuseful energy resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today with my colleague, Senator \nConrad, to introduce legislation aimed at helping companies to develop \ntechnologies for cleaner burning fuels. This is important to the people \nin my home state of Utah where air pollution is one of the top concerns \nof citizens.\n  I believe that cleaner burning fuels that will reduce emissions is a \nkey element of the solution to this problem. The Biomass and Coal \nFacilities Extension Act would provide a tool for companies that are \nstepping into this void and developing clean burning fuels by extending \nthe ``placed in service'' date under section 29 for facilities that \nproduce alternative fuels.\n  Section 29 was originally created to encourage the development of \nalternative fuels to reduce our dependence on imports and to reduce the \nenvironmental impacts of certain fuels. With the enormous reserves of \nlow rank coals and lignite in the United States and around the world, \nand with the potential for use of biomass and other alternatives, it is \nparticularly important to the American economy and to our environment \nthat new, more environmentally friendly fuels are brought to market \nboth here and in developing nations.\n  Bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In \nparticular, finding investors to take a new technology from a \nlaboratory table to the marketplace is difficult because working the \nbugs out of a first-of-a-kind, full-sized plant is a costly \nundertaking. Incentives to bring new, clean energy technologies to the \nmarket in the U.S. are a worthwhile use of the tax code.\n  In 1996, Congress provided sufficient incentives to make the \ndevelopment of alternative fuels a viable pursuit by extending the \nsection 29 ``placed in service'' date for facilities designed to \nproduce energy from biomass or processed coals to July 1, 1998, \nprovided that those facilities were constructed pursuant to a binding \ncontract entered into before January 1, 1997. Many contracts were \nsigned and construction projects started.\n  Then the Administration released its budget in February 1997. It \ncontained a proposal to eliminate the extension granted just one year \nbefore, cutting off the section 29 credit for plants not completed by \nJuly 1, 1997, which is an impossible deadline to meet for many of these \nprojects.\n  Without the assurance of the section 29 tax credit, financing for \nthese projects dried up. Taxpayers were stranded in contracts, some of \nwhich contained significant liquidated damages clauses. As a result of \nthe Administration's proposal, taxpayers essentially lost a significant \namount of the extension given them by Congress in 1996.\n  The bill before us would give companies with projects already in \nprogress and contracts signed by January 1, 1997 some additional time \nto finish these projects. The bill does not extend the contract \ndeadline, allow more projects to be initiated, or change the 2008 \ndeadline for receiving the section 29 tax credit. This bill simply \nrestores some of the time that taxpayers lost in their efforts to \ndevelop environmentally friendly fuels under section 29.\n  Bringing new alternative fuel technologies to the market is an \nimportant part of our commitment to a cleaner environment and a secure \neconomy. Congress reflected that commitment in our efforts to mitigate \nsome of the financial risk involved in developing this much needed \ntechnology in 1996. This bill maintains that commitment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kerrey, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 1099. A bill to establish a mechanism for using the duties imposed \non products of countries that fail to comply with WTO dispute \nresolution decision to provide relief to injured domestic producers; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     trade injury compensation act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Bingaman, \nDorgan, Kerrey, Johnson, and Daschle. I rise to introduce the Trade \nInjury Compensation Act of 1999.\n  Under U.S. trade law, we may retaliate when a trading partner \nimproperly closes its market to American goods or services. In certain \ncircumstances, the World Trade Organization endorses that retaliation. \nThe normal form of trade retaliation is to increase the tariff to one \nhundred percent on a designated list of imported goods.\n  The intention of retaliation is not protectionist. It is just the \nopposite--use the leverage of access to the huge United States market \nto open up a foreign market and expand trade. Retaliation is a tool \ndesigned to inflict enough economic pain on a trading partner that he \nreturns to the negotiating table and removes the trade barriers that \nstarted the problem in the first place. Sometimes these negotiations \nrestart quickly, sometimes even before the retaliation goes into \neffect. Other times, the negotiations start again only after the impact \nof retaliation sinks in.\n  In some cases, the new one hundred percent tariff raises the price of \nthe imported good so prohibitively that it is priced completely out of \nthe market. In other cases, the product is still sold in the United \nStates, perhaps at a higher price, or perhaps at the original price \nwith the importer absorbing the added tariff.\n  The United States is increasingly taking trade disputes to the WTO's \nDispute Settlement Body. However, some of our trading partners have \nbeen, in effect, snubbing their nose at the WTO's decisions. The most \negregious example of this is the European Union, whose approach to WTO \ndispute\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\nsettlement is, frankly, outrageous. First, in bananas, and now in beef, \nthe EU is using legal and procedural technicalities to delay \nimplementation of important and legitimate WTO panel decisions. Each \ntime they do this, the EU seriously undermines the credibility of the \nWTO as a fair and even-handed place to get trade justice.\n  The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a mechanism for using \nthe tariffs imposed when a country fails to comply with WTO dispute \nresolution decisions. Normally, the additional tariff revenues received \nfrom retaliation go to the Treasury. This bill establishes a trust fund \nso that the affected industry will receive those revenues as \ncompensation for its injury.\n  In the case of agriculture, the money will be spent on promotion and \ndevelopment of products for the industry. In non-agriculture cases, the \nmoney will go to additional Trade Adjustment Assistance payments to the \naffected industry.\n  Mr. President, the WTO is a critically important institution that \nsets the foundation and framework to make world trade grow. We all \nrecognize that it needs improvement, and I, along with many of my \ncolleagues, are working on ways to fix it, starting with the WTO \nMinisterial in Seattle. But, while the United Staes is striving to \nsupport and improve the WTO system, the EU seems to be working overtime \nto undercut the WTO. We must stop this abuse of the WTO, and we must \nprovide assistance to our industries that are damaged by these illegal \nactions of the EU or others in the future.\n  Within two weeks, the Administration will implement retaliatory \nmeasures against the European Union because of its WTO-illegal \nrestrictions on beef. My bill would provide the American beef industry \nwith much needed compensation while the retaliatory measures remain in \nplace.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1099\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trade Injury Compensation \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States goods and services compete in global \n     markets and it is necessary for trade agreements to promote \n     such competition.\n       (2) The current dispute resolution mechanism of the World \n     Trade Organization is designed to resolve disputes in a \n     manner that brings stability and predictability to world \n     trade.\n       (3) When foreign countries refuse to comply with a panel or \n     Appellate Body report of the World Trade Organization and \n     violate any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, it has a \n     deleterious effect on the United States economy.\n       (4) A WTO member can retaliate against a country that \n     refuses to implement a panel or Appellate Body report by \n     imposing additional duties of up to 100 percent on goods \n     imported from the noncomplying country.\n       (5) In cases where additional duties are imposed on \n     imported goods, the duties should be used to provide relief \n     to the industry that is injured by the noncompliance.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \nprovide that the designation of critical habitat for endangered and \nthreatened species be required as part of the development of recovery \nplans for those species; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                      critical habitat legislation\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill, together \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senators Domenici and Crapo, to \naddress one of the most problematic, controversial and misunderstood \nprovisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. This is the provision \nrelating to the designation of critical habitat for endangered or \nthreatened species.\n  As I have often said, the key to protecting our nation's fish and \nwildlife is to protect the habitat on which those species depend. This \nis particularly true for endangered and threatened species, which often \nfall into such precarious condition precisely because of habitat loss \nand degradation. This makes habitat protection for those species all \nthe more vital. It is thus terribly ironic that the provisions in the \nESA relating to habitat are those that present the most problems. My \nbill goes a long way to fix those problems. It is virtually identical \nto the critical habitat provisions contained in S. 1180 from the last \nCongress, which was approved by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee by a vote of 15 to 3, with strong bipartisan support.\n  Landowners fear that critical habitat imposes severe restrictions on \nuse of their own lands; the Secretary frequently does not designate \ncritical habitat to avoid these controversies; and environmental groups \noften bring lawsuits over this failure to designate. Of almost 1,200 \nspecies listed by the Fish and Wildlife Service, only 113--nine \npercent--have critical habitat designated. Indeed, of the 256 species \nlisted since April 1996, the Service has designated critical habitat \nfor only two. As a result, numerous lawsuits have been brought against \nthe Service in recent years. Currently, 15 active lawsuits are pending, \nwith six already decided--all against the Secretary--and prospective \nchallenges for another 40 species are on the horizon.\n  These statistics underscore the problems with the existing law with \nrespect to critical habitat designations. The root of these problems \nlies in the fact that designation of critical habitat requires \nknowledge of the conservation needs of the species as well as an \nassessment of the economic impacts of the designation, neither of which \nis generally known, or can be determined, at the time of listing.\n  Designation of critical habitat is more appropriate in the context of \ndeveloping a recovery plan for a listed species, because the recovery \nplan specifically addresses the conservation needs of the species and \nprovides for an estimate of the costs for recovery actions. Indeed, \nnumerous individuals and organizations, including the National Research \nCouncil, have suggested that the requirement to designate critical \nhabitat be moved from the time of listing to the time of recovery plan \ndevelopment.\n  As for recovery plans, the Secretary is required to develop and \nimplement recovery plans for listed species. However, there is no \ndeadline for the Secretary to do so. Less than 70 percent of listed \nspecies are covered in a recovery plan, and 56 percent of those species \nwithout plans have been listed for longer than one year. These \nstatistics underscore the need for a mandatory deadline for developing \nrecovery plans.\n  The bill that I introduce today would move the requirement to \ndesignate critical habitat from the time of listing to the time of \nrecovery plan development. The bill would also require that a recovery \nteam be appointed, unless the Secretary states otherwise through notice \nand comment. The bill would also provide a deadline for development of \nrecovery plans, no later than 36 months after listing. In the event \nthat the designation is necessary to avoid the imminent extinction of \nthe species, the bill allows the Secretary to designate critical \nhabitat concurrently with listing. A new provision would be added to \nthe citizen suit section that would require any lawsuit challenging the \nactual designation of critical habitat to be brought in conjunction \nwith a suit challenging the recovery plan on which the designation is \nbased. Other than these changes, the critical habitat provisions would \nremain virtually the same as in existing law.\n  Let me say that I do not have any desire to open the broader question \nof reauthorization of the ESA. I believe that this bill addresses a \nnarrow fix in a way that answers the complaints of both environmental \ngroups and the regulated community. I do not advocate the inclusion of \nother issues not related to critical habitat. There may be another time \nand vehicle for that, but this is not the time, and this bill should \nnot be the vehicle.\n  In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico for his cooperation on this \nissue, and for his decision to work on this bill together in lieu of \noffering a rider on the recent supplemental appropriations bill. I know \nthis issue is of no great importance to the constituents in his home \nState, and I am pleased to work with him to find a resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Recovery plans and critical habitat designations.''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago I rose to speak and \nshare with my fellow Senators an extraordinary exchange that occurred \nbetween myself and Interior Secretary Babbitt regarding the failings of \nthe Endangered Species Act in a situation on the Rio Grande River in \nNew Mexico. I told you that the Secretary's remarks were significant \nbecause they acknowledged that this law, however well intentioned, is \nnot working.\n  I felt Secretary Babbitt's testimony before the Senate Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee could open the door to significant reform \nof the Endangered Species Act, permitting all parties to work together. \nI pledged to begin serious work on improving the Endangered Species \nAct, and I am immensely pleased today to be cosponsoring this bill with \nSenators Chafee and Crapo to do just that.\n  I was in the Senate to vote in favor of the Endangered Species Act, \nbut the courts are implementing it in a cart before the horse fashion \nnever contemplated by the Congress. The focus of saving species should \nbe on planning recovery, not using premature habitat designation as a \nhammer on the heads of humans sharing that habitat. We want to protect \nendangered species, but we don't want to unnecessarily hurt people. \nTying critical habitat designation to recovery plan implementation is \nlogical, defensible, and the right thing to do. This legislation goes \ndirectly to the heart of this issue.\n  The protection of endangered species is supposed to be accomplished \nby first figuring out the necessary habitat for survival, then \ndesignating that critical habitat. But the Endangered Species Act and \nthe courts are rushing the process. According to Interior Secretary \nBruce Babbitt, recent litigation will ``strait jacket'' the federal \ngovernment into prematurely designating the critical habitat for, in \none case, the Rio Grande silvery minnow.\n  People in D.C. tend to forget that the western United States is the \narid, ``great American desert.'' Western rivers and streams are \nprimarily supported by melting snow pack. They change annually from \nroaring torrents in April to bare trickles in June, to dried up river \nbeds in August. The Rio Grande, despite its ``big river'' title, is no \nexception to this cyclical flow. As a child, I often walked across the \ndry riverbed in Albuquerque.\n  This will be a very dry year in the normally arid New Mexico. The \nhistorical hydrographic record shows that between 1899 and 1936, long \nbefore Albuquerque grew, or the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District \nstarted to farm, the Rio Grande was dry twenty percent of the time in \nAugust as measured at the San Marcial Gauge.\n\n  Now, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, prodded by various groups, \nare claiming a ``new'' water demand on the river for the silvery \nminnow. They should assert the interest in the water needed for the \nminnow, but the demand isn't new. The issue, however, is how should \nthat interest be asserted and what the need really is. And, once known, \nhow do we continue to address the human water needs, and at what cost?\n  I believe something is terribly wrong in the way the courts are \nhandling this situation because you may have to close down a river to \nhuman users without knowing the habitat needs for an endangered \nspecies. The Secretary of Interior is required to base critical habitat \ndesignation on the best scientific data available, after taking into \nconsideration the economic impact of that designation.\n  I asked Secretary Babbitt whether the Interior Department had \nsufficient data to determine the true water needs to sustain the \nsilvery minnow in the Rio Grande, and to make an accurate economic and \nsocial assessment of what a critical habitat designation would mean to \nexisting water rights owners. Babbitt testified that his department \ndoes not have sufficient information, but that it has no choice but to \nact because of federal court orders.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously agreed that the best \nscientific and commercial data available must be used to designate a \ncritical habitat. Designation of critical habitat is more appropriate \nin the context of a final recovery plan for an endangered species, \nbecause that plan must specifically address conservation needs and \ncosts of recovery. This bill will move the requirement to designate \nhabitat from the time of listing to the time of recovery plan \ndevelopment.\n  The quantity of water needed by the Rio Grande silvery minnow is \nunknown. The Fish and Wildlife Service has conceded that there has \nnever been a thorough study of the economic consequences of providing \nwater as a critical habitat for the minnow.\n  While we all want the silvery minnow and other endangered species to \nhave their critical habitat, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nBureau of Reclamation acknowledge that they do not know what the \n``critical habitat'' is or should be. Were the consequences of \ndesignation insignificant, a guesstimate might be acceptable. However, \nas noted by the Bureau of Reclamation, a designation requiring year-\nround continuous flows on a river that has never produced such flows \ncould have a ``profound effect on downstream water users.''\n  We must not try to cure the problem of endangered species with \npremature, uninformed, unscientific critical habitat designation, the \nvalidity of which has not been substantiated by adequate economic, \nscientific and social research. When the scientific facts on the \npossible side effects of a drug are unknown, the Food and Drug \nAdministration does not authorize the sale of that drug. Likewise, the \nEndangered Species Act should not permit designation of critical \nhabitat until we have scientifically determined that the habitat \ndesignation will be helpful to the species and does not impose \nunnecessary social and economic side effects.\n\n  It is abundantly clear that a complete environmental analysis of a \ncritical habitat designation is an absolute necessity. Senator Chafee, \nSenator Crapo, and I are now addressing this illogical and unworkable \ncurrent situation with this bill. I thank them for their leadership on \nthe Environment Committee. We will be working with the administration, \nand I encourage all my fellow Senators to participate in this limited, \nlocal and necessary endangered Species Act reform.\n  This bill will now tie designation of critical habitat to the \ndevelopment of recovery plans for endangered and threatened species, as \nit should be. Federal agencies should not have their hands tied by \npremature designation, forced by litigation. If we want to save \nspecies, as was and is the intent of the Endangered Species Act, then \nwe have to plan how to recover them.\n  Recovery plans require objective and measurable criteria for saving \nspecies, specific descriptions of management actions, and cost \nestimates for those actions. This bill will create a mandatory deadline \nfor developing final, comprehensive recovery plans. Critical habitat \nwill now be designated in conjunction with those plans.\n  These changes will go towards achieving the original goal of the \nEndangered Species Act. I am very proud to be a part of this historic \nlegislation, and I anticipate a bipartisan group, along with the \nadministration, feels as I do. The time has come for common-sense \nreform to the Endangered Species Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1101. A bill to provide for tort liability of firearms dealers who \ntransfer firearms in violation of Federal firearms law; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 gun dealer responsibility act of 1999\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp turn the tide of gun violence by requiring greater responsibility \nfrom those in the business of selling weapons.\n  Currently, there are over 104,000 federally licensed firearms dealers \nin the United States. While most of these dealers are responsible small \nbusiness people, recent tracing of crime-related guns by the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) has found substantial evidence that \nsome dealers are selling guns to minors, convicted felons, and others \nwho are prohibited by federal law from purchasing firearms. This direct \ndiversion of weapons from retail to illegal markets is taking place \nboth through off-the-book sales\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\nby corrupt dealers and through so-called straw purchases, when an \nineligible buyer has a friend or relative buy a firearm for him.\n  While federal law already prohibits a person from transferring a \nfirearm when a person knows that the gun will be used to commit a \ncrime, it is very difficult for victims of gun violence to seek legal \nredress from gun dealers who sell guns to those prohibited from buying \nfirearms. There is very little case law and no federal law giving \nvictims of gun violence the right to sue gun dealers who make illegal \ngun sales.\n  To remedy this situation, my legislation, the Gun Dealer \nResponsibility Act, would provide a statutory cause of action for \nvictims of gun violence against dealers whose illegal sale of a gun \ndirectly contributes to the victim's injury.\n  I believe this legislation will make unscrupulous gun dealers think \ntwice about selling weapons to minors, convicted felons, or any other \nineligible buyer, either directly or through straw purchases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Satellite Television Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n     Competition Act of 1992, Congress stated its policy of \n     promoting competition in cable services and making available \n     to the public a diversity of views and information through \n     cable television and other video media.\n       (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress stated \n     its policy of securing lower prices and higher quality \n     service for American telecommunications consumers and \n     encouraging the rapid deployment of new telecommunications \n     technologies.\n       (3) In most places throughout America, cable television \n     system operators still do not face effective competition form \n     other providers of multichannel video service.\n       (4) Absent effective competition, the market power \n     exercised by cable television operators enables them to raise \n     the price of cable service to consumers, and to control the \n     price and availability of cable programming services to other \n     multichannnel video service providers. Current Federal \n     Communications Commission rules have been inadequate in \n     constraining cable price increases.\n       (5) Direct-to-home satellite service has over 8 million \n     subscribers and constitutes the most significant competitive \n     alternative to cable television service.\n       (6) Direct-to-home satellite service currently suffers from \n     a number of statutory, regulatory, and technical barriers \n     that keep it from being an effective competitor to cable \n     television in the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (7) The most prominent of these barriers is the inability \n     to provide subscribers with local television broadcast \n     signals by satellite.\n       (8) Permitting providers of direct-to-home satellite \n     service to retransmit local television signals to their \n     subscribers would greatly enhance the ability of direct-to-\n     home satellite service providers to compete more effectively \n     in the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (9) Due to capacity limitations and in the interest of \n     providing service in as many markets as possible, providers \n     of direct-to-home satellite service, unlike cable television \n     systems, cannot at this time carry all local television \n     broadcast signals in all the local television markets they \n     seek to serve.\n       (10) It would be in the public interest for providers of \n     direct-to-home satellite service to fully comply with the \n     mandatory signal carriage rules at the earliest possible \n     date. In the interim, requiring full compliance with the \n     mandatory signal carriage rules would substantially limit the \n     ability of direct-to-home satellite service providers to \n     compete in the provision of multichannel video services and \n     would not serve the public interest.\n       (11) Maintaining the viability of free, local, over-the-air \n     television service is a matter of preeminent public interest.\n       (12) All subscribers to multichannel video services should \n     be able to receive the signal of at least one station \n     affiliated with each of the major broadcast television \n     networks.\n       (13) Millions of subscribers to direct-to-home satellite \n     service currently receive the signals of network-affiliated \n     stations not located in these subscribers' local television \n     markets. Where conventional rooftop antennas cannot provide \n     satisfactory reception of local stations, distant network \n     signals may be these subscribers' only source of network \n     television service.\n       (14) The widespread carriage of distant network stations in \n     local network affiliates' markets could harm the local \n     stations' ability to serve their local community.\n       (15) Abrupt termination of satellite carriers' provision of \n     distant network signals could have a negative impact on the \n     ability of direct-to-home satellite service to compete \n     effectively in the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (16) The public interest would be served by permitting \n     direct-to-home satellite service providers to continue \n     existing carriage of a distant network affiliate station's \n     signal where--\n       (A) there is no local network affiliate;\n       (B) the local network affiliate cannot be adequately \n     received off-air; or\n       (C) continued carriage would not harm the local network \n     station.\n\n     SEC. 203. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to promote competition in the \n     provision of multichannel video services while protecting the \n     availability of free, local, over-the-air television, \n     particularly for the 22 percent of American television \n     households that do not subscribe to any multichannel video \n     programming service.\n\n     SEC. 204.

Mr. President, I rise to give tribute to \nAdmiral Bud Nance. His recent death is a great loss to this institution \nand to this country. His list of accomplishments is long, his list of \nfriends even longer. I want to express my sympathy to his wife and \nfamily. I also want to extend that same sympathy to my friend from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Helms, who has lost a great friend and advisor.\n  I first met Bud in 1991 when he came out of a well-deserved military \nretirement and took over as Staff Director of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. I was a member of the Committee at that time. His \ncareer as a Navy Commander brought a steady hand and a cool head to the \nCommitte. I knew that when I had new staff member starting in the \nSenate I could send him or her to Bud and he would put the staff member \non the right track with his fatherly guidance. His maturity and \nmentoring role will be almost impossible to replace. I also knew that \nBud would provide me with clear-headed advice. He was plain spoken and \nhonest, and I truly admired him for that. Even after I left the \nCommittee, I often turned to Bud for assistance or guidance on a \nparticular issue, and he always gave me an honest answer. That counts \nfor a lot up here.\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Admiral's many accomplishments have been noted \npreviously by my colleagues. Although I knew of his military background \nprior to joining the Senate, Bud was too modest to let the rest of us \nin on just what he had gone through in his previous career as a Navy \nofficer. He saw active duty in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. It has \nbeen reported that during World War II he endured 162 Japanese air and \nkamikaze attacks. One of the papers reminded me of one of Bud's great \nlines when the Committee was considering whether U.S. Ambassadors \nshould receive additional benefits, including hardship pay. ``I fought \nat Iwo Jima,'' he said, ``That's hardship.''

He went on to earn an MA in international \nrelations from Oxford University on a Marshall Scholarship, where he \nand a partner won the annual Oxford Debating Championship. Mr. Glueck \nhas advised the Peruvian and Bolivian governments on economic \ncompetitiveness and from 1995-98, directed a national competitiveness \nproject for the Venezuelan government and private sector. He was also a \npro bono advisor to the Center of Middle East Competitive Strategy, an \neconomic development and regional cooperation project for the signatory \ngovernments of the Middle East peace process. Mr. Glueck has maintained \nhis long-standing commitment to public service with his involvement in \nmany community-based organizations. He tutored at a housing project as \na student in Boston, was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Political \nReview, was a founding participant of the Harvard Communications \nProject--an inter-ethnic discussion group--and started a recycling \nprogram at the Oxford University dorms.\n  Since 1965, the White House Fellowship Program has offered \noutstanding citizens across the United States the opportunity to \nparticipate in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Fellows work closely \nwith influential leaders in government and see U.S. policy in action. \nThe nearly 500 alumni of the program have gone on to become leaders in \nall fields of endeavor, fulfilling the Fellowship's mission to \nencourage active citizenship and service to the nation. This program is \nextremely competitive, choosing individuals that have demonstrated \nexcellence in community service, leadership, and professional and \nacademic achievement. It is the nation's most prestigious fellowship \nfor public service and leadership development.\n  Mr. Glueck had been assigned to the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. \nduring his White House Fellowship. In this capacity, he works on ways \nto reconcile free trade with environmental protection around the world. \nHe has helped coordinate a campaign for environmental standards of all \nOECD governments that would withhold public financing for projects in \ndeveloping countries that damage the environment. In addition to these \nresponsibilities, Mr. Glueck works to counter unfair trade practices by \nforeign governments in emerging governments and to promote sales by \nU.S. companies with environmentally-beneficial products to places in \nAsia and Latin America that can benefit from American know-how.\n  Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Jeffrey Glueck for his \naccomplishments, and especially for being a distinguished recipient of \nthe White House Fellowship. It is an honor to represent Mr. Glueck in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5772-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5772-S5773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO DR. GEORGE VERNON IRONS, SR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of \nAlabama's great native sons, Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., and to \nacknowledge the eulogy by Dr. James D. Moebes, given at his funeral \nservice on July 21, 1998.\n  A native of Demopolis, Dr. Irons was Distinguished Professor of \nHistory and Political Science, Samford University, 43 years, \nDistinguished Professor Emeritus, 22 years--a Samford record. Dr. Irons \ntaught not only history but how to make history--teaching 17 students \nwho become university presidents--more than any educator.\n  Dr. Irons was also one of Alabama's true athletic greats--the only \ndistance man--the only University of Alabama track man--ever inducted \ninto the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Mr. President, only three men \nhave been inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame on the first \nballot: Ralph Shug Jordan, Paul Bear Bryant and Dr. George Irons. He \nwas its oldest member at age 95.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Irons was truly an institution in himself. He \nfirst came to Howard College (now Samford University) in Birmingham in \n1933. When Dr. Irons reported to Howard College, the school was in \nserious financial trouble owing a half million dollars. Dr. Irons gave \na wealth of leadership, dedication and promise, sorely needed by \nHoward.\n  The rest of history. Today Samford University is the largest \nprivately endowed Baptist school in the world; largest Baptist pharmacy \nschool in the world. The only Baptist university in America with an \ninspiring domed school of divinity on its campus.\n  Born in Demopolis, Dr. Irons taught at Duke University for two years \nbefore joining Samford. Dr. Irons was a founding member of the Alabama \nHistorical Association in 1947 and attended the 50th anniversary of the \norganization last year in Birmingham. He was also a member of the \nSouthern Historical Association, Alabama Baptist Historical \nAssociation, Birmingham-Jefferson Historical Society and John H. Forney \nHistorical Society. Dr. Irons historical writings were published by \nthose organizations.\n  He was past president of the Alabama Writer's Conclave and received a \ndistinguished service award from that organization in 1977. He also \nserved as Vice President of the Alabama Academy of Science.\n  Dr. Irons was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal from \nFreedom's at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1962 and the George \nWashington Honor Award in 1963. He was Director of Samford's \nFreedom Foundation Program which won a record seventeen consecutive \nawards. The Samford yearbook, Entre Nous, was dedicated by the Samford \nstudent body to Dr. Irons, and unprecedented four times during his \nteaching career--in 1941, 1960, 1969, and 1974. He served as a member \nof the Jefferson County Judicial Commission from 1961 to 1965, \nselecting circuit judges for the largest judicial circuit in Alabama.\n\n  Dr. Irons was selected to Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the \nSouth and Southwest, Who's Who in American Education and Directory of \nAmerican Scholars.\n  Dr. Irons is a true Alabama sports legend. In the early 1920's, the \nprowess of the Alabama Crimson Tide football had ebbed. However, \nCrimson Tide track and distance star, George Irons, kept the athletic \nflame burning at the Capstone as its ``Knight of the Cinderpath.'' The \nlate Senator John Sparkman, a classmate of Irons, said, ``George Irons \nwas all we had to cheer about--if it hadn't been for Irons, athletics \nwould have been pretty boring back then.''\n  His athletic feats have been heralded by legendary Coach Paul \n``Bear'' Bryant as ``truly outstanding athletic achievements,'' Coach \nWallace Wade (three time Rose Bowl winner) as the ``greatest distance \nrunner of his day,'' and Coach Hank Crisp as ``self-made distance star \nfor the Alabama Crimson Tide.''\n  In 1923, he was described by those who knew him best--his fellow \nclassmates at the University of Alabama, including the late U.S. \nSenator John Sparkman:\n  ``George Irons: The South's greatest distance runner and a scholarly \nChristian gentleman. He is one of the true greats of Alabama athletic \nhistory, an honor man in scholarship and a record breaking athlete--\nthat is a real man--our Knight of the Cinderpath.''\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\n  [The Corolla, 1923.]\n  At his interment ceremonies Dr. Irons received full military honors. \nA 21 gun salute was fired and taps bugled in honor of his valiant \nservice in World War II, rising to the rank of Colonel, with 33 years \nactive and reserve duty.\n  It's no surprise his life had such brilliant radiance. No surprise \nhis devoted valiant service was so broad in scope. Devoted service to:\n  Family. His wife, Velma Wright Irons, a distinguished educator in her \nown right--sons, Dr. George Vernon Irons, Jr., Charlotte, North \nCarolina, a practicing cardiologist and William Lee Irons, a prominent \nBirmingham attorney. Both have left notable marks on their professions \nof medicine and law. Parenthetically, Dr. George V. Irons, Sr., and his \nson, William L. Irons, are the only father-son listing selected to the \n1998 Who's Who in America from the entire State of Alabama--yet another \nrecord for this remarkable man.\n\n  Alma Mater. The University of Alabama--where he established his name \nin crimson flame as ``one of the true greats in Alabama's famed \nathletic history.'' A Phi Beta Kappa honors student, Irons was the \nUniversity of Alabama's--the State of Alabama--nominee for the Rhodes \nScholarship to England in 1924. Since the University's founding in \n1831, only seven athletes have been selected to become a member of Phi \nBeta Kappa.\n  College. Dr. Irons was a key player in seeing Howard College grow \nfrom a financially distressed school, to the largest privately endowed \nBaptist university in the world--an internationally acclaimed \nuniversity.\n  Dr. Irons was elected by the Samford University Faculty to serve as \nGrand Marshall of all academic, graduation and commencement exercises. \nLeading the academic processionals for fifteen years, carrying the \nsilver scepter, symbol of Samford University's authority--Dr. Irons \nwore brilliant blue academic gowns and silks with dignity and \ndistinction. In 1976, the Samford University Faculty wrote in the \nUniversity's records by Resolution:\n  ``In the long history of Samford University, Dr. Irons must be ranked \nat the very top in terms of his widespread beneficent influence, the \nlove that former students evidence from him, and his impeccable \ncharacter and qualities of modesty, humility, kindness and selfless \nservice to the University.\n  [Samford University Resolution (1976)]\n  Country. Dr. Irons distinguished himself in World War II, rising to \nthe rank of Colonel, defending his Nation for a third of the 20th \nCentury in war and peace.\n  God. Dr. Irons gave tireless service to his Church as deacon, Sunday \nSchool teacher and Chairman of the Board of Deacons, and was elected as \nlifetime Deacon, Southside Baptist Church. His life reflects his depth \nof devotion in word, thought and deed--an icon of virtue--a legendary \nrole model for generations of Samford students spanning over half a \ncentury.\n  Mr. President, America salutes Dr. George Vernon Irons, Sr., as \nrecord breaking champion athlete for his alma mater, the University of \nAlabama, as Colonel, World War II, who defended his Nation for a third \nof the 20th century in war and peace, as Distinguished Professor, 43 \nyears, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, 22 years, as Grand Marshall, \nSamford University, elected by the Faculty to preside over all \ncommencement and academic exercises, as one of its most admired leaders \nin its proud history.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na true champion of public service: Clara Shin of Orange, CA. Ms. Shin \nis a former AmeriCorps program officer and is currently a distinguished \nWhite House Fellow.\n  One of the greatest gifts that Clara Shin has been endowed with is an \nappreciation and a passion for public service. Her background is filled \nwith notable accomplishments that have provided her with a sense of \ncommunity and an unfailing commitment to helping others.\n  Ms. Shin received her bachelor's degrees in physiobiopolitics and \ngovernment from Smith College and a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law \nSchool. As a law student, she worked at the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, serving as a legal intern to the Regional \nLegal Advisor for Southern Africa. She later joined AmeriCorps as its \nyoungest program officer and was responsible for developing the first \nnational grant applications for local programs seeking funding. She \nthen managed a $25 million grant portfolio for the program and \ncoordinated a service network spanning the Southwest. Ms. Shin also co-\ndesigned the $100 million community service component of a Housing and \nUrban Development initiative to revitalize severely distressed public \nhousing developments. She founded KOSOMOSE Women's Journal, a magazine \nfor Asian American women, and helped start the Tahoe-Baikal Institute, \na bi-national environmental institute in California and Siberia that \ntrains environmentalists in land and water issues.\n  As one of 17 White House Fellows, Ms. Shin has achieved the nation's \nmost prestigious fellowship for leadership development and public \nservice. Her assignment to the White House Office of the Chief of Staff \nallows her to work hand-in-hand with leaders in government on \nimmigration, race, and science and technology issues, where she \ncoordinates working group meetings, tracks and manages issues, and \nmeets with advocacy groups. For more than thirty years, White House \nFellows have carried out the program's mission to encourage active \ncitizenship and service to the nation. Ms. Shin is an individual who \nexemplifies this notion. Her efforts to serve those around her are an \ninspiration to us all.\n  Mr. President, it is with great honor that I pay tribute to Clara \nShin for her accomplishment and dedication to public service. Her \nenthusiasm for social and environmental causes is both uplifting and \nencouraging. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Clara Shin many \nmore years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5773-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5773-S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n A TIME TO RESPOND: AMERICAN LAMB INDUSTRY THREATENED BY IMPORT SURGES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the \nsurging wave of cheap, imported lamb meat that threatens to drown the \nUnited States lamb industry, an industry that has been part of our \nnation's economy since independence.\n  This surge of imports, primarily from the nations of Australia and \nNew Zealand, can be seen in the numbers collected by our federal \ninspectors.\n  In 1993, just 56 million pounds of lamb meat entered this country and \nits markets.\n  By 1997, that figure had risen to 84.4 million pounds--a shocking \nincrease of nearly 50 percent.\n  Those figures have been converted to carcass-weight equivalents, and \nare higher than those collected by the U.S. Commerce Department. But \nthat department's information shows no indication that the surge is \nslowing. In 1998, a record 70.2 million pounds--by volume--of lamb meat \nentered the domestic market.\n  Not only has the level of imports increased, but the lamb meat \nflooding the domestic market is directly competitive with products \nproduced by this nation's lamb industry.\n  In place of lamb carcasses, shipments of fresh, chilled meat--cut and \nprocessed and ready for the grocery store shelves--are displacing \ndomestically produced meat across the country.\n  At this point, importers control one-third of the United States lamb \nconsumption, a market share that makes it difficult, if not impossible, \nfor our producers to control their own destinies.\n  The importers do not participate in voluntary price reporting. In \nfact, they have actively fought a joint lamb promotion program through \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  Despite ample notice of the effect their skyrocketing levels of \nimports have had on the domestic industry, and despite ample notice \nthat the industry intended to file a case against them, the importers \nrefused to pull back voluntarily, or even discuss the situation.\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n  The lamb industry's case now rests with the President. I call on this \nAdministration to follow through with the strong and effective relief \nthis industry needs to regain its footing and confidence. With \nconfidence will come investment, and with investment, will come a more \ncompetitive industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5774-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ROSE FISHER BLASINGAME, NATIVE AMERICAN LOUISIANA ARTIST\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nspecial artist from my state whose art was recently exhibited in our \nnation's capital. She is Rose Fisher Blasingame, a member of the Jena \nBand of Choctaw who are located in LaSalle Parish in Jena, Louisiana. \nRose Fisher Blasingame was born and raised in Central Louisiana, and is \nmarried to Micah Basingame and has four children. Her artwork is \nbasketry, an art she is attempting to revive since its loss from their \ncommunity after the time of her great-great Aunt Mary Lewis who \npracticed the craft until she died in the early 1930's. From hearing \nstories from her family and elders, and seeing some of her aunt's work, \nshe decided to try to learn this art-craft and bring back this lost \ntradition. She should be very proud that she has accomplished this \ngoal. She also makes blow guns, arrow quivers, and tans deer hides. She \nshares the task of making china berry necklaces with her elders who she \nalso joins in the tradition of passing down stories about creation, \nmedicinal plants and home remedies. Her new goal, which she shares with \nher elders, is to attempt to bring back the Choctaw language.\n  Her baskets have been based on authentic Choctaw artifacts in the \nSmithsonian. They are splendid works of art which have many complex \nweaves of light and dark involving a number of incredible shapes and \ntextures. One of her pieces which I saw was composed of an inside weave \nwhich was the mirror image of the exterior weave done in reversal \ncontrast of light and dark.\n  She is a beneficiary of a grant from the Louisiana Arts Endowment \nProgram. By recognizing her artwork, I also wish to honor all Choctaw \ntribes and culture. The Choctaw call themselves pasfalaya, which means \n``long hair.'' They are of the Muskhogean language group. The Choctaw \nwere natives of Mississippi and Alabama, making them one of Louisiana's \nimmigrant tribes. After Spain took control of Louisiana in 1763, the \nSpanish government, seeking a buffer between themselves and the \nEnglish, invited the tribes from east of the Mississippi River into \nLouisiana. Small groups of Choctaw, including the Jena band, took them \nup on this offer, and there were several Choctaw settlements throughout \nnorth and central Louisiana.\n  Louisiana boasts of many Choctaw place names. Early explorers used \nChoctaw guides to lead them to the new territories west of the \nMississippi. The names given to the rivers, streams and other landmarks \nhave remained as they were named hundreds of years ago. Some of these \nnames include Atchafalaya (long river), Bogue Chitto (big creek), \nCatahoula (beloved lake), Manchac (rear entrance), and Pontchatoula \n(hanging hair or Spanish moss). It is also the Choctaw who taught the \nFrench and Spanish settlers the use of file' seasoning which is so \nwidely used even today in the gumbo recipes of our unique Louisiana \ncuisine.\n  Clearly, Rose Fisher Blasingame knows that she holds the rare coin of \nher culture which should be cherished and treasured. Imagine the \nremarkable effort she has undertaken along with her tribe to re-\nestablish their language. In this ambitious effort, Rose has sent her \ndaughter Anna Barber to attend the Choctaw school in Mississippi in \nthat branch of their tribe. I understand there are about 12 Choctaws \nspeakers left among the Jena Choctaw, and the tribe is planning a \ncomputer language program which will teach adults as well as children, \nbut aimed specifically at the kids. As always, their hope for the \nfuture will be carried by their children.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this moment to recognize the work of \nthis remarkable artist and woman, and the Choctaw tribe and culture of \nLouisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5774-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOHN TIEN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to salute the work and \ndedication of Major John Tien, a distinguished White House Fellow from \nLong Beach, CA.\n  Major Tien was chosen as one of the selected few to participate in \nthe distinguished 1998-99 White House Fellowship Program. Since 1965, \nthe program has offered outstanding individuals, like Major Tien, the \nopportunity to apply their considerable talents to public service. Past \nU.S. Army White House Fellow alumni, including former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff General Colin L. Powell, have emerged as great \nmilitary leaders, and I have no doubt that Major Tien will be \nsuccessful in his future endeavors.\n  As a White House Fellow, Major Tien has been assigned to the Office \nof the U.S. Trade Representative. He conducts research on consumer, \nlabor, and environmental groups in an effort to educate the American \npublic about the benefits of international trade. Other \nresponsibilities include coordinating partnerships with important \nbusiness groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe Business Round Table, and the President's Export Council, to \ndevelop trade education ideas and advance a free trade agenda. He is a \nmember of the lead team for planning the Third Ministerial Conference \nof the World Trade Organization in Seattle, Washington. He is also a \nmember of the steel import crisis response team, where he is \nresponsible for drafting reports for the Congressional Steel Caucus. \nMajor Tien is the special assistant to the Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative on all WTO matters.\n  Major Tien was an assistant professor in the Department of Social \nSciences at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He received his \nbachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from West Point, where he was \nthe top-ranked military cadet in his class. He later attended Oxford \nUniversity as a Rhodes Scholar. As a veteran of Operation Desert Storm, \nhe was among the first soldiers to cross the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border. \nHe has commanded an M1A1 main battle tank company and a headquarters \ncompany, and has served as the chief logistics officer for a thousand-\nsoldier brigade. Additionally, Major Tien has successfully balanced \nseveral extracurricular activities with his military commitments. For \nexample, he has served as a volunteer tutor for inner-city elementary \nand high school youth, as a co-organizer of the New York, Orange County \nSpecial Olympics and as a youth league soccer and baseball coach.\n  Mr. President, the importance of the public service should be \nrecognized, and Major Tien stands as an especially admirable role model \nin this regard. For his efforts, and in recognition of the well-\ndeserved honor of serving as a White House Fellow, I am privileged to \ncommend and pay tribute to Major John Tien.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/20/senate-section/article/S5774-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate considers legislation that \nwill help provide for greater consumer choice and competition in \ntelevision services, S. 247, ``The Satellite Home Viewers Improvements \nAct of 1999.'' The bill before us is a model of bipartisanship and \ncross-Committee cooperation. The cosponsors of this bill include, first \nand foremost, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, with whom I have worked closely on this \nlegislation; the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the minority \nleader, Senator Daschle; the chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee, Senators DeWine and Kohl; \nand the distinguished chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, \nSenator McCain. We have all worked together with many others of our \ncolleagues to bring this important legislation along on behalf of our \nconstituents.\n  The options consumers have for viewing television entertainment have \nvastly increased since that fateful day in September 1927 when \ntelevision inventor and Utah native Philo T. Farnsworth, together with \nhis wife and colleagues, viewed the first television transmission in \nthe Farnsworth's home workshop: a single black line rotated from \nvertical to horizontal. Both the forms of entertainment and the \ntechnologies for delivering that entertainment have proliferated over \nthe 70 years since that day. In the 1940s and 50s, televisions began \narriving in an increasing number of homes to pick up entertainment \nbeing broadcast into a growing number of cities and towns.\n  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, cable television began offering \ncommunities more television choices by initially providing community \nantenna systems for receiving broadcast television signals, and later \nby offering new created-for-cable entertainment. The development of \ncable television made dramatic strides with the enactment of the cable \ncompulsory license in 1976, providing an efficient way of clearing \ncopyright rights for the retransmission of broadcast signals over cable \nsystems.\n  In the 1980s, television viewers began to be able to receive \ntelevision entertainment with their own home satellite equipment, and \nthe enactment of the Satellite Home Viewer Act in 1988 helped develop a \nsystem of providing options for television service to Americans who \nlived in areas too remote to receive television signals over the air or \nvia cable.\n  Much has changed since the original Satellite Home Viewer Act was \nadopted in 1988. The Satellite Home Viewer Act was originally intended \nto ensure that households that could not get television in any other \nway, traditionally provided through broadcast or cable, would be able \nto get television signals via satellite. The market and the satellite \nindustry has changed substantially since 1988. Many of the difficulties \nand controversies associated with the satellite license have been at \nleast partly a product of the satellite business attempting to move \nfrom a predominately need-based rural niche service to a full service \nvideo delivery competitor in all markets, urban and rural.\n\n  Now, many market advocates both in and out of Congress are looking to \nsatellite carriers to compete directly with cable companies for \nviewership, because we believe that an increasingly competitive market \nis better for consumers both in terms of cost and the diversity of \nprogramming available. The bill we consider today will move us toward \nthat kind of robust competition.\n  In short, this bill is focused on changes that we can make this year \nto move the satellite television industry to the next level, making it \na full competitor in the multi-channel video delivery market. It has \nbeen said time and again that a major, and perhaps\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\nthe biggest, impediment to satellite's ability to be a strong \ncompetitor to cable is its current inability to provide local broadcast \nsignals to its subscribers. (See, e.g., Business Week (22 Dec. 1997) p. \n84.) In fact, marketing research by one firm found that 86 percent of \nthose consumers who consider subscribing to satellite but ultimately do \nnot do so, decide against satellite service because the local \ntelevision signals are not available. (U.S. Satellite Broadcasting, \n``Research Summary for Thomson Electronics,'' Aug. 1997, p. 6.) This \nproblem has been partly technological and partly legal.\n  As we speak, the technological hurdles to satellite retransmission of \nlocal broadcast signals are being lowered substantially. Emerging \ntechnology is not enabling the satellite industry to begin to offer \ntelevision viewers their own local programming of news, weather, \nsports, and entertainment, with digital quality picture and sound. This \nwill mean that viewers in the remoter areas of my large home state of \nUtah will be able to watch television programming originating in Salt \nLake City, rather than New York or California. In fact, one satellite \ncarrier is already providing such a service in Utah.\n  Today, with this bill, we hope to remove the legal impediments to use \nof this emerging technology to make local retransmission of broadcast \nsignals a reality for all subscribers. The most important result will \nbe that the constituents of all my colleagues will finally have a \nchoice for full service multi-channel video programming: They will be \nable to choose cable or one of a number of satellite carriers. This \nshould foster an environment of proliferating choice and lowered \nprices, all to the benefit of consumers, our constituents.\n  To that end, the ``Satellite Home Viewer Improvements Act'' makes the \nfollowing changes in the copyright law governing satellite television \ntransmissions:\n  It creates a new copyright license which allows satellite carriers to \nretransmit a local television station to households and businesses \nthroughout that station's local market, just as cable does, and sets a \nzero copyright rate for providing this service.\n  It extends the satellite compulsory licenses for both local and \ndistant signals, which are now set to expire at the end of the year, \nuntil 2004.\n  It cuts the copyright rates paid for distant signals by 30 or 45 \npercent, depending on the type of signal.\n  It allows consumers to switch from cable to satellite service for \nnetwork signals without waiting 90-day period now required in the law.\n  It allows for a national Public Broadcasting Service satellite feed.\n  Many of my colleagues in this Chamber will recognize this legislation \nas substantively identical to a bill reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee last year. It passed the Judiciary Committee this \nyear again with unanimous support. I am pleased with the degree of \ncooperation and consensus we have been able to forge with respect to \nthis legislation, and I am pleased that we have been able to bring this \nbill before the Senate for swift consideration and approval.\n  Let me explain how we will proceed. As I have indicated earlier, the \nbill we have before us is the copyright portion of a comprehensive \nreform package crafted in conjunction with our colleagues on the \nCommerce Committee. As the Judiciary Committee has moved forward with \nconsideration of the copyright legislation embodied in S. 247, the \nCommerce Committee proceeded simultaneously to consider separate \nlegislation introduced by Chairman McCain, S. 303, to address related \ncommunications amendments, including important ares such as the must-\ncarry and retransmission consent requirements for satellite carriers \nupon which the copyright licenses will be conditioned, and the FCC's \ndistant television signal eligibility process. It is our joint \nintention to combine our respective work product as two titles of the \nsame bill in a way that will clearly delineate the work product of each \ncommittee, but combine them in the seamless whole necessary to make the \nlicenses work for consumers and the affected industries. To do that, \nChairman McCain will today offer the text of his committee's companion \nlegislation as an amendment to the Judiciary Committee's underlying \ncopyright bill. Upon adoption of this amendment, we will offer a \nmanager's package of technical and conforming amendments to more fully \nmeld the bills into a comprehensive, pro-consumer package that we can \noffer to the House for their consideration in a conference.\n  I am glad we are taking up this legislation today. We need to act \nquickly on this legislation. The Satellite Home Viewer Act sunsets at \nthe end of this year, placing at risk the service of many of the 11 \nmillion satellite subscribers nationwide. Many of our constituents are \nconfused about the status of satellite service in February and April to \nas many as 2.5 million subscribers nationally who have been adjudged \nineligible for distant signal service under current law. The granting \nof the local license, together with some resolution of the eligibility \nrules for distant signals and a more consumer-friendly process, can \nhelp bring clarity to these consumers, and greater competition in price \nand service for all subscription television viewers.\n  I again thank the majority leader for his interest in and leadership \nwith respect to these issues, and the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee for his collegiality and cooperation in this process. I also \nthank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who have worked on this \nlegislation. This bill is a product of a bipartisan effort with \nSenators Leahy, DeWine, and Kohl, and I have been pleased to work \nclosely with each of them every step of the way. Finally, I thank the \nRegister of Copyrights, Ms. Marybeth Peters, and Bill Roberts of her \nstaff in particular, for their assistance and expertise throughout this \nprocess. The Senate process has been a more informed one, and the \nproduct of our efforts more sound as a result of their advice and \nrecommendations.\n  In closing, I look forward to our consideration of this important \nlegislation today, and to continued collaboration with my colleagues to \nhelp hasten more vigorous competition in the television delivery market \nand the ever-widening consumer choice that will follow it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is able \nto pass the Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act. This \nbill will provide viewers with more choices and will greatly increase \ncompetition regarding network and other video programming.\n  For some time, I have been concerned about the lack of competition \nwith cable TV and escalating cable rates. This bill will allow \nsatellite TV providers to compete directly with cable and will give \nconsumers a choice. It also avoids needless cutoffs of satellite TV \nservice and protects local TV affiliates.\n  The Judiciary Committee had a full committee hearing on these \nsatellite issues on November 12, 1997, and Chairman Hatch and I agreed \nto work together on this bill. On March 5, 1998, the Hatch-Leahy bill, \nS. 1720, was introduced and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously on October 1, 1998. It permits local TV signals, as opposed \nto distant out-of-State networks signals, to be offered to viewers via \nsatellite; increase competition between cable and satellite TV \nproviders; and provide more PBS programming by also offering a national \nfeed as well as local programming; and reduce rates charged to \nconsumers.\n  We have been racing against the clock because court orders have \nrequired the cutoffs of distant CBS and Fox television signals to over \na million households in the U.S.\n  Under a preliminary injunction, satellite service to thousands of \nhouseholds in Vermont and other states was to be terminated on October \n8, 1998, for CBS and Fox distant network signals for households signed \nup after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed.\n  This bill will allow satellite TV to operate just like cable TV with \nlocal channels, movies, local weather, sports, CNN, news, \nsuperstations, and the like. It allows for local TV stations to be \nreceived over satellite, permanently, and could reduce satellite rates.\n  It ends the cable subscriber 90-day waiting period for those wanting \nto switch from cable to satellite--which has been a needless barrier to \ncompetition.\n  The bill extends distant network service to allow for a phase-in to \nlocal-\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\ninto-local TV service and creates a national PBS feed, and also will \noffer the local PBS.\n  It also restores all lost distant stations, if the satellite provider \nis willing to restore service, and delays cutoffs of all other distant \nsignals until December 31 of this year and only for a much smaller \nnumber of dish owners.\n  Ultimately, in 2002, the bill will impose ``must carry'' rules on \nsatellite providers just like the ``must carry'' rules for cable TV \nwhich permits a phase-in of local-to-local service.\n  The chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator DeWine, and the \nranking member, Senator Kohl, also worked hard on this issue.\n  It is absurd that home dish owners--whether they live in Vermont, \nUtah or California--have to watch network stations imported from \ndistant states.\n  This committee has worked together to protect the local broadcast \nsystem and to provide the satellite industry with a way to compete with \ncable.\n  Cable TV now offers a full range of local programming as well as \nprogramming regarding sports, politics, national weather, education, \nand a range of movies.\n  Yet, cable rates keep increasing--I want satellite TV to directly \ncompete with cable TV. The only way they can do that is to be able to \noffer local TV stations.\n  We heard testimony in 1997 and 1998 that the major reason consumers \ndo not sign up for satellite service is that they cannot get local \nprogramming. I want satellite carriers to be able to offer the full \nrange of local programming.\n  We should be encouraging this so-called ``local-into-local'' service. \nLocal broadcast stations contribute to our sense of community.\n  We should be encouraging competition through local-into-local \nservice. Instead, the current policy fosters confusion-into-more-\nconfusion service and lots of litigation.\n  By striking a burdensome and flawed limitation on satellite \nproviders, we will be prescribing fairness for dish owners and \ninjecting some much-needed competition into the television market.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues at conference.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 372\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to enhance the \n  ability of direct broadcast satellite and other multichannel video \nproviders to compete effectively with cable television systems, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I want to engage my good friend from \nArizona, our chairman of the Commerce Committee, in a colloquy \nconcerning an issue I raised in committee on signal reception \nstandards.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be happy to accommodate the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, consumers who live in small and rural \nmarkets deserve access to network television service via satellite and \nthe competition with cable it provides just as much as their fellow \ncitizens living in urban markets. The local-into-local\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\nservice that will be made possible by the legislation we are \nconsidering today will provide this much-needed service to consumers, \nthereby enhancing competition to cable in many urban markets. \nUnfortunately, because local-into-local will not be available in small \nand rural markets in the immediate future, consumers who live there \nmust depend on satellite delivery of network signals from distant \nmarkets. Recent court-imposed limitations on the delivery of distant \nnetwork signals, however, will affect households that cannot receive \nviewable local network signals over-the-air.\n  To correct this imbalance, we should grant the Federal Communications \nCommission the authority to set a modern television signal reception \nstandard. If the new signal reception standard is set at a level that \nwill provide consumers with a viewable picture, then the new standard \nwill produce a more realistic and accurate separation between \n``served'' and ``unserved'' households for purposes of SHVA. In \naddition, such a standard would provide consumers who do not qualify to \nreceive distant network signals with a reasonable expectation that, if \nthey go to the trouble and expense of installing a ``conventional'' \nrooftop antenna, they will be able to receive a television picture they \ncan actually watch.\n  To make application of the new standard more consumer friendly, I \nalso urge that we give the FCC the authority to establish the most \naccurate point-to-point predictive model. Such a model would enable a \nconsumer to know whether or not he or she will be able to receive a \nsignal of the strength established by the rulemaking quickly, \naccurately, and without expensive testing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think my colleague for his work on this very sensitive \nbut important subject. The senator is absolutely correct. With the \npassage of this bill, the issue of setting an appropriate signal \nreception standard and predictive model is more important than ever. \nConsumers are frustrated today by the current situation with distant \nnetwork signals because they are being told by local broadcasters they \nmust receive their local signals over-the-air, though in many \ncases traditional antennas do not provide an adequate picture. If the \nlaw tells consumers they must get a local signal but they aren't able \nto get a decent picture, what alternative does a consumer have? \nUnfortunately, we are dealing here with an antiquated law that needs \nupdating for the twenty first century.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. If this law isn't revised we can expect more consumer \nconfusion and frustration. The ``Grade B'' standard that is used as the \nsignal reception standard today measures the amount of signal intensity \nthat a consumer must receive at his or her rooftop antenna to produce \nwhat is considered an ``acceptable'' television picture. Unfortunately, \nthis was a determination made in 1952. Consumer expectations of what \nconstitutes an ``acceptable'' picture have increased substantially in \nthe past 50 years. What constituted an acceptable picture to a focus \ngroup in 1951 watching black and white television would almost \ncertainly not be a picture that modern consumers would want to watch on \nstate-of-the-art color sets.\n  In addition, interference has increased substantially since the early \n1950's. Background noise produced by aircraft, automobile and truck \ntraffic, power lines, and the like, and electronic interference \nproduced by computers, cell phones, and other electronic equipment \ninterfere with signal propagation. Because of this increased \ninterference, consumers need higher signal intensity in order to \nreceive a viewable television picture.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I concur with your concerns over this situation. If we \nare going to enforce the law and enforce a standard, we need to make \nsure that consumers can rely on the standard. Today, that is clearly \nnot the case. In addition, since the purpose of the bill before us \ntoday is to give satellite television the tools it needs to become more \nviable competitors to cable, we have to evaluate each of the ways in \nwhich cable and satellite are compared. For example, the viewing \nstandard that you discussed is based on three ``grades'' of television \npicture--``fine,'' ``good,'' and ``acceptable,'' in descending order of \nquality. Currently, cable viewing standards are based on a ``good'' \npicture. Satellite's standard is ``acceptable,'' which is a grade below \n``good.'' Why wouldn't we want the reception standards between these \ntwo competing industries to be equivalent? If we are to provide true \ncompetition between cable and satellite, an increase of the standard \nand a corresponding increase in signal intensity model is necessary.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Even though the language mandating a new signal standard \nand predictive model was not adopted in committee, I think the chairman \nwould agree that such language needs to be incorporated into a final \nmeasure. Many of my colleagues have been stunned to learn of the crazy \ncircumstance that is facing many of our rural constituents as they \nattempt to get a network signal that they can actually watch. We \nshouldn's be making it more difficult for them to get this valuable \nservice.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I can assure my colleague from Nevada, we will attempt to \naddress this in conference and rectify a very troubling inconsistency \nin the law.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 247, the Satellite \nHome Viewers Improvement Act. This legislation represents a first step \ntowards providing a viable competitor to cable in the multichannel \nvideo programming marketplace. Significantly, S. 247 permits direct-to-\nhome satellite providers to transmit local broadcast signals into local \nmarkets, and eliminates the 90 day waiting period for existing cable \nsubscribers who wish to switch to satellite service. These critical \nchanges in the law will substantially help satellite providers compete \nwith their cable counterparts.\n  I also support, for the most part, the inclusion in S. 247 of the \nfloor amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nAmendment No. 372. This amendment is identical to the text of the \ncommittee reported amendment to S. 303, the Satellite Television Act of \n1999, which was reported favorably by the Senate Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee, Senate Report No. 106-51. With one \nreservation, which I will explain shortly, I am pleased that the work \nproduct of the Commerce Committee will be included in the Satellite \nHome Viewers Improvement Act, S. 247, as passed by the Senate.\n  As reported by our committee, S. 303 complements S. 247 by removing \nadditional statutory impediments that thwart the ability of direct-to-\nhome satellite service providers to compete with cable television. S. \n303 authorizes direct-to-home satellite service providers to offer \ntheir subscribers local television station broadcasts, but requires \nthose providers to comply with the must-carry and retransmission \nconsent rules that apply to cable television operators. In addition, S. \n303 requires the Federal Communications Commission to use the \nIndividual Location Longely-Rice Methodology to better determine who \nshould be receiving distant network signals and who should not. \nFinally, the legislation requires the FCC to implement a waiver process \nto give consumers with unsatisfactory local television reception a \ntimely process in which to have their concerns addressed.\n  While I support moving S. 247, as amended, out of the Senate, I must \nnote one concern with the legislation. I oppose provisions in S. 303 \nthat sanction the illegal behavior of direct broadcast satellite \nservice providers. Those provisions permanently grandfathered the \ntransmission of distant network signals to subscribers residing outside \nof their local station's Grade A contour, but within the Grade B \ncontour, regardless of whether those subscribers are actually able to \nreceive the signals of their local stations. My opposition to this \napproach is explained in greater detail in the minority views filed \nwith the Committee Report. In brief, I will say that the provisions I \nopposed put the legislation squarely in the position of sanctioning \nillegal behavior. As a law and order man, that is not an approach I am \nwilling to support.\n  Otherwise, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has been able to \nact so quickly on this important issue. By passing legislation so early \nin the 106th Congress, we have gone a long way toward ensuring greater \ncompetition in the video programming marketplace.\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation \nbecause it will increase competition between satellite and cable. \nSenators McCain, Hatch, Leahy, Hollings, DeWine and others deserve \ncredit for moving this measure so quickly this term, especially when we \ncame so close last year.\n  Mr. President, when the Judiciary and Commerce bills are combined as \none, it creates a good, comprehensive measure. Satellite companies will \nfinally be allowed to legally broadcast local stations to local \nviewers--so-called ``local into local.'' The strange anomaly that \nrestricted satellite from providing local signals will be a thing of \nthe past. And to be balanced, satellite companies will also be subject \nto ``must-carry'' obligations, just like cable. This bill will also \nreduce the royalty fees for those local signals to a level closer to \nthat paid by cable companies. All of this moves us towards parity \nbetween satellite and cable, and it is a huge step forward for \nconsumers. Let me tell you why.\n  Increased competition will discipline the cable marketplace which, in \nturn, will create lower prices, increased choice, and wider \navailability of television programming for all Americans, no matter how \nremote. And we do this in the best way possible, by promoting \ncompetition, not increasing regulation. Moreover, it won't be at the \nexpense of our local television stations, which provide a valuable \ncommunity benefit in the form of local news, weather, sports and \nvarious forms of public service.\n  One of the hardest questions to address, of course, is which viewers \nshould be entitled to receive ``distant network'' signals, especially \nin rural states like mine. Authorizing ``local into local'' is a \ncrucial first step and, eventually, when technology advances and more \nsatellites are launched, we will see ``local into local'' almost \neverywhere. So, this bill goes a long way to ensure that every viewer \nwill receive one signal of each of the major television networks--this \nis a marked improvement over the current situation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nmeasure which will permit satellite companies to compete on a more \nlevel playing field with cable. We have our work cut out for us at \nconference because the House version is quite different from ours. But \nthere is no excuse for not enacting this pro-competition, pro-consumer \nlegislation this year. Let's get to conference and get this bill done.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, and that the Senate proceed to Calendar \nNo. 93, H.R. 1554. I further ask unanimous consent that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 247, as amended, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that \nany statements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate place in \nthe Record. I finally ask unanimous consent that S. 247 then be placed \nback on the Calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RESERVATION.\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol is subject to the reservation, which \n     shall be included in the United States instrument of \n     ratification and shall be binding upon the President, that \n     the United States reserves the right to use other devices (as \n     defined in Article 2(5) of the Amended Mines Protocol) to \n     destroy any stock of food or drink that is judged likely to \n     be used by an enemy military force, if due precautions are \n     taken for the safety of the civilian population.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNDERSTANDINGS.\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol is subject to the following \n     understandings, which shall be included in the United States \n     instrument of ratification and shall be binding upon the \n     President:\n       (1) United States Compliance.--The United States \n     understands that--\n       (A) any decision by any military commander, military \n     personnel, or any other person responsible for planning, \n     authorizing, or executing military action shall only be \n     judged on the basis of that person's assessment of the \n     information reasonably available to the person at the time \n     the person planned, authorized, or executed the action under \n     review, and shall not be judged on the basis of information \n     that comes to light after the action under review was taken; \n     and\n       (B) Article 14 of the Amended Mines Protocol (insofar as it \n     relates to penal sanctions) shall apply only in a situation \n     in which an individual--\n       (i) knew, or should have known, that his action was \n     prohibited under the Amended Mines Protocol;\n       (ii) intended to kill or cause serious injury to a \n     civilian; and\n       (iii) knew or should have known, that the person he \n     intended to kill or cause serious injury was a civilian.\n       (2) Effective Exclusion.--The United States understands \n     that, for the purposes of Article 5(6)(b) of the Amended \n     Mines Protocol, the maintenance of observation over avenues \n     of approach where mines subject to that Article are deployed \n     constitutes one acceptable form of monitoring to ensure the \n     effective exclusion of civilians.\n       (3) Historic Monuments.--The United States understands that \n     Article 7(1)(i) of the Amended Mines Protocol refers only to \n     a limited class of objects that, because of their clearly \n     recognizable characteristics and because of their widely \n     recognized importance, constitute a part of the cultural or \n     spiritual heritage of peoples.\n       (4) Legitimate Military Objectives.--The United States \n     understands that an area of land itself can be a legitimate \n     military objective for the purpose of the use of landmines, \n     if its neutralization or denial, in the circumstances \n     applicable at the time, offers a military advantage.\n       (5) Peace Treaties.--The United States understands that the \n     allocation of responsibilities for landmines in Article \n     5(2)(b) of the Amended Mines Protocol does not preclude \n     agreement, in connection with peace treaties or similar \n     arrangements, to allocate responsibilities under that Article \n     in a manner that respects the essential spirit and purpose of \n     the Article.\n       (6) Booby-Traps and Other Devices.--For the purposes of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol, the United States understands that--\n       (A) the prohibition contained in Article 7(2) of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol does not preclude the expedient \n     adaptation or adaptation in advance of other objects for use \n     as booby-traps or other devices;\n       (B) a trip-wired hand grenade shall be considered a \n     ``booby-trap'' under Article 2(4) of the Amended Mines \n     Protocol and shall not be considered a ``mine'' or an ``anti-\n     personnel mine'' under Article 2(1) or Article 2(3), \n     respectively; and\n       (C) none of the provisions of the Amended Mines Protocol, \n     including Article 2(5), applies to hand grenades other than \n     trip-wired hand grenades.\n       (7) Non-Lethal Capabilities.--The United States understands \n     that nothing in the Amended Mines Protocol may be construed \n     as restricting or affecting in any way non-lethal weapon \n     technology that is designed to temporarily disable, stun, \n     signal the presence of a person, or operate in any other \n     fashion, but not to cause permanent incapacity.\n       (8) International Tribunal Jurisdiction.--The United States \n     understands that the provisions of Article 14 of the Amended \n     Mines Protocol relating to penal sanctions refer to measures \n     by the authorities of States Parties to the Protocol and do \n     not authorize the trial of any person before an international \n     criminal tribunal. The United States shall not recognize the \n     jurisdiction of any international tribunal to prosecute a \n     United States citizen for a violation of the Protocol or the \n     Convention on Conventional Weapons.\n       (9) Technical Cooperation and Assistance. The United States \n     understands that--\n       (A) no provision of the Protocol may be construed as \n     affecting the discretion of the United States to refuse \n     assistance or to restrict or deny permission for the export \n     of equipment, material, or scientific or technological \n     information for any reason; and\n       (B) the Amended Mines Protocol may not be used as a pretext \n     for the transfer of weapons technology or the provision of \n     assistance to the military mining or military counter-mining \n     capabilities of a State Party to the Protocol.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONDITIONS.\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol is subject to the following \n     conditions, which shall be binding upon the President:\n       (1) Pursuit deterrent munition.--\n       (A) Understanding.--The Senate understands that nothing in \n     the Amended Mines Protocol restricts the possession or use of \n     the Pursuit Deterrent Munition, which is in compliance with \n     the provisions in the Technical Annex.\n       (B) Certification.--Prior to deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives that the Pursuit Deterrent Munition shall \n     continue to remain available for use by the United States \n     Armed Forces at least until January 1, 2003, unless an \n     effective alternative to the munition becomes available.\n       (C) Effective alternative defined.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (B), the term ``effective alternative'' does not \n     mean a tactic or operational concept in and of itself.\n       (2) Humanitarian demining assistance.--The Senate makes the \n     following findings:\n       (A) United states efforts.--The United States contributes \n     more than any other country to the worldwide humanitarian \n     demining efforts, having expended more than $153,000,000 on \n     such efforts since 1993.\n       (B) Development of detection and clearing technology.--The \n     Department of Defense has undertaken a program to develop \n     improved mine detection and clearing technology and has \n     shared this improved technology with the international \n     community.\n       (C) Expansion of united states humanitarian demining \n     programs.--The Department of Defense and the Department of \n     State have expanded their humanitarian demining programs to \n     train and assist the personnel of other countries in \n     developing effective demining programs.\n       (3) Limitation on the scale of assessment.--\n       (A) Limitation on assessment for cost of implementation.--\n     Notwithstanding any provision of the Amended Mines Protocol, \n     and subject to the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C), \n     the portion of the United States annual assessed contribution \n     for activities associated with any conference held pursuant \n     to Article 13 of the Amended Mines Protocol may not exceed \n     $1,000,000.\n       (B) Recalculation of limitation.--\n       (i) In general.--On January 1, 2000, and at 3-year \n     intervals thereafter, the Administrator of General Services \n     shall prescribe an amount that shall apply in lieu of the \n     amount specified in subparagraph (A) and that shall be \n     determined by adjusting the last amount applicable under that \n     subparagraph to reflect the percentage increase by which the \n     Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year exceeds \n     the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year three years \n     previously.\n       (ii) Consumer price index defined.--In this subparagraph, \n     the term ``Consumer Price Index'' means the last Consumer \n     Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the \n     Department of Labor.\n       (C) Additional contributions requiring congressional \n     approval.--\n       (i) Authority.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     President may furnish additional contributions for activities \n     associated with any conference held pursuant to Article 13 of \n     the Amended Mines protocol which would otherwise be \n     prohibited under subparagraph (A) if--\n       (I) the President determines and certifies in writing to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress that the failure to \n     make such contributions would seriously affect the national \n     interest of the United States; and\n       (II) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the \n     certification of the President under subclause (I).\n       (ii) Statement of reasons.--Any certification made under \n     clause (i) shall be accompanied by a detailed statement \n     setting forth the specific reasons therefor and the specific \n     activities associated with any conference held pursuant to \n     Article 13 of the Amended Mines Protocol to which the \n     additional contributions would be applied.\n       (4) United states authority for technical cooperation and \n     assistance.--Notwithstanding any provision of the Amended \n     Mines Protocol, no funds may be drawn from the Treasury of \n     the United States for any payment or assistance (including \n     the transfer of in-kind items) under Article 11 or Article \n     13(3)(d) of the Amended Mines Protocol without statutory \n     authorization and appropriation by United States law.\n       (5) Future negotiation of withdrawal clause.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that, in negotiations on any treaty \n     containing an arms control provision, United States \n     negotiators should not agree to any provision that would have \n     the effect of prohibiting the United States from withdrawing \n     from the arms control provisions of that treaty in a timely \n     fashion in the event that the supreme national interests of \n     the United States have been jeopardized.\n       (6) Land mine alternatives.--Prior to the deposit of the \n     United States instrument of\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\n     ratification, the President shall certify to Congress that--\n       (A) the President, in pursuing alternatives to United \n     States anti-personnel mines or mixed anti-tank systems, will \n     not limit the types of alternatives to be considered on the \n     basis of any criteria other than those specified in \n     subparagraph (B); and\n       (B) in pursuit of alternatives to United States anti-\n     personnel mines, or mixed anti-tank systems, the United \n     States shall seek to identify, adapt, modify, or otherwise \n     develop only those technologies that--\n       (i) are intended to provide military effectiveness \n     equivalent to that provided by the relevant anti-personnel \n     mine, or mixed anti-tank system; and\n       (ii) would be affordable.\n       (7) Certification with regard to international tribunals.--\n     Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of \n     ratification, the President shall certify to Congress that, \n     with respect to the Amended Mines Protocol, the Convention on \n     Conventional Weapons, or any future protocol or amendment \n     thereto, the United States shall not recognize the \n     jurisdiction of any international tribunal over the United \n     States or any of its citizens.\n       (8) Tactics and operational concepts.--It is the sense of \n     the Senate that development, adaptation, or modification of \n     an existing or new tactic or operational concept, in and of \n     itself, is unlikely to constitute an acceptable alternative \n     to anti-personnel mines or mixed anti-tank systems.\n       (9) Funding regarding the international humanitarian \n     crisis.--The Senate finds that--\n       (A) the grave international humanitarian crisis associated \n     with anti-personnel mines has been created by the use of \n     mines that do not meet or exceed the specifications on \n     detectability, self-destruction, and self-deactivation \n     contained in the Technical Annex to the Amended Mines \n     Protocol; and\n       (B) United States mines that do meet such specifications \n     have not contributed to this problem.\n       (10) Approval of modifications.--The Senate reaffirms the \n     principle that any amendment or modification to the Amended \n     Mines Protocol other than an amendment or modification solely \n     of a minor technical or administrative nature shall enter \n     into force with respect to the United States only pursuant to \n     the treaty-making power of the President, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (11) Further arms reductions obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval an \n     international agreement that would obligate the United States \n     to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the \n     United States in a militarily significant manner only \n     pursuant to the treaty-making power as set forth in Article \n     II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       (12) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally-based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and condition (8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the CFE Flank Document, \n     approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (13) Primacy of the united states constitution.--Nothing in \n     the Amended Mines Protocol requires or authorizes the \n     enactment of legislation, or the taking of any other action, \n     by the United States that is prohibited by the Constitution \n     of the United States, as interpreted by the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this resolution:\n       (1) Amended mines protocol or protocol.--The terms \n     ``Amended Mines Protocol'' and ``Protocol'' mean the Amended \n     Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, \n     Booby-Traps and Other Devices, together with its Technical \n     Annex, as adopted at Geneva on May 3, 1996 (contained in \n     Senate Treaty Document 105-1).\n       (2) CFE flank document.--The term ``CFE Flank Document'' \n     means the Document Agreed Among the States Parties to the \n     Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) of \n     November 19, 1990, done at Vienna on May 31, 1996 (Treaty \n     Document 105-95).\n       (3) Convention on conventional weapons.--The term \n     ``Convention on Conventional Weapons'' means the Convention \n     on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain \n     Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively \n     Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, done at Geneva \n     on October 10, 1980 (Senate Treaty Document 103-25).\n       (4) United states instrument of ratification.--The term \n     ``United States instrument of ratification'' means the \n     instrument of ratification of the United States of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to speak today in support \ngiving the Senate's advice and consent to ratification of the Amended \nMines Protocol to the Convention on Conventional Weapons. This amended \nprotocol was adopted on May 3, 1996, and submitted to the Senate for \nits advice and consent to ratification on January 7, 1997. The Foreign \nRelations Committee approved this resolution of ratification on March \n23 of this year, with no dissents.\n  While this is not as big an issue as NATO enlargement or the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, ratification of the Amended \nMines Protocol will be a real achievement. Its enactment is a further \ndemonstration that the Senate and its Foreign Relations Committee can, \nin fact, reach agreement upon treaties that deal with difficult issues.\n  My colleagues are well aware of the humanitarian crisis that has \ndeveloped in the world as a result of the millions of unexploded land \nmines left from the last generation of wars in the world. The United \nStates is a leader in humanitarian de-mining efforts, and we have all \nsupported those efforts. But a few examples may help explain to the \npublic why the issue of land mines is of such deep concern.\n  In April 1996, Newsweek magazine wrote about one victim of land mines \nas follows:\n\n       He served three years on Bosnia's front lines and survived. \n     But within days of being demobilized, Petr Jesdimir became a \n     casualty of the peace.\n       He was working with a private road crew on the outskirts of \n     Sarajevo last month when an anti-personnel mine buried at the \n     roadside blew up under his left foot. As he stumbled down the \n     road to get help, another mine shattered his right leg.\n       Today he lies in a Sarajevo orthopedic clinic where battle-\n     tested doctors have made their own transition--from treating \n     soldiers hit by grenades to amputating the arms and legs of \n     mine victims, mostly children. Jesdimir, 50, realizes that \n     until he dies he'll probably be a drain on the nation he \n     fought to preserve.\n       ``I know I have to live with this now,'' he sobbed last \n     week, holding up the trembling stump of a leg. ``Now I \n     understand war.''\n\n  A year later, The Washington Post recounted the story of another \nBosnian victim:\n\n       The June weather was perfect as 14-year-old Tibomir Ostojic \n     returned home from a dip in a nearby river. ``Cherries,'' he \n     thought. ``Wouldn't it be nice to have some cherries?''\n       So he climbed a cherry tree not far from his apartment in \n     the Sarajevo neighborhood of Dobrinja. As he was climbing \n     down--and a split-second before his foot hit the ground--he \n     realized the grass he was about to step on clearly had been \n     avoided by others, and he knew instantly he was in trouble.\n       The first explosion threw him into the air and onto a \n     second land mine. By then he had his hands over his head for \n     protection. The second blast blew them off.\n\n  Land mines were also the major cause of casualties for NATO forces in \nBosnia. Yet Bosnia is hardly the only land where this occurs.\n  A Washington Times article of June 10, 1997, reported: ``The land \nmines are strewn so widely in the jungles along the cease-fire zones \nbetween Ecuador and Peru that when peacekeepers kick a soccer ball out \nof their compound, it stays there.'' Last year, in the wake of \nHurricane Mitch, still more innocent people fell victim to land mines \nleft over from the civil war in Nicaragua.\n  The catalogue of countries ravaged by land mines--long after the end \nof the wars in which those mines were laid--goes on and on: \nAfghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Mozambique, Vietnam. It was the need to \nput an end to these seemingly endless post-war tragedies that motivated \nboth the Administration and the Foreign Relations Committee to \nrecommend ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol.\n  The new Protocol is not a complete ban on anti-personnel land mines. \nMany of us regret that the United States is not in a position to sign \nand ratify the Ottawa Convention that institutes such a ban. The \nAmended Mines Protocol is supported, however, by several mine-producing \nor mine-using powers that would not sign the Ottawa Convention.\n  It is a sad fact of life that countries with fortified borders are \nnot yet willing to do without land mines. By adhering to this Protocol, \nthey will save many innocent lives while we work to make a world-wide \nban feasible for all countries.\n  The new Protocol bans mines that are designed to be exploded by the \npresence of a mine detector, and it requires anti-personnel mines to be \ndetectable. These provisions will greatly aid mine-clearing efforts in \nfuture wars.\n  The Protocol severely limits the use of land mines unless they are \nboth self-destructing within 30 days and self-deactivating within 120 \ndays (in case the self-destruct mechanism should fail). Adherence to \nthese provisions should end the senseless post-war slaughter inflicted \nby so many mines today.\n  The Protocol establishes an obligation to clean up minefields after \nwars\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\nhave ended. You might think that this was an obvious duty, but \ncountries have often failed to clean up their lethal mess.\n  Finally, the new Protocol applies to civil wars, as well as \ninternational ones. This is a desperately needed provision, as so many \nof the worst land mine disasters have been the result of civil wars. \nThe Amended Mines Protocol is the first protocol of the Convention on \nConventional Weapons to be applied to civil wars, and this is an \nimportant achievement that is in keeping with U.S. policy and \npractices.\n  These provisions will go a long way, if adopted and fully implemented \nby the major mine users and producers, to curtail Future humanitarian \ncrises due to land mines. The amended Protocol specifically meets \nconcerns that the Senate articulated in 1995, when we gave our advice \nand consent to ratification of the original Mines Protocol and the \nunderlying Convention on Conventional Weapons. For all these reasons, \nthe Amended Mines Protocol deserves our wholehearted support.\n  Bringing the Amended Mines Protocol to the Senate floor has required \nus to reconcile sharply differing and strongly held views regarding the \nutility and morality of using anti-personnel mines that meet the \nstandards of the Amended Mines Protocol. We owe a debt of gratitude to \nour colleagues who agreed to accept resolution provisions and report \nlanguage that safeguarded each other's positions on the broader land \nmine issues.\n  One colleague who put the lives of innocent civilians ahead of his \npersonal policy preferences is our esteemed Chairman, Senator Helms of \nNorth Carolina. Senator Helms has stated that anti-personnel mines are \nessential to the U.S. Armed Forces and that a ban on such weapons would \nneedlessly place U.S. forces at risk.\n  The Amended Mines Protocol does not pre-judge, however, the question \nof U.S. adherence to the Ottawa Convention. Both supporters and \nopponents of that treaty can support the Protocol's limits on the use \nof anti-personnel land mines by those countries that retain them.\n  Adherence to the amended Protocol will not require any adjustment of \nU.S. military weaponry or tactics, moreover. Rather, it will make other \ncountries meet standards that we already have achieved. U.S. military \nleaders want this Protocol to succeed, because it will save the lives \nof U.S. service men and women.\n  In the interests of securing ratification of the Amended Mines \nProtocol, Senator Helms agreed to several major changes in the \nresolution of ratification, both last year and again this year, to \nremove from that resolution any language that would jeopardize this \neffort by pre-judging the broader land mine questions in his favor. He \nalso issued a Committee report this year that omitted extensive \nmaterial on land mines and the Ottawa Convention, thus minimizing any \nunintended affront to colleagues who favor a complete ban on anti-\npersonnel mines.\n  Another colleague who has put other people's lives ahead of his own \nviews is Senator Leahy of Vermont. Senator Leahy has said many times in \nthis chamber that the United States should adhere to the Ottawa \nConvention as soon as possible. He has sponsored successful legislation \nto fund the search for land mine alternatives, and he has an \nunderstandable interest in ensuring the effectiveness of that search.\n  Senator Leahy is in an interesting position, however: he actually \nhelped to bring about the Amended Mines Protocol. Although he favors a \nworld-wide ban on anti-personnel mines, Senator Leahy has stated that \nhe also considers the Amended Mines Protocol an improvement over the \nexisting Protocol.\n  Senator Leahy agreed not to seek to amend this resolution of \nratification, even though he opposes some of its provisions. For \nexample, the resolution will preserve the Pursuit Deterrent Munition \nuntil January 1, 2003, even though the U.S. military found that this \nweapon was too heavy to be of great use to U.S. personnel.\n  It was not easy to bring Chairman Helms and Senator Leahy to \nagreement on a resolution of ratification for the Amended Mines \nProtocol. Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and I, as well as Executive \nbranch officials from several agencies, had to work at this beginning \nin 1997.\n  Chairman Helms and Senator Leahy agreed early on, however, that \nratification of this Protocol was worth doing, if it could be done \nwithout prejudicing their stands on the larger issues. I am very \npleased that we achieved such a resolution. I am also proud to be \nassociated with two fine colleagues who kept their eye on the ball and \narrived at an agreement.\n  I want to recognize some of the staff members who have labored so \nhard to bring about successful U.S. ratification of the Amended Mines \nProtocol. Marshall Billingslea and Edward Levine of the Foreign \nRelations Committee staff have kept at this for over a year and a half, \nframing the issues and enabling Chairman Helms and me to reconcile our \nown differences as well as those between the Chairman and Senator \nLeahy.\n  Senator Hagel's staff also played a major role in reconciling those \ndifferences, especially in the early stages. Tim Rieser of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee staff ably served Senator Leahy in crafting \nlanguage that would not subvert the cause of eventual land mine \nabolition.\n  Two State Department lawyers deserve special recognition for their \nroles. The Principal Deputy Legal Adviser, Michael J. Matheson, was \ninstrumental in the negotiation of the Amended Mines Protocol and in \nexplaining to the Senate its legal intricacies.\n  Steve Solomon, an attorney in the office of the Assistant Legal \nAdviser for Political-Military Affairs, was tireless and expert in \nexplaining why U.S. ratification is in our national interest. Time and \nagain, Mr. Solomon kept us on track toward reasonable solutions. \nWithout the assistance of those fine civil servants, we would not be \nratifying this Protocol today.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to emphasize that U.S. ratification \nof the Amended Mines Protocol is an action of which all Senator can \nfeel proud. It will save innocent lives. It will reaffirm U.S. \nleadership in codifying the laws of war. Irrespective of whether we \neventually renounce all anti-personnel mines, and without prejudicing \nthat debate, the Amended Mines Protocol will serve our national \ninterest and the interests of humanity.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1981 the Convention on Conventional \nWeapons (CCW) came into force. The United States was instrumental in \ndrafting that Convention, including Protocol II which imposed modest \nlimits on the use of landmines. The United States signed the CCW, but \nanother 15 years elapsed before President Clinton forwarded it to the \nSenate for its advice and consent. The U.S. finally ratified it in \n1995.\n  Protocol II, commonly known as the Mines Protocol, was, during those \nyears, the only international agreement which explicitly dealt with the \nuse of landmines, and it was routinely ignored--not by the United \nStates military, but by many other countries. And throughout that \nperiod the United States and other mine producers sold and gave away \ntens of millions of mines to other governments and rebel groups who \nused them against civilian populations. Our mines can be found today, \nand we are paying millions of dollars annually to help remove them and \nassist the victims, in some thirty countries.\n  By the early 1990's, it was widely recognized that the Mines Protocol \nhad utterly failed to protect civilians from landmines. In fact, during \nthe previous decade, the number of civilian casualties from mines \nskyrocketed.\n  There were many reasons for the failure of the Mines Protocol, but \ncertainly among them was that it was riddled with loopholes, and that \nits rules were difficult to verify and impossible to enforce.\n  In 1992, convinced that far stronger leadership was needed to solve \nthe mine problem, I sponsored legislation to halt United States exports \nof anti-personnel mines. I did so because I felt it was wrong for the \nUnited States to contribute to the carnage caused by mines, and I \nbelieved that little would change unless the United States, by setting \nan example, encouraged others to act. And that is what happened. In a \nmatter of two or three years, close to fifty governments stopped \nexporting mines. Today, there is a de facto global export ban in \neffect. Even governments\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\nthat produce mines and have refused to renounce their use, including \nRussia and China, have publicly said that they no longer export.\n  At the same time that I was sponsoring legislation in Congress, I was \nalso aware that ten years had elapsed since the Mines Protocol had come \ninto force and that any party could request the United Nations to \nsponsor a CCW review conference. I saw this as an opportunity to \nstrengthen the Protocol and to consider banning anti-personnel mines \naltogether. Since the U.S. was not a party, I and others urged the \nFrench Government to request the conference. By the time the review \nconference opened in late 1995, the United States had ratified the CCW \nand was able to participate fully in the negotiations.\n  The negotiations were difficult. Despite efforts by myself, some \ngovernments, and non-governmental organizations to promote a total ban, \nthe idea was hardly discussed. Instead, the basic premise of the \noriginal Protocol remained unchanged--that mines are legitimate weapons \nof war. To its credit, the Clinton Administration made some \nconstructive proposals dealing with, for example, the detectability of \nmines, and the Amended Protocol reflects some of those proposals. It \nrequires all anti-personnel mines to contain enough iron to be \ndetectable, and to either contain self-destruct/self-deactivation \ndevices or be placed in marked and monitored minefields. It applies to \ninternal conflicts, and also contains limits on certain transfers of \nanti-personnel mines.\n  These are notable improvements, but the negotiators again failed to \ninclude effective verification or enforcement provisions. They also \nrefused to include a U.S. proposal to apply the prohibition on non-\ndetectable mines to anti-vehicle mines.\n  Despite these significant flaws, I supported the Amended Protocol and \nencouraged the Administration to forward it to the Senate for its \nadvice and consent. Indeed, I suspect that had I not sponsored the \nfirst law anywhere to halt exports of anti-personnel mines, or urged \nthe French Government to request a review conference, there would not \nbe an Amended Protocol.\n  Last year, after the Foreign Relations Committee reported what I and \nothers regarded as a fatally flawed Resolution of Ratification, I \nrefused to consent to its adoption by unanimous consent. At that time I \nmade clear that the issue was not the Amended Protocol itself, but a \nResolution and Committee Report that contained language that was \nextraneous, inaccurate, and provocative.\n  Today we are again asked to give our consent, and this time I have, \nwith some reluctance, agreed. I say with some reluctance, because if \nthis Resolution and the accompanying Committee Report dealt only with \nthe Amended Protocol there would be no disagreement. In fact, we could \nhave adopted it six months ago. But while the Resolution and Report are \nfar preferable to the versions we were presented last year, they also \ncontain language that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Amended \nProtocol. That is because, Mr. President, a few members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee have tried to use this Resolution as a vehicle to \nattack the Ottawa Convention, governments and individuals like myself \nwho support that Convention, and current United States policy.\n  After reaching a stalemate last year, Senator  Biden and I worked \nwith Senator Helms to resolve our differences. While there is still \nlanguage in the Resolution which is extraneous and I disagree with, and \nin the report which is extraneous, factually inaccurate and \nobjectionable, it has been pared down substantially. For that I thank \nSenator Biden and Senator Helms and their staffs. They worked \ndiligently to reach a result which, while not perfect, each of us can \nlive with.\n  One of the reasons that I am consenting to this resolution is that \nthe objectionable report language reflects the views of only some \nmembers of the Committee. In fact, much of it deals with issues which \nwere never considered or debated by the Committee as a whole. Rather, \nit is based on the testimony of a handful of like-minded witnesses at a \nhearing that was attended by Senator Helms and only one other Member of \nthe Committee, who was a cosponsor of my legislation to ban United \nStates use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea.\n\n  In other words, to the extent that the Helms Report purports to lay \ndown markers for future landmine policy, it is neither binding nor \nrepresentative of the views of the Committee as a whole, and even less \nso of the United States Senate.\n  While there is no need to address every objectionable phrase in the \nReport, two issues require a response.\n  First, the Report states that it is the view of many members of the \nCommittee that the United States should not agree to any prohibition on \nthe use, production, stockpiling or transfer of short-duration anti-\npersonnel mines. Yet the Committee never debated this issue and the \nviews of its members, with the exception of Senator Helms, were never \npublicly expressed. Furthermore, and most important, some 135 countries \nhave signed the Ottawa Convention which bans the production, use, \ntransfer and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines, and 77 have ratified. \nThey include every member of NATO except the United States and Turkey, \nand every Western Hemisphere country except the United States and Cuba. \nThey also include many countries that have produced, used and exported \nmines in the past.\n  To suggest that the United States should remain outside the \nConvention that is widely and increasingly seen as establishing a new \ninternational norm outlawing anti-personnel mines, is inconsistent with \nUnited States policy and the interests of the United States. The \nAdministration, including the Pentagon, has stated repeatedly and \nunequivocally that it will sign the Ottawa Convention when it has \nsuitable alternatives to these weapons, and that it is aggressively \nsearching for such alternatives.\n  Moreover, 67 members of the Senate voted for my amendment to halt \nU.S. use of anti-personnel mines, for one year. And 60 Senators, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, including every Senator who fought in \ncombat, cosponsored legislation introduced by myself and Senator Hagel \nto ban U.S. use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea.\n  Second, the Report notes that the Administration hopes to negotiate a \nban on exports of anti-personnel mines in the U.N. Conference on \nDisarmament. I believe such a strategy is fraught with problems. It is \nrelevant here only insofar as the Helms Report states that many members \nof the Committee believes that in future negotiations on an export ban \nthe Administration should differentiate between short and long-duration \nmines.\n  Perhaps those members are unaware that five years ago the United \nStates and Britain proposed such an ``export control regime.'' It was \nrejected out of hand not only by many of our NATO allies, but by \ndeveloping countries who already had stockpiled millions of long-\nduration mines and saw the U.S./UK proposal as an attempt to market \ntheir higher tech, higher priced mines. Any attempt by the United \nStates to resurrect that failed approach would only further damage U.S. \ncredibility on the mine issue.\n  I would also refer members to the Minority views in the Report, which \nably address this issue. Finally, it is notable that Senator Helms \nvoted twice for my amendment to halt exports of antipersonnel mines, as \ndid the then Majority Leader Robert Dole. Those amendments passed \noverwhelmingly, and did not differentiate between short and long-\nduration mines.\n  Mr. President, the Amended Mines Protocol is a step forward. If \nadhered to it will help reduce the maiming and killing of civilians, \nand United States soldiers, by landmines. If its prohibition on non-\ndetectable mines is applied to anti-vehicle mines, as the United States \nhas proposed, that would be a significant advance.\n  But like its predecessor, the Amended Protocol has too many loopholes \nand can be easily violated. It is a far cry from what is needed to \nachieve the goal declared by President Clinton and adopted by the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly of ridding the world of anti-personnel mines. I \nbelieve that can only occur--as was done with poison gas and as the \nOttawa Convention would do--by stigmatizing these indiscriminate \nweapons. That will take far stronger United States leadership than we \nhave seen thus far.\n  Mr. HATCH.
