Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on or in relation to \namendment No. 1621.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment requires a study of mining in \nthe Mark Twain Forest to address the scientific gaps identified \nspecifically by the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey on behalf of \nthe Forest Service, EPA, and others. While the information is \ncollected, it delays any prospecting or withdrawal decisions for the \nfiscal year.\n  It does not permit mining, prospecting or weaken environmental \nstandards. It preserves the long-term requirements of a full NEPA \nprocess, which will ultimately dictate whether additional mining will \noccur.\n  The opponents seem to have an argument not with me but with the \nadministration scientists who have concluded that there is insufficient \ninformation. The bipartisan county commissioners of the eight counties \nin the area are unanimous and adamant in their support. I met with the \nrepresentatives of the 1,800 miners whose continued livelihood in this \npoor area depends on the opportunity to continue to mine. They want a \nhearing held in Mark Twain country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two additional letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Mark \n           Twain National Forest,\n                                         Rolla, MO, July 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Thank you for the opportunity to respond \n     to the situation concerning the collection of data to assess \n     the potential impacts of lead mining on the Doniphan and \n     Eleven Point Ranger Districts of the Mark Twain National \n     Forest. These two districts were acquired in the Fristoe \n     Purchase Unit in the 1930's, so there is some documentation \n     that refers to the area as the Fristoe Unit. A Multi-agency \n     Technical Team was established in 1988 to identify and \n     collect the information necessary to evaluate the impacts of \n     mining upon this area of the Forest. The Forest Service has \n     chaired this Team since it began and since 1989 the Forest \n     staff officer for Technical Services, Bob Willis, has been \n     Chair. The original charter for the Team is enclosed.\n       A great deal of information has been collected, but there \n     is much that remains to be gathered if a decision for mineral \n     production is ever proposed. At this time, there are no \n     proposals for exploration or leasing in this area of the \n     Forest. The information that has been gathered is all that is \n     identified in Phase I of the plan and is a portion of the \n     information that may be required. The remaining information \n     identified will be collected only if a proposal to mine is \n     made. A proposal to withdraw the area from mineral entry \n     would require collection of similar information.\n       Members of the Multi-agency Technical Team as well as a \n     summary of the information the Team has collected is \n     enclosed.\n       We anticipate the Technical Team will identify additional \n     site specific information if a proposal to mine or a proposal \n     to withdraw the area from mineral entry is made. This \n     information will only be a portion of the information \n     necessary to make a National Environmental Policy Act \n     decision, and a multi-disciplinary team will take the \n     Technical Team data as well as cultural, economic, social, \n     biological, and additional ecological information to analyze \n     the impacts of mining. Funding for the Technical Team \n     information collection has been limited, and only a small \n     portion of the data identified as needed for a mining \n     decision has been collected. The remaining information will \n     be extremely expensive to collect and has been waiting on a \n     proposal to mine to initiate collection. The technical data \n     needed to analyze the impacts of mineral development in this \n     portion of the Forest is complex and the technical Team has \n     done a good job identifying the technical data needs of the \n     decision and collecting the first place of information. \n     Additional effort by the Team will be needed on any mineral \n     entry or withdrawal proposal.\n       Thank you for your interest regarding this issue and the \n     Mark Twain National Forest. If you have additional questions, \n     please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Randy Moore,\n                                                Forest Supervisor.\n\n\n                  multi-agency technical team members\n\n       USDA Forest Service--Mark Twain National Forest.\n       Bureau of Land Management.\n       National Park Service--Ozark National Scenic Riverways.\n       Environmental Protection Agency.\n       U.S. Geological Survey--Water Resources Division.\n       U.S. Geological Survey--Geologic Division.\n       U.S. Geological Survey--Mineral Resource Program.\n       U.S. Geological Survey--Mapping Division.\n       Missouri Department of Natural Resources.\n       Missouri Department of Conservation.\n       U.S. Geological Survey--Columbia Environmental Research \n     Center.\n       Ozark Underground Laboratory.\n       Doe Run Company.\n       Cominco.\n       University of Missouri--Rolla.\n       U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  U.S. Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                       U.S. Geological Survey,\n\n                                        Reston, VA, July 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: This is in response to your letter of \n     July 20, 1999, to Mr. Jim Barks, related to mining in the \n     Mark Twain National Forest (MTNF) area. In your letter, you \n     ask that we provide a brief and clear assessment as to the \n     quality of information that was compiled by the interagency \n     technical team charged with building a ``relevant database to \n     assess mining impacts and base future decisions.'' You ask \n     that we, ``specifically address the question as to the \n     adequacy and relevance of information currently available to \n     provide a solid scientific foundation for any decision to \n     justify either withdrawal or mining in the region.''\n       In 1988, an interagency technical team was assembled to \n     guide the identification, collection, and dissemination of \n     scientific information needed to assess the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the MTNF area. Since \n     1989, the team has been chaired by Bob Willis of the Forest \n     Service. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has actively \n     participated on the team from the beginning, with Mr. James \n     H. Barks, USGS Missouri State Representative, serving as our \n     representative.\n       The technical team believes that there is insufficient \n     scientific information available to determine the potential \n     environmental impact of lead mining in the MTNF area. This is \n     a consensus opinion that the technical team has held from the \n     beginning through the present. Due to the lack of scientific \n     information available to assess the potential impacts of lead \n     mining, the technical team proposed that a comprehensive \n     study be conducted.\n       In January 1998 at the request of the technical team, the \n     USGS prepared a proposal for a multi-component scientific \n     study to address the primary questions about the potential \n     environmental impacts of lead mining in\n\n[[Page S10659]]\n\n     the MTNF area. Mr. Barks provided a copy of the proposed \n     study to Brian Klippenstein of your staff at his request on \n     July 9, 1999. Neither a requirement for full environmental \n     review to support a Secretarial decision nor a source of \n     funding has been established. For these reasons the proposed \n     study has not been initiated.\n       Please let us know if we can provide additional information \n     or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Charles G. Groat,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge colleagues to oppose the Bond \namendment. This sets the stage for lead mining in the Mark Twain \nNational Forest, one of the most beautiful recreational areas in the \nMidwest. This is opposed by the Governor of Missouri, the attorney \ngeneral of Missouri, every major newspaper in the State, a score of \ndifferent groups of citizens living in the area, as well as \nenvironmental groups.\n  To open this area to lead mining is to run the risk of making an \nindustrial wasteland out of one of the most beautiful recreation areas \nin Missouri. It is an area shared by those of us who live in Illinois \nand in many other States. At the current time, the Department of the \nInterior has the authority to review this. What the Senator from \nMissouri is attempting to do is to circumvent that process. That should \nnot happen.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1583\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on or in relation to \nthe pending Robb amendment No. 1583.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment would strike section 329, the \nlegislative rider which attempts to bypass the administrative and \nlegislative process. Section 329 would overturn recent Federal court \ndecisions which merely required the Forest Service to collect the data \nthe law requires for making forest management decisions like cutting \ntimber. It would apply to all activities that are affecting wildlife on \nall 450 million acres of public lands in the United States. The \nSecretaries of Agriculture and the Interior said:\n\n       It is unnecessary, confusing, difficult to interpret, and \n     wasteful. If enacted, it will likely result in additional and \n     costly delays, conflicts, and lawsuits, with no clear benefit \n     to the public or the health of public lands.\n\n  It is opposed by the Forest Service. It is opposed by BLM. The Forest \nService can comply and is complying with the court rulings. They are \ngathering the information now.\n  Last night, my colleagues complained that the New York Times and the \nWashington Post did not understand the Northwest. Here is what the \nSeattle Times has to say about the decisions, in an editorial opposing \nsection 329 with the headline, ``No More Outlaw Logging.''\n\n       It falls to the Forest Service to balance scientific and \n     commercial interests . . . keeping the Forest Service honest \n     and forcing it to commit resources to make the plan work.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the effect of the Robb amendment would be \nto terminate all harvests on all public lands in the United States and \nmuch recreational activity that requires any kind of improvement. It \nrequires between $5 billion and $9 billion worth of wildlife surveys \nbeyond endangered species, surveys that are unnecessary and so \nexpensive that it will not be wise to go ahead with any of them.\n  The amendment does not require the Forest Service or the Secretary of \nthe Interior to do anything. It simply authorizes them to conduct their \nbusiness in the future as they have conducted it in the past. If they \ndo not want to, if they want to go after these surveys, they still can. \nSection 329 is entirely discretionary and is entirely within the power \nof the administration to interpret as it wills.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I express my full support for Senator \nGorton's section 329. It is the right thing to do because, without it \nthere would be a new $8 billion mandate on the Forest Service.\n  This provision is needed because it affirms a position taken by three \ncircuit courts and nine Federal courts. Senator Gorton's effort is \nnecessary because it will ensure that the Forest Service and the Nation \nhave a uniform public policy.\n  The opponents of section 329 want to ignore the position taken by \nthree circuit courts and nine Federal courts because they got the \ndecision they liked from the 11th Circuit Court.\n  There is a certain irony here. Here is an instance where \nenvironmentalists do not want a one-size-fits-all national policy.\n  Senator Gorton's provision helps the Forest Service. It properly \neliminates very expensive and completely unnecessary work by the Forest \nService.\n  Senator Gorton would allow the Forest Service to rely on sampling \ndata regarding available habitats for the species.\n  Opponents want the Forest Service to count the actual populations of \nthe species--not just once, but several times to determine population \ntrends. In each case, the three circuit courts and nine Federal courts \ndid not buy this argument.\n  Currently, the Forest Service has followed the Federal court \ndecisions. It has correctly contained to inventory wildlife by habitat \navailability for almost two decades.\n  Now, the Senate is being asked to ignore 20 years of experience plus \ndecisions from three circuit courts and nine Federal courts.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to ignore the experts at the Forest \nService.\n  The Senate is also faced with a decision that will significantly \nincrease the cost of operating the timbers sales program in the Forest \nService. Eight billion dollars is real money and spending the \ntaxpayer's hard earned money unwisely is criminal.\n  Let me put the Senator Robb mandated spending into a context. Eight \nbillion dollars is 2\\1/2\\ times the entire annual budget of the whole \nForest Service.\n  Mr. President, it is clear the 11th Circuit Court has ``overreached'' \nand Senator Robb's mandated spending is unjustified.\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\n  The current wildlife data requirements can be applied nationwide \nwithout threatening species habitats. But timber sales, an authorized \nand core mission of the Forest Service, would be placed in jeopardy.\n  In Mississippi, timber sales are the lifeblood of many counties. It \nfunds children's education in some of Mississippi's and the Nation's \npoorest counties.\n  Congress must ensure that Forest Service timber sales continue in a \ntimely fashion.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the efforts of Senator Robb. His \namendment would, quite frankly, destroy the fiscal viability of two \ncounties in Mississippi. Wayne County and Perry County are currently \nlisted by Federal Governments as two of the poorest in the Nation. They \ndepend on Federal timber sales--remember, this is a legal and primary \nmission of the Forest Service.\n  Mr. President, Senator Gorton's section 329 is the right provision on \nthe right appropriation bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we all want to solve the problems \nconcerning implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan and the so-\ncalled ``survey and manage'' requirements. I have long supported and \ncontinue to support the plan and believe it should work as written. \nUnfortunately, section 329 undermines the important protection and \nscientific credibility of the forest plan and does not solve the \ncurrent problems. That's why today I supported the Robb/Cleland \namendment to strike section 329 from the fiscal year 2000 Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  Recently, a Federal court injunction halted dozens of timber sales in \nWashington, Oregon, and California. The injunction is not the fault of \nthe timber industry, the environmental community, or the Northwest \nForest Plan. The blame rests squarely on the forest Service and the \nBureau of Land Management (BLM). They have failed to undertake the \nsurvey and manage requirements of the forest Plan despite having five \nyears in which to do so. The Forest Service and BLM may believe they \nwere meeting the requirements of the forest Plan, but clearly they did \nnot. Unfortunately, the Forest Service and BLM's failure is harming \ninnocent communities and, potentially, species.\n  The Northwest Forest Plan came out of a time of discorded in the \nPacific Northwest. In 1992, our timber industry was shut down by the \nspotted owl. The Forest Plan was designed to provide industry with a \ngreater assurance regarding timber harvest levels, while also \nprotecting the forests and the species they support.\n  The Northwest Forest Plan's survey and manage provision was developed \nby scientists to help land mangers reduce the potential 9mpact of \ntimber harvests and other activities on a wide variety of currently \nunlisted species, ranging from fungi, to mollusks, to tree voles. The \nresult should have been a management program for the Pacific Northwest \nnational forest that provided for stable timber harvest levels and \nprotection against another spotted own crisis. That hasn't happened.\n  However, we cannot abandon the Northwest Forest Plan. We especially \ncannot abandon it without putting in place other ways to protect our \nforests species and provide a sustainable flow of timber.\n  Section 329, is not a solution to the failure of federal agencies to \nmeet their survey and manage requirements. The solution lies in the \nforest Service and BLM getting their acts together and doing what they \nare required to do. If some of the survey and manage requirements are \nflawed or unnecessary, we need the Federal agencies and the scientific \ncommunity to tell us. We can then all work to find a balanced solution. \nI commit to working with the industry, agencies, environmentalists, and \nmy colleagues to find a way to make the Northwest Forest Plan work.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, that will \nmove to strike a section of the Interior appropriations bill that is \nnot only important to the future of the management of our national \nforests, but critical to the taxpayers of this country.\n  Section 329 of the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill is a \nnecessary clarification to the National Forest Management Act provision \nthat requires the Forest Service to include wildlife diversity in its \nmanagement of the national forests. A recent decision by the 11th \nCircuit Court determined that the Forest Service must conduct \ncomprehensive wildlife population surveys in every area of each \nnational forest that would be disturbed by a timber sale or any other \nmanagement activity in order to authorize that activity.\n  This may seem like a simple requirement. However, in order to \nunderstand this amendment, you need to understand what types of surveys \nare currently being done and how expensive it would be to comply with \nthe new recent decision. It is also important to know that this \ndecision overturns 17 years of agency practice and is contrary to \ndecisions in 3 other courts of appeal.\n  From 1982 until 1999, the Forest Service has consistently interpreted \nits rules implementing the wildlife diversity by inventorying habitat \nand analyzing existing population data when determining the effect of \nplanning decisions on wildlife populations. During this same 17 year \nperiod, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth, Eighth, and \nNinth Circuits have upheld the Forest Service's interpretation of its \nown rule, not to mention several lower courts.\n  Then this year the Eleventh Circuit overruled a lower court decision \nconcerning one national forest in Georgia and found that the Forest \nService, despite two decades of agency interpretation and performance \nand judicial opinions, must count every member of every species on the \nground. This decision sets a standard never seen before in the \nmanagement of our national forests. The cost estimate to carry out such \na laborious task could be as high as $9 billion. That is almost three \ntimes the entire National Forest Service budget. This inventory \nstandard is unachievable and sets a paralysis on the management of our \nnational forests.\n  In my home State of Georgia, this decision threatens small saw mills \nthat purchase their lumber from public lands as well as fisheries and \nwildlife projects, recreation, land exchanges and new facility \nconstruction such as trails and campgrounds. Section 329 will reapply \nthe standard that the Forest Service has been using for the past 17 \nyears, and allow for a balance between protection of wildlife and \nprotection of public lands.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to look beyond the rhetoric on this \namendment and see that section 329 does not interfere with the judicial \nprocess, nor does it reverse current policy of the Forest Service or \nthe Bureau of Land Management. It simply allows agencies to use the \nbest information that is available to them to protect our national \nforests. I urge you to support sensible management and vote ``no'' on \nthe amendment to strike the language of section 329.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator \nRobb's amendment to strike section 329 from the Interior appropriations \nbill. This effort is misguided and I urge my colleagues to understand \nthe need for this Section if our National Forests are going to continue \nto function.\n  The ability of my home State's national forests to provide timber and \nother important resources is critical to the survival of many \ncommunities. I know the supervisors of both the Ozark-St. Francis and \nOuachita National Forests in Arkansas. They are dedicated to preserving \nthe forests' survival and natural beauty, while providing a healthy \nsource of timber. The timber purchase program in Arkansas is one of the \nfew in the country that consistently makes a profit. Not only does \nArkansas' timber industry benefit, but so do school children who \nreceive a portion of the earnings from the timber sales.\n  Section 329 simply clarifies that despite a recent circuit court \ndecision, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior should maintain \nthe discretion to implement current regulations as they have been doing \nfor nearly 20 years. Specifically, on February 18, 1999, the 11th \nCircuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Forest Service must conduct \nforest-wide wildlife population surveys on all proposed, endangered, \nthreatened, sensitive, and management indicator species in order to \nprepare or revise national forest plans on all ``ground disturbing \nactivity.'' Never\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\nbefore has such an extensive and impossible standard been set by the \ncourts. In the end, this ruling results in paralysis by analysis.\n  It would require the Forest Service to examine every square inch of a \nproject area and count the animals and plant life before it approved \nany ``ground disturbing activity.'' The cost to carry out such \nextensive studies--studies which have never been required before--could \nbe as much as $9 billion nationwide. How do we know this? Because the \nForest Service does contract for population inventorying on occasion.\n  If one were to extrapolate from the $8,000 cost of one plant \ninventory, they will reach $38.1 million for the 864,000 acres within \nthe Chattahoochee National Forest where the 11th Circuit Court decision \noriginated. When applied to Arkansas, one could deduce that this action \ncould cost my state's industry roughly $78 million. If applied to the \n188-million acre national forest system, the cost reaches $8.3 billion. \nDuring the past two decades, nine separate court decisions have backed \nthe way the Forest Service has been conducting their surveying \npopulations by inventorying habitat and analyzing existing population \ndata.\n  We appropriate roughly $70 million for forest inventory and \nmonitoring. Are we prepared to shift the $9 billion necessary for this \nnew standard? If not, this recent interpretation forces the Forest \nService to shut down until they can apply the new standard.\n  The purpose of section 329 is not to change the court decision or set \na new lower standard. It is simply to clarify that the existing \nregulation gives the discretion to the Forest Service and the BLM when \ndetermining what kind of surveys are needed when management activities \nare being considered.\n  Some of my colleagues would argue that this is an issue for the \nauthorizing committees to deal with. I agree. This is an issue that \nabsolutely should be dealt with by those committees. They need to \ndetermine whether the agencies have been correctly interpreting their \nregulation for the past 17 years. They need to determine whether it is \nsufficient to inventory habitat, rely on existing populations, consult \nwith state and Federal agencies and conduct population inventories only \nfor specific reasons. But I argue that the appropriations process \nshould not be made to bear the burden while the authorizing committees \nstudy the question.\n  All section 329 seeks to do is preserve the status quo, as the \nalready limited resources of our home States' National Forests would be \nfurther stretched if they are required to fund this new standard. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support sensible \nmanagement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH (when his name was called).

I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have a \nvote on the Hutchison amendment no later than 5 p.m. today.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, I \nwould like to have a vote on the Hutchison amendment. I think the \nSenator from Texas has a good amendment. The Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Domenici, has worked on this amendment. It is unfortunate that it \nis needed.\n  I am chairman of the Energy Regulation Subcommittee, and we had a \nhearing on this issue. The issue was whether or not MMS could change \npolicy on royalties, or does that take an act of Congress. Does MMS \nhave the power to increase taxes or the power to increase royalties? \nThey have the power to collect royalties; that has been the law. Do \nthey have the power to change it?\n  I tell my colleague from California, if she is not going to give us a \nvote on the amendment, then I am going to move to table the amendment \nmomentarily. I am going to make a couple more comments. If she wishes \nto have a couple of minutes on this, I will agree to that. I listened \nto the debate last night for a while. I wasn't able to get in here to \njoin the debate. I will make a couple of comments momentarily. If the \nSenator from California wishes to speak before I move to table, I will \nagree to that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from Oklahoma a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend, it is very generous to \noffer me a little time before he moves to table. My friend and I have \nspoken. We are very open about our disagreement on this amendment and \nwhether it is the right or the wrong thing. That will come out in our \ndebate. We have a couple of people who wanted to talk and weren't able \nto get over here last night. Senator Wellstone has been waiting. We \nwould be very happy to agree to quite a limited time, a few minutes, if \nthat would be possible, before my friend makes his motion to table.\n  Perhaps we can have a unanimous consent agreement that includes \nsufficient time, not exceeding 10 or 15 minutes total, before he moves \nto table. And, by the way, we are all going to vote not to table. I \ndon't exactly know why we are going to do this. We think this deserves \nmore discussion.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 20 \nminutes of debate on the motion to table, equally divided between the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nbeing generous. We know that under the rules he can move to table \nimmediately, and we would not be able to have time for debate. I want \nto tell my friends from Illinois and Minnesota that I intend to yield \nto them under this unanimous consent request.\n  Let me set the stage, before I do that, by encapsulating in a very \nfew minutes why I think the Hutchison amendment is not a good idea, why \nI think it is dangerous for the Senate to put its imprimatur on the \nHutchison amendment, and why I think it is wrong for the taxpayers to \ncontinue to be cheated out of millions and millions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, if rushing through this center door here in this \nbeautiful Senate Chamber we saw someone with a bag full of cash that he \nor she had stolen, we would call the police. Yet what is going on today \non behalf of 5 percent of the oil companies is out and out thievery. \nThose are strong words, but they are backed up.\n  Listen to the words of USA Today. They say:\n\n       Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and \n     grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 to 10 percent discount off \n     the marketplace. Over time, that would add up to really big \n     bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure \n     nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement.\n\n  They say:\n\n       It is time for Congress to clean up this mess.\n\n  Yet the amendment we have before us continues this mess. We have \nalready lost, because of these amendments in the past, $88 million from \nthis Treasury. This amendment will continue that loss--another $66 \nmillion.\n  It is wrong. How do we know it is wrong? First of all, a royalty \npayment is not a tax. May I say that again. A royalty payment is not a \ntax. The Senator from Texas calls it a tax. It is not a tax. It is an \nagreement that is freely signed by the oil companies. It says they will \npay royalty payments when they drill on Federal lands belonging to the \npeople of the United States of America, and that payment will be based \non the fair market value of the production. As a matter of fact, it is \neven stronger language:\n\n       It shall never be less than the fair market value of the \n     production.\n\n  Yet 5 percent of the oil companies that are vertically integrated are \ncontinuing to underpay. How do we know this? We know this because there \nis proof of this.\n  We know this because already the oil companies have settled with \nseven different States for $5 billion. In other words, rather than face \nthe trial, they settled for $5 billion--I don't think any of us could \nimagine how much that is--because they didn't want to face the truth. \nThey settled because they admitted it in essence, although technically \nthey didn't. But by settling, the basic message is, we were wrong. How \nelse do we know there is cheating going on?\n  How about the retired ARCO employee who said that the company \nunderpaid oil royalties. Where do you think this ran? It didn't run in \nsome liberal publication. It ran in Platt's Oilgram News. It is big \nnews. It is big news--since the last time this rider went into effect.\n  Here he is, a retired Atlantic Richfield employee, admitting in court \nthat while he was secretary of ARCO's crude price committee, the posted \nprices were far below market value. He basically says that he admitted \nhe was not being truthful 5 years ago when he testified in a deposition \nthat ARCO posted prices representing fair market value. What did he say \nwhile he was an ARCO employee? Some of the issues being discussed were \nstill being litigated. He says: My plan was to get to retirement.\n  So you have a former employee from ARCO who raises his hand on the \nBible and tells the truth about the scam that is going on. What does \nthe amendment do? It continues the very scam that he has rebuked.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 3 minutes to the good Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think the Hutchison amendment is one \nof the most outrageous provisions to be offered to the Interior \nappropriations bill and shouldn't be included in this legislation. This \namendment would restrict the Interior Department from doing its job, \nwhich is to make sure that these oil companies pay full royalties for \nthe oil they are drilling on Federal and Indian lands.\n  I thank the Senator from California, who is willing to stand up to \noil companies. There are many Senators who will not do so. The Senator \nfrom California has the courage to do it.\n  I don't know why it is that all of a sudden we appear to have such \nsympathy for people who appear to be cheating the public. I know that \nwhen it comes to finding out what is happening to poor women and \nchildren, we do not seem to have a lot of interest in figuring out what \nis going on in their lives. I know that when we try to raise the \nminimum wage, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to \nblock that. But in through the door walks the CEO of one of these \nlarge, integrated oil companies that has been underpaying its \nroyalties--oil companies that have been heavy campaign contributors--\nand all of sudden we have sympathy to spare. We have sympathy coming \nout the wazoo. We feel their pain. All of a sudden, it is: ``At your \nservice; we can do it for you, Senator. How can we serve you better?''\n  This is a vote about whether or not we have an open, accountable \npolitical process. These companies should pay their fair share, and \nwhen they try to get away with basically not being honest and paying \nwhat they owe the public, they call on their friends in the Congress. \nThe Republican-led Congress answers their call without a moment's \nhesitation with an amendment to this bill. Congress comes to the rescue \nand rewards them for chronically underpaying the royalties which they \nowe to people in this country.\n\n  That is what this is all about.\n  I think this amendment is a sweetheart deal. It lets the oil \ncompanies off the hook. Frankly, I don't believe we should let them do \nthat--not if we represent the people in this country.\n  I thank the Senator for her amendment. I will vote against tabling \nthe amendment because I want to have a lot of debate and discussion. \nBecause the more the people in this country know what is at stake on \nthe floor of the Senate and understand what is going on, the better the \nchance we have of a significant victory.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield the remaining time?\n  How much time more time does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to ask the Senator if he was aware that the \nHutchison amendment had been included in the bill, and whether when it \ncame out of the Appropriations Committee it was stripped out because it \nwas deemed legislating on appropriations. Now it is back before us in a \nlittle bit of a changed technical fashion. But doesn't the Senator \nagree with me that the Senator from Texas is legislating on an \nappropriations bill?\n  This is a matter that is very serious. It is not about \nappropriations. As a matter of fact, it is stealing appropriations. It \nis stealing money from the people. It results in money being lost from \nthe Interior bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I don't have time. But I agree.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I reclaim any time and give an additional \n30 seconds to the Senator.\n  If he will continue to yield, doesn't he believe that this kind of a \nrider doesn't belong on this bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I don't think the rider belongs on this bill. I don't \nthink the rider belongs on any bill. I think these oil companies should \npay the royalty. I think the public is cheated when they don't. I don't \nthink, because they are big contributors and heavy hitters, that they \nshould be taken off the hook. I don't believe it should be included in \nany bill, especially this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I leave the remaining time to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Before I do, I wanted to call to my colleagues' attention a Los \nAngeles Times editorial, ``The Great American Oil Ripoff.'' ``America's \nbig oil companies have been ripping off Federal and State Governments \nfor decades by underpaying royalties for oil drilled on public lands.''\n\n[[Page S10663]]\n\n  It goes on. It says that Congress should not buckle to the pressure \nof the oil lobby, and that the Hutchison bill should be defeated.\n  Let me say I don't think you need a degree in economics; I don't \nthink you need a degree in political science to know cheating when you \nsee it. We know cheating when we see it. We know these companies are \nsettling for billions because they do not want to face the courts. Yet \nthis Senate, if it votes for the Hutchison amendment--I feel so \nstrongly about it--is putting its approval on organized cheating. How \ndo we know that it is organized? Because we have had former ARCO \nexecutives and others admit that it was, in fact, planned and \norganized.\n  I yield the remaining time to Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say in conclusion that this is one \nof the legislative riders that calls into question the basic issue. Who \nowns the public lands of America? Will they be a playground for the \ncompanies that want to come in and use our lands to make a profit, or \nwill these companies pay their fair share for using public lands?\n  The Senator from California is resisting Senator Hutchison's \namendment. She wants these companies to pay their fair share in \nroyalties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Texas would \ngive me time. I know the Senator from Louisiana wants a couple of \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  When I heard some of the arguments by my colleagues about cheating, \nstealing, and lying, I thought I was listening to a country and western \nsong at one point. The question is not about cheating, stealing, and \nlying. It is not about whether you have sympathy for the oil companies \ncoming out the wazoo. I checked my wazoo, and I don't have any sympathy \nfor the oil companies coming out of it. But I do think I have sympathy \nfor what is fair and what is right.\n  The Federal Government owns the oil, and it allows companies to \nexplore and produce it. The companies give back in return one-sixth or \none-eighth of the royalties to the Federal Government--to the taxpayers \nof the United States--in payment for the right to do this type of \nproduction.\n  The only question is, What is the value of oil? The companies don't \nset that. We do. Congress does. The only issue is, How do you determine \nthe legitimate value of the oil?\n  We have a formula that has been in place for years. The Federal \nGovernment, through minerals management, said we will try to make it \nsimple. We are not going to try to raise any additional money and keep \nit revenue-neutral. We want to have a simpler way of doing it.\n  The issue now boils down to the regulations. They are very \ncomplicated. It is not an easy process. How do you determine the price \nof oil that is produced in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico? If you \nsold it at the well 200 miles offshore, it would be easy to determine \nwhat the price is. But it is not sold in the middle of the Gulf of \nMexico. It is transported hundreds and hundreds of miles onshore where \nit is refined and then ultimately sold.\n  The question is, What is the legitimate production price? Who pays \nfor the transportation from the middle of the gulf? It is the Federal \nGovernment's oil. Do the companies pay for the transportation, or does \nthe Federal Government pay for the transportation?\n  The question is, What is the legitimate production in determining \nwhat the price is?\n  Could I have 30 seconds to conclude?\n  What the Senator from Texas has done is say: Look, pull over. There \nis a huge disagreement. It is very difficult and very complicated. \nNobody is stealing, cheating, or lying. But we need a little bit more \ntime to try to bring both sides together to come up with a realistic \nway of determining fair market value.\n  I think our amendment is a good one and should be supported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the explanation \nof the Senator from Louisiana because he is getting to the real point.\n  This chart shows what the MMS is proposing to do under the new rule. \nAs the Senator from Louisiana said, the mandate to MMS was to simplify \nthe rule so the Federal Government and the taxpayers of America get a \nfair share of the oil royalties. This is what they have come up with.\n  I believe if we can have a 1-year moratorium that MMS, which has a \nnew leader, will come forward with a reasonable plan. It is not going \nto tax costs. No other industry has a tax on their transportation costs \nand their marketing costs. It is going to be a fair return. That is \nwhat we are after.\n  I want to make one other point before I yield to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  We keep hearing about this former ARCO employee and all of the oil \ncompanies settling. But the Senator from California fails to mention \nthat 2 weeks ago, there was a verdict by a jury in California saying \nthat Exxon did not cheat the taxpayers of California. That is the oil \ncompany that didn't settle because it didn't believe it had cheated. \nThe former ARCO employee who has been referred to by the Senator from \nCalifornia testified in the case and was found uncredible.\n  So I think it is very important that be in the debate.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas. I think the Senate has an opportunity today to decide \nwhether we are going to give in to a group of Federal bureaucrats who \nhave decided it is going to be their way or no way. That is actually \nthe issue. All we are trying to determine through the activities of an \nestablished regulatory body is what the fair market value of the oil is \non which the U.S. taxpayers are entitled to receive a royalty.\n  The MMS has decided to change the way we have done it in the past and \nin the process, in the opinion of this Senator and many others, has \nmade it no longer fair. It is not actually levying a royalty on the \nvalue of the oil. They have decided to have new starting points. They \nare not allowing certain things to be deducted that are actual business \nexpenses. In a nutshell, they are establishing a price upon which the \nroyalty is predicated which is not the result of the marketplace and \nordinary business practices but some concoction that they have come up \nwith which will cost more money to an American industry that clearly \nshould not be paying new taxes today.\n  This is a new tax because you change the way you regulate it and the \nway you determine value and you thus increase the taxes. If it is not \nthe right way, then it is an increase in taxes. I do not believe they \nshould be doing this. I think we should be doing this. I believe they \nought to establish a process and submit it to us and ask, Do you want \nto change the rules on this or not?\n  Essentially, I listened attentively to the Senator from Louisiana. He \nhit it right on the head. And the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma \nin his brief remarks was right there. There has not been a better \nfighter than Kay Hutchison. She has been right again. We have been \nright together on this, and we have convinced the Senate heretofore, \nbut we cannot convince the MMS to be fair, and that is what the issue \nis all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to \nthe distinguished assistant majority leader and thank him very much for \nhis leadership on this issue. Senator Domenici, Senator Nickles, and I \nhave been fighting this fight and I could not think of\n\n[[Page S10664]]\n\ntwo people who better understand the issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Texas for \nher statement of yesterday and today, and also for the chart. I hope my \ncolleagues will look at the chart because that is what MMS is proposing \nand it is not workable. People who work in this field all the time have \ncome before our committee, a committee of Congress, and said this \nproposal is not workable. They told that to myself, they told that to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, as well as Senator Domenici, \nalso from New Mexico. They said it is not workable.\n  I have two or three problems. I am going to touch on them briefly.\n  One, I have a problem with the Senator from California saying she \ndoesn't like the amendment so she is going to filibuster the amendment. \nI earlier said: Let's vote on the amendment an hour from now, or 5 \nhours from now.\n  No, no, we are not going to have a vote on the amendment; she's going \nto filibuster the amendment.\n  If we are going to filibuster every amendment coming along on an \nappropriations bill, we are never going to get it done. If we do this, \nwe are never going to be able to get finished.\n  People can talk all they want about a do-nothing Congress, but if we \nhave members of one party or the other, or individual Members, who say: \nI don't like that provision in the transportation bill so I am going to \nfilibuster the transportation bill--we have already seen that happen \ntoday--or I don't like this provision so we are going to filibuster it \nso we are not going to get an Interior bill unless I get my way, or get \na supermajority--to say we need to have 60 votes to pass any amendment, \nI think that is a mistake. So we should get away from that.\n  Let me touch on the subject of this amendment. We passed in 1996 a \nbill, the Federal Royalty Fairness and Simplification Act, of which I \nwas one of the principal sponsors, in a bipartisan way to simplify \nroyalty collection. We did that. It passed overwhelmingly. The \nPresident signed it. It was a good bill.\n  The chart Senator Hutchison shows, the proposed MMS regs, is just the \nopposite of royalty simplification and fairness. If we follow the MMS \nproposal, what we have is an invitation for litigation. You have \nlitigation nightmares already going on. The Senator from Texas already \nmentioned the testimony of the ARCO employee. His testimony was not \npersuasive. The issue of royalty under payments went before a jury of \ntwelve in California in a case that had been ongoing for 14 years, and \nguess what? The jury decided in favor of the oil companies. They \ndecided that the oil company was right. This company litigated the \nissue of underpayments for 14 years.\n  A lot of companies decided it was not worth the expense. It was not \nworth the bad press. It was not worth these editorials that really do \nnot know what they are talking about, that know nothing about oil \nvaluation and the complexity of it. So maybe they do settle. That does \nnot mean they are guilty, that they are stealing. That is like somebody \nwho says, wait a minute, the IRS audited your taxes and you owe some \nmore money. Does that mean you are stealing?\n  There are some things wrong with the current royalty valuation \nprogram. We had two government employees who were involved in these \ndeveloping the new MMS regulations and all of a sudden they got paid \n$350,000 each by an outside group who supports the proposed \nregulations. That is pretty corrupt. That is like having an IRS agent \nsay: I audited your return and as a result we found out you owed more \nmoney. I want half of it. That is what happened in this case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nmajority leader's time for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That investigation is pending. Supposedly, the Justice \nDepartment is reviewing that case.\n  I urge all of our colleagues, to think about that. There are two \nfederal employees involved in developing these MMS regulations who were \npaid $350,000 by a group with a financial interest in the final rule. I \nfind that to be corrupt. I find that to be unethical. I find that to be \noutlandish. It needs to be stopped.\n  So I compliment, again, my colleague from Texas for this amendment. \nWe need to make sure that Congress raises taxes if Congress is going \nto. If there is going to be a tax increase, if there is going to be a \nroyalty increase, it should happen by an act of Congress. It should not \nhappen by an act of unelected bureaucrats changing the rules without \nappropriate legislative authority and opening up a litigation \nnightmare.\n  Mr. President, I move to table.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator withhold for a unanimous consent \nrequest to add Senators Brownback and Thomas as cosponsors of the \nHutchison-Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator \nHutchison's amendment to continue the moratorium on the Minerals \nManagement Service (MMS) oil royalty valuation rule. I am concerned \nthat the MMS proposed rules for determining federal royalty payments \nwill increase compliance costs for small, independent oil producers. \nThese producers have just begun to recover from some of the lowest oil \nprices in 30 years, which cost the oil and gas industry more than \n67,000 American jobs and saw the closure of more than 200,000 oil and \ngas wells. A hike in the royalty rates will make a bad situation worse \nand could cause more domestic oil production to be replaced by foreign \nimports.\n  It is up to Congress and not federal agencies to establish public \npolicy. The MMS clearly exceeded its authority by proposing to raise \nroyalty rates without congressional authorization. No congressional \ncommittee or affected industry groups were notified before the final \nversion of the rule was announced. The MMS has also tried to get around \nthe congressional moratorium by changing federal lease forms and taking \nother measures that are similar to the prohibited rule. These reckless \nactions have led me to believe that this is an agency out of control.\n  I am also very concerned about the appearance of a quid pro quo with \nrespect to payments that were made by the Project on Government \nOversight (POGO) to officials at the Departments of Interior and Energy \nwho were involved with the royalty rate valuation issue. I agree with \nSenator Hutchison that the Interior Department should not proceed with \nthis rule until this matter has been resolved by the Justice \nDepartment.\n  I do believe that the current royalty rate valuations are \nfundamentally flawed and should be changed. But the regulations \nproposed by the MMS would increase the amount of royalties to be paid \nby assessing royalties on downstream values without full consideration \nof costs. In a period of low oil prices, the government should be \nconsidering royalty rate reductions, not an increase.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress to make policy decisions \naffecting royalty rates and the responsibility of the MMS to implement \nthose policies. We, the United States Senate, have been elected by our \nconstituents in order to make these difficult decisions and should not \nhave our authority preempted by federal bureaucrats. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Hutchison royalty rate moratorium amendment \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am supporting Senator Hutchison's \namendment to extend the moratorium on the oil valuation rule of the \nDepartment of the Interior. I do this with some reluctance because like \nmost of my colleagues from oil producing States, I believe strongly \nthat this issue must be settled. Yet, after careful consideration, I \ncannot honestly conclude that the rule as currently proposed will \nachieve that.\n  I have worked hard with officials from the Department of the Interior \nand others to try to find the right approach to resolving the disputes \ninvolved in this rulemaking. I am very aware of the hard work and good \nfaith efforts of many in the environmental and public interest \ncommunity, within the States, and within the industry, to address the \ncontroversial issues raised\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\nby this rule. I believe there has been progress. However, we are not \nthere yet.\n  The way oil from Federal leases is valued for purposes of calculating \nroyalty payments is complex to say the least. Nonetheless, it is also \nvery important; it is important to those producing the Federal oil, it \nis important to the American taxpayers, and it is important to the \nStates who receive up to half of the proceeds from Federal leases \nwithin their state boundaries.\n  My State of New Mexico is the second largest producer of onshore \nFederal oil and gas. In 1998, there were almost twelve thousand Federal \noil and gas leases within New Mexico, covering over seven million acres \nof land. The majority of these leases are operated by small independent \nproducers whose livelihood is greatly impacted by the manner in which \nFederal payments are calculated.\n  In 1998, the State of New Mexico received almost $168 million as its \nshare of the revenues from Federal mineral leases within the State. My \nState uses these payments to help fund its public education system.\n  Given these circumstances, it is obvious to me that the method of \nvaluing these Federal royalty payments is of deep concern to New \nMexico, from a number of different angles. It is important to get it \nright. It is pointless to create rules that are unworkable, or unfair, \nor that will be mired in costly and nonproductive litigation. I owe it \nto the honest producers in my State, as well as to my State Treasury, \nto try to ensure that a final rulemaking on this subject will achieve \nthe desired end of fairness to all, and creation of a clear set of \nstandards that will not be plagued by endless controversy.\n  For this reason I am supporting an additional moratorium. I do not \nbelieve the rulemaking as it is currently proposed will work. The \nDepartment of the Interior has indicated that its latest round of \ncomments has resulted in information which it has found helpful, and \nwhich could result in changes that would satisfy the concerns of \nindustry and others, while ensuring that the United States receives \nfair market value for its oil resources. The Department has suggested \nthat with this new information, it may be able to work out ways to \nresolve the issues that to date have proven so intractable.\n  I believe imposition of this moratorium will allow the Department the \nadditional time it needs to re-propose this rule, and get to the \nelusive, but necessary resolution of this issue.\n  In comments I submitted to this rule, I recommended a number of areas \nfor change, based on my conversations with New Mexico producers, and \nwith other interested groups. These include ensuring that independent \nproducers and others who engage in arms-length sales of their oil pay \nroyalties only on the actual amount they receive; creating reasonable \ndeductions for transportation costs; and resolving the treatment of \nmarketing costs. I continue to urge the Department to consider these \nrecommendations as it addresses the final rule.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, so we will have all Senators on record \nvoting either for or against the Hutchison amendment, I move to table \nthe Hutchison amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion \nto table.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1603. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) \nand the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced, yeas 2, nays 96, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 267 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--2\n\n     Byrd\n     Gregg\n       \n\n                                NAYS--96\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     McCain\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the present order of business, of course, \nis a continuing debate on the Hutchison amendment. There will be a \ncloture motion filed on that amendment that will ripen either Monday or \nTuesday; I am not certain which. The Senator from California has \njustifiably, in defending her position, asked for assurances that there \nwill not be a cloture motion filed on the whole bill, which could \ntheoretically deprive her of her right to continue debate until some \nconclusion with respect to the Hutchison amendment.\n  I assure her that will not take place. Her amendment will be disposed \nof one way or another--either by the adoption of cloture and the \neventual vote on the amendment, or by a failure of cloture and its \nwithdrawal before any cloture motion will be filed on the bill as a \nwhole. In fact, I can say I don't see any reason or need that we should \nhave to file cloture on the bill as a whole. We are making good \nprogress on it. There are other amendments we can discuss and vote on \ntoday, and perhaps even on Monday, so it may very well be that the \ndisposition of her amendment is the last significant matter.\n  In any event, I assure her that her rights will be protected, and \nthat, of course, is a necessary precondition to my asking unanimous \nconsent to set the Hutchison amendment aside and go on to other \namendments. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, has such an \namendment. So I hope with that assurance, it is sufficient that we can \ngo forward on another subject.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nbeing so gracious in preserving my rights. My friend from Texas and I \nfeel equally strongly on the point, just on different sides. I think \neach of us wants to have justice done on the amendment. So I want to \nreiterate what my friend stated so we all agree that this is the \nprocedure. There will be a cloture motion filed on the Hutchison \namendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A vote will be held Monday or Tuesday, or perhaps later, \nat whatever date it ripens. Then, in any case, there will not be a \ncloture vote on the entire bill until the cloture vote on the Hutchison \namendment is held.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much. With that, I do not object \nto laying the amendment aside.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hutchison \namendment be laid aside and the Senator from New Jersey be recognized \nto propose an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1571\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds made available by this Act to \nauthorize, permit, administer, or promote the use of any jawed leghold, \ntrap, or neck snare in any unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System)\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], for himself, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Moynihan, \n     and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 1571.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 62, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1 _. USE OF TRAPS AND SNARES IN NATIONAL WILDLIFE \n                   REFUGES.\n\n       None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to \n     authorize, permit, administer, or promote the use of any \n     jawed leghold trap or neck snare in any unit of the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System, except for the purpose of research, \n     subsistence, conservation, or facilities protection.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I have been informed that members of his party are in a \npolicy meeting and would like to defer any vote on this amendment to a \ntime certain--2 o'clock. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If, indeed, it is required to have a rollcall vote, \nthat would be OK. I have some expectation that it might not be \nrequired.\n  Mr. GORTON. It seems to me to be appropriate to say, for Members, \nthat there won't be another rollcall vote prior to 2 o'clock, and we \nhope by that time we will have completed debate on the Torricelli \namendment and deal with it either by rollcall or voice vote at the \nnecessary time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, trapping has been \npart of the American economic and cultural life before there was a \nUnited States, whether for recreational purposes or subsistence----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield? I don't want to interrupt, but \nthis is so crucial, and I am with him on it.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to correct myself and make sure the Senator from \nWashington would allow me this chance and not on Senator Torricelli's \ntime. I wanted to say that I agree with the Senator that there would \nnot be a cloture vote on the bill until the Hutchison amendment was \nresolved. Those were his words. I didn't say it exactly in that way in \nmy agreement.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thought she did. In any event, that is the agreement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In remembering my words, I am in agreement with my \nfriend. I have no objection.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate deals \nwith the issue of trapping on Federal wildlife refuge lands. It \nrecognizes the reality that trapping has been part of the economic and \ncultural life of the United States for generations and, indeed, an \nimportant part of the economic life of many communities. But as \nanything else in life, there is a right and a wrong way to have \ntrappings on these Federal lands.\n  Overwhelmingly, trappers on Federal lands are using relatively humane \nmethods of trappings that ensure the death of the animal so that there \nis no suffering. But in a small minority of these instances there are \nparticularly egregious types of traps that continue to be used on \nFederal lands though many States have banned them for years. Most \negregious of all are steel-jaw leg-hold traps and neck snares. These \ntraps almost assure the suffering of an animal. The legislation before \nthe Senate would ban these two specific types of traps and no others--\ntraps used in a small minority of the trapping industry and no others, \nand not for all purposes.\n  Trapping for research is not included in this amendment. All \nscientific research can continue with any traps.\n  Subsistence: Many Native American tribes that live off these traps--\nlive off the game they collect--should not be impacted and are not \nimpacted.\n  Facilities protection, or conservation: For any of those purposes, \ntrappers are free to use whatever type of traps they would like. But \nfor recreational purposes or other subsistence purposes, we would ban \nthese two specific types of traps.\n  I know some Senators have raised the question of whether or not \nbanning any traps would cause a problem for the Government itself in \nmaintaining stocks, endangered species, or other legitimate purposes of \nthe Government itself.\n  It is important to note that Secretary Babbitt was asked to address \nthis question, and he wrote:\n\n       The amendment would not impact the ability of the U.S. Fish \n     and Wildlife Service to manage refuges under the Organic Act \n     of 1997.\n\n  Specifically, therefore, Secretary Babbitt had given testimony that \nbanning these traps would not contradict the lawful purposes of the \nU.S. Government.\n  It should also be noted that it is not a new issue for the States. It \nis not a new issue for the Congress. The House of Representatives on \nJuly 14 was confronted with the identical issue on whether or not these \ntwo specific traps should be banned for these narrow purposes. By a \nvote of 259 to 166, with 89 Members of the Republican majority, it \noverwhelmingly passed this same prohibition.\n  The question arises: Why have the States, why has the House of \nRepresentatives, and why have so many of our colleagues expressed \nconcern and support on this floor about a ban on these two specific \nforms of traps?\n  A leg-hold trap is simply designed to trap an animal by its leg with \nthe force of this steel jaw and hold the animal until the trapper \nreturns. There are several problems with this very old, very tested, \nbut very cruel technology. The trapper may not return for days, or a \nweek, in which case the animal starves to death, becomes dehydrated, \nand suffers over a period of days and days and days.\n  Second, the extraordinary power of this trap is nearly certain to \ncause a laceration, or to break the leg of the animal. The animal \nsuffers. As is the case with 80 or 90 percent of these traps, the trap \ncatches the wrong animal. It is not the animal the trapper wants. It is \nsome other animal. If it were a live cage, as overwhelmingly trappers \nuse, the trappers would then release to the wild the animal that was \nunwanted. But in 80 or 90 percent of the cases the trapper has an \nanimal that he didn't even want. The leg is now broken, or the animal \nis bleeding to death. It cannot be released to the wild. And an \nunwanted species is destroyed for no purpose when another technology--a \nlive-bait trap, which most trappers use--would have avoided the whole \nproblem.\n\n  Even crueler, what is often happening is, these animals caught in the \nleg-hold trap for days and the trapper does not return are chewing off \ntheir own legs--destroying themselves to get free. The reality is that \nit is destroying unwanted species, with extraordinary suffering, with \nanimals maiming themselves, and for absolutely no reason.\n  This legislation, I repeat, does not deal with scientific reasons, \nsubsistence reasons for Native American tribes, or other scientific \npurposes. It is only for recreation. It is only for a minority of \ntrappers. It is only for these two kinds of traps, and it only deals \nwith wildlife refuges.\n  What kind of wildlife refuges are the United States maintaining if we \nare to allow these particularly egregious and cruel types of traps? \nThese are refuges. They are set up for the safety and maintenance of an \nanimal species. It allows trapping and harvesting of species, but not \nwith this one particularly cruel kind of trap. That is the purpose of \nthe amendment.\n  Only 1 out of every 10 species actually gets caught in these traps. \nIt is the intended species--1 in 10.\n  I brought before you a protected species of bird caught in a leg-hold \ntrap. No one was trying to trap an eagle. No one wanted to do so. It \nwas unlawful. There is no purpose in doing so. But the trap doesn't \ndiscriminate. When the trapper arrives, what is he to do? The leg of \nthis bird is broken. You can do nothing but kill this animal, though it \nwas no one's intention.\n  This has been endorsed by the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation, the American Animal Hospital Association, hunting groups, \nand sportsmen. The States of California, Arizona, Colorado, and \nMassachusetts have already passed statewide ballot initiatives banning \nthese specific traps. Florida, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have \nlegislative or administrative bans. Eighty-\n\n[[Page S10667]]\n\neight nations--virtually the entire industrialized world--developed \nnations, all have banned these traps. We, and we alone, use them. And \nwe are not only using them, we are using them in wildlife refuges that \nwe have had set up for 100 years to protect these animals. How could \nanyone rise in defense of this trap?\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join the House of \nRepresentatives and the various States and impose this narrow \nprohibition on these two specific traps for these narrow recreational \npurposes and on these Federal lands. It is a modest request for what is \nan egregious problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose this amendment. I \nthink it sets a bad precedent because I think it is bad politics.\n  I just came back from my State, as most of us did, and talked to my \nagricultural producers. We have a predator problem in Montana.\n  Let me tell you about a conversation I had with a good friend in \nGlasgow, MT. They are sheep producers. They run from the Fort Peck \nReservoir south towards Circle, MT. That is McCone Valley and Roosevelt \nCounty. They have trapped and killed 90 coyotes on their ranch, and \nthey are still run over with them.\n  This lies along the CMR Wildlife Refuge in Montana along the Missouri \nRiver. Those sheep are smart enough to stay in that refuge. The only \ntime we can get them is when they come out. They lose about 300 lambs a \nday. I don't know how many people can sustain that much loss.\n  But this particular trap is sort of needed, whether it be in the use \nof predator control, whether it be used on the refuge, or on BLM or \nprivate land.\n  I said yesterday that on one of the amendments one of these days this \nbody is going to be hit by a large bolt of common sense. Then I don't \nknow what is going to happen. We will not know how to deal with things \nhere.\n  But I will tell you that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opposes \nthis amendment. They are the ones who manage the refuge systems.\n  The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies that \nrepresents the 50 fish and wildlife agencies and conservation groups--\nwhich includes the Izaak Walton League of America--all oppose this \namendment. They oppose it for the simple reason that we get a little \nloose with definitions.\n  I think the point is that nobody likes to see the suffering and \ncatching the wrong animal in the wrong trap. I would question the 80 to \n90 percent wrong animal figure. I would question that because no \ntrapper I know, whether they did it as a sportsman for recreation, \nwhether they did it to prevent predation on livestock, or whether they \ndid it for a living, worth his salt, who knows how to trap, has figures \nsimilar to this. There is none that I know. And we have quite a few of \nthem in my State.\n\n  So I ask we oppose and defeat this amendment. It is taking away some \nof those tools that do not meet the definition. We say, if States OK it \nfor recreation, then define recreation. We know it has a habit of \nspilling over into areas where, if we cannot use these traps to prevent \npredation, then we are again put at the mercy of predators, of which we \nhave many.\n  Businesses cannot sustain those losses. Maybe no one cares whether \nbusinesses sustain themselves or not. Let's face it; they have human \nfaces, too, in this situation. So I rise in opposition to this \namendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nMontana. I want the Senate to know this amendment would seriously harm \na vital sector of the rural Alaskan economy. It would injure greatly \nthose who follow the Alaskan way of life.\n  We are very much involved with this amendment. What it seeks to do is \nend trapping in the Federal wildlife refuges. There are some exceptions \nin the Senator's amendment for research, conservation, facilities \nprotection, and subsistence.\n  Let me point out this chart I have. There are 77 million acres of \nwildlife refuge in our State; 85 percent of all the wildlife refuge in \nthe country is in Alaska.\n  The amendment seeks to absolutely discard the concepts of sound game \nmanagement principles. As the Senator from Montana stated, the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, the International Association of Fish and \nWildlife Agencies, which represent State fish and game managers \nthroughout the country, have opposed the amendment because it limits \nthe ability to manage wildlife populations scientifically. The Fish and \nWildlife Service wrote me a letter on July 20 explaining the Service's \nopposition to the House amendment in detail. This is a very serious \nthing. I am disturbed when my colleague talks about recreational \ntrapping.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service recognizes that the core of its mission \nis wildlife management. In its letter to me, the Fish and Wildlife \nService stated that:\n\n       . . . a prohibition of specific animal restraint devices is \n     not in the best interest of sound wildlife management.\n\n  The Department of Fish and Game of my State of Alaska also stated \nthis amendment hinders the ability of wildlife managers to do their \njob. It said:\n\n       We have consistently supported trapping as an important \n     tool in managing the national wildlife refuge system.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game, Division of \n           Wildlife Conservation,\n                                        Juneau, AK, July 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I am writing to express my concern \n     over house approved language amending the FY2000 Interior \n     Appropriation Bill (HR2466) that restricts the use of leghold \n     traps and neck snares on National Wildlife Refuges. I \n     understand similar language may be introduced soon on the \n     senate floor. If that language is introduced, I encourage you \n     to vote no and to remove the house passed language in \n     conference committee.\n       Commercial, recreational, subsistence, and nuisance animal \n     trapping have never been classified in regulation as separate \n     uses because pelts are acquired, traded, or sold and enter \n     commerce through all of these uses. Therefore, it is \n     meaningless to separate commercial and recreational \n     activities from other types of trapping for purposes of \n     managing the refuge system.\n       Trapping on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska is \n     important to our department because the activity helps us \n     track furbearer populations in areas not often frequented by \n     members of the public, especially during winter when weather \n     can have severe impacts on animal populations. We have \n     consistently supported trapping as an important tool in \n     managing the National Wildlife Refuge system and the Wildlife \n     Refuge Improvement Act of 1996 recognizes the importance of \n     that tool.\n       Eighty-five percent of all lands in the National Wildlife \n     Refuge system are in Alaska. The opportunity to trap and \n     snare furbearers on these lands is essential to our rural \n     culture and the lifestyle of families living in remote \n     villages. Many people in these areas have seasonal incomes, \n     and trapping plays a critical role in supplementing that \n     income with cash obtained from a local resource when jobs are \n     nonexistent. If trapping and snaring are prohibited on these \n     refuges, the impact would be disastrous economically, as well \n     as culturally, to the people of Alaska.\n       Thank you for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Wayne Regelin,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the House of \n     Representatives recently adopted an amendment by Congressman \n     Sam Farr to the Interior Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2466) \n     concerning trapping on National Wildlife Refuges. We \n     anticipate that this issue may arise during Senate \n     consideration.\n       The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opposes this amendment. \n     We believe national legislation directing a prohibition of \n     specific animal restraint devices is not in the best interest \n     of sound wildlife management. The enclosed statement explains \n     our opposition to this amendment.\n       We would be happy to respond to any questions or provide \n     any further information that may be helpful as you consider \n     this matter.\n       Identical letters have been sent to the Honorable Robert C. \n     Byrd, Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Interior and \n     Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United States \n     Senate; the Honorable\n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\n     Slade Gorton, Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior and Related \n     Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate; \n     the Honorable John Breaux, United States Senate; the \n     Honorable John H. Chafee, Chairman, Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works, United States Senate; the Honorable Frank \n     H. Murkowski, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, United States Senate; the Honorable Jeff Bingaman, \n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, United States Senate; the Honorable Max Baucus, \n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works, United States Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Rogers,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, these agencies agree wildlife managers \nrely upon commercial trappers to control invasive and nuisance species, \nas well as normal predators. In Alaska, Federal and State wildlife \nmanagers rely on these trappers to control predators in order to \nmaintain healthy moose and caribou herds, for instance. Moose and \ncaribou are major subsistence species, and a ban on this trapping would \nharm subsistence hunters by creating more competition for subsistence \nresources.\n  Another example is the Aleutian-Canada goose. This species was listed \nunder the Endangered Species Act after foxes were introduced on the \nAleutian Islands. At first, the refuge managers tried to poison the \nfoxes until EPA banned the poison. Then they hired local trappers to \nsave the goose, and trappers have successfully controlled the fox \npopulation, restoring the Aleutian-Canada goose.\n  Our Alaska Department of Fish and Game relies upon data from trappers \nto track remote populations, where the agency cannot afford to have \nbiologists, through this area that is one-fifth the size of the United \nStates. I know proponents of the amendment argue that more humane \nmethods are available. But the trouble is the methods cost 10 times as \nmuch and will not work, and we do not have the people to pursue those \nmethods. A $2 snare trap works much better than a $30 conibear trap \nthat freezes in the snow. A trapper can vary the size, location, \ntension, bait, scent, screening, and seasonal timing of a trap to \ntarget specific animals.\n  These unfortunate concepts that have been mentioned by the Senator of \nthe birds that have been trapped--no one seeks that. I do not believe \nthat is a normal result of trapping, particularly in our very wild \ncountry.\n  The amendment purports to contain a subsistence exemption. I want to \nexplain that a little bit to the Senate. In 1980, the Congress \nspecifically allowed those who reside in the area of wildlife refuges \nin Alaska to use refuge lands for subsistence hunting. Most of the \ntrappers in our States are, in fact, subsistence hunters.\n  Many Native Alaskans trap for subsistence and they generate cash \nincome from the pelts they take. This permits trapping only for \nsubsistence, but not for the commercial side of that operation. These \npeople are not in trapping for recreation. They are trapping not only \nfor the food they obtain but also for the cash they derive from the \ntrapping activities. That cash is one of the main sources of income for \npeople who live in the rural area of Alaska.\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, which added 53 million acres, in one act of Congress, \nto the wildlife refuge system, the National Wildlife System, on lands \nwithin our State. Among the new Federal lands added by that act were \nthe Innoko, Kanuti, and Koyukuk; almost 9 million acres of land, the \nsize of New Hampshire and Connecticut together. Congress specifically \nrecognized the furbearer resources of those refuges when it passed that \nact which we call ANILCA.\n  This amendment will essentially repeal the Alaska National Interest \nLand Conservation Act concept of permitting trapping by prohibiting the \nharvesting of resources in a way that currently is recognized by law. \nIn Alaska, licensed trappers earn about $7 million annually, mostly \nfrom marten, lynx, and beaver. It may not sound like a lot of money to \nMembers of Congress, but within these refuges in our State lies the \nmost poor census district in the country; that is, the Wade Hampton \nDistrict in the Yukon Delta Refuge. That stretches over 22 million \nacres. It's the largest refuge in the United States and the largest of \nthe 16 refuges in Alaska. It is, I would say to my friend from New \nJersey, four times the size of New Jersey.\n\n  The refuge contains 42 Native Alaska villages and tens of thousands \nof people, mostly Natives. Like many others in Alaska, most of these \npeople rely on subsistence lifestyle, which includes commercial \ntrapping, as I have said.\n  I have received letters from a number of villages on or near refuges, \nincluding Ruby, Mountain Village, and Quinhagak. They point out to me \nthat trapping keeps predators in check so the other game animals on \nwhich they rely will flourish. They also point out how the only \nnongovernment jobs available in the winter are trapping jobs and they \nwould rather trap and sell the fur than sit idle and collect welfare \nchecks. As a matter of fact, we in Congress have mandated they do just \nthat; they go to work.\n  When we passed the welfare reform we required these people to go to \nwork. Now this amendment would outlaw the only jobs that are available \nfor these people in this very remote area of Alaska.\n  The amendment also makes a value judgment about the way these \nAlaskans have lived for generations. This bothers me greatly. For \ndecades, in many cases centuries, our Alaskan Native people have lived \noff the land. They have been joined by a great many non-Alaskan people, \nby the way. The Federal law guarantees both non-Natives as well as \nNatives the right to a subsistence lifestyle, and to trap within these \nareas if they reside in the area of the refuge. When others tell \nAlaskan hunters, trappers, and fishermen how to manage our resources, \nthey are literally telling them how to live their lives.\n  We have a great deal of respect and admiration for our wildlife, \nprobably more than any I know. This includes trappers who, \nincidentally, have a very strict code of ethics. I want to have that \nprinted in the Record. I am not sure many people realize these trappers \nhave come together and put up, even before this issue arose, an ethics \ncode.\n  That code encourages trappers to act humanely, to concentrate on \nareas with overabundant population, and to share information that they \nobtained with the wildlife managers. In other words, each one of them \nis a volunteer on a wildlife refuge to assist in the scientific \nmanagement of the areas that are set aside in our State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the code of ethics be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Code of Ethics--A Trapper's Responsibility\n\n       1. Respect the other trapper's ``grounds''--particularly \n     brushed, maintained traplines with a history of use.\n       2. Check traps regularly.\n       3. Promote trapping methods that will reduce the \n     possibility of catching nontarget animals.\n       4. Obtain landowners' permission before trapping on private \n     property.\n       5. Know and use proper releasing and killing methods.\n       6. Develop set location methods to prevent losses.\n       7. Trap in the most humane way possible.\n       8. Dispose of animal carcasses properly.\n       9. Concentrate trapping in areas where animals are \n     overabundant for the supporting habitat.\n       10. Promptly report the presence of diseased animals to \n     wildlife authorities.\n       11. Assist landowners who are having problems with \n     predators and other furbearers that have become a nuisance.\n       12. Support and help train new trappers in trapping ethics, \n     methods and means, conservation, fur handling, and marketing.\n       13. Obey all trapping regulations, and support strict \n     enforcement by reporting violations.\n       14. Support and promote sound furbearer management.\n       The Code of Ethics is reprinted from the Alaska Trappers \n     Manual. The manual was created in a joint effort by the \n     Alaska Trappers Association and the Alaska Department of Fish \n     and Game.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nrespect the needs of these wildlife managers and the traditional \nlifestyle of our Western States, as well as to respect the basic \nconcepts of the Alaska lifestyle.\n  Let me add just a few statistics before I close.\n  Our State has 365 million acres. As I said, we are one-fifth the size \nof all the lands of the United States. These 16\n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\nwildlife refuges have 77 million acres. They are more than 20 percent \nof Alaska. More than one-fifth of our State, which is one-fifth of the \nNation, has been set aside in refuge land.\n  Congress specifically recognized the need for this type of harvesting \nof resources in the 1980 act. We believe the impact of this amendment, \nif adopted, would deny our Alaskan people the protection that was \nassured by Congress at the time this vast acreage was set aside as \nwildlife refuge areas.\n  I want to quote from a book written by a friend, John McPhee. Some \npeople may recognize John. He wrote a book, called ``Coming Into The \nCountry,'' about Alaska. It was a book that received acclaim from all \nsides of issues pertaining to Alaska, those who agree with us as well \nas Alaskans who basically agree with John McPhee and his outlook.\n  He told a story of one woman in Alaska, and he said this:\n\n       Ginny looks through Alaska Magazine, where her attention is \n     arrested by letters from the Lower 48. ``There was a time \n     when man was justified in taking wildlife,'' she reads aloud, \n     ``for then man's survival was at stake, but that time is long \n     gone. . . .'' She slaps the magazine down on the table. \n     ``They don't understand,'' she says. . . .''These people who \n     write these letters are not even rational. They say we're out \n     to kill everything. People in the Lower 48 do not understand \n     Alaska. . . . They wonder how Alaskans get their mail, and \n     what they do in the winter. They can't believe anything can \n     grow here. They're amazed we can't buy any land. They think \n     Indians are Eskimos. They know nothing about Alaska and yet \n     they've been manipulating us for years. We thought Statehood \n     would put an end to that. They don't understand trapping. \n     They don't understand the harvesting of animals.''\n\n  That is the type of comment I get when I go home. People in Alaska \nconstantly tell me: Those people you work with in the Congress just \ndon't understand us. They have asked me to stand up and try to explain \nto the Senate what the Alaska lifestyle is.\n  That is hard for a lawyer, a person who has been here 30 years now, \nto continue to try to convince succeeding generations, those who have \ncome after me, that Alaska is still that way. For the most part, Alaska \nis natural wilderness, and dispersed throughout that wilderness are \nsome 700,000 people. The bulk of the people out of the cities live the \nAlaska lifestyle. They hunt for their food. They trap to obtain furs as \nwell as food, but the furs give them a cash flow of income. That is \nsupplemented by our own Alaska system of what we call a permanent fund \ndividend. Without the income they obtain from hunting, these people \nwould not be able to survive.\n  In this area, hunting is done by trapping. If you take away the \ntraps, they will go back to shooting them. This bill does not ban guns. \nWhat it would do is go back to the day before traps were recognized as \na scientific management concept, and animals will be shot. For every \ntime there is a miss, it is much worse than one being caught and having \na leg broken in a trap because that animal is wandering off forever.\n  The wildlife managers have told us, if you are going to harvest these \nanimals, the best way to do it is with these traps following the code \nof ethics that has been adopted by the trappers themselves, with the \napproval, by the way, of the wildlife managers.\n  I can tell you without any question that I have urged every Member of \nthe Senate by a personal letter to vote no on this amendment. This is \nnot the way to change the concept of scientific management of the lands \nthat we have set aside as wildlife refuges. It is not the way to change \nbasically the Alaska lifestyle. Eighty-five percent or more of its \nimpact is in our State. We would be devastated if this concept is \nadopted. I urge this amendment be defeated.\n  I serve notice that I will ask for a rollcall vote on this amendment. \nWhen the time is appropriate, I will make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Torricelli. I listened carefully to the statement of my \ncolleague from the State of Alaska. Having visited his State several \ntimes, I acknowledge they have an extraordinary situation that is \nunlike perhaps any other State across this Nation. I hope he will take \ninto consideration what Senator Torricelli's amendment seeks to do is \nto really limit the use of this trap on national wildlife refuges.\n  I am not sure exactly how one would define a refuge, but in my way of \nthinking, it is akin to a shelter. It is something that has really been \ndesigned by law to provide a special kind of protection that might not \notherwise be available to wildlife. That is why Senator Torricelli's \namendment, I believe, is so appropriate because it is limited to the \nwildlife refuge and, secondly, it makes exceptions.\n  I understand what Senator Stevens has said, that the subsistence \nexception would not cover commercial trapping on wildlife refuges, but \nI say to the Senator from Alaska, I think perhaps other forms of \ntrapping should be used rather than this form.\n  I know the Senator from New Jersey is going to take the floor again \nand make a part of the Record a letter which was received after the \nletter quoted by the Senator from Alaska. I have a copy of it, and I \nwill read from it. It is a letter from the Secretary of the Department \nof the Interior, Bruce Babbitt. It is written to the House sponsor of \nthis legislation. It is very brief, and I will read it into the Record:\n\n       Dear Mr. Farr:\n       I am responding to your letter requesting the Department's \n     position on your amendment relating to the use of certain \n     kinds of traps on national wildlife refuges. The letter dated \n     July 20, 1999, from Mr. John Rogers and the enclosed effect \n     statement do not represent the position of the Department of \n     the Interior. After careful consideration, I can advise you \n     that your amendment--\n\n  The Farr amendment--\n\n     and the Torricelli amendment, which is identical, would not \n     impact the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     manage refuges under the Organic Act of 1997. Accordingly, \n     the Department does not take a position on your amendment.\n\n  I say to those who are following this debate, the earlier reference \nto a letter of July 20 was superseded by a letter on July 23 from the \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior who said they will not take \na position on the amendment and the Torricelli and Farr amendment do \nnot in any way impact their ability to manage wildlife refuges.\n  I also remind those following the debate of Senator Torricelli's \nstatement that some 88 nations across the world have already banned \nthis form of trap. Many people are critical of Senators from New Jersey \nand Illinois who try to make comment on the way people live in the \nWest. My friend from Montana, Senator Burns, occasionally calls me \naside when I offer these amendments related to Montana and the West and \nspeaks of his Midwestern friends who do not quite understand the \nlifestyle of the West. I will concede, by classic definition, I am from \na sodbuster State. I may not understand all the things that are part of \nthe lifestyle of the West, but I call the attention of those who are \nconsidering this amendment to statements made in the press in Western \nStates about these steel-jawed leghold traps.\n  Arizona, the Arizona Republic, February 7, 1993:\n\n       Outlawing the barbaric, needlessly cruel steel trap--a \n     device that tortures animals to death--should no longer be a \n     matter of serious dispute.\n\n  The Arizona Tribune, 1994:\n\n       No need for extremists to exaggerate what happens to an \n     animal when a trap's steel jaws slam shut on it. It's more \n     than inhumane; it's heinous.\n\n  Colorado, October 15, 1996, the Boulder Daily Camera:\n\n       The trapper hides the equivalent of a land mine in wildlife \n     habitat and ``harvests'' whatever has the rotten luck to step \n     in it.\n\n  From the Californian, October 8, 1998:\n\n       Laying a trap that statistically is more likely to maim or \n     kill an animal other than the one being hunted is wasteful, \n     inhumane, and cruel.\n\n  The Tucson Citizen 1993, Arizona:\n\n       Steel-jaw traps are cruel devices that subject animals--\n     sometimes family pets--to mutilation or slow and painful \n     death. And they pose a threat to people who use public lands \n     for recreation. . . . Steel-jaw traps have no place in a \n     civilized world, particularly on public lands.\n\n  Those were statements not from some bleeding heart eastern journals \nbut from newspapers from the West--Arizona, Colorado, California--areas \nwhere I think they have even more familiarity with this than some \nMembers of the Senate might themselves.\n  I have a couple photographs to demonstrate how these traps are used. \nYou can see from this photograph that the\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\ncat has had the misfortune of coming across a steel trap and its paw \nhas been trapped inside. From what we have been told, it might be a day \nor two or maybe even more before the person who set this trap comes to \ndecide what to do with the animal that is included. I don't know if \nthis was the target animal this trapper was looking for. My guess is \nthat this animal will be in pain and suffering until that trapper shows \nup on the scene to either release it or kill it.\n  Here is another photograph. It appears to be a fox trapped as well. \nThere is evidence that many of the animals that are caught in these \ntraps, in pain, in desperation chew off their own limbs to try to \nescape. Of course, as they hobble around the wilderness, they may not \nlast long either.\n  These are basically and fundamentally inhumane. For us to allow them \nin wildlife refuges, I think, is a serious mistake. The amendment by \nthe Senator from New Jersey is a reasonable one. It allows exceptions \nfor research, subsistence, which the Senator from Alaska has alluded \nto, conservation, and facility protection.\n  When the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, told the story of those in \nMontana who were trying to protect their flocks of sheep from coyotes \nthat came out of the wildlife refuge, as I understand the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Jersey, there would be no prohibition against \ntheir setting these traps on their own property to protect their flock \nfrom these predatory animals. The Torricelli amendment alludes only to \nputting these traps in wildlife refuges. I think, frankly, that is a \nline that should be drawn and one that I support.\n  As I have said, Secretary Bruce Babbitt has written to the Senate \nindicating the Torricelli amendment would have no adverse impact on the \nmanagement of the Fish and Wildlife Service on refuges. The House has \napproved this amendment overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. Eighty-\neight nations and a number of States have made it clear that this \nbarbaric device has no place in wildlife management.\n  I urge support for the Torricelli amendment and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment \noffered by Senator Torricelli to the Interior Appropriations Act \nconcerning leghold traps. This is a sensible and narrowly tailored \namendment that will address the misuse of tax dollars to promote cruel, \ncommercial trapping programs on the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n  This amendment will prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to administer \nor promote the use of steel-jawed leghold traps or neck snares for \ncommerce in fur or recreation on National Wildlife Refuges. Our \namendment would not limit the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService to manage our National Wildlife Refuges.\n  I am proud to say that my State of California banned the use of \nsteel-jawed leghold traps last year when voters overwhelmingly approved \na ballot initiative related to trapping. Californians recognized not \nonly that these traps are inhumane, but also non-selective. In other \nwords, these traps often result in the death of many animals that are \nnot the targets of the traps.\n  In its 1998 Environmental Document on trapping, the California \nDepartment of Fish and Game cited several state studies showing a high \nnumber of non-target species being caught. In Colusa County, 26 target \nmuskrats and 19 non-target animals; in Tehema County, seven target \ncoyotes and 85 non-target animals; in San Diego County, 42 target \nbobcats and 91 non-target species.\n  Mr. President, these numbers are astonishing, and they demonstrate to \nus beyond a shadow of a doubt that these traps are abhorrent devices. \nWhether they are hunting dogs, family pets, bald eagles, deer, or other \nanimals, there are countless untold victims of these traps. They have \nrightly been likened to ``land mines'' for wildlife, catching any \nanimal that triggers them.\n  It is shocking that these traps are allowed in our country at all, \nespecially given that 88 nations throughout the world bar their use. \nBut it is even more horrifying to think that American tax dollars go to \nadminister trapping programs on our nation's wildlife refuges.\n  I looked up the word ``refuge'' in the American College Dictionary. \nIt defines refuge as (1) ``a place of shelter, protection, or \nsafety,'', or (2) ``anything to which one has recourse for aid, relief \nor escape.''\n  It is plainly contradictory to allow the commercial killing of \nwildlife on places called wildlife refuges. It is worse to allow the \nuse of barbaric traps on refuges. And it is shocking to Americans to \nhave their hard-earned dollars finance this hoax. The Torricelli \namendment goes very far to be reasonable and accommodating.\n  It does not bar trapping on refuges. It does not even bar steel traps \nor neck snares on refuges, since the amendment specifically allows \nthese traps to be used for research, conservation, subsistence \ntrapping, or facilities protection. It simply bars these devices for \ncommerce or recreation.\n  This amendment should be adopted overwhelmingly. It makes sense. The \npolicy of allowing the financing of such programs is contradictory and \nwrong-headed. It should be no surprise that fully 83 percent of \nAmericans oppose using steel traps on refuges. Just last month, the \nHouse passed an identical amendment by an overwhelming margin. The \nDepartment of the Interior has no problem with this amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting the Torricelli amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it is basic in this institution, \nindeed in our Union, that each of us, as representatives of some \nStates, have respect for the economy, the culture, and the traditions \nof other States.\n  Indeed, this should not, and cannot, be a debate between Illinois and \nNew Jersey against Montana and Alaska. Disproportionately, this would \nimpact the great State of Alaska and several other Western States. \nBecause of the gracious invitation of the Senator from Alaska, I have \nvisited his State. I have been to Montana many times. I have enormous \nrespect for their traditions and their cultures. It is because of that \nfact that this amendment was so carefully designed.\n  Senator Burns has appropriately talked about the problem of ranchers \nand farmers who lose livestock and need to protect their own \nproperties. The Senator from Montana need not be concerned. The \nmanagement of species protection of those lands is exempt from this \namendment. Private lands are exempt from this amendment.\n  There is no greater advocate of native peoples than Senator Stevens. \nHe appropriately has talked about the need for subsistence of people \nwho live off the land. And while he has talked about the need to sell \nsome of those species, to the extent that he is concerned about the \nneed of people to trap for their own subsistence, he need not be \nconcerned. That is exempt from this amendment.\n  Maintenance of species, dealing with predatory animals, research are \nall exempt from this amendment. Private lands are all exempt from this \namendment.\n  We are talking about wildlife refuges set up by this Congress to \nprotect species from two specific traps. The question was raised by the \nSenator from Montana whether or not it was accurate that 80 percent of \nthe species caught in these traps are not the intended species. The \nlife of the animal lost is wasted because these specific traps cannot \ndistinguish between the fox or the mink or the coyote, whatever it is \nthat is being hunted, and another animal. Indeed, 80 percent, upon \nfurther research, is not accurate. In 1989, a study by Tomsa and Forbes \nfrom the Fourth Eastern Wildlife Damage Control proceedings found that \n11 nonintended animals were maimed or killed for every 1 that was being \nsought, 11 to 1.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have placed in the Record the statement prepared by \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service and a letter they sent to me on July 20. \nIn there is a statement about which I want to ask the Senator, my good \nfriend from New Jersey, a question. It says: As background, during the \nperiod 1992 to 1996, a total of 281 refuges conducted one or more \ntrapping programs, a total of 487 programs. Eighty-five percent of the \nmammal trapping programs on refuges were conducted for wildlife and \nfacilities management reasons--85 percent.\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\n The remaining 15 percent occurred primarily to provide recreational, \ncommercial, subsistence opportunities to the public, as portrayed by \nthe following table.\n  The Senator's amendment exempts all of the 85 percent. It affects \nonly those who are not government, those who live on the land.\n  I ask the Senator, what about the 85 percent of the trapping programs \nusing the same traps that will continue to be conducted by Federal and \nState managers? They have the same effect as the Senator complains of \nconcerning those that are private. Why should the Senator allow any \ntrapping if he believes as he does? The Federal managers, State \nmanagers are not prohibited from conducting 85 percent of the trapping \nin the wildlife refuges. This only prohibits those of the people who \nlive there, who reside there. Why would the Senator pick out those who \nearn money from trapping and say they cause more damage than the 85 \npercent of the trapping by Federal and State agencies?\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reclaiming my time, the Senator from Alaska cites an \ninteresting point, but it is one that has been done to accommodate \npeople concerned about trapping. Senator Burns has noted the problem of \nmaintaining stocks, of protecting ranchers. We have kept the power on \nthese lands to use these traps by government or private citizens or \nscientists or universities or trappers or anybody else, if it is to \nmanage the stocks, if it is to deal with predatory animals or research.\n  What is interesting about Senator Stevens' points is, to identify the \nextent of what this amendment does in order to minimize the impact on \nranchers, on the economy, on hunting, we are taking what in essence, by \nthe Senator's own statement, is only 15 percent of all the activity \nwith these traps, recognizing these traps only represent 10 or 15 \npercent of all trapping activity. We are dealing with 10 percent of 10 \npercent of trapping activity and then only on Federal wildlife lands.\n  Now, if the Senator from Alaska wants to offer an amendment to ban \nthese traps on all lands and by everybody and for all purposes, I can \nassure the Senator from Alaska, he will have my vote. I have narrowly \nconstructed this because I do not want to impact native peoples who are \non subsistence. I do not want to interfere with predatory animals. I do \nnot want to interfere with the management of these lands by the \nGovernment. My main purpose is to try to prohibit this for recreational \npurposes, only with these two traps, or other purposes where it is not \nnecessary to protect ranchers or other legitimate objectives.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has used the statistics for all trapping on \nFederal wildlife refuges in order to try to eliminate those who use \nthem for income, those who use them to pursue a lifestyle. I say to my \nfriend, does he think that is fair?\n  The wildlife managers use these traps. The statistics the Senator has \ncover all the programs on all of the wildlife refuges mainly, 85 \npercent, conducted by managers. But the Senator presumes that the \ndamage is done by the 15 percent. Does the Senator think it is fair to \nsay: Let's stop these people from using these traps because they harm \nthe animals that they trap? What about the 85 percent? They catch \nbirds. They catch foxes that eat their legs off. They catch other \nanimals other than the targeted species. But in terms of fairness, the \nSenator's amendment prohibits those who live by trapping.\n  Trapping is a management tool. I defend the 85 percent. I don't \noppose it. It is a management tool.\n  I wonder if the Senator knows that trapping of species such as red \nfox and racoons has saved the Hawaiian coot and duck and goose. They \nhave saved some of the indigenous species that live in these refuges \nfrom the predators they trap.\n  The predators they trap have a value. Those skins are sold for cash. \nI just ask the Senator, in fairness now, why should we say those people \nwho use traps for a living do all this damage? It is not fair, in my \nopinion.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. First, let me repeat my offer. If the Senator would \nlike, for the sake of fairness, to abandon this, not only by the \nmanagers of the land and recreational, but also commercial people, I \nwould be the first to vote for his amendment. This has been narrowly \nconstrued only for commercial purposes as an accommodation to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Now, I believe that, as you know, overwhelmingly, trappers are not \nusing these two traps. Overwhelmingly, they are using alternate kinds \nof technology that are not inhumane, are recognized internationally, \nand by most other States.\n  If, indeed, by further banning these, we can encourage others to use \nthese traps, I would be the first to do it. It is simply my belief that \npeople who are in this for cash business, they are trapping for furs, \ngetting cash for their furs, we have a right to ask them to spend the \nextra money to get different traps that either kill the animal outright \nor catch it alive and unhurt so it can be released and the wrong \nspecies are not caught. I think we can put that extra burden on a \nperson who is trapping for cash dollars to buy the different trap. The \nsubsistence people, who are eating the game they are trapping, are \nexempt from this, as the Senator knows--particularly native peoples who \nmay not be able to afford to do so, or it is in their tradition to do \nso. They are exempt.\n  So we are dealing with a minority of a minority, only on wildlife \nrefuge lands. I think that is fair; it is narrowly construed, and \nmostly to accommodate the Senator from Alaska. The Senator was probably \nunaware of this or he would not have put the earlier statement in the \nRecord, but after the letters the Senator submitted for the Record, \nSecretary Babbitt wrote to me as he did to Congressman Farr, making \nclear that ``The letter dated July 20, 1999, from Mr. John Rogers and \nthe enclosed effect statement do not represent the position of the \nDepartment of the Interior.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                        Washington, July 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Robert G. Torricelli,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Torricelli: I am responding to your request \n     for the Department's position on your amendment relating to \n     the use of certain kinds of traps on National Wildlife \n     Refuges. The letter dated July 20, 1999, from Mr. John Rogers \n     and the enclosed effect statement do not represent the \n     position of the Department of the Interior.\n       After careful consideration, I can advise you that your \n     amendment would not impact the ability of the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service to manage refuges under the Organic Act of \n     1997. Accordingly, the Department does not take a position on \n     your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have the highest regard for the Secretary of the \nInterior as a Secretary of the Interior. I don't accept him, however, \nas a wildlife manager. I have put in the Record a letter from the \nDirector of the Fish and Wildlife Service, a professional who has put \nover 30 years of his life into the management of wildlife refuges, and \nhe stands by his position. The letter that I have read to you was \nwritten after the Secretary of the Interior made his statement as a \npolitical figure, and the wildlife managers stand by their position. \nThey stand by their position that these traps are the best scientific \nway to manage wildlife on Federal refuges.\n  I really believe the Senator misinterprets my position. I want to \nmake sure we understand each other. I support the use of these traps \nfor wildlife management purposes, and I support the use of them for \nthose who want to trap for income. But I say to my friend, in terms of \nthe two types of traps that he would ban, those are traps that have \nbeen specifically approved by the wildlife managers. They are now \nopposed on a political level; I admit that. But what does the Senate \nwant to do in terms of wildlife refuges? Manage for political purposes, \nor manage the system as the scientifically trained managers tell us is \nthe best way to manage them?\n  We defend the fish and wildlife managers and the safe fish and game \ncommissioners. I say to my good friend, I accept the fact that he is \ndefending the political judgment of my good friend, the Secretary of \nthe Interior. I disagree with that, and I hope the Senate does also.\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. As the Senator knows, I have respect for him for his \nextraordinary advocacy in all interests of Alaska. We simply have a \ndifference of judgment on what is a relatively narrow matter. You have \npointed out that one-fifth of Alaska is in a Federal wildlife refuge. \nThat means in four-fifths of Alaska you can use any trap you want, any \nway you want, for any purpose you want. But on those lands set up as \nrefuges--20 percent of your State--in those few lands where, by \npolitical judgment, this institution in previous years decided it \nwanted wildlife to have a refuge, it is basic to the concept of a \nrefuge that we try to use, at least for the killing of animals, a \ntechnology that is understood and accepted to be relatively humane in \nthose lands and only for these narrow purposes.\n  For all the concerns that you legitimately bring and Senator Burns \nbrings about the destruction of livestock, or culture, people who live \non subsistence, they are free to do what they want, even in the refuge. \nIf we cannot make this narrow exception here, with a letter from the \nSecretary of the Interior making clear the position of his Department, \nsomething endorsed by the House of Representatives, by my party and 89 \nmembers of your party, by every other industrialized nation in the \nworld, and we alone are doing this, all I am asking--and it is \noverwhelmingly in the United States--if you want to use a leghold trap, \nthough it is inhumane and rejected by the rest of the world and most of \nthe Nation, you are free to do so under my amendment. For all these \npurposes, I ask that, in those few narrow lands, these two specific \ntraps be banned for these few narrow purposes. That is our fundamental \ndisagreement. But that is our only disagreement on that narrow point. I \nwanted to clarify that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, I say to my friend, I have \nthis map again to show to the Senate. Isn't it interesting that, \nhowever, the Senator's amendment affects 52 native villages in that one \narea, the Yukon Delta Refuge. The Senator says I can use the other \nfour-fifths of the land of the United States. These people have no \naccess at all. They are the lowest income people in the United States. \nThe effect of the Senator's amendment would limit them, even under \nsubsistence, to obtaining no more than $10,000.\n\n  I don't know if he understands that, but Federal law already limits \nsubsistence use when it is totally for subsistence, without a \ncommercial protection, to $10,000, in terms of barter concepts. But \nthese people can't go to these lands that are in yellow. Those are the \nother lands that are not affected. The lands affected are the lands in \nwhich they live.\n  Congress, in 1980, gave them the right to continue their lifestyle in \norder that they might continue to live. They live on fish and game \nresources, and they sell both to obtain cash income, very limited \namounts, on an individual basis. The total, altogether, is $7 million. \nBut the total out there is something like 70,000 people. When you look \nat it, you are saying, oh, yes, you can use traps, just go to downtown \nAnchorage now and get one of those newfangled traps, the ones that the \nenvironmental people say are safe and humane, but you can't use the one \nthat the scientific managers say are the most effective, not only to \ncarry out the business of obtaining their food and their cash income, \nbut to pursue our own objectives of limiting predators so we can \nprotect other wildlife.\n  I have a whole list of wildlife that have been protected by these \npeople who are subsistence hunters, who catch or trap these animals and \nsell the furs, but they do protect the migratory birds that come into \nthis vast area. The areas were not set aside to protect the animals \nbeing snared. They were set aside to protect migratory waterfowl. These \nare not wildlife refuges to protect the red fox, or anything else. They \nare for migratory waterfowl. You are telling them that they cannot use \nthese traps. As our volunteer agents, by the way, they are doing the \njob that it would take a thousand paid officials to do.\n  They are trapping the predators and selling their skins.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. So our colleagues are clear on this narrow difference \nthat we represent, two things have been said that deserve further \nattention.\n  One, if the trapping is to deal with a predator--and indeed this is \npart of the management of the refuge--my amendment does not affect \nthem. They can trap.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator want a permit every time they do it and \nhave the managers say this is for management purposes only?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Allow me to finish.\n  If it is a predator and it is for management of the species, they are \nfree to use any trap they want.\n  Second, it was appropriately pointed out if they are in the business \nof getting furs, they are in that cash business. My amendment would \nimpact them. However, if they are using these traps for subsistence for \ntheir own consumption, as the Senator knows, they are also exempt from \nmy amendment.\n  There is a great deal of debate on this floor for a great number of \npeople who have no relationship to my amendment.\n  We are dealing with two traps, one kind of land, narrowly defined, \nwith six exemptions. We are dealing with a fraction of a fraction of \nthe hunting that is going on, which will still leave the United States \nas the only developed nation in the world that is allowing the traps to \nbe overwhelmingly used. If we cannot take the narrow stand for the \nwildlife refuge, my guess is we can take no stand at all.\n  I yield the floor and I thank the Senator from Alaska for what has \nbeen an enlightening discussion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I heard this morning a brilliant \nstatement by the Senator from Hawaii to our Alaska Federation of \nNatives forum being conducted now.\n  One of the things he stated I want to repeat to the Senator from New \nJersey: Subsistence is not about eating. The Senator's amendment \npresumes subsistence means going out and obtaining food.\n  Subsistence is a way of life. Subsistence is the ability to hunt, \nfish, trade, or barter what they get for cash in order to live. It is \nmore than just obtaining an animal. The Senator's amendment says one \ncan continue to trap for subsistence and I believe he means for food. \nHe says once they sell the pelt, they are into commercial activities.\n  Our State fish and wildlife service recognizes that trapping for \nsubsistence is a legitimate activity. As a matter of fact, the \nexception in the Federal law is for subsistence hunters. They can trap \nin pursuing their subsistence lifestyle.\n  To think they could not then sell those animals, sell the pelts, or \nto put them in a position where they could only do so for wildlife \nmanagement purposes--which is the effect of the Senator's amendment--\noffends us. The people who rely on a subsistence lifestyle hunt, fish, \nand trap. They consume some of the fish, they consume the animals, and \nthey sell or use the remainder of what they catch--both mammals and \nfish--for their native arts and crafts.\n  They also carry out the purposes of wildlife management because they \nare, in fact, trapping the predators that would destroy the migratory \nwaterfowl--the foxes that eat the eggs, the other predators that eat \nthe birds. The area was set aside to protect the migratory waterfowl.\n  The Senator is saying they cannot use traps on these wildlife refuges \nthat were set aside to protect migratory waterfowl because these traps \ncatch some birds. The predators they catch considerably outnumber the \nimpact of the traps on migratory waterfowl. The Senator says they can \ndo it if it is for wildlife management purposes. There is no agent \nsetting traps because these people are setting traps. In effect, they \ncarry out the purposes of the management scheme by trapping the way the \nmanagers tell them to trap. They are using the traps that have been \napproved by the Federal and State system.\n  Along comes this amendment. It makes the judgment that two of those \ntraps are inhumane and should not be used by these people. It doesn't \nban the fish and wildlife managers from using them. It doesn't ban \nanyone from using them. It bans the 15 percent of the people who use \nthese traps. I don't intend to support banning anyone from using them \nas long as the fish and wildlife managers say this is scientifically \nthe best way to deal with both the predator\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\ncontrol and the objective of obtaining resources for maintaining the \nsubsistence lifestyle of these people.\n  These 52 native villages, I think the Senator knows, can only be \nreached by air in the wintertime. For the most part they are on rivers. \nDuring the summertime, visitors can travel to the villages but during \nthe winter trapping period, the only way to get to and from there is by \nair. Diesel costs $3 to $5 a gallon. And now the Senator would say they \ncan't sell those pelts? They can still catch the animals and eat them \nbut they can't sell them?\n  Those people are out there trapping simply for plain trapping \npurposes. That is their cash income. They are from one of the larger \nvillages, but they have a trapline. They have a permit. They are \nsupervised by somebody. They get approval of where they will set the \ntraps. They get approval of the type of traps they will use. That is \nwhat the wildlife management system brought to them. They live with \nthat. They made up the code of ethics as required by the Federal \nmanagers; they live by that. Why should the Congress of the United \nStates tell them they cannot carry out a lifestyle that the scientific \nmanager says is the correct way to manage those resources?\n  I think those who live in the East have the luxury of saying do \nsomething else. Go to the store and get another trap. That is not the \ncase. Most of the traps are very old. They are maintained by our \npeople. Many of them were made by them. The idea of saying they can \ncontinue trapping but go down to the store--there is not a Sears, \nRoebuck store nearby. You can't get the needed traps by mail order.\n  If you use these new traps, you can continue trapping, but you can't \nuse the ones you have been using.\n  It is amazing; the Senator's amendment hits about 95 percent of the \ntraps that are in use today on the wildlife refuges. Does the Senator \nknow that?\n  I say to my friend, I could not oppose this more, not only on the \nbasis of being the Senator from Alaska but on the basis of scientific \nmanagement. As much respect as I have for the Secretary of the \nInterior--I was assistant to the Secretary of the Interior and the \nsolicitor general counsel to the Interior Department in the Eisenhower \nadministration, but in my day we relied upon scientific managers and \ndid not reverse them for political purposes. That, I think, is what the \nSenator is defending, which I oppose.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I believe we have defined the issue \nappropriately and at length. That ultimately is where we now differ. \nThe technology of trapping has clearly moved. Eighty-five percent of \nthose who are trapping in the country are not using these traps. The \nlargest States in the Nation have now banned these traps, as have other \nnations.\n  What remain are those few on Federal wildlife refuge lands who \ncontinue to use these two traps identified as inhumane who would \nadmittedly, as Senator Stevens suggested, for purposes where they are \nin the cash business of killing the animal and getting the fur, have to \nchange to use other traps. If they are eating the food, they can use \nthe same trap. If it is against predators, they can use the same trap. \nIf they are in management for wildlife species, they can use the same \ntrap. If they are going to sell the fur and they are in the business of \nmaking money by doing so, they are going to have to move to a more \nhumane trap. That is as narrow as I know how to write this.\n  That is the issue. That is our difference. I commend it to the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I serve notice to the Senate that as the \nhour of 2 o'clock approaches, I will make a motion to table. I am \ninformed that other Senators wish to make statements. Therefore, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as we work to pass Interior appropriations, \nof course, because this is a piece of legislation that is key to so \nmany important areas of our States, whether they be east or west, it is \nalso an opportunity to attempt to change what is standard law or \npractice or belief in many of our States. The Torricelli amendment on \ntrapping is just that kind of amendment.\n  My guess is there are few Senators on the floor who have actually \never trapped. I grew up on a very rural ranch in southwestern Idaho, \nand at age 6 I began to run a trapline and I used legholding traps to \ncatch coyote and bobcats. That was done largely for the purpose of \nraising money, but it was also to protect our domestic livestock herds \nin the springtime when our cows began to calve and would find \nthemselves, oftentimes, having their baby calves harassed and killed by \ncoyotes.\n  I was taught how to trap, but I was also taught an important lesson \nin trapping. I will not dispute in any way what the Senator from New \nJersey might try to suggest is an inhumane approach, but I will suggest \nit can be used in a right and responsible way. The thing I was taught \nby my father and by an elderly gentleman who lived on our ranch who \ntaught me how to trap was that you check your trapline daily, so if an \nanimal is caught, it will not suffer. Of course that is exactly what I \ndid, and that is exactly what good trappers do throughout the West.\n  The reason I was allowed to do that and the reason trappers around \nthe country are allowed today to trap when and where necessary under \nthe appropriate circumstances is that responsibility always rested with \nState governments--State fish and game departments and State agencies. \nAnd because I believe, as most Senators do, that State agencies are \nmuch closer to the people and can more quickly respond to the needs of \na State or a given locale, that that is where that authority to \ndetermine policy ought to be--not with a Senator from New Jersey who \nwould not understand Idaho or any other Western State where the \nabundance of wildlife sometimes is such that it needs to be managed. He \nwould not understand the State of Idaho or Montana or Wyoming or Alaska \nworks very closely with their fish and game department to make sure \nlaws and regulations fit the need and the desire of the area under \nconcern.\n  Historically, this Government, our Government, the Federal \nGovernment, has said it is the responsibility of States to govern and \nmanage wildlife populations. They have said it for the very reason I \nhave just given, because a Congress and a Senate cannot really be in \ntune with what is necessary in Juneau, or out from Juneau in Alaska, or \nout from Jackson Hole in Wyoming, or out from Midvale in Idaho. They \ndon't really understand the circumstance if there is an infestation or \nlarge buildup of coyote, a killing of domestic livestock herds, and a \nreason to moderate and manage that wildlife population. That is why we \nhave allowed trapping and why States have consistently allowed it. We \nhave constantly erred on the humane side, of being responsible in the \nmanagement of our wildlife, as we should.\n  We have the responsibility of good stewardship. That is my job, that \nis every citizen's job, to be a good steward of their public land \nresources. But it is not our job here to try to fine tune and \nmicromanage because some interest group comes to us and suggests this \nis a good and right political thing to do, because it will sell well in \nsuburbia New York. It has no impact in New York. It has no impact \nwhatsoever in that State. But what might sell well and be a good, warm, \ntouchy-feely, ``I care'' kind of vote in New York causes all sorts of \nproblems in a rural Western State such as mine.\n  That is why, again, we have tried to take the emotions out of these \nissues and say there are categories of responsibility on which we ought \nto err and on which we ought not. This is an amendment that really \nshould not be debated on this floor. We have a U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService. They make every effort to be responsible in the effective \nmanagement of our wildlife. And they, while they have broad authority, \nwork directly with State fish and game departments. Historically, they \nhave always had a right and proper relationship, erring on the side of \nthe State and on the side of the area or\n\n[[Page S10674]]\n\nlocal fish and game management experts when making the kinds of \ndecisions that I believe arbitrarily the Senator is attempting to make \nwith his amendment.\n\n  That is why it is interesting that after this amendment passed the \nHouse, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wrote a letter to all of us \nsaying they would not support the House amendment. It was only when the \npolitics caught up with it that Bruce Babbitt, our Secretary of the \nInterior, came out and said that is not the position of the \nadministration. The reason it has not become the position of the \nadministration is because of a set of environmental groups that came \nforward and said this is our national cause and we need to make it a \nnational cause, totally ignoring what is good policy or what is a \nreasonable relationship between a State government and a State agency \nand the Federal Government and a Federal agency.\n  Interestingly enough, even with the position of the Secretary of the \nInterior, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has not changed its \nposition. It still believes the Torricelli amendment is the wrong \namendment, and the right thing to do is what they have done \nhistorically with State fish and game agencies.\n  What do I hear from my citizens? They want the right to trap. They \naccept the responsibility and they accept the regulations that the \nState fish and game agency would put upon them. But an outright ban is \nnot the way to manage this, and I hope those of my colleagues who focus \non this issue will cut away from the idea that this is an easy, free \nvote that somehow demonstrates their humaneness toward a population of \nwildlife.\n  What they ought to err on the side of is allowing their State fish \nand game agencies to make those determinations and allow the State \nagencies and the Federal U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that kind of a \nrelationship. I hope they will err on the side of good government \ninstead of warm, feely, and touchy politics because that is all this \nis. It is a feel-good vote that ends up being pretty bad government in \nthe end.\n  Sometimes, I suggest to my colleagues, it takes a little bit of \nstrength and a little bit of backbone to stand up and say, no, this is \nthe wrong thing to do and then be willing to go home and explain it, if \nyou erred on the side of the State capital and the fish and game agency \nof that State in making the decision and you trust your State \nlegislators because they are the closest to the people, to make sure \nfish and game regulations and fish and game management in their State \nis done in a fair and humane way. I believe it is today, and I believe \nit will continue to work well that way when we allow our national U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service to work closely with our State agencies, \nerring on the side of primacy, or primary responsibility, at the State \nand local level. It has worked well in the past. It will work well in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table the Torricelli amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe there was an understanding that \nthis vote would not start before 2 p.m. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote start at 2 p.m. and the quorum call end automatically at that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud my friend, Mr. Torricelli, for \nbringing up this important amendment today.\n  This amendment is very simple. It prohibits the expenditure of funds \nto administer or promote the use of steel-jawed leghold traps or neck \nsnares on any unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System except for \nresearch subsistence, conservation, or facilities protection.\n  This is a no-brainer. These traps are inhumane. They are designed to \nslam closed. The result is lacerations, broken bones, joint \ndislocations, and gangrene.\n  Additional injuries result as the animal struggles to free himself, \nsometimes chewing off a leg or breaking teeth from chewing at the metal \ntrap.\n  An animal may be in a trap for several days before a trapper checks \nit.\n  The American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal \nHospital Association, and the World Veterinary Organization have all \ndeclared leghold traps to be inhumane.\n  Our National Wildlife Refuges are the only category of federal land \nset aside for the protection and benefit of wildlife. It is \ninconceivable to me that, as a matter of federal policy, we allow \nrecreational and commercial killing of wildlife on refuges with \ninhumane traps.\n  This is not even a close call. These traps are so inhumane and \nindiscriminate that they have been banned altogether in 88 countries. \nAdditionally, they have been banned in four of our United States: \nCalifornia, Arizona, Colorado, and Massachusetts. Other states impose \nrestrictions on them.\n  Let me be clear about one critical point: This amendment does NOT bar \ntrapping on National Wildlife Refuges. Other traps, such as foot \nsnares, conibears, and box and cage traps can be used for any purpose \nconsistent with applicable laws and regulations on Refuges.\n  This amendment does not even forbid the use of steel traps or neck \nsnares outright, although I think that would be a good idea. It just \nbans these two processes on National Wildlife Refuges.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, research, subsistence, conservation, \nand facilities protection uses are still allowed under this amendment.\n  In this day and age, there is no need to resort to inhumane methods \nof trapping, particularly not on those portions of our federal land \nthat are set aside specifically for the protection and benefit of \nwildlife. I encourage all of my colleagues to support the Torricelli \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 2 o'clock having arrived, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 1571.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nthe Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), and the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Chafee) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 64, nays 32, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 268 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--64\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--32\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n\n[[Page S10675]]\n\n\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Chafee\n     McCain\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I note the presence of the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, who has an amendment related to grazing. My inclination \nis, since he is here and ready to go, he should go next.\n  I think it is important to inform our Members that we hope to \naccomplish more business during the course of the day. The particular \nlarge piece of business that we are closest to, an agreement on a \ncollection of several amendments that do not relate to amounts of money \nin the bill, we hope shortly to have unanimous consent for. We are also \nworking, of course, on a managers' amendment. Many of the amendments \nthat have been reserved are likely to be the subject of a managers' \namendment. I have discussed this matter with a number of individual \nMembers.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, whether we will be able to get to \na vote on his amendment this afternoon I am not certain. I hope we \nwill. He has cooperated in this connection. I would like to see a \ncouple of more votes this afternoon, but I am not sure we will. But \nlet's begin the debate and we will see what its dynamics are and \ndetermine how far we can go.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Washington yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am prepared to agree to a time agreement allowing 40 \nminutes on this amendment and a vote to follow.\n  Mr. GORTON. Unfortunately, I am not able to agree to even that yet. \nThe opponents to his amendment will control that. While I will be \nvoting with the opponents, I will not lead the debate on this. So I \nthink we should work on a unanimous consent agreement during the course \nof the debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let the Record show that I tried.\n  Mr. GORTON. It will so show.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1591\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Bureau of Land Management to establish a \n schedule for completion of processing of expiring grazing permits and \n                                leases)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending business and to move to my amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1591.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 52, strike lines 16 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 117. PROCESSING OF GRAZING PERMITS AND LEASES.\n\n       ``(a) Schedule.--''\n       ::(1) In General.--The Bureau of Land Management shall \n     establish and adhere to a schedule for completion of \n     processing of all grazing permits and leases that have \n     expired in fiscal year 1999 or which expire in fiscal years \n     2000 and 2001.\n       ``(2) Requirements.--The schedule shall provide for the \n     completion of processing of the grazing permits and leases in \n     compliance with all applicable laws, including the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) not \n     later than September 30, 2001.\n       ``(b) Required Renewal.--Each grazing permit or lease \n     described in subsection(a)(1) shall be deemed to be renewed \n     until the earlier of--\n       ``(1) September 20, 2001; or\n       ``(2) the date on which the Bureau completes processing of \n     the grazing permit or lease in compliance with all applicable \n     laws.\n       ``(c) Terms and Conditions of Renewals.--\n       ``(1) Before completion of processing.--Renewal of a \n     grazing permit or lease under subsection (b)(1) shall be on \n     the same terms and conditions as provided in the expiring \n     grazing permit or lease.\n       ``(2) Upon competition of processing.--Upon completion of \n     processing of a grazing permit or lease described in \n     subsection (a)(1), the Bureau may--\n       ``(A) modify the terms and conditions of the grazing permit \n     or lease; and\n       ``(B) reissue the grazing permit or lease for a term not to \n     exceed 10 years.\n       ``(d) Consideration of Permit or Lease Transfers.--(1) \n     During fiscal years 2000 and 2001, an application to transfer \n     a grazing permit or lease to an otherwise, qualified \n     applicant shall be approved on the same terms and conditions \n     as provided in the permit or lease being transferred, for a \n     duration no longer than the permit or lease being \n     transferred, unless processing under all applicable laws has \n     been completed.\n       ``(2) Upon completion of processing, the Bureau may--\n       ``(A) modify the terms and conditions of the grazing permit \n     or lease; and\n       ``(B) reissue the grazing permit or lease for a term not to \n     exceed 10 years.\n       ``(d) Effect on Other Authority.--Except as specifically \n     provided in this section, nothing in this section affects the \n     authority of the Bureau to modify or terminate any grazing \n     permit or lease.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which addresses the \nquestion of grazing on public land. If you followed the debate on the \nDepartment of Interior appropriations bill over the last few days, and \nthe weeks when we were in session before our August recess, you would \nsee that we have an issue primarily between the Republican side of the \naisle and the Democratic side of the aisle, a question of stewardship \nof public land. In virtually every amendment offered from the \nDemocratic side there has been an attempt to make certain that the \npublic lands are protected, that the value of the public lands are \nprotected, and that America's taxpayers, who in fact own these public \nlands, are not shortchanged by those who would come in and use them.\n  Consistently on the other side the position has been, if someone \nwants to take the land of America, the land belonging to all Americans, \nour public land, and use it for grazing, drilling, mining, or logging, \nthat there should be few or any restrictions and, second, that they \nshould not pay an extraordinary amount of money for the privilege of \ntaking profit off our public land.\n  This has been a clash of philosophy that has been visited on every \nsingle amendment in one form or another. It is a clear difference of \nopinion, primarily between the Republican side of the aisle and the \nDemocratic side of the aisle.\n  There are those of us on the Democratic side who understand that \nthese public lands, first and foremost, are a legacy that we inherited \nfrom previous generations and must leave in good shape for future \ngenerations. First and foremost, that is our obligation.\n  Second, if the lands are to be used for a practical purpose such as \nderiving income from logging or mining or grazing or drilling, the \ntaxpayers of this Nation are entitled to fair compensation from those \nwho would use the lands for commercial purposes.\n  We have had a lot of arguments about various aspects. This particular \namendment goes to the question of grazing. The Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, is an agency within the Department of the Interior \nwhich is entrusted with an extraordinary responsibility--to administer \nliterally millions of acres of our Nation's valuable and diverse public \nlands located primarily in 12 Western States, including Alaska.\n  The BLM has an extraordinary responsibility when it comes to land \nmanagement. It manages more Federal land than any other Federal agency. \nThis agency, BLM, oversees 40 percent of our Nation's Federal lands, \nroughly 264 million acres of surface land.\n  But acres do not really tell the story. Our Nation's public lands \ncontain a wealth of natural, cultural, historic, and economic resources \nthat literally belong to every American. The natural and ecological \ndiversity of BLM-managed public lands is perhaps the greatest of any \nFederal agency. The BLM manages grasslands, forest lands, islands, wild \nrivers, high mountains, Arctic tundra, desert landscapes, and virtually \nthe spectrum of land primarily in the western part of the United \nStates. As a result of this diversity of habitat, many thousands of \nwildlife and fish species occupy these lands. These fish and wildlife \nspecies represent a wealth of recreational, natural, and economic \nopportunities for local communities, States, and the Nation's hunters, \nsportsmen, and families. So the responsibility of the BLM is not only \nto watch this land but to make certain that they preserve the resources \ngiven to them in the lands.\n\n  Grazing is the most extensive use of BLM lands in the lower 48. Of \nthe roughly 179 million acres of BLM public lands outside of Alaska, \ngrazing is\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\nallowed on almost 164 million acres, and millions of these acres also \ncontain valuable and sensitive fish, wildlife, archeological, \nrecreation, and wilderness values.\n  At the present time, BLM authorizes, through the issuance of grazing \npermits, approximately 17,000 livestock operators to graze on these 164 \nmillion acres of public lands. These permits and the public land \ngrazing they allow are important to thousands of western livestock \noperators who literally make their living by grazing their cattle on \nthe public lands. Many of these operators use the permits they receive \nfrom the BLM to secure bank loans that provide important financial \nresources for their operations.\n  The BLM typically issues grazing permits for a 10-year period of \ntime. Many of the current grazing permits were issued in the late 1980s \nand now are starting to expire in large numbers during a 2- or 3-year \nperiod. These permits, numbering in the thousands, present the BLM with \nan unusually large and burdensome short-term renewal workload.\n  The BLM reports that they face a workload of renewing some 5,300 \ngrazing permits which will expire in fiscal year 1999. While the BLM \nwill be able to handle the majority of these renewals during this \nfiscal year, it is anticipated that 1,000 of these expiring permits \nwill have to be held over until the next fiscal year. In addition, the \nnumber of permits due to expire in that fiscal year is greater than \naverage. As a result, the BLM will have a fiscal year 2000 workload of \napproximately 3,000 permit reviews.\n  I raise this point because we are trying to balance, with this \namendment, two or three things: First, to make sure that those who make \ntheir livelihood by grazing livestock on public lands have an \nopportunity to renew their permits to secure the bank loans to continue \ntheir operations in a responsible way. That is reasonable. This \namendment that is offered is consistent with that, and I think it will \nachieve that end.\n  On the other side of the ledger, and equally important from a public \npolicy viewpoint, we believe that this Federal agency, the BLM, has a \nresponsibility to look at the permits and view the land that is being \nused, the public land being used by private people, to make certain it \nis being adequately protected, protecting America's natural resource, \nthe millions of acres of public land that we as a nation own. How does \nthe BLM do that?\n  When they reissue these permits for grazing, they take a look at the \nland to determine what has been the impact of the grazing: Is there too \nmuch grazing in one particular area? Are there things that need to be \nchanged in terms of the terms and condition of the grazing to protect \nAmerica's natural assets, these public lands?\n  Superimpose over this balance this workload I have just described. \nBLM now has more permits to renew than is usually the case, and there \nis some uncertainty among those who are asking for permits as to \nwhether BLM can do their job in an expeditious fashion. It is my \nunderstanding that last year we extended permits by a year. We decided \nbecause of the workload that we wanted the permit holders to know they \ncould continue to have their permits even if they had not been \nindividually reviewed by the BLM.\n  My amendment says that the extension will be for 2 years or, if the \nBLM is able to do the review, sooner, which gives assurance to the \nlandholder that they will have the permit and they can go to the banker \nand say: We have at least 2 years on this, perhaps longer.\n  At the same time, it says to the BLM: Don't shirk your \nresponsibility; you are supposed to review these permits, guard \nAmerica's natural assets, and make sure the public land is not \nexploited.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to strike this balance to give to the \npermit holders the additional 2 years and to say to the BLM: Still do \nyour job, protect these assets, make the environmental reviews that are \nnecessary, and open it for public hearing as required.\n  The on-the-ground, permit level decisionmaking that should legally \naccompany BLM's permit renewal process is fundamentally important to \nthe ecologically sound, multiple-use management of our Nation's public \nlands. The BLM must conduct what is known as National Environment \nPolicy Act compliance--shorthand, in Federal jargon, NEPA, National \nEnvironmental Policy Act--and land use plan performance reviews before \nreauthorizing the permits.\n  To meet the review requirements of NEPA and other existing Federal \nlaws and regulations and to meet the diverse demands of the American \npublic, the BLM uses interdisciplinary teams composed of agency \nprofessionals in wildlife, range, wild horse and burro, cultural, \nrecreation, wilderness, and other areas. The BLM also solicits public \ncomment and relevant information from the wide array of the public \ninterested in range management, including hunters, fishermen, and \nothers who enjoy our public lands.\n  The simple fact is this: On most public land grazing allotments, all \nthe important decisions that determine the condition of public \nrangeland resources are contained in the terms and conditions of the \ngrazing permits and in the annual decision about the amount, timing, \nand location of livestock grazing.\n  These decisions determine whether streams and riparian areas will \nflourish or be degraded, whether the wildlife habitat will be \nmaintained, protected, or destroyed. Public involvement in this process \nis essential for balanced public land management. Without the \napplication of NEPA and related laws, the American public literally has \nno voice in public rangeland management.\n  The unusually large number of permits that need to be renewed have \ncreated a dual dilemma for the Bureau and for its many public \nconstituents. Western livestock operators who currently hold these \nexpiring permits are worried that delays in the Bureau's processing \ntime may cause them to lose their permits or otherwise threaten their \nability to use them to secure loans and make a living.\n\n  Conservationists meanwhile believe the Bureau ought to perform \nresponsibly the environmental stewardship and analysis aspects of its \ngrazing management and permit renewal activities.\n  It is not the ranchers' fault that such a large number of permits are \nexpiring at once. If anyone were to blame, it would be BLM, the agency, \nwhich should have recognized this and addressed the problem sooner.\n  I am not certain whether we provided the resources, incidentally, so \nthey could do that, but certainly it should have been called to the \nattention of Congress.\n  BLM has a duty to all public land users, ranchers, conservationists, \nand others to provide orderly and balanced management of our public \nland resources.\n  It is entirely understandable to me, being from the State of \nIllinois, that ranchers are concerned about the issues of security and \npredictability. My farmers face the same thing. Likewise, we require \nthe BLM to wisely manage and protect our public lands for all \nAmericans. In the face of these concerns, a balance must be struck. The \ngood news, I submit, is that these two concerns can be handled in a \nmutually inclusive fashion.\n  The substitute language I am offering addresses the ranchers' needs \nfor the Bureau to process grazing permits in a timely fashion and in a \nmanner by which ranching operations and financial operations will not \nbe needlessly disrupted.\n  I want to hold BLM's feet to the fire, make them do their job right. \nI want them to solve the backlog of expiring permits. I want them to \ndeal in a fair and forthright way with ranchers. And I want them to \napply our Nation's environmental laws so that public rangelands are \nprotected for all to use and enjoy.\n  As I seek to protect ranchers from operational uncertainty due to \nbureaucratic delays, I also want to address the concerns raised by \nconservationists that the Bureau's equally necessary environmental \nanalysis and resource protection duties move forward.\n  The current language in the bill, if I am not mistaken, was inserted \nby Senator Domenici of New Mexico. This language, unfortunately, \nprovides an unnecessarily controversial, open-ended, and uncertain \nresponse to this problem. Clearly, the language in the bill, which I \nseek to change, is pitting conservationists against ranchers, and that \nis needless.\n  Ironically, I am concerned the language in the bill at this time, as \ndrafted, will actually undercut both the\n\n[[Page S10677]]\n\nranchers and the conservationists. The actual permit renewal and \nenvironmental protection problem at hand is tightly defined and should \nbe remedied with a tightly defined and effective solution.\n  Nevertheless, section 117 in the bill, as drafted, would apply to \npermits that have or will expire in ``this or any fiscal year''--any \nfiscal year.\n  Consider that for a moment--not just those that would expire during \nthe term of this appropriations bill, but any fiscal year. Given the \ntightly defined 2- to 3-year nature of the current issue, this section \nprovides an open-ended timeframe that is excessive and unnecessary. \nInstead of responding to the current real and specific crisis, section \n117 in the bill virtually writes a new policy for permits that expire \nin this or any fiscal year.\n\n  I think that goes way beyond what we need to accomplish in this \nlegislation. Section 117 provides a loosely drafted, open-ended delay \nof application of NEPA, the environmental law, and many other laws.\n  Given the facts of the issue at hand and the importance of \nmaintaining adequate environmental protections and reviews for public \nland management decisions, section 117 is far too sweeping in its \neffect. As written in the current law, section 117 would actually \nprovide the Bureau of Land Management with an incentive to delay the \napplication of NEPA and other laws.\n  Because the Senator from New Mexico does not put a time certain as to \nwhen these permits will end, putting pressure on BLM to do its job, I \nam afraid we are going to have literally no review, and that is not in \nthe best long-term interest of protecting America's public lands, which \nis the second half of this equation that we have to balance if we are \ngoing to be fair both to ranchers and to conservationists and Americans \nat large.\n  Section 117 also undercuts meaningful opportunities for public \ninvolvement in the range management process. Because it requires the \nBLM to reissue permits under their current terms and conditions for an \nindefinite period of time, it effectively eliminates effective public \ninput. As a result of these and other problems, the existing section \n117 is adamantly opposed by a wide array of groups that include the \nNational Wildlife Federation, Defenders of Wildlife, Natural Resources \nDefense Council, and the Wilderness Society.\n  If enacted as written, section 117 could well cause the Bureau to \nmaintain expiring grazing permits in sort of a bureaucratic limbo \nindefinitely. Ranchers might find themselves holding a permit of \nuncertain tenure instead of ultimately receiving the clearly defined \npermit that would be required under my amendment. Section 117, \ntherefore, could well create a situation that would actually harm the \neconomic certainty of ranching operations in the West.\n  We need to find a workable solution. We must not give the BLM the \nability to delay its important permit renewal activities indefinitely. \nCongress must act to place the Bureau on a schedule to accomplish its \nwork in a timely fashion to renew the permits. We need not--we must \nnot--create a system that sacrifices either legitimate rancher concerns \nor environmental protection. We have to hold the BLM's feet to the \nfire. We must treat public land ranchers fairly, and we must protect \nthe environment. We do not need to sacrifice one for the other, and I \nfear the existing language of section 117 does just that.\n  My intent is to ensure that the Bureau will be able to bring the \ncurrent permit renewal situation under control by the end of fiscal \nyear 2001, 2 years from now.\n  Additionally, I propose we extend the tenure permits which have \nexpired in fiscal year 1999, or will expire in fiscal year 2000 or \n2001, until the end of fiscal year 2001 or until the necessary \nenvironmental analysis under NEPA and other laws is completed, \nwhichever comes first. This says to a rancher, you know with certainty \nif the Durbin amendment is adopted that your permit will be extended at \nleast to the end of fiscal year 2001, and if in the interim BLM has \ndone its job, it could be extended longer. That gives them something to \ngo to the bank with, that they can, in fact, secure loans and continue \ntheir ranching operations. This amendment provides the ranching \ncommunity and financial institutions certainty that these permits will \nnot lapse during reprocessing. This amendment will provide continued \nassurance to the American public that their lands are being protected. \nIt provides a real solution, not a controversial stopgap approach.\n\n  I based my proposal on the permit language that Congress adopted as \npart of the Interior appropriations law for fiscal year 1999, as well \nas current House and Senate versions of this bill. My language closely \nresembles a solution that Congress passed as part of the 1995 \nrescissions bill to address a similar permit renewal problem faced by \nthe Forest Service. In the rescissions bill, Congress placed the Forest \nService on a fixed-year schedule to bring their grazing permits into \ncompliance with NEPA. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis balanced approach to the management and protection of our Nation's \npublic lands.\n  I understand the backlog and the workload faced by the BLM. As I \nsaid, it is extraordinary in its scope. I also understand the \nchallenges that face the ranchers and those who depend on these permits \nfor their livelihood. I think we have struck a balance, a balance which \nshould give some assurance on the one hand to the ranchers about the \nfuture of their permits, and give assurance to the public and \nconservationists that these natural resources are being protected.\n  I have two illustrations of why this is a particularly important \nissue. These photos were taken on BLM land and give a good indication \nof what can happen with proper land management and what happens when it \ndoesn't occur. Notice on the left-hand side this overgrazed riparian \narea, Road Canyon in southeast Utah. There is hardly anything left, \nsand and gravel.\n  On the other side is Grand Gulch, where it has been properly managed. \nThere is a good stand of grass. This is important for many reasons. If \nwe are going to protect these lands and make certain that we have \ngrazing opportunities for years and years to come, we have to manage \nthem. My farmers in the Midwest have to manage their lands every year, \ndecide what to plant, where to plant, what to apply to make certain the \nland will be ready after this crop for another crop. Basically, the \nBureau of Land Management has that responsibility when it comes to our \npublic lands.\n  They allow these ranchers to come and graze but under terms and \nconditions so they can say to the American people: Next year, 10 years \nfrom now, we will have protected your assets, your resources, for your \nuse as well as the use of future ranchers. Overgrazing has severely \ndegraded riparian areas in Comb Wash. As a result of many years of \novergrazing, much of the natural streambank vegetation has been \nstripped away, leaving either bare soil or undesirable plants such as \nsnakeweed and tumbleweed that invade overgrazed areas. Because of the \novergrazing, severe stream channel erosion has occurred, and water \ntables have dropped.\n  Annual grazing permits issued by BLM allow this degradation to occur. \nIf they keep renewing the permits on an annual basis instead of \nstepping back from time to time and looking at the impact, you can see \nthat, frankly, we are going to have bad results. The language in the \nbill, which I amend, section 117, would continue this degradation \nindefinitely. Once we have run these resources down to bare rock, what \ngood is it to the ranchers? Literally, they have to be certain they \nhave a resource to turn to in decades to come so they have some \nassurance of their own livelihood. It is in their best interest to \nprotect this resource as well with reasonable permits.\n\n  When you take a look at this healthy riparian area, as illustrated in \nthe other photo, Grand Gulch, you can see the difference. This area \nhad, again, been arrested from grazing for 20 years. In Grand Gulch, \nthere was a healthy streamside ecosystem. The stream channels are \nstable, protected from erosion by vegetation. Sound grazing management \ndecisions by BLM would allow more riparian areas across the West to \nreturn to healthier conditions.\n  This has been a controversial area and is a clear illustration of why \nwe need to have the annual review by BLM consistent with NEPA \nstandards.\n\n[[Page S10678]]\n\n  The second photo shows a similar story. The ecological condition of \nthe Santa Maria River in western Arizona has improved dramatically as a \nresult of permit management practices under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act. It is important to note the BLM continues to allow grazing \nin this area. However, it has changed the timing of this grazing. BLM \nis not at war with the ranchers but trying to make sure that it manages \nthe Nation's resources on these public lands in a responsible fashion.\n  As a result of environmental reviews, the grazing permits on the \nSanta Maria River now contain terms and conditions requiring livestock \nto be kept out of the riparian areas during the spring and summer \ngrowing seasons.\n  The Santa Maria River is a rarity: a free-flowing river in the midst \nof a vast, hot, low-elevation desert. The riparian corridor provides \nessential habitat for dozens of species of wildlife, including 15 \nspecies that are listed by Federal or State agencies as threatened, \nendangered, or other special status. The riparian area of the Santa \nMaria and its ability to support wildlife were severely degraded by \nmany years of uncontrolled, unmanaged livestock grazing in the river \ncorridor. The vegetation was stripped away. The water was polluted. \nStreambanks were trampled. Miles of riparian area were nearly as barren \nas the surrounding desert.\n  For decades, the BLM issued and renewed grazing permits to ranchers \nalong the Santa Maria River with no terms and conditions to protect \nriparian areas. Even though the BLM developed a land use plan that \nrequired the river to be arrested from livestock grazing, the \nrequirement was never incorporated in grazing permits.\n  It illustrates the point to be made: The existing language in the \nbill, which I seek to amend, extends indefinitely these grazing permits \nunder the terms and conditions currently existing. If there is a need \nto step in and to protect an area such as this from being degraded and \ndestroyed for future generations, the language of the bill does not \nprovide for it. My amendment does. It says the permits will be extended \nto 2 years; if there is an intervening environmental review, even \nlonger but under terms and conditions consistent with good environment \nand public input.\n  In the late 1980s, a portion of the Santa Maria River received an \nunplanned reprieve from grazing because the rancher holding the permit \nwent bankrupt and had to sell his cattle. The result of 3 years of rest \nfrom grazing can be seen in this second photograph. It is night and day \nbetween this dry river bed and this creek, which we can see, this \nriparian area, which has good growth and a stand of grass.\n\n  The riparian vegetation has returned. The streambanks are starting to \nrebuild. The water is cleaner, as are other portions of the river. In \nthe early 1990s, the bankrupt rancher sold out to a new rancher who \nwanted to restock the river corridor with cattle. The BLM proposed to \ntransfer the grazing permit to the new rancher with no NEPA analysis, \nno public review. The transferred permit would have had the same terms \nand conditions as the old permit: year-round grazing in the riparian \narea with no measure to protect or restore riparian vegetation and \nwildlife habitat.\n  A number of individuals and organizations challenged the BLM decision \nto renew the permit without a NEPA review. As a result, grazing permits \non the Santa Maria contained terms and conditions requiring that \nlivestock be kept out of this area during spring and summer growing \nseasons.\n  If section 117 is enacted as written in the law, such permit level \nmanagement changes will be much more difficult to achieve.\n  I see other Members wishing to speak to this amendment. I can \ncertainly return to this debate after they have had their opportunity, \nbut I do believe it is in the best interest of those who value these \npublic lands as a natural resource of assets for America and those who \nsee them as a livelihood to come together and reach a commonsense \nagreement.\n  The existing language in the bill, which I would amend, gives the \nranchers the upper hand. It says: Your permit is renewed indefinitely. \nWe may never return to the question of whether or not your grazing \nrights should be changed to protect this particular creek bed from \nbecoming part of the desert. That is not in the best interest of the \nrancher involved, nor in the best interest of the people of the United \nStates who literally own this land. It is another question, another \nenvironmental rider which addresses the basic philosophy I mentioned at \nthe beginning of this debate.\n  There was an unusual breakdown in point of view between the \nRepublican side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle. It \nis hard for me, as I study history, to believe that the party of \nTheodore Roosevelt, which, frankly, initiated the creation of such \nthings as the Yosemite National Park and our National Park System, \nwould now take such a different point of view when it comes to guarding \nthe value of these resources. It would seem to me to be bipartisan, \nnonpartisan, for us to agree that if these public lands are to be used, \nthey should be used safely, responsibly, and in a way so that future \ngenerations could have that benefit.\n  But time and again, these environmental riders that come to us, \nwhether they are for logging, drilling, mining, whatever it happens to \nbe, have come to us with the suggestion that the public interest should \nbe secondary to the private exploitation of the land. I think that is \nwrong. I think the balance should be struck. It is not only in the best \ninterest of this country, it is in the best interest of everyone living \nin the western part of the United States. The amendment I have offered \nhas been supported by virtually every major environmental group: The \nWilderness Society, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Trout Unlimited, Friends of the Earth, American Land \nAlliance, and others.\n  I sincerely hope my friends from the West, the Senator from New \nMexico, and the Senators from Idaho and Wyoming, will look carefully at \nthis amendment and realize that it is a positive one; it is not \nnegative in nature. It is an attempt to resolve this in a fair and \nbalanced way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from New Mexico \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we have three people who want to \nspeak on our side. I think the Senator from Wyoming would like to speak \nfirst. I will follow with a few minutes and then Senator Craig will \nfollow, and we will be finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for giving leadership \non this issue. We have worked together for a very long time in this \narea. I guess I am a little surprised and, frankly, a little offended \nthat it would be said that people on this side of the aisle are not as \ncareful or do not care as much about public lands as someone else.\n  I brought out this map I used yesterday. You can see where the \nFederal land holdings are in this country. Out in the West, nearly half \nof the land in most of our States belongs to the Federal Government, \nand we have taken care of it for years. I think the Senator's State of \nIllinois has about 2 percent. Here he is telling us how to manage \npublic lands. I find that very difficult.\n  We are very intent on being the stewards of public lands. I want to \ntell you a little bit about open space. There has been more and more \ninterest in open space as people move out. We have discovered that the \nbest way to keep it is to provide an opportunity for ranchers to \ncontinue to operate. That is how you keep open space. We are trying to \ndo that now. We want fair compensation. This has nothing to do with \ncompensation. Let me start by reading the language that we think works. \nThis is what is in the bill:\n\n       Grazing permits and leases which expire or are transferred, \n     in this or any fiscal year, shall be renewed under the same \n     terms and conditions as contained in the expiring permit or \n     lease until such time as the Secretary completes the process \n     of renewing permits and leases in compliance with all \n     applicable laws.\n\n  That is what it says, ``all applicable laws,'' which includes the \nresponsibility of the BLM to do this.\n\n       Nothing in this language shall be deemed to affect the \n     Secretary's statutory authority or the rights of the \n     permittee or lessee.\n\n  That is the language--the language that we have studied for several \nyears.\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\n We have been through this temporary thing the Senator from Illinois \nbrought forth before, and we are back at it again. We think we have \nfound an answer that would be more long term.\n  Let me cover a few of the things. This year, 5,364 grazing permits \nare up for renewal; only 2,159 have been renewed. So here we are, \nalmost at the end of September, with people who have leases that, if \nnot studied, will be taken off the land at the end of the month. \nSection 117 of S. 1292 addresses this problem by allowing the BLM more \ntime to complete the renewal process without causing unwarranted \nhardship on the rancher or farmer who utilizes the public lands to make \na living. Keep in mind, this is not some random thing people do. When \nthe West was settled, we settled in and the homesteads were taken up \nalong the water, the better lands, and these other lands were basically \nleft there. They are simply residual lands that are managed by the BLM. \nThey are very much attached, however, to the water and the other lands \nto make a ranching economic unit. So it is more than that.\n  Section 117 allows for the renewal of grazing permits under the same \nterms and conditions of expiring permits pending completion of the \nrenewal process. BLM has to do this, and in the meantime this farmer or \nrancher is not penalized for something that wasn't his fault.\n  Permits renewed under this provision are not exempt from compliance \nwith existing environmental laws. Permits will be issued under existing \nenvironmentally compliant land use plans. That is the way that is.\n  Section 117 allows for a thorough environmental review by the BLM, \nindustry, and the public instead of an abbreviated, cursory \nenvironmental analysis, which will probably happen if the Senator has \nhis way. The BLM cannot and will not ignore its environmental \nobligations due to the threat of litigation, of course.\n  We talked a little bit about the finances of it. One of the \ninteresting things, of course, is that most farmers and ranchers depend \non credit. Let me read you something that comes from the Farm Credit \nAssociation:\n\n       It is no secret that providing loans for farmers and \n     ranchers is a risky business. The security offered by section \n     117 in allowing a full 10-year permit will relieve some of \n     the risks. However, the Senator from Illinois intends to make \n     the practice even more risky by shortening the duration of \n     permits to 1 or 2 years.\n\n  That is the Farm Credit Association talking about the opportunity to \nhave an effective beef production operation.\n  There is another factor that is underlying all of these things, the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. That allows for these things to continue \nif the permittee simply sends in a request and does that prior to the \ntime of the exploration. That has been recently dealt with in the court \nand proved to be an effective tool. The language in this amendment, if \nit passes, would probably negate that. I think that would be a real \nproblem.\n  So there are a lot of things involved. It sounds kind of simple. You \nknow, we are just going to do it for 2 years and we will get this all \nresolved. That isn't the way it works, my friends. We have been through \nthis before. We continue to come up each year, and we have found, \nthrough the help and leadership of the Senator from New Mexico, a long-\nterm solution that will not change the obligation for environmental \nprotection, will not change the obligation of the BLM, and it, in fact, \nwill take away some of the risk from the farmer or rancher, which has \nnothing to do with the fact that this has been elongated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think Senator Durbin, who serves on \nthe Budget Committee, which I happen to chair, knows that on many \nmatters I hold him in high esteem. As a matter of fact, I believe he is \nsmiling a very gentle smile there as he sits back in his chair, and I \nguess he is going to listen now for a few minutes. I hope so. He would \nnot disavow what I have just said. But he is wrong on this one. He is \nwrong in many ways.\n  First, he would have done a wonderful job if he had left out the \npartisan speech at the end about this side of the aisle not being as \nconcerned as our forefathers about the environment. Second, he showed \nsome pictures of leases where one of the leaseholds had been abused and \nin some way tied that to the Domenici language or to his amendment. To \ndo that is totally without an understanding of the ongoing authority of \nthe BLM and the Forest Service, the twin agencies who are out there on \nour property.\n  I say to the good Senator, the BLM does not find malfeasance on the \npart of ranchers only when they renew the lease every 10 years. As a \nmatter of fact, they have total authority to enter upon the premise, \ninspect, and periodically recommend changes in the use that the rancher \nshould make. They don't wait around until a drought year or until the \n10-year permit has expired to go in and change the usage of the lessee.\n  You cannot use what we are trying to do to prevent a wholesale \ndiminution of ranching properties in our States, and state that there \nare abuses out there that need to be fixed; let me suggest they are \nbeing fixed. Animal numbers are being changed all the time. As a matter \nof fact, 2 years ago they were changed regularly in my State, regularly \nin Arizona, and regularly in Wyoming because we were in a drought \nperiod. Federal managers would say this coming year you can't do as \nmuch because the foliage isn't so good. You wore it down pretty good \nlast year. So we are going to cut you by 50 head or 100 head.\n  Ongoing management remains the prerogative of the management agency--\nin this case the Bureau of Land Management.\n  Having said that, let me also say I have been around a little while--\nsometimes longer than I want to admit. But the Senate ought to know \nthat no administration before this one--Democrat or Republican--has \nsubjected the leases of cattlemen and women and businesses to a total \nreview under NEPA for the simple issuance of permits. The Forest \nService did on a few selective ones. This administration comes along \nwith thousands and thousands of leases out there and decides that \nbefore they are going to issue a renewal, they are going to subject it \nto an environmental assessment and, if necessary, a full-blown impact \nstatement. Some of us told them that is crazy. We lost. Do you know the \nresult? The result is this debate on this floor of the Senate because \nBLM can't conceivably do their work on time.\n  As a matter of fact, in the State of Wyoming only 15 percent of the \nsubject leases--these leases are to families who live on the ranches \nand borrow money on their houses and their ranch together--only 15 \npercent have gone through compliance by the BLM. The BLM hasn't done \nits work.\n  Look, before we leave a wide-open opportunity to cancel these leases \nbecause the environmental assessment is not done, we have to give some \nlatitude to these people who are subject annually to review in terms of \ntheir ranch management. We have to provide them with some flexibility \nand assurance from the standpoint of knowing what they own and what the \nbankers are going to say about the loans they have on the ranch. There \nis nothing new about having a loan on a ranch in Wyoming or New Mexico. \nYou put it on the entire ranch, including the fee ownership, and the \nranch house. The entire unit--it is called--is collateral for the loan.\n  It is a coincidence that a member of an esteemed banking institution \nis sitting in the Chair and happens to be from the same State as the \nSenator who is opposed to my approach. But I ask hypothetically, do you \nthink a banker who had been expecting to renew a loan because there was \ngoing to be a new 10-year permit issued--it is about a year away--and \nthe rancher comes up, and says: Hey, banker, friend, are you going to \ngive us a loan again?\n  And the banker says: What does the BLM say about your permit?\n  The poor rancher says: Well, they have their own rule, and it says if \nyou do not have an impact statement you can't get the permit.\n\n  But they haven't done the required work on this permit.\n  And the poor rancher says: Won't you lend me the money anyway?\n  But the banker says: No, of course not.\n  What Senator Domenici tried to do was to say it isn't a ranchers' \nproblem that the BLM undertook such a mammoth job of environmental \nassessments\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\nand sometimes full-blown statements on every single lease out there in \nthe West. BLM and the Forest Service began the process, so we can say \nboth of the public lands management twins do this. It is not the \nranchers' fault. They didn't hold up these environmental assessments.\n  I said to the ranching community: What would be a fair way to make \nsure you are not harmed by the inaction of the Bureau of Land \nManagement?\n  They said: Let them extend our lease as they would have done 5 years \nago, and as they would have done if they had completed their work. But \nlet them continue with their assessment work, and when they get it done \nand say there are some changes that have to be made, give them the \nauthority to make the changes that the assessment calls for.\n  That is essentially where we are. I understand we are in a battle in \nthe West. We are in a battle where ranchers are looked upon by some \nenvironmental groups with very low esteem. In fact, some of the groups \neven say there shouldn't be any cattle grazing on public lands. They \nsay this without any evidence it is harmful. If managed properly, \ngrazing is not harmful. It is salutary. It is healthy. It is good for \nthe forest lands and for Bureau of Land Management lands.\n  We are not talking here about rich farmers and ranchers; even though \nthere may be some in corporate ownership.\n  I have five letters from New Mexicans. I want everybody to listen to \nthe last names of these people. They live in northern New Mexico with \nanywhere from 100 head to 350 head. Their names are Gerald Chacon, a \nHispanic American whose family has lived there for generations.\n  He says in this letter, ``Please don't take away our security.'' It \nisn't ``take away our ranch.'' They are saying ``our security.'' ``The \nbank won't lend us the money.'' He alludes to the fact that if it is \nonly a 2-year opportunity to get a loan, he is not going to have a very \ngood chance.\n  That is the solution of the Senator from Illinois to this problem.\n  From Palemon Martinez, also from northern New Mexico, a letter that \njust plain pleads with me to make sure their leases are not held in \nabeyance because the Bureau of Land Management did not do their work.\n  Again, I repeat for those worried about proper management, BLM has \nentry all year long, and management opportunities all year long. They \ndo not need to wait around for permit renewal to say to my friend, \nPalemon Martinez, that he has to change his way of doing business \nbecause he is grazing too heavily or he is affecting the stream.\n  Alonso Gallegos from Pena Blanca, NM--the same kind of letter. Jake \nVigil, and Dennis Braden, general manager for a family. They are all \nthe same--frightened to death of what is going to happen to the \nsecurity in their allotment if we don't say it is the BLM's fault for \nnot having done the assessments.\n  This fellow, Jake Vigil, had nothing whatsoever to do with it. He is \nwide open to review. They come out there and do their assessment. He \nmakes his comments. But they do not get it done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: I am pleased to have the opportunity \n     to express the serious concerns we have should the Bureau of \n     Land Management not complete its required environmental \n     assessments of each grazing permit.\n       I sincerely hope your colleagues in the senate recognize \n     the economic and personal hardships that ranch families will \n     face in our county.\n       I represent 3 families who share as an association, a BLM \n     allotment made up mostly of BLM lands. Our contact (permit) \n     with the US government allows for 348 head of cattle to graze \n     from May 1 to November 1 of each year. Our winter grazing is \n     located 70 miles away at a lower elevation with winter \n     access. We have no alternate pasture available to us should \n     we be removed in mid season. The permittees will be forced to \n     suffer for something, we did not have any control over or \n     participation in. We would be faced to sell, at depressed \n     prices the 348 cow-calf pairs we own. Two families have loans \n     on operating expenses and cattle to service. Markets are at \n     the least, 140 miles from the ranch. Trucking expenses shrink \n     on the weights of cattle and depressed prices would bankrupt \n     us. We also have large sums of our own money currently being \n     spent on a livestock and wildlife watering pipeline system \n     for each pasture. Our water system and other rangeland \n     improvements would be lost without our ability to pay for it \n     from calf sales this fall.\n       Our schools and county governments rely heavily on our \n     private property and livestock taxes to operate on. Our \n     county, already one of the poorest in this nation depends \n     heavily on income generated from public land resources like \n     grazing, timber and recreation. The multiplying affect of \n     this action to our local economies would be staggering. I am \n     hopeful that common sense will prevail and you will be able \n     to do what is right for our families and the land. Removing \n     one from the other has in the past proven disastrous for our \n     communities and for the environment.\n       I would invite any members of the senate to visit our \n     homes, communities, and the public lands we care for. We are \n     constantly troubled by one decision after the other that we \n     are forced to face without a voice or process for our \n     involvement. I hope all of you can help us to stay on these \n     lands as we have for over two hundred years.\n       Thank you for your continued representation and help in \n     this serious matter. Please help us to tell our story.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Gerald L. Chacon,\n\n                            Representing the Chacon Family and the\n     Esperanza Grazing Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Northern New Mexico\n\n\n                                       Stockman's Association,\n\n                               Ranchos de Taos, NM, July 27, 1999.\n     Hon.

Grazing activities on \n     public lands should not be disrupted or interrupted. Small \n     ranchers in Northern New Mexico cannot afford additional \n     hardships. We stand in opposition to Senator Durbin's \n     amendments.\n       We appreciate your assistance.\n           Thank you,\n                                              Palemon A.

Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: As a permittee with the Bureau of \n     Land Management (BLM), my family and I are in trouble. The \n     language you successfully attached to the Interior \n     Appropriations Bill would be a lifesaver.\n       My ten-year permit is up for renewal this year. Under new \n     BLM policy, the agency says that National Environmental \n     Policy Act (NEPA) analysis must be completed prior to my \n     renewal. This means that this work must be done by September \n     30, 1999.\n       My permit is for 98 head, year-round. I have had it more \n     than half a century. It was inherited from my father, who \n     inherited it from his father. Our family grazed this land \n     before there was a BLM. This permit makes up 50 percent of \n     the income for my family, which includes my wife and three \n     children, ranging in age from 13 to 16.\n       I was unaware that the BLM was working on my allotment \n     until the middle of June 1999, when I received a letter \n     giving me seven days to comment on an ``Analysis, \n     Interpretation & Evaluation'' (AIE). I did not even receive \n     the letter until the comment period had expired. Then in mid-\n     July, I received an environmental assessment (EA) with a 15-\n     day comment period.\n       Given that the EA does not meet the requirements of NEPA, \n     it is highly likely that there will be problems with its' \n     completion. With just over 60 days to complete this process, \n     I am in serious jeopardy. If the NEPA is not completed, what \n     will I do with my cattle? How will I feed my family?\n       As you can see, the language allowing more time for the \n     completion of the analysis is imperative to me and my family \n     as well as hundreds of other New Mexicans in a similar \n     position.\n       Thank you in advance for what you have done on this issue \n     thus far. However, without passage of the amendment on the \n     Senate Floor, I will lose half of my income, not to mention \n     my heritage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Alonso Gallegos.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       El Rito, NM, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon.

The language \n     you successfully attached to the Interior Appropriations Bill \n     would be a lifesaver.\n       Our ten-year permit is up for renewal this year.

This permit is an integral part of \n     our ranching operation.\n       We have been urging our BLM office to start this process \n     for over a year.\n       With just over 60 days to complete this process, we are in \n     serious jeopardy. If the NEPA is not complete, what will we \n     do with our cattle?\n       As you can see, the language allowing more time for the \n     completion of the analysis is imperative to us as well as \n     other New Mexico ranchers in a similar position.\n       Thank you in advance for what you have done on this issue \n     thus far.

My concern encompasses the \n     renewal of grazing permits for a ten-year term and how my \n     financing organization deals with those permits. Within \n     Section 117 of the Interior Appropriations bill you will find \n     language providing for ten-year grazing permits.\n       This year, over 5,000 BLM grazing permits for public lands \n     are expiring. In New Mexico alone over 700 permits are \n     expiring. Farm Credit Services of New Mexico currently holds \n     loans for over 1,400 ranching and farming families totaling \n     over $360 million. By providing these loans to the ranching \n     and farming families in New Mexico, we therefore also support \n     the communities in which they reside.\n       It is no secret that providing loans to farms and ranches \n     is a risky business. The security offered by Section 117 in \n     allowing the full ten-year permit will relive some of the \n     risk. However, Senator Durbin intends to make the practice \n     even more risky by shortening the duration of permits to one \n     or two years. Though Senator Durbin may be well-intentioned, \n     he is placing a lot of unnecessary and unwarranted pressure \n     on families already suffering through a depressed agriculture \n     economy.\n       Financial lenders, including myself, may not be as willing \n     to provide the level of support as we have in the past if the \n     grazing permit is only for a short period or if it is \n     uncertain whether the permit will be renewed. As a lender, I \n     do not look forward to foreclosing on a farm or ranch. We try \n     to do everything we can before taking such a drastic measure. \n     Nonetheless, providing loans becomes more difficult when \n     matters out of our control such as Senator Durbin's Amendment \n     enter the process.\n       I strongly urge you to resist any amendment to the existing \n     language in Section 117. The language as it stands is very \n     vital to the economic well being of many farming and ranching \n     families in New Mexico and other western states. thank you \n     for your consideration of my request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Eddie Ratliff,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The history of noncompliance by the Bureau of Land \nManagement in getting this work done in New Mexico is miserable. In our \nState, we are a little ahead of Wyoming. We have 26 percent that have \nhad their environmental assessments done. The rest aren't going to have \nit done before their permits expire and are exactly subject to what I \nhave been telling the Senate on the floor.\n  My friend from Illinois says: Keep the pressure on the BLM. Don't \ntake the pressure off by saying you can issue the permit. But I say you \ncontinue your assessment work, and when you have finished and find that \nyou want to make some changes to the permit, if you must, then do it, \nand you have the automatic right to do it.\n  We are not on the floor of the Senate trying to risk the security of \nhundreds and hundreds of ranchers--including these people--for the \npurpose of keeping the heat on the Bureau of Land Management, which \nought to get their own work done. As a matter of fact, there are many \npeople who think the assessments and impact statements are very \nexpensive, that in many cases they don't even fix the problems.\n  We have a NEPA law that is a couple of decades or more old. We \nattempt to apply it to every kind of environmental issue around. The \ncases it applies to with the least efficacy are ranchlands because they \nare small ``events.'' We had in mind big governmental actions before we \napplied the NEPA laws to land.\n  I am not interested in putting at risk the ranchers in my State so we \ncan keep the pressure on the Bureau of Land Management. Senator Gorton \ncan keep the pressure on in his bill. He gives them the money. He can \ntell them: Do your work. That is all the pressure they need.\n  Frankly, this is an easy one. Sometimes it is awful hard for people \nwho don't have public lands to understand our plight. This is easy. The \nonly thing difficult is a whole group of organizations that don't think \nthe rancher cares about anything. They are saying: Don't give them help \nwith what Domenici wants, give them something less.\n  Keep the heat on; and a wonderful, nice Senator from Illinois who \ndoesn't have any public land making their pitch for them. He is a good \npitch maker. He made a good speech today. It just happens to be it is \nnot right. It is not right.\n  I will have printed in the Record a letter of very recent origin from \nthe president of the Farm Credit Services of New Mexico. I think the \nSenator from Wyoming alluded to it.\n  Anyone who questions whether or not the ranchers are more at risk \nunder this 2-year extension rather than giving them their permit and \nletting the Bureau of Land Management do their work, this is the proof \nof the pudding. I was giving a hypothetical. This is the banker. This \nis the Farm Credit Bureau. They go out and place these loans. They say \nit is very hard on this 2-year proposal to get the financing for the \nfarmers and their families in my State, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and \nthe rest.\n  My last observation, and I am not at all sure the senior Senator from \nIllinois intended this, I view the amendment as making a significant \nchange in FLMPA, Federal Land Management bill that underlies this \ndebate. In Arabic No. 2, his amendment says:\n\n       Upon completion of processing of a grazing permit or lease \n     described in subsection (a)(1), the Bureau may--\n       . . . (B) reissue the grazing permit or lease for a term \n     not to exceed 10 years.\n\n  I think the substantive law of the land says ``shall,'' not ``may.'' \nI am not sure he wants to have ``shall'' or ``may'' in there. It \nshouldn't be ``may.'' If you have done your work and the land is OK, \nthe law is they shall issue the permit. We surely should not change \nthat on the floor while we are trying to get the Bureau of Land \nManagement to do their job--which they are not doing--on time. Frankly, \nI think they bit off more than they can chew. That is the reason. This \nis a big undertaking.\n  What we ought to have is an economic impact statement on this huge \njob of environmental assessments. What have we gotten out of it that is \nenvironmentally enhancing? I am not sure it would be very much. I am \nnot asking for that today. I am merely speculating based on what I \nhappen to feel and know.\n  Having said that, I want the Senate to know I have used far more time \non this issue than I should. The combined time we all spent is probably \nmore than we should have used. Some people are very pleased we are \nspending all of this time so they can be doing something else. But I \nguarantee, this is very important. These five letters from the New \nMexicans that I read are multiplied across Western America hundreds and \nhundreds of times over.\n  We talk on the floor about problems people have. Many times they are \nless significant and less important than the problem we are addressing \ntoday. We don't need to punish a few thousand Americans living out in \nrural Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, et cetera, who are already having \nit very tough because of the market in cattle and the droughts that \nhave been recurring. We don't need them worrying about what the Federal \nGovernment will do to them, when they have done nothing wrong \nthemselves.\n  We don't need them worrying about their banker, who will tell them: \nWhen you know you have the permit, we will lend you the money. Isn't \nthat what they will say? They will not say: You\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\nare a nice fellow and I loaned your grandpa and your great grandpa \nmoney on this ranch. They will say: Where is the permit? They will say: \nThe Durbin amendment passed and we only have it for up to 2 years \nbecause we had to give the government more time to do an impact \nstatement, which they should have already done.\n  I don't think we need that. If Members had the opportunity to read \nthese five or six letters, they would get the tone. The tone is one of \nreal fear. If we don't fix this, technically, they wouldn't have to \nissue any of these permits because the impact statement isn't \ncompleted--because of the government's delay--and they could say: Here \nare the rules; unless it is done, we will not issue permits.\n  I understand my friend from Idaho wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, would the Senator from Idaho yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President and the Senator from Illinois, I have been \ninformed that my comanager, the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia, will not be available until approximately 4 o'clock. There \nwill be a motion to table, and I strongly suspect the Senator from \nIllinois will desire some time to reply. The motion to table should be \nmade not earlier than 3:45, which means there is another 20 minutes for \ndebate. For the information of other Senators, at least, we will be \nlikely to vote on a motion to table the Durbin amendment at or some \ntime shortly after 3:45.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could the chairman of the subcommittee \nput the last statement in the form of a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GORTON. I need to know how much time the Senators from Idaho and \nIllinois wish to speak in order to do that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I certainly need no more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that a vote on or in relation to \nthis amendment take place at 3:50 this afternoon, with the time between \nnow and 3:50 equally divided between the Senator from Idaho and the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, in his unanimous consent \nrequest there will be no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. GORTON. And there will be no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if we could add \nit be in order to make the motion to table and ask for the yeas and \nnays at this time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the Durbin amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield such time to myself as I may consume under the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  I sat through most of the debate on this very important amendment \nthat the senior Senator from Illinois has proposed. If I could speak to \nthe senior Senator from Illinois for just a moment, there is a very \nreal difference but a similar responsibility between the Senator from \nIdaho and the Senator from Illinois.\n  When I went home during the August recess, I held meetings with the \nagricultural community. The Senator from Illinois has a good many \nfarmers, but there was a different kind of person in my meetings than \ncould possibly have been in any meeting he would have. That was a \npublic land rancher. Because the Senator from Illinois knows he doesn't \nhave ranchers and grazers on the public lands of the State of Illinois. \nBut the Senators from Idaho and New Mexico and the Senator from Iowa \ndo--thousands of them. Their livelihood depends on access to the public \nlands and a perpetuation and a continuation of that access, to keep \ntheir ranching operations alive. The Senator from Illinois understands \nthat. He has already expressed that as it relates to financing and \nbanking.\n\n  What is important here--and I wish to express something that probably \nno one coming from a public land State would miss--is that there is a \nvery different word, a single word in his amendment that does not exist \nin law today and should not be put in law. That is the word ``may.''\n  It has been the public policy of this country that, under certain \nconditions and in the right areas, grazing is a responsible use of our \npublic lands and that we shall allow grazing as a right in responsible \nuse of our public lands if the following conditions are met--the \nconditions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the conditions \nthat are established by the regional advisory groups that were \nappointed by this Secretary of the Interior. That is the law that \nestablishes the permanency and the relationship that the Senator from \nIllinois said he speaks to, but in fact he does not.\n  Having said all of that, the law of this public land is the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, and from that the rules and regulations by \nwhich ranchers graze that public land are established. We have said as \na Congress, and as a part of public policy, that with the renewal of \nthose permits there should be an analysis of the condition of the \nrangeland that the permit is tied to. The Senator from Illinois \nunderstands that. That is within the law. But, because of costs, \nbecause of personnel, because of the time involved, not all of these \npermits have been able to be analyzed and therefore gain their impact \nstatement in time for that renewal.\n  Is that a fault of the rancher? It is not. Is that a fault of BLM and \nthe Federal Government? It is. Last year we extended for 1 year the \nright of renewal while the studies went on. But we also understand--and \nwhat Senator Domenici's addition to the Interior bill clearly states--\nafter the analysis is done and the terms and conditions of the permit \nare established, that permit will be allowed and shall exist under \nthose conditions to be met--not ``may be'' but ``shall be.'' That is \nvery important.\n  If the Senator from Illinois were truly dedicated to the continuation \nof grazing on public lands under these environmental conditions, then \nthe word ``may'' would not be there because that is the word the \nfinancial community looks toward to see whether they ought to lend \nmoney to this rancher to continue his or her ranching operation. They \ncould not continue that ranching operation without access to the public \ngrazing lands. The map the Senator from Wyoming displayed is the very \nsimple reason why.\n  Idaho's No. 1 agricultural commodity is cattle--not potatoes but \ncattle in total dollar volume sold. Mr. President, 80 percent of that \namount, 80 percent of the cattle in Idaho, have to graze on public \nlands at some time during the year for them to exist in our State. \nThrowing that in jeopardy is like suggesting to the Senator from \nIllinois we are going to wipe Caterpillar out of Peoria or we are going \nto throw it in such jeopardy that the banks won't continue to finance \nit. But that will not happen to Caterpillar in Peoria because they are \nnot dictated to by the Government and they are not operating under \ngovernmental regulations, except safety and all of that, but their very \nlivelihood does not exist on a ``may'' or ``shall'' piece of language \nin a Federal bill.\n\n  That is what is important here. We want the environmental analysis \ndone. We want the public lands to retain a high quality of \nenvironmental values.\n  The Senator from Illinois held up some pictures, one from Utah and \none from Arizona. The reason he did not show Illinois is that the issue \nhe is talking about doesn't exist in his State, so you will have to go \nelsewhere to find a problem, if a problem exists, if you want to debate \nthis bill. Those problems do exist on public lands but much less than \nthey ever have. I am extremely proud of the laws we have changed to \nimprove the rangeland conditions in my State and in large, western \npublic land grazing States in this Nation. We should not be throwing \nextraordinary roadblocks in the way. We ought to be facilitating the \nBLM in this area.\n  The BLM will not take a position. But when the Director of BLM was in \nmy office several months ago, prior to his confirmation, he said: If \nyou keep the general language in the bill that you had last time, we \ncan support it. That is because they need that flexibility to go ahead \nto do their analysis\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\nin a right and proper way. That is what is important.\n  So when the Senator from Illinois says that none of these rules can \napply, this locks in a standard and the BLM cannot come back and make \nthe changes, I must say, in all due respect to my colleague from \nIllinois, that is not correct. The BLM does govern these lands. The BLM \ncan make these changes. And the BLM has the right under the law to do \nit, even if the permit is issued. The BLM has the right to amend the \npermit if there is major environmental degradation going on.\n  So what the Senator said, and I quote him, ``they could not \nachieve''--that was in the beginning of his statement, and at the end \nof his statement he said, ``it would be very difficult for the BLM to \nachieve changes in the environmental standards allowed under the \npermit.'' The truth is, the BLM can change these standards. They can \nrewrite the permits if there are major grazing changes.\n  Another factor the Senator from Illinois would, I am sure, appreciate \nknowing is, when ranches are brought and sold, while I do not like what \nthe BLM is doing at this moment, they are actually stepping in midway \nnow and saying change some of the regulations. And right now, under \nthis administration's regulations, anyone from the outside can step in \nand say: We don't like the character of the regulations because the \nregulations have failed to address certain needs of the land that are \nnot consistent with the grazing permit.\n  Those are the realities with which we are dealing. That is why the \nSenator from New Mexico thought it was extremely important to offer \nsome degree of certainty to the process. That is exactly what BLM needs \nbecause they have not done their work well. They have a huge backlog. \nIn fiscal year 1999 there were 5,360 grazing permits and leases \nexpiring, and, according to the BLM's latest statistics, only 2,159 of \nthese expiring leases--permits or leases--have been analyzed and \nrenewed. So they have a giant task before them. We encourage them to \ndo so. We finance them so they can.\n\n  Because I am proud of the western legacy of public land grazing, I \nwant it done right. I want it done to assure riparian quality. I do not \nwant our cattlemen run off the public land, the people's land, where \nthe Congress has consistently said it is a right and proper use to \ngraze these grasslands. It is a way to return revenue to our Government \nwhile at the same time ensuring quality wildlife habitat, water \nquality, and all those natural things the Senator from Illinois talks \nabout.\n  Oh, yes, the Senator from Illinois has a right to talk on this issue. \nAbsolutely he does, because these are public lands. But I have tried to \ndiscuss today the sensitivity I hope he understands is important, where \nthese lands become a major factor in the economy of my State--not the \neconomy of his State--where it is critically important that we maintain \na high quality of grasslands to assure a high quality not only for the \nenvironment but for the very users of that environment, in this case \nthe public land grazing in the West.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join me and the Senator from New Mexico \nand other western legislators in tabling this amendment.\n  We are not saying don't do the study. We are saying do it and do it \nright, do it properly, and make the amendments and make the changes \nwhere necessary, protect the riparian zones, make sure that all of that \nhappens as it should. But do not put a black cloud over a third-\ngeneration ranching family who must have a relationship with that land \nto exist and to ensure their financing on an annualized basis.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining under the unanimous consent \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 11 minutes. The \nSenator from Idaho has 9 seconds. He will have to speak quickly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Idaho can use those 9 seconds \nvery effectively, as we have seen in the past.\n  I readily acknowledge to my colleagues from the Western States that \ntheir knowledge of the subject is greater than mine. They live in these \nareas. They deal with these problems on a regular basis. I have tried \nto make it clear with this amendment that I am not seeking to end this \npart of the western economy, the use of public lands for grazing \npurposes. I am not one of those.\n  Someone in the course of the debate said there are some environmental \norganizations so radical that they would stop grazing on public lands. \nThat is not my position. I do not know if it is a position of any of \nthe groups that have endorsed this amendment.\n  What I am trying to do is find a consistent way of protecting the \nprivilege given to private people to use public lands for grazing while \nstill protecting the value of those public lands.\n\n  There are several things that have been said during the debate which \njust baffle me. I want to at least express myself on those and invite \nmy colleagues during the course of my comments to perhaps ask a \nquestion or make a comment if they care to.\n  The first is the argument that unless a rancher can go to a bank and \nsay to the bank, I have the right to graze on this land for at least 3 \nyears or more, that rancher cannot secure a loan for his operation. We \nhave heard this repeatedly. My amendment would extend these permits for \n2 years.\n  Critics of the amendment have stood up and said that is not enough; \nno rancher can secure the money for his ranching operation with only 2 \nyears of certainty. Yet, isn't it odd, as we listen to the debate, that \nthose on the other side have conceded that many of these ranchers are \ndealing with 10-year permits which do expire. So these ranchers have \nfaced this time and again. There has always been the second to the last \nyear and the last year of the permit when they had to finance their \noperations. This is nothing new. What we are saying is give them 2 \nyears with certainty.\n  We have also heard it said that the Bureau of Land Management could \nstep in under extraordinary circumstances and amend the terms and \nconditions of the permits. One of the suggestions was to reduce the \nnumber of animal units or cattle that could be grazing on a certain \npiece of land because of environmental concerns. I hear in that \nsuggestion that the terms and conditions of these permits can also be \nchanged unilaterally during the course of the permit and that these \nranchers continue to do business, continue to secure loans.\n  Those who argue on the other side against my amendment, saying we \nneed drop-dead certainty of 3 years or more or we cannot do business, \nreally, I think, have in the course of their own debate put a mockery \non the table when it comes to that argument. We know these permits \nexpire, and we know they expire in short order, 1 or 2 years to go, and \nthese ranchers stay in business, as they should.\n  I also suggest someone has said: We are not about the business of \nputting pressure on the BLM to do their job. I disagree. I believe it \nis our responsibility as Senators entrusted with these assets of the \nNation, these public lands, to say to the Bureau of Land Management: \nYou have a job to do here as well, not just to give a permit to a \nrancher but to make certain that permit is consistent with protecting \npublic lands, and if you do not do that, we are going to be on your \ncase, we are going to put the pressure on you.\n  Let me step back for a second and tell my colleagues what I think the \nreal concern is. I think there are many who hope the BLM will not do \ntheir job. They would just as soon renew the permits, the terms and \nconditions, indefinitely and not take into consideration these \nenvironmental concerns. That may be their point of view; it is not one \nI share.\n  What I try to achieve by this amendment in a 2-year extension is to \nsay to the BLM: Get your job done, too; protect the ranchers for 2 \nyears, but get your job done, too, to make sure that permit is \nconsistent with the environmental laws of the land. I do not think that \nis wrong.\n  Let me also add, the Senator from New Mexico has read letters into \nthe Record of ranchers of humble means who write to his office \nconcerned about their future. I have farmers in similar circumstances. \nI know that type of plaintive letter. I receive them in my\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\noffice, and I have sympathy for men and women working hard for a living \nwho ask those of us in Washington: Don't make anything more difficult; \ntry to help us if you can.\n\n  Remember last year when we addressed this problem what our solution \nwas? A 1-year extension. The Durbin amendment is a 2-year extension. I \ndo not think this is hard-hearted or heartless on my part. In fact, it \nis an effort to offer twice as much in terms of certainty as was \noffered by this Congress last year. So say to the BLM at the same time, \ndo your job and renew these permits in the right way.\n  For those who argue that I just do not understand it, I am not \nsympathetic, I do not have sufficient compassion for the situation, I \nsuggest that last year a 1-year extension was considered sensible, \nreasonable, and compassionate. Now a 2-year extension is not. I do not \nfollow that logic, that reasoning on the other side.\n  The final point I will make is this: My concern is that in this \ndebate the environmental issue is an afterthought, it is secondary. \nThere are many who are determined to renew permits for ranchers to \ncontinue to use public lands and care not when or if BLM meets its \nresponsibility. I do not agree with that point of view. I think both \nsides have to be taken into consideration. There has to be a balance, \nas offered by this amendment.\n  For those who argue the existing language which Senator Domenici put \nin the bill preserves this environmental protection, I tell them that \nvirtually every major environmental group in America endorses the \nDurbin amendment because they understand that it puts in place a \nmechanism which not only gives the ranchers a new permit and extends \nfor 2 years those that are expiring but says to the BLM: Do your job, \ntoo; you have a responsibility of stewardship as well.\n  That is why the environmental groups support this amendment. That is \nwhy those who vote to table this amendment are basically saying: We \nbelieve the needs and requirements of the ranchers are paramount to the \nneeds and requirements of the American people in the future of their \npublic lands. I disagree with that, and I hope those on both sides of \nthe aisle will take a close look at it when it comes up for this vote.\n  I conclude by saying this amendment strikes a balance which is \nreasonable, which acknowledges that private individuals and their \nfamilies and businesses can continue to use public land for grazing and \ncan do it for 2 years if their permit is expiring but says at the same \ntime to the BLM: Do your job; make certain that you supervise those \nlands in a way that we can say to future generations, those lands will \nbe intact long after we have come and gone so the American people will \nrealize we met our obligation of stewardship of their natural assets.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have 9 seconds left, and I yield back all \n9 seconds. I believe that will bring us to the vote, if the Senator \nfrom Illinois yields back his time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, with more than 5,000 Federal grazing permits \nscheduled to expire in FY 1999, the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, is \nhard pressed to meet its September 30 deadline before hundreds of \nAmerican ranchers are forced to shut down business and move off the \nland. This could result in local economies suffering dramatically for \nthe BLM's inability to keep up with bureaucratic regulations.\n  The Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee has included language \nin this bill that would allow the BLM to complete its permit renewal \nprocess without forcing ranchers out of business.\n  It is important to note, that, in spite of misconceptions put forward \nby the other side:\n  1. The BLM must still comply with all Federal environmental laws and \nthe BLM must still complete all of its environmental reviews. The cost \nof delays, however, will be borne by the agency and not by individual \nranchers who have no control over the completion of the environmental \nreviews.\n  2. The current language does not dictate any new terms or conditions. \nAfter the BLM completes its final reviews the BLM still has the \nauthority to update the terms and conditions of all permits.\n  3. The BLM still holds the authority to terminate grazing permits for \nunauthorized use or noncompliance.\n  The goals of environmental protection and economic stability are not \nmutually exclusive. Please help keep western livestock producers on the \nland while protecting the financial future of family ranches and \nWestern economies.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the existing language in \nSection 117 of the bill, and oppose this and any amendment that may \nadversely impact the delicate balance of sound livestock production, \nand the sustainability of western landscapes for wildlife habitat and \nother recreational opportunities.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will use 25 seconds of it only to clarify one point \nthat has been raised; that is, whether or not I used the word ``may'' \nin contravention to existing law. We object. And the language we have \nin the bill is consistent with the language which was passed last year \nby those who wanted a 1-year extension. It is consistent with the \nlanguage in the House as well. So we have not changed any of the \nlanguage in the bill in that regard.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent I have 2 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I am reading off a type-written \namendment. If you say it is ``shall,'' I withdraw that part.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1591. The yeas and nays have been previously \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, today, the Department of Justice is \nreleasing a report on the success of the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. \nIn its first seven months of operation, national background checks have \nstopped 100,000 felons, fugitives and other prohibited persons from \ngetting guns from licensed firearms dealers.\n  Unfortunately, it doesn't extend to all of the people who sell guns.\n  There is a major gun show loophole. Congress has been unwilling to \nclose that because of the opposition of the gun lobby, even though, \nincidentally, we passed a measure that did close that loophole several \nmonths ago in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. Even though we \nclosed it, we have yet to move forward on the juvenile justice \nconference report. It had been hoped and I think the American people \nhoped that we would complete the juvenile justice bill prior to school \nopening.\n  I am hoping that we can complete it prior to Christmas vacation for \nschools, at the rate we have been going.\n  I talked to a lot of gun dealers at home who say they have to obey \nthe law, they have to fill out the forms, they have to report whether \nsomebody tries to buy a gun illegally, and they ask why they have to \ncompete with those who can take their station wagon to a weekend flea \nmarket and sell guns out of the back of it.\n  This report is more concrete evidence that Congress should extend \nbackground checks to the sales of all firearms.\n  I want to commend the nation's mayors and police chiefs for coming to \nWashington today to demand action on the juvenile justice conference.\n  I hope the leadership in the Senate and the House will listen to what \nthey said. I hope the majority will hear the call of our country's \nlocal officials and law enforcement officers to act now to pass a \nstrong and effective juvenile justice conference report.\n  I am one of the conferees on the juvenile justice bill. I am ready to \nwork with Republicans and Democrats to pass a strong and effective \njuvenile justice conference report. I suspect most Americans, \nRepublicans or Democrats, would like to see that. So far we have only \nhad one meeting to resolve our differences. Even though we passed the \nHatch-Leahy bill months ago, we have had only one conference meeting. \nIn fact, that one meeting was 24 hours before we recessed for the \nAugust recess, almost guaranteeing there would be no more meetings.\n  We haven't concluded our work. The fact is school started without \nCongress finishing its work, and I think that is wrong. We have \novercome technical obstacles, we have overcome threatened filibusters, \nbut now we find that everybody talks about how we should improve the \njuvenile justice system and everybody decries the easy availability of \nguns, but nobody wants to do anything about it.\n  We spent 2 weeks, as I said, on the floor in May. We considered \nalmost 50 amendments to the Senate juvenile justice bill. We made many \nimprovements on the bill. We passed it by a huge bipartisan majority. \nNow I am beginning to wonder whether we were able to pass it because \nthere was a private agreement that the bill would go nowhere.\n  We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of children who do \nnot know how to use them or plan to use them to hurt others. Law \nenforcement officers in this country need our help.\n  I am concerned that we are going to lose the opportunity for a well-\nbalanced juvenile justice bill--one that has strong support from the \npolice, from the juvenile justice authorities, from those in the \nprevention community at all levels. We are going to lose this \nopportunity because one lobby is afraid there might be something in \nthere they disagree with.\n  I come from a State that has virtually no gun laws. I also come from \na State that because of its nature that has extremely little crime. But \nI am asked by Vermonters every day when I am home, they say: Why has \nthis bill been delayed? Aren't you willing to stand up to a powerful \nlobby? My answer so far has been, no; the Congress has not.\n  Due to the delays in convening this conference and then its abrupt \nadjournment before completing its work, we knew before our August \nrecess that the programs to enhance school safety and protect our \nchildren and families called for in this legislation would not be in \nplace before school began.\n  The fact that American children are starting school without Congress \nfinishing its work on this legislation is wrong.\n  We had to overcome technical obstacles and threatened filibusters to \nbegin the juvenile justice conference. It is no secret that there are \nthose in both bodies who would prefer no action and no conference to \nmoving forward on the issues of juvenile violence and crime. Now that \nwe have convened this conference, we should waste no more time to get \ndown to business and finish our work promptly.\n  Those of us serving on the conference and many who are not on the \nconference have worked on versions of this legislation for several \nyears now. We spent two weeks on the Senate floor in May considering \nalmost 50 amendments to S. 254, the Senate juvenile justice bill, and \nmaking many improvements to the underlying bill. We worked hard in the \nSenate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill, and we should \ntake this opportunity to cut through our remaining partisan differences \nto make a difference in the lives of our children and families.\n  I appreciate that one of the most contentious issues in this \nconference is guns, even though sensible gun control proposals are just \na small part of the comprehensive legislation we are considering. The \nquestion that the majority in Congress must answer is what are they \nwilling to do to protect children from gun violence?\n  A report released two months ago on juvenile violence by the Justice \nDepartment concludes that, ``data . . . indicate that guns play a major \nrole in juvenile violence.'' We need to do more to keep guns out of the \nhands of children who do not know how to use them or plan to use them \nto hurt others.\n  Law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns \nout of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking \nabout people who use guns for hunting or for sport, but about criminals \nand unsupervised children.\n  An editorial that appeared yesterday in the Rutland Daily Herald \nsummed up the dilemma in this juvenile justice conference for the \nmajority:\n  ``Republicans in Congress have tried to follow the line of the \nNational Rifle Association. It will be interesting to see if they can \nhold that line when the Nation's crime fighters let them know that \nfighting crime also means fighting guns.''\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country was concerned this \nsummer about school violence over the last two years and worried about \nwhen the next shooting may occur.\n  They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their \nchildren. This is an unacceptable and intolerable situation.\n  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do \nour part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, \neffective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out \nof the hands of children and away from criminals.\n  I hope we get to work soon and finish what we started in the juvenile \njustice conference. We are already tardy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 33\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of the urgent nature of the subject \ninvolved, since the subject will be dealt with on Friday of this week, \ntomorrow, I thought we needed to proceed to have some debate and \nhopefully even a vote with regard to the matter of the pardon of the \nPuerto Rican terrorists.\n  So I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S.J. Res. 33, a \njoint resolution deploring the actions of President Clinton with \nrespect to clemency for FALN terrorists, and there be 2 hours for \ndebate to be equally divided between the two leaders. I further ask \nconsent that no amendments be in order to the resolution and that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of the debate time, the joint \nresolution be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, let me say this \nresolution was introduced last night. It was only put on the calendar \ntoday. To my knowledge, very few, if any, people have had the \nopportunity to read the resolution, much less give much consideration \nto it. So I ask unanimous consent the majority leader's consent request \nbe modified to conform with the regular order of the Senate and provide \nfor amendments and no limit on debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think the \nSenator's point is well taken, that this has come up quickly. But there \nis a reason for that. This whole issue came out during the August \nrecess period when Senators were back in their respective States. I \nthink everybody was stunned and shocked and somewhat in disbelief that \nthese 12 or so terrorists--I believe it was 16 total--were going to be \noffered this clemency and this pardon.\n  We just returned to the Senate for business on Wednesday of this \nweek. There was no earlier opportunity to introduce this resolution, \nand I understand clemency takes effect tomorrow, on Friday. That is why \nit has been handled in this way.\n  Having said that, I inquire of Senator Daschle, with those \namendments, any amendment that would be offered, would they be relevant \nto this subject, to the question of the clemency of these terrorists, \nor would it be his request that any amendment would be in order \naffecting any subject?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I can respond to the distinguished majority leader, \nfirst, let me say that nothing, as I understand it, in this \nresolution--again, I have only had a cursory opportunity to look at \nit--would do anything with regard to the President's actions. The \nPresident is going to be able to act with or without this resolution. \nSo the timing of the resolution has no real bearing on the President's \ndecision.\n  We can adopt or reject the amendment and the resolution at any time. \nThat is, I think, what the majority leader's intent would be, to put \nthe Senate on record with regard to the action, not prevent the \nPresident from doing so because this resolution does not prevent him; \nit simply comments on what they view to be the advisability of the \nresolution.\n  But in answer to the question of the majority leader, let me say, we \nwould want to at least give our colleagues the right to offer \namendments. I am not in a position at this moment to come to agreement \nwith regard to what the amendments might or might not be. I simply am \nasking that in the context of legislation and the Senate rules the \nregular order be followed. The regular order is that Senators can offer \namendments. It does not say the regular order requires germaneness or \nrelevancy. The regular order is Senators have a right to offer \namendments.\n  I simply ask in my unanimous consent request that the regular order \nunder Senate rules be allowed in this case as one would expect they \nwould be followed traditionally.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I say to Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, and other Senators on both sides of the aisle, since \nI believe there apparently will be objection, and there will probably \nbe a vote on this at some point, we will be glad to work on both sides.\n  I know there is a feeling of outrage in the country and on both sides \nof the political aisle about this happening. We are going to express \nourselves either before or after the clemency actually takes place. I \nextend that invitation to work with us to see if we can develop \nlanguage that can have the type of broad support that I believe there \nis in this country on the whole against this action. In view of the \nrequest, I have to object to that addition to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that the unanimous consent \nrequest by the minority leader is not in order. We first must dispose \nof the unanimous consent request of the majority leader before we can \nentertain an additional unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe under that circumstance then it goes back to the \nquestion of whether or not there is objection to my original request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, the majority leader \nobjects to my modification.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As a result of that, I object to the proposal as \npresented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/09/senate-section/article/S10686-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I begin by thanking the majority leader for \noffering the resolution condemning the President's action in granting \nthis clemency to convicted terrorists. What I want to do is begin by \nreminding people about the activities conducted by the organization to \nwhich these 16 terrorists belong. I then will remind people that we are \nabout to see history repeat itself because a President has pardoned and \ngiven clemency to Puerto Rican nationalist terrorists before. Then I \nwill make some basic observations about how outrageous I believe the \nPresident's action is.\n  First, I remind my colleagues that on November 1, 1950, two \nterrorists who were, or at least claimed to be, promoting independence \nfor Puerto Rico attempted to shoot and kill President Truman. One of \nthe gunmen was killed and the other was sentenced to death but \nPresident Truman subsequently commuted the sentence to life \nimprisonment. On March 1, 1954, three such\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\nterrorists opened fire from the gallery of the United States' House of \nRepresentatives--in fact, there is a bullet hole in the ceiling of the \ngallery of the House of Representatives to this day and to this day, a \nbullet hole remains in the desk of the Republican leader on the House \nfloor. Several Congressmen were wounded in the attack, one of them \nquite seriously. This was in 1954.\n  In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter pardoned the three Puerto Rican \nterrorists who were involved in the House of Representatives attack and \nthe terrorist who attempted to take the life of President Truman.\n  The point I want to make, and I think if you will listen to this \npattern of activity you will see that we are in grave danger of history \nrepeating itself. Several terrorists tried to kill the President; \nothers actually shot and wounded Members of Congress; Jimmy Carter \nbecomes President and pardons them, and I believe you will see when I \ngo through the list of terrorist acts committed by those terrorists who \nare now being given clemency by President Clinton that there was a \nsurge in such terrorist activity after the Carter pardons, when it \nappeared to became clear that you could actually attempt to murder the \nPresident, shoot Members of Congress, commit terrorist acts, and be \npardoned by the President of the United States. In short, history is \nabout to repeat itself.\n  We use clinical terms in talking about these people. But I want to go \nback and give first a review of history and then I want to talk about \nfour of their acts. Then I will talk about three of their victims. I \nwill make my point and get out of the way and let other people have an \nopportunity to speak.\n  Let me review the following facts. On Wednesday, August 11, President \nClinton offered clemency to 16 terrorists who were members of the \nnotorious FALN, Armed Forces of National Liberation, terrorist group in \nexchange for the simple act of agreeing not to use violence to promote \ntheir political agenda. I wonder if one looked at every felon, every \nmurderer, every terrorist, every drug dealer in every prison in America \nand asked them, Would you be willing to say you won't do it again if we \nlet you out, my guess is there would be no one left in any prison \nanywhere in America. That is the President's standard.\n  The New York Times reported on August 27 that the FBI, the Bureau of \nPrisons, and the U.S. attorneys in Illinois and Connecticut, flatly \nopposed President Clinton's offer of clemency to these terrorists.\n  Newsweek reported this week that some of the 16 terrorists offered \nclemency were captured on tape by the Bureau of Prisons discussing a \nreturn to violence upon release from prison.\n  The FALN carried out 130 bombings of key political and military \nlocations throughout the United States. The number of such attacks, and \ntheir frequency, has never been rivaled by any terrorist group in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  The 16 terrorists who were offered clemency are serving prison \nsentences ranging from 15 to 105 years.\n  Most of the 16 terrorists were charged with seditious conspiracy and \nweapons possession connected to 28 bombings that occurred in northern \nIllinois in the late 1970s.\n  Despite the President's generous deal, and demonstrating a clear lack \nof remorse for their reign of terror and destruction, 13 of the 16 \nterrorists have called the President's offer of clemency \n``intolerable.''\n  On Wednesday, September 8, 12 of the jailed Puerto Rican terrorists \naccepted President Clinton's offer of clemency.\n  That is a recounting of the recent events.\n  Let me talk about four of the crimes that were committed because, \nagain, it is easy to talk about this act of clemency and pardon by the \nPresident, and sometimes it is hard to remember what happened.\n  In January of 1975, members of this terrorist group bombed a \nhistorical site in lower Manhattan and killed 4 people and injured 53 \npeople.\n  In August of 1977, they bombed the Mobil Oil Corporation building on \nEast 42nd Street in Manhattan and killed a 26-year-old young man.\n  On New Year's Eve in 1982, their terrorist acts accelerated; they \nbombed the New York City Police Headquarters, the Manhattan office of \nthe FBI, the Metropolitan Correctional Center, and other locations, \nseriously injuring several New York City police officers, including \nDetective Richard Pastorella.\n  Let me tell you about him.\n  Detective Pastorella was blinded in both eyes. He lost all five \nfingers on his right hand. He is deaf in his right ear and lost 70 \npercent of his hearing in his left ear. He required 13 major operations \non his face alone. He had 20 titanium screws used to hold his facial \nbones together.\n  Let me give you a quote from him: ``You wake up with nightmares at \nnight, cold sweats. It never leaves. It never goes away.''\n  The second police detective who was wounded in this terrorist attack \non New Year's Eve in 1982 was Anthony Senft. He underwent five \noperations in 1983 alone. He is blind in his right eye. He has \ndiminished hearing in both ears. His nose, eyeball sockets, and hip \nhave been reconstructed.\n  Police Officer Rocco Pascarella had his left leg amputated below the \nknee. He is deaf in his left ear. He lost 20 percent of his hearing in \nhis right ear. He is legally blind in his left eye.\n  Let me make two other points of fact, and then I will say what I have \nto say.\n  Carmen Valentin, one of the 16 terrorists offered clemency, called \nthe judge a terrorist when she was being sentenced and said that only \nthe chains around her waist and wrists prevented her from doing what \nshe would like to do; and that is, kill the judge.\n  Ricardo Jiminez shouted to the judge, when he was sentenced to \nprison, ``We're going to fight . . . revolutionary justice will take \ncare of you and everybody else!''\n  The worst wave of terrorist attacks in the history of America were \ncommitted by the group to which the 16 people whom the President is in \nthe process of pardoning and letting out of jail, belong and all he \nasked is that they say they won't do it again.\n  Joe Lockhart, the White House Press Secretary, on September 8, 1999, \nwhen he was talking about the Osama bin Laden terrorist case, said: \n``You know, I think that our efforts to bring terrorists to justice are \none of the highest priorities of the president's national security \nagenda.''\n  I ask my colleagues, if bringing terrorists to justice, if deterring \nterrorism is one of the President's top priorities, what is he doing \npardoning 16 terrorists who killed Americans on our own soil?\n  When we are facing, as our greatest national security crisis in the \nworld, terrorist acts, when we are threatened with terrorism in our \nhomes and in our cities and in our businesses, in our capital, in the \nCapitol Building, in our embassies, when we are trying to deter \nterrorist acts, what is the President of the United States doing \npardoning people who have committed such acts?\n  I think I know what he is doing. I think he is playing New York \npolitics. We have offered a resolution condemning this action by the \nPresident.\n  I wonder, if the First Lady were a Senator, if she would cosponsor \nthis resolution. I wonder if our Vice President, who is running for \nPresident, supports the President's policy. I wonder if he would \nsupport this resolution.\n  But I say I think it is an absolute outrage, at the very moment when \nwe face terrorist attacks and threats to our embassies all over the \nworld, when we face the very real threat of terrorism in the heartland \nof America, at the very moment when our No. 1 national security problem \nin the world is terrorism, we have the President of the United States \npardoning terrorists who are reported to have no remorse about the acts \nthey have taken, and at least some evidence is available that they have \nsaid they will commit these acts again if they are freed.\n  As I have said earlier, I do not know what kind of standard it is, \nsaying you are sorry and you won't do it again. By that standard, we \nwould release every criminal in every prison in America.\n  But I believe Congress should go on record. Let me also say that if \nwe could overturn the President's decision, I would be in favor of \ndoing it. The President has the right to pardon under the Constitution. \nWe have no powers, as far as I am aware, to overturn that decision. But \nif we could, I would offer an amendment to do it.\n  Let me say to the minority leader, it is true that this resolution \nwas just introduced last night. But there is hardly\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nanything startling in this resolution. Basically, this resolution says \nthat we deplore what the President has done. You either deplore it or \nyou do not deplore it. So I think we can engage in these parliamentary \ngimmicks for a while, but I think eventually people are going to \nunderstand.\n  I say, as one Member of the Senate, we are going to vote on this \nresolution or we are going to vote on a cloture motion related to \nit. We are going to have Senators on record. I think people have a \nright to know whether you think it is a good idea for the President of \nthe United States to be pardoning terrorists who have killed Americans. \nI think this is a very serious matter.\n\n  It is a very serious matter, not because it has to do with New York \npolitics, not because we have gotten into this absurd charade where the \nPresident clearly undertakes this action to respond to a political \nconstituency in New York only to see it backfire--the First Lady is \nopposed to it unless they say they are sorry and they won't do it \nagain--I think that is, to a large extent, beside the point. The real \npoint is, at a time when the greatest threat we face to national \nsecurity is terrorism, what are we doing pardoning terrorists?\n  I conclude by asking my colleagues, do we never learn anything? When \nwe had terrorists promoting with violence and attempted murder exactly \nthe same cause of the terrorists that the President is pardoning today, \nwhen we had terrorists with the same goal shoot Members of Congress in \n1954 and try to kill President Truman in 1950, and when we see Jimmy \nCarter as President in 1979, pardon those terrorists. What happened in \nthe 1970s and 1980s? New members of the terrorist group committed acts \nof violence in the same name to promote the same objective. We have a \nprocess. If people in Puerto Rico want to be an independent nation, let \nthem choose to do it. But let's not use violence to promote an \nobjective. I think civilization breaks down when we allow that to \nhappen.\n  We saw terrorist acts in 1950 and 1954. Jimmy Carter came into \noffice, pardoned the terrorists in 1979, and you have heard me describe \nsome of the terrorist acts that took place in the early 1980s, and now \nwe are about to repeat, in my opinion, the same sad history. I think \nthis is a bad idea. I think it is wrong. I am opposed to it. I think it \nis outrageous. I think the President ought to be ashamed of it. I think \nthe American people need to hold him accountable. I think the American \npeople have a right to know who finds the President's act deplorable.\n  I do. I want people to know it. I think our colleagues ought to be on \nrecord, and they will be as a result of this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join with the Senators from Georgia \nand Texas and the majority leader, Trent Lott, in expressing my very \ndeep concern about what I consider to be one of the greatest \nmiscarriages of justice I have seen in our country.\n  When the President of the United States chose to pardon these 16 \nterrorists, he did an act which I can only conclude is based on \npolitical reasons and not on merit, and in doing so, he has damaged the \ncredibility of the Department of Justice, a Department of this \nGovernment I dearly love, at which I spent 15 years and have some real \nappreciation for and have some understanding about how it works. Equal \njustice under law is a cornerstone of our Government. It is on our \nSupreme Court building right across the street, chiseled into the \nmarble of that building, ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n\n  Before we go into the details of this matter, I suggest that there \nare a million or more Americans in jail at this very moment. As a \nFederal prosecutor, part of the Department of Justice, and U.S. \nattorney, I had the responsibility to preside over cases in which young \nmen and women involved, maybe for the first time, with large amounts of \ncocaine and marijuana received very severe sentences for their \noffenses--15 years, 20 years, life without parole for people as young \nas 25 years of age. I have seen that in Federal court under the laws \nthis Congress has passed for serious drug offenses.\n  Now, there are other criminal offenses in this country, and every one \nof those individuals has some excuse for what they did. They have some \nbasis to claim they didn't mean it or they have changed or they have \nturned over a new leaf.\n  In 1893, the President of the United States issued a document, an \nExecutive order, that transferred the investigatory power over clemency \nand pardons to the Department of Justice, a logical step. The country \nwas growing and he had no ability to investigate these cases. So an \noffice in the Department of Justice exists, known as the pardon \nattorney, and it is the responsibility of that office to investigate \nthese matters.\n  Let me read to you from the current Department of Justice manual. \nThey call it the United States Attorney's Manual. It says this when it \ntalks about the pardon attorney:\n\n       The pardon attorney, under the direction of the associate \n     Attorney General, receives and reviews all petitions for \n     executive clemency--which is what we have here--\n     which includes pardon after completion of the sentence, the \n     commutation of sentence, remission of fine and reprieve, \n     initiates necessary investigation, and prepares the \n     Department's recommendation to the President.\n\n  Now, fundamentally, that is a logical requirement. The Constitution \nflatly gives unreviewable power to the President to pardon anyone for \nan offense against the United States as he so chooses. They have set up \nthis procedure to make sure we have some sort of order and consistency, \nbut the President ultimately has the power. I understand he has only \ndone a few commutations --maybe as few as four--in recent years. At any \nrate, that is an unreviewable power. To the extent to which he does it, \nwe don't legally have the power to stop it in this body. We might as \nwell accept that.\n  But when the President of the United States takes a power given to \nhim by the Constitution and he abuses it and he denigrates the orderly \nprocedures of justice, when he elevates terrorists over other people \nwho may well deserve pardons much more, or having their sentence cut \nmuch more, he has abused his power and abused his office, and it is the \nduty and responsibility of this Congress to do the only thing we can, \nand that is to adopt a resolution that speaks clearly that we don't \naccept it, don't agree with it, and we deplore it. So I salute the \nSenator from Georgia for preparing that resolution and presenting it \nand bringing it forward this day.\n  There are thousands of people in Federal prisons today--thousands of \nthem, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands--who are more deserving \nof a commutation of their sentence, or a pardon, than these defendants \nin this case. There is no doubt about it.\n  I am quite confident, and I would be shocked if the pardon attorney \nwho is required to do an evaluation of this approved and recommended \nthat the President make these clemency actions. I just would be amazed \nif that happened. If they did, that pardon attorney needs to come \nbefore the Congress for hearings in this body and explain why they \nchose to have these terrorists' sentences cut and not someone else. If \nthe person did recommend that, I don't see how they are fit to remain \nin office. I don't see how they can look in the eyes of the mothers and \nfathers, as I have, of people in prison who are asking for a break on \ntheir sentences, and you tell them no, no, no, no, no--and then you \ngive a break to these people. It is a fundamental question of justice \nthat is so deep that a lot of people don't understand it. But we must \nexercise the pardon and clemency powers in this country effectively, \nfairly, and judiciously. The President has not done that in this case.\n\n  I wanted to share with the Members of this body a letter to the Wall \nStreet Journal from just a couple of days ago, written by Deborah A. \nDevaney, former assistant U.S. attorney. I once was an assistant U.S. \nattorney. I supervised some of the finest assistant U.S. attorneys this \ncountry has ever produced for 12 years as U.S. attorney. I want to read \nwhat she said about this case. It chills my spine. This is clearly what \nthis is about. Make no mistake about it, when Deborah Devaney and her \ncohorts were prosecuting these terrorists, you better believe when they \ncame home at night and talked to their families about it, they talked \nabout their own personal safety because these were terrorists, \nmurderers, who suggested\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nthey would kill the judge if they had a chance to do so. This was a \ncourageous prosecution, and this person deserves to be heard on this \nsubject. This is what she said:\n\n       As one of the FALN prosecutors, I know too much. I know the \n     chilling evidence that convicted the petitioners--the \n     violence and vehemence with which they conspired to wage war \n     on all of us.\n\n  I am quoting her exact words:\n\n       I know, too, the commitment and sacrifice it took the FBI \n     and the U.S. Attorney's Office to convict these terrorists in \n     three separate prosecutions.\n       In the first prosecution, some of the petitioners were \n     captured in the back of a van loaded with weapons to be used \n     to commit armed robberies to fund the FALN operations.\n\n  Now, we have a President who is always talking about some new gun law \nto apply to some innocent American citizen. Here we have people with a \nvan full of weapons designed to conduct armed robberies to get money to \ncreate bombs to kill American citizens, and he cuts their sentences.\n\n       In the second prosecution, three of the petitioners were \n     caught on videotape in safehouses--\n\n  That is where they thought they had a safe house--\n\n     making bombs that they planned to plant at military \n     installations.\n\n  So they had a house set aside to make bombs to blow up a military \ninstallation, and the FBI penetrated it, apparently, and videotaped it. \nNow, I will tell you, there are a lot of people in the Federal \npenitentiary today who deserve clemency a lot more than these, but only \nfour others have gotten it since this President has been in office, \napparently. She goes on to note:\n\n       Through determination and luck, the FBI was able to obtain \n     search warrants allowing them to surreptitiously disarm those \n     bombs at night.\n\n  They went in the place and disarmed the bombs as part of the \nundercover effort.\n\n       In the third prosecution, the imprisoned leader of the \n     FALN, (whose sentence President Clinton has drastically \n     reduced) led a conspiracy of cooperating radical groups to \n     obtain C-4 explosives to be used to free him from Leavenworth \n     Penitentiary --\n\n  He was already in jail and they were going to free him--\n\n     and to wage war on the American people. Most of the \n     petitioners were convicted of seditious conspiracy, a \n     prosecution reserved for the most serious conspiracies, that \n     of opposing by force the authority of the United States.\n       Yet the President has seen fit to reward these conspirators \n     simply because they were unsuccessful in their murderous \n     attempts.\n\n  Well, he said, ``I pardon them because nobody was hurt.'' Now you \nknow why nobody was hurt by this bunch. It was because they were caught \nin the act before they completed their crime. They were caught with a \nvan load of guns to commit robberies, apparently, before they were able \nto commit the robberies.\n  They penetrated the bombmaking enterprise and caught them before they \ncould make the bombs. Morally they are as responsible as if they had \nbeen able to carry out their intentions. There is no basis to suggest \nthey deserve a lesser punishment or should be relieved of the just \nsentence that was imposed on them by a Federal judge and had it \naffirmed by the courts of appeals in full appellate review.\n  It goes on to note that when the news of the clemency petition broke, \nthe White House spun the tale that Mr. Clinton was freeing only those \nwho harmed no one. A few dedicated agents are the only people who stood \nin their way.\n  That is what Ms. Devaney says. Only a few dedicated agents were \nthere, or they would have harmed someone at the risk of their very \nlives, I submit to you. The conspirators, she says, made every effort \nto murder and to maim. It is no small irony that they should be freed \nunder the guise of humanitarianism.\n  Then she goes on.\n  Since the granting of the clemency petition, we have been subjected \nto the spectacle of convicted terrorists objecting to the conditions \nprecedent to their release.\n  Isn't that a spectacle? Isn't she correct about that? He has given \nthem a pardon--letting them out of jail. And now they are not happy \nbecause he asked them not to do violence in the future. That is too \nmuch of a burden on them, they say.\n  That is really an embarrassment to this Nation. This Nation is a \ngreat nation. The Presidency of the United States is an august office \nof power and prestige, and the President needs to exercise that power \ncarefully. The world will be laughing at us over this. The world is \nlaughing at this.\n  We ought not to be. We ought to be outraged.\n  Contrast those protestations, she says, with a poignant message of \nthe Connors whose lives were forever diminished by the political murder \nof their father. There is little anyone can say to give solace, but I \nwould like the Connor family to know that there were those who cared \nabout the victims and fought for them, Ms. Devaney--and those FBI \nagents--being one of them who fought for them and who believed these \ncrimes were the precursors to heightened domestic terrorism, and who \ntried very hard to protect the American people.\n  In fact, I will add that this series of prosecutions and tough \nsentences that were imposed by a courageous Federal judge broke the \nback of these terrorist acts. We have a safer country today because of \nit and because of the courage of the people who brought these cases \nsuccessfully.\n  Then she finished. All of America ought to hear this. This is her \nlast line.\n\n       I would like the Connor family to know that the American \n     justice system did not fail them. The President did.\n\n  This is a real serious issue. Justice in this country is extremely \nimportant. Out of all the people who are in jail today--all over \nAmerica in Federal jails, many of them convicted and serving long \nsentences, some of them might deserve a sentence to be cut every now \nand then. For some of them maybe their offenses were not so serious \nthat a pardon after some period of time in private life living a good \nlife would be justified.\n  I have supported, in 15 years as a Federal prosecutor, two or three \npardons for people who I believe justified it. These were pardons after \nthey had served their time--not letting them out of jail before their \ntime was over--after they had led a good life for a number of years, \nand only after I thought, after fully evaluating their case, that the \noffenses were not so serious that a pardon would be improper. Many of \nthose offenses may have been technical offenses, paperwork offenses, or \nthings that were less serious.\n  But to take a terrorist, a person with a truckload of guns, C-4 \nexplosives, and plans to blow up military bases, and give them a pardon \nover everybody else in the prison system in America--that doesn't make \nsense to me. There is something afoot here.\n\n  I think it is important that the First Lady rejected this after the \nstorm blew up. I think we need to know where the Vice President stands \non this and what his views are on this. The President has apparently \nacted. I hope it is not too late for him to change his mind. But if it \nhas been done, it has been done. It is his power. He can do it. And we \ncan't do anything about it.\n  Let me show you what the Department of Justice U.S. Attorneys Manual, \nsection 1-2.108 under the Office of the Pardon Attorney rubric notes \nabout how you determine who deserves clemency.\n  With respect to commutation of sentence--that is what we are talking \nabout here--appropriate grounds for considering clemency include \ndisparity of sentence. Have they received a lot more sentence than \nsomebody else of the same offense? A terminal illness--we don't have \nthat here--and meritorious service on the part of the petitioner in \nsome fashion.\n  Pardons after completion of the sentence usually are granted on the \ndemonstration of good conduct for a significant period of time after \nrelease from confinement.\n  The seriousness of the offense, it goes on to say, are factors that \nshould be considered in whether to grant clemency.\n  I think we have a number of things that we need to know about. I hope \nthe Senator from Georgia will be having some hearings about it. We need \nto know. What did the Attorney General do? Did she recommend for or \nagainst this?\n  Frankly, I cannot imagine the Attorney General recommending these \npardons. I am going to be shocked if she recommended it.\n  We need to know whether the pardon attorney recommended them or not. \nHe\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\nhas a duty in this case. Did they even bypass him?\n  You will notice one other thing that is most unusual about how this \nprocess was conducted. Here it is in the Code of Federal Regulations--\nreferring to the same subject--petitions and recommendations: Executive \nclemency, says the Attorney General, shall review each petition and all \npertinent information developed through the investigation.\n  It says ``shall review each petition.''\n  Is there a petition in this case? From what we have seen in the \npapers, there was not. These people never even asked for a pardon. They \nnever even petitioned for a pardon to set forth why they are entitled \nto one.\n  According to the U.S. attorney's manual, the petition initiates a \nbackground investigation to see if it is worthwhile to go forward.\n  That, again, is an extraordinary event--the President pardoning 16 \nconvicted terrorists sentenced to a very long time in prison who have \nnot even petitioned for it.\n  I can't imagine that. That is beyond my comprehension. It is a threat \nand a diminishment to the rule of law in this country. It is an \nembarrassment to the justice system of our country.\n  I hope we will continue to look into it. We will find out what basis \nthere was for it. We know the FBI opposed this clemency. We know the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons opposed it. Indeed, the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons, it is reported, have audio records indicating that some of \nthese 16 have vowed to resume violent activities--recordings made while \nthey were still in prison. And he has pardoned these people?\n  That is beyond my comprehension.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will proceed with it carefully. It is \nnot a matter that is insignificant. If this is what we call \npoliticizing justice in America, it is sad, and we need to know if that \nis true. We need to stand up as a nation and as a Senate, reject it, \nand say we will not condone politics when it comes to justice; we will \nnot do so; we will protect the lives of Americans; we will validate the \npersonal risk this young prosecutor and those FBI agents expended in \norder to apprehend these criminals and the risk and damage and \nsuffering of the victims throughout the procedure. I hope we can do \nthat, get to the bottom of it, and that the truth will come out.\n\n  To pardon somebody is so serious, if I were the pardon attorney of \nthe United States and I recommended against these pardons, and then the \nPresident of the United States pardoned them, I don't believe I could \ncontinue to serve in that administration. I believe I would submit my \nresignation.\n  Every year there are thousands of requests for pardon and clemency. A \nlot of them are so much more deserving of this. And the President comes \nalong, for some unknown reason to me as pardon attorney, and grants \nthese pardons to terrorists, and I am supposed to forget that and \ncontinue to deny every day young men and women who have served \nsentences who are so much more deserving of a pardon. What kind of \njustice system is that? What kind of right and wrong is that?\n  I say to the pardon attorney who is presidentially appointed and \nconfirmed by this Congress: We want to know your position on this. This \ngoes for the Attorney General. We want to know what the Attorney \nGeneral's recommendation was on this before it got to the President.\n  As someone who loves justice and the legal system of America, as \nsomeone who cares about its faithful execution and the laws being \nfairly and objectively enforced, equal justice under law, I believe we \nhave to talk about this. We cannot let this slide.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Georgia. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend both the Senator from Alabama \nand the Senator from Texas who preceded him on their remarks regarding \nthis subject.\n  I am particularly taken with the personal experience the Senator from \nAlabama brings to this as a former prosecutor. He raises a point in \nconjunction with the exchange that occurred between the majority and \nminority leader about the timeliness of this. The minority leader \nsuggested we can't really affect the President's decision--that is \ncorrect--and therefore we are under no mandate to speak hurriedly--\nwrong.\n  The Senator from Alabama talked about the duty and the honor of the \nlaw enforcement officials who put their lives on the line to stop this \nterrorist activity. He alluded to victims, two sons who lost their \nfather in the tavern in New York.\n  The Senator from Alabama is making the case that there must be a \nvoice in our Government that says to these people and the world that \nthis divergence from policy about how the United States handles \nterrorism is not universally accepted here. In fact, there is massive \nobjection. It is setting the record straight. Because of the speed with \nwhich the President has proceeded with this, a speed must occur that \nresponds to it. There is no terrorist in the world, no law enforcement \nofficial, no living victim who does not understand what U.S. policy is \nwith regard to terrorism, even if there is confusion in the White \nHouse.\n  The U.S. State Department has a report entitled ``Patterns of Global \nTerrorism in 1998'' which is exceedingly pertinent to this discussion. \nBefore I read from this paragraph, terrorism is now a component of \nstrategic warfare. It is not a passing fad as we might have thought in \nthe 1980s. It is a permanent tool of forces throughout the world that \nwould destabilize large free societies such as the United States. It is \nhere. It will become even more perfected. Therefore, this issue \nrequires massive attention of our Government.\n\n  The introduction to this chapter reads:\n\n       The cowardly and deadly bombings of the U.S. Embassies in \n     Kenya and Tanzania in August of 1998 [just a year ago] were \n     powerful reminders that the threat of international terrorism \n     still confronts the world.\n\n  This is our State Department telling all Americans that this issue is \ndynamic, it is large, and we had better be paying attention.\n  It goes on to list the number of casualties and wounded. It says:\n\n       It is essential that all law-abiding nations [the rule of \n     law to the Senator from Alabama] redouble their efforts to \n     contain this global threat and save lives.\n\n  That is a correct statement coming from our State Department in this \nadministration.\n  It says:\n\n       The United States is engaged in a long-term effort against \n     international terrorism. [These are international terrorists \n     we are talking about.] To protect lives and to hold \n     terrorists accountable we will use the full range of tools at \n     our disposal, including diplomacy backed by the use of force \n     when necessary as well as law enforcement and economic \n     measures.\n\n  In other words, no stone unturned in terms of recognizing the threat \nof terrorism to the United States and to the free world and our resolve \nto contain it.\n  Obviously, this clemency is a contradiction with policy. It is \nincongruous. It is illogical.\n  Let me go on to the summary of the policy:\n\n       The United States has developed a counterterrorism policy \n     that has served us well over the years [Republican and \n     Democrat administrations] and was advanced aggressively \n     during 1998.\n       First, make no concessions to terrorists and strike no \n     deals.\n\n  I repeat the one sentence: ``Make no concessions to terrorists and \nstrike no deals.''\n\n       Second, bring terrorists to justice for their crimes.\n\n  Now, a tortured editorial in the New York Times endeavors to give \nsome credence to this action, although they say it is a bit difficult. \nThe President has been totally silent. He has not defended his actions. \nHe hasn't given reasons for them. He is just quiet, so it makes it a \nlittle complicated here.\n  They say in closing:\n\n       At a time when the United States must be vigilant against \n     terrorism [that is certainly true] all over the world, the \n     administration cannot afford mixed signals about its \n     tolerance of violence. At the same time, justice demands the \n     sentence fit the crime as proved in a court of law. The \n     long sentences of the men in this case resulted at least \n     in part from their declining even to contest the charges. \n     They accepted the case presented against them and even \n     threatened the life of the judge presiding over the case.\n\n  I have to say that if you commute, pardon, the sentences of 16 \nconvicted terrorists who did not dispute the facts, who had arms in \ntheir vans, who were planning these bombings, who created 130 bombings \nin the United States, 70 wounded--we have heard certain personal \ndescriptions about it: 6\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\ndead and, by the grace of God and these law enforcement officers, not \nmore--how clear a case must we have?\n  I repeat our policy, the United States policy:\n\n       First, make no concessions to terrorists and strike no \n     deals.\n\n  Not only was there clemency offered here but the standards of it were \nmade known: If you will just promise not to associate with that kind of \ncrowd anymore and tell us you are going to be OK and you won't do this \nanymore, we are going to let you out. What an absurd condition, \nrelating to people who have been convicted for international terrorism.\n  My point here is that the New York Times editorial is hopelessly lost \nbecause there is no way to achieve anything other than a mixed signal. \nIf the policy is ``make no concessions to terrorists and strike no \ndeals,'' and the President makes a deal with 16 terrorists and says you \ncan get out because you didn't throw the bomb, what kind of message is \nthat? Does that mean bin Laden is some lesser problem to the United \nStates because he did not personally throw the bomb in Kenya and \nTanzania? Is he, therefore, less of a threat to the United States just \nbecause he planned it, less than the person who threw it? Would anybody \nin their right mind believe that?\n  So we do have a mixed signal. And, therefore, we need these \nresolutions to be adopted by the people's branch of Government that \nsays to these terrorists wherever they are, whatever their plans, our \npolicy is: Make no concessions and strike no deals, and if you are \narrested and caught by these law enforcement officers, you are going to \nface the harshest form of justice. It is the only way we will be able \nto stabilize the threat of terrorism in the United States.\n  I am going to conclude by just noting that the House resolution on \nthis subject, H. Con. Res. 180, has just been agreed to. There were 311 \nMembers of the House who voted ``aye,'' 41 voted ``no.'' But here is \nthe shocker: 72 only voted ``present.'' That is pretty remarkable.\n  I have always said the best barometer of where the American people \nare is the House. It is a great barometer. This says the American \npeople do not accept this incongruity in our pursuit to throttle \nterrorism. The message that has been sent by the President is a wrong \nmessage, and the responsibility of the people's branch is to get the \nmessage straight and fast.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the key things in any pardon is \nthat the individual is presumed to be guilty of the offenses, and when \nthey review a pardon or a clemency it normally does not even deal with \nthe question of guilt or innocence. It is assumed since the jury has \nconvicted them and the case has been affirmed--and I don't think there \nis any doubt about these defendants. They have never even denied their \ninvolvement in these offenses. But I would like to point out that \nbefore you have clemency for individuals, they really should renounce, \nclearly and unequivocally, the acts which they have done.\n  You would think that would mean some of these prisoners would say \nthat violence in these circumstances was terribly wrong, I wish I \nhadn't done it, I am sorry for the lives, I apologize for the \ndestruction and devastation it has caused. But that is not the case.\n  I am reading here from the Washington Post, a newspaper here in \nWashington known for its pro-Clinton leanings. This is what Michael \nKelly has written about this very subject, about whether or not they \nhave renounced their wrongdoing. He says:\n\n       . . . none of the 16 prisoners has ever admitted to \n     complicity in any fatal bombings or expressed specific \n     remorse for those bombings. No one has ever apologized to the \n     families of those murdered. The statement signed by the 12 \n     who have accepted commutation does renounce the use of \n     violence, but it expresses no contrition or responsibility \n     for past actions.\n       And these selected statements distributed by the White \n     House did not fully and honestly represent the views of the \n     16. Not included, for instance, was a 1998 [just last year] \n     statement by one of the FALN leaders, Oscar Lopez Rivera, in \n     which Rivera rejected the whole idea of contrition.\n\n  I am quoting here Michael Kelly in the Washington Post:\n\n       I cannot undo what's done. The whole idea of contrition, \n     atonement, I have a problem with that.\n\n  So I will just say that is a sad event we are now proposing, to offer \nclemency to persons with that type of mentality. I believe this has \nbeen a colossal error, a great stain on the integrity and consistency \nof the Department of Justice pardon and commutation procedures. It \ncannot be explained to any rational person. It represents an \naberrational, unfair, and unjust act that I can only conclude was \ndriven by some forces, probably political, outside the realm of \njustice. It is a terrible thing.\n  I agree with the Senator from Georgia, it is important that at least \nthis branch of Government, the Senate and the House, speak out clearly \nand deplore it.\n  I thank the Senate for its time and attention and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/09/senate-section/article/S10691-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10691-S10692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RUSSIAN STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ANTI-BALLISTIC MISSILE TREATY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the National Missile Defense Act makes it \nthe policy of the United States to deploy a limited national missile \ndefense system as soon as the technology to do so is ready. This act \nwas passed by large margins in both Houses. Because the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile or ABM Treaty prohibits such a system, that treaty must be \nmodified.\n  That point was made in the debate on the National Missile Defense Act \nin the Senate, and it is the reason why administration officials have \nengaged the Russian Government in discussions on modifying the treaty. \nThese discussions began last month in Moscow, and I am pleased that \nstaff members of the Senate's National Security Working Group were able \nto attend and be briefed on the progress of those talks. Deputy \nSecretary of State Strobe Talbott is in Moscow for further negotiations \non this and other important issues.\n  But I am very disturbed by reported comments of Russian officials on \nthis subject. Today, for example, it was reported that Mr. Roman \nPopkovich, Chairman of the Defense Committee of the Russian Parliament, \nsaid that if the United States builds a missile defense system, Russia \nmay respond by ``developing an entirely new kind of offensive weapon.'' \nMr. Popkovich was also quoted in this story as saying, ``No anti-\nmissile defense will be able to stop our new missiles.''\n  His are not the first such comments we have heard about modifying the \nABM Treaty. The lead Russian negotiator, Grigory Berdennikov, said the \nmere raising of the issue meant ``the arms race could now leap to outer \nspace.'' Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of International Cooperation in the \nRussian Ministry of Defense, said that modifying the treaty ``would be \nto destroy the entire process of nuclear arms control.''\n  I don't know the motivations for such statements, but I believe they \ndeserve a response. There should be no misunderstanding of our Nation's \nintentions with respect to national missile defense. We face a real and \ngrowing threat of ballistic missile attack from rogue states or outlaw \nnations. That threat is advancing, often in unanticipated ways. The \nU.S. Government has a duty to protect its citizens from this threat.\n  It is our policy, which is now set in law, to deploy a system to \ndefend against limited attack by ballistic missiles as soon as \ntechnologically possible. The system we intend to deploy in no way \nthreatens the strategic retaliatory force of Russia. The ABM Treaty, an \nagreement between two nuclear superpowers engaged in an arms buildup in \n1972, prohibits such a system and must be modernized. I am sure Russian \nofficials know all of this. They have been briefed repeatedly on the \nU.S. assessment of the threat. They have been briefed repeatedly on \nU.S. plans for national missile defense and know as well as we do that \nthe system we contemplate is not directed at Russia and poses no threat \nto its forces.\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\n  So the statements of Mr. Popkovich and the other Russian officials \nessentially threatening an arms race if the U.S. does what it must do \nto protect its citizens are very disappointing. They sound like \nsomething from the past, an echo of the cold war that is over.\n  The United States has embarked in good faith in discussions about the \nneed to modernize the ABM Treaty. We negotiated in good faith with \nRussia when it demanded changes to the Conventional Forces in Europe \nTreaty in order to enable Russia to adapt to changed circumstances. It \nwould be unfortunate if the United States were put in the position of \nchoosing between defending its citizens and adhering to an outdated \nagreement because we have already determined that we will defend \nourselves.\n  I am confident the Senate will not accept an arrangement in which the \nU.S. continues to be vulnerable to new threats because of a 27-year-old \nagreement that is so clearly out of date. What is needed now is for the \nrhetoric to be cooled, for threats about arms races and new missiles to \nbe set aside, and let serious and fruitful discussions proceed. It is \nin not only our interest for that to happen but Russia's as well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the McGregor Range at Fort \n     Bliss, Texas; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, Future military threats to the United States and \n     its allies may come from technologically advanced rogue \n     states that for the first time are armed with long-range \n     missiles capable of delivering nuclear, chemical, or \n     biological weapons to an increasingly wider range of \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. military strategy requires flexible and \n     strong armed forces that are well-trained, well-equipped, and \n     ready to defend our nation's interests against these \n     devastating weapons of mass destruction; and\n       Whereas, Previous rounds of military base closures combined \n     with the realignment of the Department of the Army force \n     structure have established Fort Bliss as the Army's Air \n     Defense Artillery Center of Excellence, thus making McGregor \n     Range, which is a part of Fort Bliss, the nation's principal \n     training facility for air defense systems; and\n       Whereas, McGregor Range is inextricably linked to the \n     advanced missile defense testing network that includes Fort \n     Bliss and the White Sands Missile Range, providing, \n     verifying, and maintaining the highest level of missile \n     defense testing for the Patriot, Avenger, Stinger, and other \n     advanced missile defense systems; and\n       Whereas, The McGregor Range comprises more than half of the \n     Fort Bliss installation land area, and the range and its \n     restricted airspace in conjunction with the White Sands \n     Missile Range, is crucial to the development and testing of \n     the Army Tactical Missile System and the Theater High \n     Altitude Area Defense System; and\n       Whereas, The high quality and unique training capabilities \n     of the McGregor Range allow the verification of our military \n     readiness in air-to-ground combat, including the Army's only \n     opportunity to test the Patriot missile in live fire, \n     tactical scenarios, as well\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\n     as execute the ``Roving Sands'' joint training exercises held \n     annually at Fort Bliss; and\n       Whereas, The Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 requires \n     that the withdrawal from public use of all military land \n     governed by the Army, including McGregor Range, must be \n     terminated on November 6, 2001, unless such withdrawal is \n     renewed by an Act of Congress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby support the U.S. Congress in ensuring that the \n     critical infrastructure for the U.S. military defense \n     strategy be maintained through the renewal of the withdrawal \n     from public use of the McGregor Range land beyond 2001; and, \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-344. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to benefits for military \n     retirees; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, Military retirees who have served honorably for 20 \n     or more years constitute a significant part of the aging \n     population in the United States; and\n       Whereas, These retirees were encouraged to make the United \n     States Armed Forces a career, in part by the promise of \n     lifetime health care for themselves and their families; and\n       Whereas, Prior to the age of 65, these retirees are \n     provided health services by the United States Department of \n     Defense's TRICARE Prime program, but those retirees who reach \n     the age of 65 lose a significant portion of the promised \n     health care due to Medicare eligibility; and\n       Whereas, Many of these retirees are also unable to access \n     military treatment facilities for health care and life \n     maintenance medications because they live in areas where \n     there are no military treatment facilities or where these \n     facilities have downsized so significantly that available \n     space for care has become nonexistent; and\n       Whereas, The loss of access to health care services \n     provided by the military has resulted in the government \n     breaking its promise of lifetime health care; and\n       Whereas, Without continued affordable health care, \n     including pharmaceuticals, these retirees have limited access \n     to quality health care and significantly less care than other \n     retired federal civilians have under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program; and\n       Whereas, It is necessary to enact legislation that would \n     restore health care benefits equitable with those of other \n     retired federal workers; and\n       Whereas, Several proposals to meet this requirement are \n     currently under consideration before the United States \n     Congress and the federal Department of Defense and Department \n     of Health and Human Services; of these proposals, the federal \n     government has already begun to establish demonstration \n     projects around the country to be conducted over the next \n     three years, which would allow Medicare to reimburse the \n     Department of Defense for the costs of providing military \n     retirees and their dependents health care; this project would \n     allow a limited number of Medicare-eligible beneficiaries to \n     enroll in the Department of Defense's TRICARE Prime program \n     and receive all of their health care under that program: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76 Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby memorialize the Congress of the United States to \n     maintain its commitment to America's military retirees by \n     providing lifetime health care for military retirees over the \n     age of 65; to enact comprehensive legislation that affords \n     military retirees the ability to access health care either \n     through military treatment facilities or through the \n     military's network of health care providers, as well as \n     legislation to require opening the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program to those uniformed services beneficiaries \n     who are eligible for Medicare, on the same basis and \n     conditions that apply to retired federal civilian employees; \n     and to enact any other appropriate legislation that would \n     address the above concerns; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas Secretary of State forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the president of the Senate and Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and \n     all members of the Texas delegation to the Congress with the \n     request that this resolution be entered in the Congressional \n     Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-345. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to the Medicaid \n     disproportionate share hospital program; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 75\n\n       Whereas, The Lower Rio Grande Valley is an area of Texas \n     vital to the economic success and well-being of the state; \n     and\n       Whereas, The area faces a variety of challenges, one of \n     which is a significant demand for indigent health care; this \n     need is complicated by transportation issues and other \n     difficulties affecting patient access to health care \n     services; and\n       Whereas, The State of Texas operates the South Texas \n     Hospital in the city of Harlingen, and this institution \n     provides critically needed health care services to indigent \n     patients in the Lower Rio Grande Valley; and\n       Whereas, State funds used to provide indigent health care \n     services at the South Texas Hospital have been used to obtain \n     matching federal funds through the Medicaid disproportionate \n     share hospital program and their use has increased the \n     resources available to provide health care services to \n     indigent patients throughout Texas; and\n       Whereas, The South Texas Hospital's physical facilities are \n     in need of major renovation, and there are other hospitals in \n     the Lower Rio Grande Valley that can provide inpatient \n     services needed by the indigent population of the region; and\n       Whereas, The mission of the South Texas Hospital and the \n     public good will best be served by contracting with public \n     and private hospitals in the Lower Rio Grande Valley so that \n     they may provide inpatient services to the indigent \n     population; and\n       Whereas, If the state intends to continue its commitment to \n     provide needed health services to the people of the Lower Rio \n     Grande Valley, then the Texas Legislature must encourage the \n     federal government to continue matching state funds used to \n     provide eligible inpatient services and to participate in \n     innovative approaches that maximize local, state, and federal \n     resources to address the pressing need for indigent health \n     services in Texas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     qualify the contributions made by the State of Texas for \n     eligible inpatient hospital services provided by contract in \n     the Lower Rio Grande Valley for federal matching funds under \n     the Medicaid disproportionate share hospital program; and, be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-346. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas relative to customs facilities at \n     Texas-Mexico border crossing areas; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, Bottlenecks at customs inspection lanes have \n     contributed to traffic congestion at Texas-Mexico border \n     crossing areas, slowing the flow of commerce and detracting \n     from the economic potential of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA); and\n       Whereas, Smuggling of drugs inside truck parts and cargo \n     containers compounds the problem, necessitating lengthy \n     vehicle searches that put federal customs officials in a \n     crossfire between their mandate to speed the movement of \n     goods and their mandate to reduce the flow of illegal \n     substances; and\n       Whereas, At the state level, the Texas comptroller of \n     public accounts has released a report titled ``Bordering the \n     Future,'' recommending among other items that U.S. customs \n     inspection facilities at major international border crossings \n     stay open around the clock; and\n       Whereas, At the federal level, the U.S. General Accounting \n     Office is conducting a similar study of border commerce and \n     NAFTA issues, and the U.S. Customs Service is working with a \n     private trade entity to review and analyze the relationship \n     between its inspector numbers and its inspection workload; \n     and\n       Whereas, Efficiency in the flow of NAFTA commerce requires \n     two federal customs-related funding commitments: (1) improved \n     infrastructure, including additional customs inspection \n     lanes; and (2) a concurrent expansion in customs personnel \n     and customs operating hours; and\n       Whereas, Section 1119 of the federal Transportation Act for \n     the 21st Century (TEA-21), creating the Coordinated Border \n     Infrastructure Program, serves as a funding source for border \n     area infrastructure improvements and regulatory enhancements; \n     and\n       Whereas, Domestic profits and income increase in tandem \n     with exports and imports, generating federal revenue, some \n     portion of which deserves channeling into the customs \n     activity that supports increased international trade; and\n       Whereas, Texas legislators and businesses, being close to \n     the situation geographically, are acutely aware of the fixes \n     and upgrades that require attention if NAFTA prosperity is \n     truly to live up to the expectations of this state and \n     nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     provide funding for infrastructure improvements, more customs \n     inspection lanes and customs officials, and 24-hour customs \n     operations at border crossings between Texas and Mexico; and, \n     be it further\n\n[[Page S10694]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-347. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to persons with \n     disabilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, In California and elsewhere, throughout a \n     prolonged period of economic well-being and record low \n     unemployment rates, recent national and California studies \n     both have unaccepted findings that only one-third of adults \n     with disabilities nationally and in California hold part-time \n     or full-time jobs; and\n       Whereas, In these same studies, 75 percent of those not \n     working stated they wanted to work; and\n       Whereas, The lack of access to private health insurance or \n     the lack of continuing access to Medi-Cal or Medicare is the \n     main obstacle individuals with significant disabilities face \n     when working or returning to work; and\n       Whereas, The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) \n     and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) work incentive rules \n     have the potential to be effective but are underutilized, \n     overly complex, and inconsistently administered. Social \n     Security work incentives are used by only a small fraction of \n     those eligible and often result in benefit by only a small \n     fraction of those eligible and often result in benefit \n     overpayments that must be repaid by the payee; and\n       Whereas, People with disabilities who are SSDI \n     beneficiaries and SSI recipients have limited choice in \n     employment services; and\n       Whereas, On January 28, 1999, Senator James M. Jeffords, \n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Senator William V. Roth, Jr., and \n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, introduced Senate Bill 331, \n     cited as the ``Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999,'' to \n     expand the availability of health care coverage for working \n     individuals with disabilities, establish a Ticket to Work and \n     Self-Sufficiency Program in the Social Security \n     Administration to provide these individuals with meaningful \n     opportunities to work, and for other purposes; and\n       Whereas, On March 18, 1999, Representative Rick A. Lazio, \n     Representative Michael Bilirakis, Representative Nancy L. \n     Johnson, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Representative Tom \n     Bliley, Jr., Representative Bob Matsui, Representative \n     Fortney (Pete) Stark, Representative Brian Bilbray, \n     Representative Steve Horn, of California and other states, \n     introduced House Resolution 1180, cited as the ``Work \n     Incentives Improvement Act of 1999,'' a measure similar to \n     that introduced in the Senate; and\n       Whereas, The federal act, as introduced, would provide \n     states with the option and incentive grants to set up \n     programs to extend medicaid coverage to certain classes of \n     SSDI and SSI beneficiaries who work, provide more choice of \n     employment services, and establish a $2 for $1 earned income \n     offset demonstration project for SSDI beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, The federal act, as introduced, contains strong \n     work incentive and planning provisions for individuals with \n     disabilities who work or want to work, and provisions for \n     community work incentive planners to help individuals \n     understand and use federal and state work incentive programs, \n     Social Security specialists in work incentives at field \n     offices to disseminate accurate information, protection and \n     advocacy assistance when an individual's situation is \n     negatively impacted as a result of work, and an advisory \n     panel to counsel the Commissioner of Social Security and \n     other federal agencies on employment and work incentive \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, The interconnected provisions of the federal act \n     work in concert to remove work barriers for people with \n     disabilities; and\n       Whereas, California with disabilities want to live and work \n     side by side with others in their communities and this goal \n     can begin to happen with passage of this historic national \n     legislation; and\n       Whereas, It is the California Legislature's strongest \n     belief that people have the responsibility and right to \n     meaningful employment opportunities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature affirms its \n     endorsement of the federal ``Work Incentives Improvement Act \n     of 1999,'' and urges the United States Congress to pass this \n     act at once in order to meet the urgent demands of people \n     with disabilities who work or want to work across the nation; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Senate Majority Leader, the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives, the Chirpersons of the \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations, Budget, and Finance, and \n     to the Chairpersons of the House Committees on \n     Appropriations, Budget, Commerce, and Ways and Means, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/09/senate-section/article/S10694-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       H.R. 974.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \npermanent eligibility of former members of the Selected Reserve for \nveterans housing loans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n PERMANENT ELIGIBILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE FOR VETERANS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to legislation Senator Akaka and I are \nintroducing today. Entitled ``Permanent Eligibility of Members of the \nSelected Reserve for Veterans Home Loans,'' this important legislation \ndoes not change existing law, but rather makes permanent a critical \nbenefit for the National Guard and Reserve personnel.\n  Under current law, selected Reservists and National Guard personnel \nwho complete six years of service are eligible for guaranteed home \nloans. This is a significant benefit that has been enjoyed by active \nduty personnel for many years and has proven to be very effective. In \n1992, there was broad bipartisan support in both the House and the \nSenate for extending this benefit to the hard working men and women of \nthe Reserves on a trial basis until 1999. Last year the program was \nextended to the year 2003. However, as we near that date, no potential \nrecruit may participate in the program because it expires before they \nare able to complete six years of service. Therefore, we introduce this \nbill in an effort to make this benefit permanent.\n  Our Reserves and National Guard are being called upon more and more \ntoday. They are a crucial asset to our Nation's military, but the \nReserves are not exempt from problems such as low recruiting that \ncurrently face our military. This legislation will give the Reserve \nComponent an added recruitment incentive to offer potential service \nmembers.\n  Mr. President, more and more of our service members are taking the \ngiant step of buying a home. Since the start of the VA Home Loan \nProgram in 1992 through 1996, 33,224 loans have been guaranteed by the \nVA. Only 93 of those\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\nhave been foreclosed upon; an incredibly low rate of .37 percent; The \nforeclosure rate for loans made to other veterans was .97 percent (two \nand a half times more). In 1996 alone, over $1.1 billion was given out \nin home loans under this program. This legislation is good not only for \nour veterans and Reserves, but it is good for our economy as well. I \nhope there will be support from both sides on this issue.\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nJeffords in introducing a bill that would permanently authorize the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Home Loan Guaranty Program for members \nof the Selected Reserve.\n  As the proud author of the original legislation enacted in 1992 to \nextend eligibility for the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program to National \nGuard and Reserve members, I am pleased with the results of the \nprogram. Tens of thousands of dedicated reservists who served for at \nleast six years, and continue to serve or have received an honorable \ndischarge, have been able to fulfill the dream of home ownership \nthrough this program. The participation of Guard and Reserve members \nnot only benefits these service members, but also stabilizes the \nfinancial viability of the program since this group has had a lower \ndefault rate than most other program participants.\n  In anticipation of the October 1999 expiration of the eligibility of \nreservists for VA-guaranteed home loans, I introduced legislation last \nyear to permanently authorize the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program for \nmembers of the Selected Reserve. With bipartisan support in the House \nand Senate, a revised version of my legislation was enacted into law. \nWhile I am pleased that the eligibility of reservists for veterans \nhousing loans was extended September 2003, I believe that permanent \nauthority should be provided to members of the Selected Reserve.\n  Since the end of the cold war, we have reassessed the role, size, and \nstructure of our Armed Forces. Recognizing the changes in our national \nmilitary strategy prompted by a new global environment and appreciating \nthe need to address our nation's budget deficit, we have significantly \ndownsized our active duty military forces. As a result, the National \nGuard and Reserve have played a more prominent role in the Total Force. \nReservists are being increasingly called upon to protect and promote \nour national security interests in regions throughout the world. Most \nrecently, reservists have been serving alongside active duty forces in \nthe Balkans to support NATO air operations over Kosovo. By making \npermanent the eligibility of members of the Selected Reserve for the VA \nHome Loan Guaranty Program, we would specifically recognize their vital \nservice to our country and ensure that veterans housing loans will \ncontinue to be available to them beyond the near future.\n  The VA guaranty program is also an important component of a benefits \npackage which makes Guard and Reserve service more attractive to \nqualified individuals. This is of particular importance during a time \nwhen the civilian sector is competing for the same pool of limited \napplicants, as well as when our military needs are becoming \nincreasingly technical, demanding only the most intelligent, motivated, \nand competent individuals. Currently, the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program \ncannot be used as a recruitment tool since the authority expires in \nfour years and reservists are required to serve for at least six years \nbefore they qualify for VA-guaranteed loans. A permanent authorization \nwill assist the National Guard and Reserve with their recruitment \nefforts by allowing veterans housing loans to be offered as an \nincentive.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure which would recognize the vital contributions of National Guard \nand Reserve members to our country, as well as ensure that veterans \nhousing loans will continue to be available in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Chaffee, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 1573. A bill to provide a reliable source of funding for State, \nlocal, and Federal efforts to conserve land and water, preserve \nhistoric resources, improve environmental resources, protect fish and \nwildlife, and preserve open and green spaces; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   natural resources reinvestment act\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer introductory \nremarks on the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act, a bill that I am \nintroducing today with my colleagues Mr. Chafee, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \nJeffords. Before we adjourned for the summer recess, Congress spent \nmany weeks preoccupied with weighty fiscal matters like how to divvy up \na hypothetical budget surplus, whether to grant tax cuts with money \nthat may or may not exist, or whether to do the responsible thing and \npay off the national debt with any surplus that might actually \nmaterialize. Make no mistake, these are important issues, but they are \nnot the only issues that should cause us concern. Recent visits with \ncitizens in Connecticut reinforced my conviction that one of the most \ncritical, but commonly overlooked, issues facing our nation today is \nthe conservation debt that we have amassed in recent years.\n  This conservation debt is difficult to define because it cannot be \nmeasured in dollars and cents. It is not dependent on interest rates or \nstock market gyrations. It is not a debt that can be paid off by \nsigning a check when eventually we realize that we have short-changed \nour children's environmental inheritance.\n  This conservation debt grows as urban sprawl spreads across prime \nfarmland and degrades wetlands. It is a debt that multiples every time \na community misses a chance to acquire the watershed lands that help to \npurify their drinking water. It is a debt that grows irreversibly every \ntime another endangered species is driven down the one-way road to \nextinction. It is a debt that increases each time an untended urban \npark is ceded to drug-peddlers through neglect and inattention. It is a \ndebt that builds every time a structure representing our cultural \nheritage is demolished rather than renovated. It is a debt that we can \nno longer afford to ignore.\n  Unfortunately, too little has been said or done recently in \nWashington to define the steps we--as a nation--should take to pay off \nthe conservation debt and ensure that our children and grandchildren \ninherit a planet that is healthy, productive, and blessed with \nabundant, clean, green open space.\n  Because I am committed to preserving a rich environmental legacy for \nour children, today I join with Mr. Chafee, from Rhode Island, the \nesteemed Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee on \nwhich I serve, and Mr. Leahy and Mr. Jeffords from Vermont to introduce \nthe Natural Resources Reinvestment Act of 1999.\n  The principle behind our bill is simple: as we deplete federally-\nowned, non-renewable natural resources such as oil and gas, we should \nreinvest the proceeds to establish a reliable source of funding for \nState, local, and federal efforts to conserve land and water, provide \nrecreational opportunities, preserve historic resources, protect fish \nand wildlife, and preserve open space. The Natural Resources \nReinvestment Act honors this principle by re-establishing America's \nlong-standing commitment to protecting land, fish and wildlife, and our \ncultural heritage and by re-doubling Federal commitments that help \nstates and localities protect the open space and recreational \nopportunities that Americans cherish so deeply.\n  Notwithstanding our current conservation debt, America has made many \nwise conservation investments over the years. Therefore, the Natural \nResources Reinvestment Act is not spun entirely from whole cloth, but \nalso improves upon those things we have done well. For example, the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, which has served as the primary \nFederal source of funds for the acquisition of recreational lands since \n1965, has been a tremendous success by any measure. It has helped \nprotect more than seven million acres of open space and contributed to \nthe development of 37,000 parks and recreation areas across the \ncountry. Everglades and Saguaro National Parks, the Appalachian Trail, \nthe Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site, and Niagara Falls \nare few examples of treasured places across the country that have been \ncreated or protected with help from the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n\n[[Page S10696]]\n\n  Because the Outer Continental Shelf petroleum royalty system is \nalready in collecting billions of dollars every year, rather than \nintroducing new taxes, this bill would simply ensure that taxes \nhistorically raised for conservation purposes actually result in \nconservation activity. Despite the notable successes and broad \nbipartisan support and authorization for $900 million dollars, Congress \nhas failed to appropriate sufficient money for Land and Water \nConservation Fund. More than $11 billion dollars of authorized \nconservation funding has been funneled back into the general treasury \nsince the Fund was established. Again, this bill requires no new \ntaxes----it simply ensures that existing revenues are spent on the \nconservation priorities that communities across the country have \nidentified.\n  The stateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund--the \nmoney that is supposed to help states and local communities direct \ntheir own conservation and recreation goals--has gone completely \nunfunded since 1995. This is particularly troubling for me because \nConnecticut has the smallest percentage of federally-owned land of any \nstate in the union.\n  The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act ensures that the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund will receive full authorized funding every \nyear. The bill also builds on the success of the Fund, by authorizing a \nnew program for State Lands of National or Regional Interest to help \nprotect areas of unique ecological, recreational, aesthetic, or \nregional value that would not be eligible for traditional Land and \nWater Conservation Fund support. We also provide full funding for other \nsuccessful programs with an existing claim on Outer Continental Shelf \nrevenues, including the Historic Preservation Fund, and the Urban Park \nand Recreation Recovery program. Every year our bill will reinvest $250 \nmillion dollars of Outer Continental Shelf petroleum revenues in State \nfish and wildlife conservation efforts, with special emphasis on \nprojects that protect nongame and threatened or endangered species.\n  The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act also creates a $900 million \nEnvironmental Stewardship Fund to be distributed to States for the \npurposes of conserving, protecting, and restoring their natural \nresources beyond what is required by current law. The Environmental \nStewardship Fund is designed so that States have the flexibility to \ndevise innovative solutions to their individual conservation \nchallenges. This commitment to helping, but not dictating how, \ncommunities achieve their conservation goals is exceptionally \nimportant.\n  Over the last year, the State of Connecticut has acquired 3,725 acres \nof open space worth more that $15 million dollars in 24 different \nmunicipalities. These open space purchases represent important steps \ntoward the state goal of setting aside 21% of Connecticut land as open \nspace. However, that goal is still more than 345,000 acres away from \nbeing reality. Each state has unique conservation and recreation \npriorities and the NRRA ensures that they will have flexible federal \nassistance they need to put their plans into practice. Because the NRRA \nwould support diverse ideas and approaches to conserving and protecting \nthe nation's natural and cultural resources, each state will also \nbenefit from the innovation and lessons learned by other states from \ncoast to coast.\n\n  Finally, the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act clarifies and \nimproves existing laws to leverage opportunities to protect farmland \nand watersheds, and mitigate the extent to which transportation \nprojects encroach on open and green space. While these improvements are \nmade in federal laws, they affect local decisions. For example, the \nNRRA amends the 1996 Farm Bill so that state and local conservation \norganizations can help acquire easements designed to maintain \nproductive farmland as productive farms. This provision of the NRRA \ngives communities a powerful tool to help make sure that family farms \nare not squeezed out of American communities as cities and towns grow \nand prosper in the 21st century.\n  By amending the Federal Water Pollution Control Act so that up to 10% \nof the State Revolving Loan Fund can be used for matching grants to \npurchase land that protects watersheds, the NRRA recognizes that \nflexibility is critical for cost-effective delivery of clean and \nhealthy drinking water to American homes and businesses. This provision \nof the NRRA recognizes that protecting watersheds--the Earth's natural \nwater filtration and purification systems--by preserving open space can \nbe an important and relatively inexpensive component of municipal water \nsupply strategies.\n  America's world-class network of roads and highways represents the \nfoundation of our national commerce. It also embodies many families' \ntickets to staying in touch with friends and relatives across the \ncountry and their passports for exploring the beauty and history of our \nnation. The NRRA amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \ncentury so that highway development funds can be used to purchase open \nspace and green corridors that will help mitigate the effects of \ntransportation-related growth and development.\n  The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act represents a strong, renewed \nfederal commitment to protecting our natural and historical resources \nnationwide at local, state, and regional levels. It demonstrates our \ndedication to ensuring that revenues from oil and gas leasing on \nfederal lands are reinvested in our heritage for current and future \ngenerations alike.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress enacted the land and water conservation fund \n     in 1964 and the Historic Preservation Fund in 1976, and \n     provided that revenues from activities in the outer \n     Continental Shelf would fund each program;\n       (2) however, since 1964, of $21,000,000,000 authorized for \n     the land and water conservation fund, only $9,000,000,000 has \n     been appropriated, and since 1977, of $2,776,000,000 \n     authorized for the Historic Preservation Fund, only \n     $845,000,000 has been appropriated;\n       (3) prior to dedicating outer Continental Shelf revenues \n     for new programs to benefit the Nation, Congress should \n     dedicate outer Continental Shelf revenues to the original \n     purposes for which those funds were intended;\n       (4) since the establishment of the land and water \n     conservation fund, the fund has been responsible for the \n     preservation of nearly 7,000,000 acres of park land, refuges, \n     and open spaces, and the development of more than 37,000 \n     State and local parks and recreation projects;\n       (5) since the establishment of the Historic Preservation \n     Fund, the fund has been responsible for identifying more than \n     1,000,000 historic sites throughout the United States and \n     certifying 1,145 local governments as partners in preserving \n     historic sites;\n       (6) as the loss of open space and the phenomenon of sprawl \n     in rural, suburban, and urban areas of the Nation continues \n     to increase, it is increasingly important to conserve \n     natural, historic, and cultural resources of the Nation;\n       (7) the land and water conservation fund and the Historic \n     Preservation Fund serve valuable purposes to address the \n     needs of the Nation today as they did when they were enacted, \n     and they are vital programs to assist State and local \n     governments in their efforts to address those needs;\n       (8) the land and water conservation fund should be \n     augmented to provide a new program to encourage State, local, \n     and private partnerships for conservation of non-Federal land \n     of national and regional significance that will fulfill \n     national conservation priorities while allowing the land to \n     remain under State and local control; and\n       (9) the purposes of the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery \n     Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.) and payments in lieu of \n     taxes are consonant with those of the land and water \n     conservation fund and the Historic Preservation Fund, and \n     complement those programs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to provide a secure source of funding for Federal land \n     acquisition to meet State, local, and urban conservation and \n     recreation needs through the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq.) and the Urban Park and \n     Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.); and\n       (2) to recognize and to preserve the historic places of the \n     United States through the National Historic Preservation Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.).\n              Subtitle A--Land and Water Conservation Fund\n\n     SEC. 111.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the outer Continental Shelf contains oil, gas, and \n     other nonrenewable resources owned by the public that are \n     developed by the Federal Government and generate significant \n     revenues for the United States;\n       (2) historically, the development of those mineral \n     resources has been accompanied by adverse environmental \n     impacts on the States adjacent to the outer Continental Shelf \n     in which development has occurred;\n       (3) consistent with the commitment to devote revenues from \n     offshore oil and gas leases to resource protection through \n     the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. \n     460l-4 et seq.), a portion of revenues derived from the \n     development of mineral resources of the outer Continental \n     Shelf should be reinvested in the United States through \n     conservation of environmental and other public resources, \n     including open and green spaces, habitat for fish and \n     wildlife, wetland, historic sites, parks and other outdoor \n     recreation areas, clean air, and clean water;\n       (4) the need to reinvest in the public resources described \n     in paragraph (3) has increased significantly, because the \n     United States has experienced unprecedented prosperity, \n     growth, and development that have intensified stress on the \n     natural environment;\n       (5) in recent years, numerous State and local governments, \n     as well as citizens throughout the United States, have \n     initiated efforts to conserve, protect, and restore those \n     resources; and\n       (6) the priority for carrying out measures to protect and \n     conserve the public resources described in paragraph (3) \n     should be determined--\n       (A) at the State and local levels, by individuals who have \n     the greatest interest in enhancing the quality of life in \n     their communities; and\n       (B) in cooperation with the Federal Government, which has \n     an interest in protecting the resources of the United States.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish a \n     program to provide a reliable source of Federal funding for \n     States to carry out activities to conserve, protect, and \n     restore the natural resources of the United States, including \n     water and air quality, fish and wildlife habitat, marine, \n     estuarine, and coastal ecosystems, wetland, farmland, forest \n     land, and parks and other places of outdoor recreation.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, as well as Senators Leahy and Jeffords, \nin introducing a bill to strengthen the environmental infrastructure of \nour nation, and to lay the foundation for conservation efforts for the \nnew century.\n  This bill--the Natural Resource Reinvestment Act of 1999 (NRRA)--will \nalso help shape the debate now taking place in Congress on spending \nrevenues from the oil and gas activities in the Outer Continental \nShelf. Rarely are we confronted with choices that will profoundly \ninfluence the natural legacy of this nation. The current debate over \nOCS revenues presents us with such a choice.\n  Let me first applaud the tremendous work already undertaken by my \ncolleagues who have introduced legislation on this subject, \nparticularly Senators Landrieu, Feinstein, Boxer and Graham, as well as \nSenators Murkowski and Bingaman, who oversee these bills in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. At the same time, there is room for \nadditional voices on this subject.\n  I would like to identify four basic principles that are embodied in \nour legislation, and that I believe should govern Congress' \ndeliberations on spending OCS revenues. These principles hearken back \nto those espoused by Congress when it created the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund, the only two \nprograms that by law are funded from OCS receipts.\n  First, OCS revenues should be reinvested in the nation's public \nresources--our environmental, natural, cultural and historic resources. \nSecond, reinvestment in public resources should be meaningful and \nlasting--the capital assets of our nation. Third, revenues must be \ndistributed in an equitable manner across the nation. Fourth, the \nfunding must be permanent.\n  The NRRA allocates $2.5 billion in OCS receipts to three major areas: \n$1.35 billion to land and water and historic preservation (title I); \n$900 million to states for matching conservation grants (title II); and \n$250 million for state fish and wildlife conservation (title III). In \nthe event that total OCS receipts falls short of $2.5 billion, each \nprogram will receive a pro-rated, percent share of the funds.\n  The funds generally must be spent for conservation and environmental \nimprovement activities, in keeping with the vision that revenues from \ndevelopment of non-renewable resources should be returned to the \nconservation of other natural resources. The funds are distributed to \nall 50 states in an equitable manner, derived from receipts from past, \npresent and future OCS activities, but based on a formula and derived \nfrom qualified revenues that do not encourage additional OCS activity.\n  The NRRA recognizes that the existing programs created by Congress, \nto be funded with revenues from OCS activities, should receive their \nfull share before new programs funded by those revenues are created. \nTitle I of the NRRA fulfills the promise that Congress made 35 years \nago when it created the LWCF. The LWCF is authorized to receive $900 \nmillion annually from OCS revenues, but receives only a fraction of \nthis amount in appropriations. One of the greatest conservation laws \never enacted, it provides money for Federal land and water \nacquisitions, and matches state dollars for local parks, beaches, \ngardens and other open spaces.\n  The NRRA would fully fund the LWCF automatically, without further \nCongressional action. I attempted such an effort in 1988 with the \nAmerican Heritage Trust Act, and nothing would please me more than to \nsee this effort fulfilled before I leave the Senate.\n  Created in 1976, the Historic Preservation Fund is also funded with \nOCS revenues, but of $150 million authorized annually, it receives \nroughly $45 million--30 percent. The Fund is responsible for \nregistering more than one million historic sites across the nation, and \nwith additional funding, restoration work can be carried out. The bill \nwould fully fund it at $150 million.\n  In addition, the bill provides full funding, $100 million, for the \nUrban Parks and Recreation Renewal Program, which supports parks and \nopen spaces in large urban areas. Funds are also authorized for the \nPayment in Lieu of Taxes Program and the Refuge Revenue Sharing \nProgram, which provide annual payments to local governments to \ncompensate for the removal of newly acquired public lands from the \nproperty tax base.\n  The NRRA seeks to improve and expand the LWCF in order to revitalize \nit, modernize it and bring it into the new century. Since the creation \nof the LWCF, the conservation needs of the country have evolved in ways \nthat require greater flexibility and creativity than the traditional \nmethods authorized in the original law.\n  The NRRA establishes a new program to increase the LWCF by $200 \nmillion to support state efforts to conserve land and water of regional \nor national significance. The program would provide Federal funding for \nstate and private partnerships, in order to meet nationally important \nland protection priorities in a way that ensures state or local control \nof lands and waters. This program would help conserve some of the \nnation's most treasured areas, such as the Great Lakes, the Everglades, \nthe Mississippi Delta, the Northern Forest of New England, the \nmidwestern prairie lands, and the southwestern desert.\n  Let me cite one example of why we need this new program. With over \nfive million acres of woodland on the auction block in Maine this past \nyear, The Nature Conservancy negotiated an extraordinary deal that \nwould protect 185,000 acres around the Upper St. John River, which is \nthe largest, least developed river system east of the Mississippi \nRiver. The Nature Conservancy has already raised over $10 million in \nprivate funds for this project, and hopes to receive some of a $50 \nmillion bond which will be on the Maine ballot in the fall. The Federal \ngovernment should be a partner as well. However, many folks in Maine do \nnot want additional Federal acquisitions, so the traditional Federal \nLWCF program is not a possibility. Yet Maine's annual state-side LWCF \nallocation would be too small to handle such an expensive project. A \nnew program could leverage the private and State dollars without \nrequiring Federal ownership.\n  Recognizing that priorities for protecting and conserving resources \nshould be determined at the state and local levels, in cooperation with \nthe Federal government and the use of Federal dollars, the bill creates \na new grants program for state activities to promote conservation and \nimprovement of environmental quality.\n  Specifically, $900 million is apportioned among all 50 states, based \non a formula using the following criteria: population, length of \ncoastline, geographic area, and population density. This formula is \nbased on the premise that all states share in the benefits of \ndevelopment of OCS resources. It also recognizes the many factors that \nput pressure on the nation's resources. Because the formula is not tied \nto OCS oil and gas production, it does not create incentives for \nfurther activity. Lastly, with a ceiling of 5 percent, and a floor of \n0.5 percent, the formula ensures that no state receives a \ndisproportionate amount.\n  The funds can be used for clean air, clean water, cleanup of \nbrownfields, conservation of fish and wildlife habitat, and \npreservation of open space and farmland. Projects must exceed standards \nrequired under existing law, be approved by the Governor after public \nnotice and comment, and must be included in the state plan approved by \na Stewardship Council comprised of Federal agency and Congressional \nrepresentatives.\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\n  Federal funding for projects must also be matched with at least 30 \npercent by non-Federal dollars. This matching requirement is extremely \nimportant in that it provides leverage for Federal dollars, and that it \nencourages states to use the money wisely.\n  There are special provisions for states that have historically borne \nthe activities in the OCS. Specifically, $300 million over five years, \nand $10 million annually thereafter, is provided for these states in \naddition to the amounts they receive under the formula. The funds may \nbe used for OCS mitigation activities, as well as the activities \nenumerated above.\n  The NRRA establishes a separate title for the conservation of fish \nand wildlife, to receive $250 million in OCS revenues, of which $75 \nmillion is to be spent on conservation of endangered or threatened \nspecies.\n  Although the States are the principle stewards of our nation's fish \nand wildlife, their efforts to perform this role are chronically under-\nfunded. It is high time that the Federal government assist them. And it \nis high time that we protect our nation's fish and wildlife before they \nbecome threatened or endangered, rather than wait until the costs and \ncontroversies are so great. At the same time, we must get a steady flow \nof funds for endangered and threatened species to help their recovery.\n  The key to species conservation is, of course, protection of the \nhabitat. Habitat protection, in turn, requires comprehensive planning \nand collaboration to determine which habitat is important. Many State \nfish and wildlife agencies already engage in comprehensive planning, \nand work closely with neighboring States and the Federal government. \nThe tremendous work conducted in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley \nthrough the Partners in Flight program exemplifies what States can do \nwhen they have adequate funding. Indeed, the States have recently \ncompleted comprehensive plans for all migratory birds, and plans are \nunderway for amphibians and reptiles.\n  The NRRA amends the 1980 Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to \nencourage implementation and coordination of comprehensive fish and \nwildlife conservation programs. The bill also places an emphasis on \nspecies that are not hunted, fished or trapped. This emphasis seeks to \nrectify the current imbalance in which non-game programs among all 50 \nstates receive less than $100 million annually, while game-focused \nprograms receive more than $1 billion annually. Less than 10 percent of \nstate fish and wildlife funding is targeted at the conservation of 86 \npercent of fish and wildlife species.\n  Three new programs are created in the bill. To promote watershed \nprotection, the NRRA amends Title III of the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act to allow up to 10 percent of the State Revolving Loan Fund \nto be spent as 50 percent matching grants for open space acquisition to \nprotect watersheds and water quality. To address transportation-related \ndevelopment, the NRRA amends current law to allow surface \ntransportation and highway funding to be used for the purchase of open \nspace and green corridors that mitigate transportation-related growth \nand development. Lastly, to promote the protection of farmland, the \nNRRA amends the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 \nto allow State and local conservation organizations to participate in \nthe purchase of conservation easements for farmland protection.\n  Almost 90 years ago, Teddy Roosevelt said that ``of all the questions \nwhich can come before this nation, short of actual preservation of its \nexistence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance \nwith the central task of leaving this land a better land for our \ndescendants than it is for us.'' When a rugged coastline is marred by \ncondos, or farmland is replaced by a strip mall, or a breathtaking \nvista is pocked with smokestacks, we lose something very valuable, most \nlikely for good. Our bill ensures that the tools are available to leave \nthis land in better condition for our descendants, and remains true to \nthe vision of Teddy Roosevelt.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this worthwhile \nlegislation.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today as an original \ncosponsor of the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act of 1999 (NRRA) and \nthank Senator Lieberman for his leadership on this issue. The purpose \nof this bill is to reinvest revenues from oil and gas production on \nouter continental shelf lands to establish a reliable source of funding \nfor State, local and Federal efforts to conserve land and water, \nprovide recreational opportunities, preserve historic resources, \nprotect fish and wildlife, and preserve open and green spaces.\n  This Congress, the subject of permanent funding for the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund (LWCF) has received significant attention. The \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, a special account created in 1964, is \nthe primary vehicle for funding land conservation efforts in the United \nStates and is used for acquisitions and maintenance for our national \nparks, forests, and wildlife refuges. Four federal agencies--the Park \nService, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and \nForest Service--receive these funds. In addition, the Park Service has \nadministered a matching grants program to assist states (and \nlocalities) in acquiring and developing recreation sites and \nfacilities. The fund accumulates money from diverted revenues from off-\nshore oil leases.\n  Unfortunately, the main fund has not recently been fully funded and \nthe state grant program has not received any funding since 1995. The \npromise of this worthy program has never been fully realized and many \nopportunities to conserve precious lands and to work with our state and \nlocal partners have been lost. People across the country are realizing \nthat they cannot afford to lose more opportunities to protect the lands \nthey consider important to their quality of life.\n  Many of us think of large tracks of land, like the Green Mountain \nNational Forest in my home state of Vermont, when we think about \nfederal conservation programs. When we think about the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, however, we should also envision soccer fields, \nswing-sets, picnic areas, town beaches and wildlife preserves across \nthe country. The LWCF has made it possible to protect some of the most \nvaluable wildlife habitat in the United States, and also for small \ncommunities to afford public recreation facilities that would otherwise \nnot be possible, bringing the benefits of outdoor recreation close to \nwhere we live and work.\n  In addition to the LWCF, the NRRA establishes permanent funding for \nUrban Parks and Recreation Recovery, the Historic Preservation Fund, \nand creates several new open space initiatives. The bill also \nestablishes an Environmental Stewardship Fund for states to conserve, \nprotect, and restore their natural resources beyond what is required by \ncurrent law. The Fund is designed so that states have the flexibility \nto create their own plans that address their particular needs, while \nincluding citizens through a comment process.\n  The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act demonstrates a commitment to \nconserving and protecting our national natural and historical \nresources. I urge my colleagues to support this bill that would secure \nthe funding of our conservation and open space programs for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a program \nin Colorado aimed at stopping youth violence. In the wake of the \nshootings at Columbine in Littleton, students and parents throughout \nnorthern Colorado in Fort Collins, Greeley, Windsor and my home town of \nLoveland organized the week of August 29 through September 4 as ``I \nwill pledge week.'' The program was sponsored by the Fort Collins \nColoradoan, Clear Channel--the parent company of radio stations KPAW, \nKCOL, KIIX, and KGLL, and school districts throughout northern \nColorado.\n  The ``pledge'' is a symbolic gesture meant to heighten everyone's \nawareness of the problem of youth violence. It stresses personal \nresponsibility, tolerance and empowers each student to be part of the \nsolution. I have proudly endorsed ``the pledge'' because I believe it \nwill make a difference. I would like to now share with my colleagues \n``the pledge.''\n\n                               The Pledge\n\n       To end violence . . . ``I will pledge to be a part of the \n     solution.\n       I will eliminate taunting from my behavior.\n       I will encourage others to do the same.\n       I will do my part to make my community a safe place by \n     being more sensitive to others.\n       I will set the example of a caring individual.\n       I will eliminate profanity toward others from my language.\n       I will not let my words or actions hurt others . . .\n       And if others won't become part of the solution, I will.''\n\n  Last week, literally thousands of students across northern Colorado \ntook this pledge. They committed themselves to be part of the solution \nto ending youth violence. It is an example I encourage others to \nfollow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/09/senate-section/article/S10709-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL ON INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 106-8\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
