Short on the retired list of the Army to the highest grade held as \nCommanding General, Hawaiian Department, during World War II, as was \ndone under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 for all other senior \nofficers who served in positions of command during World War II.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Maj. Clint Crosier, an Air Force fellow in my office, be granted \nfloor privileges throughout the proceedings on the fiscal year 2000 \nauthorization and appropriations bills.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith of New Hampshire pertaining to the \nsubmission of S.J. Res. 25 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 388\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 30 minutes of debate, equally divided, with an additional 10 \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, \nrelative to the Roth amendment No. 388.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, which \nwill at long last restore the reputations of two distinguished military \nofficers who were unfairly scapegoated for the surprise attack on Pearl \nHarbor by Japan at the beginning of World War II--Admiral Husband E. \nKimmel of the United States Navy and General Walter C. Short of the \nUnited States Army.\n  This amendment gives us an opportunity to correct a serious wrong in \nthe history of that war. Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the Navy \nand Army commanders at Pearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, \n1941. Despite their loyal and distinguished service, Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short were unfairly singled out for blame for the nation's lack \nof preparation for that attack and the catastrophe that took place.\n  Justice for these men is long overdue. Wartime investigations of the \nattack on Pearl Harbor concluded that our fleet in Hawaii under the \ncommand of Admiral Kimmel and our land forces under the command of \nGeneral Short had been properly positioned, given the information they \nhad received, and that their superior officers had not given them vital \nintelligence that could have made a difference, perhaps all the \ndifference, in America's preparedness for the attack. These conclusions \nof the wartime investigations were kept secret, in order to protect the \nwar effort. Clearly, there is no longer any justification for ignoring \nthese facts.\n  I first became interested in this issue when I received a letter last \nfall from a good friend in Boston who for many years has been one of \nthe pre-eminent lawyers in America, Edward B. Hanify. As a young Navy \nlawyer and Lieutenant J.G. in 1944, Mr. Hanify was assigned as counsel \nto Admiral Kimmel.\n  As Mr. Hanify told me, he is probably one of the few surviving people \nthat heard Kimmel's testimony before the Naval Court of Inquiry. He \naccompanied Admiral Kimmel when he testified before the Army Board of \nInvestigation, and he later heard substantially all the testimony in \nthe lengthy Congressional investigation of Pearl Harbor that followed \nby the Roberts Commission. In the 50 years since then, Mr. Hanify has \ncarefully followed all subsequent developments on the Pearl Harbor \ncatastrophe and the allocation of responsibility for that disaster.\n  I would like to quote a few brief paragraphs from Mr. Hanify's letter \nof last September, because it eloquently summarizes the overwhelming \ncase for long undue justice for Admiral Kimmel. Mr Hanify writes:\n\n       The odious charge of ``dereliction of duty'' made by the \n     Roberts Commission was the cause of almost irreparable damage \n     to the reputation of Admiral Kimmel, despite the fact that \n     the finding was later repudiated and found groundless.\n       I am satisfied that Admiral Kimmel was subject to callous \n     and cruel treatment by his superiors who were attempting to \n     deflect the blame ultimately ascribed to them, particularly \n     on account of their strange behavior on the evening of \n     December 6th and morning of December 7th in failing to warn \n     the Pacific Fleet and the Hawaiian Army Department that a \n     Japanese attack on the United States was scheduled for \n     December 7th, and that intercepted intelligence indicated \n     that Pearl Harbor was a most probable point of attack. \n     Washington had this intelligence and knew that the Navy and \n     Army in Hawaii did not have it, or any means of obtaining it.\n       Subsequent investigation by both services repudiated the \n     ``dereliction of duty'' charge. In the case of Admiral \n     Kimmel, the Naval Court of Inquiry found that his plans and \n     dispositions were adequate and competent in light of the \n     information which he had from Washington--adequate and \n     competent in the light of the information he had from \n     Washington.\n\n  Mr. Hanify concludes:\n\n       The proposed legislation provides some measure of remedial \n     Justice to a conscientious officer who for years unjustly \n     bore the odium and disgrace associated with the Pearl Harbor \n     catastrophe.\n\n  I have also heard from the surviving son of Admiral Kimmel. He and \nothers in his family have fought for over half a century to restore \ntheir father's honor and reputation. As Edward Kimmel wrote:\n\n       Justice for my father and Major General Short is long \n     overdue. It has been a long hard struggle by the Kimmel and \n     Short families to get to this point.\n\n  No public action can ever fully atone for the injustice suffered by \nthese two officers. But the Senate can do its part by acting now to \ncorrect the historical record, and restore the distinguished \nreputations of Admiral Kimmel and General Short.\n  I commend Senator Biden and Senator Roth for their leadership on this \namendment, and I urge the Senate to support it, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that Mr. Hanify's letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am advised that a Resolution known \n     as the Roth/Biden Resolution has been introduced in the \n     Senate and\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\n     that it has presently the support of the following Senators: \n     Roth; Biden; Helms; Thurmond; Inouye; Stevens; Specter; \n     Hollings; Faircloth; Cochran and McCain. The substance of the \n     Resolution is to request the President to advance the late \n     Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel to the grade of Admiral on the \n     retired list of the Navy and to advance the late Major \n     General Walter C. Short to the grade of Lieutenant General on \n     the retired list of the Army.\n       Admiral Kimmel at the time of Pearl Harbor was Commander in \n     Chief of the Pacific Fleet then based in Pearl Harbor and \n     General Short was the Commanding General of the Hawaiian \n     Department of the Army.\n       The reason for my interest in this Resolution is as \n     follows: In early 1944 when I was a Lieutenant j.g. \n     (U.S.N.R.) the Navy Department gave me orders which assigned \n     me as one of counsel to the defense of Admiral Kimmel in the \n     event of his promised court martial. As a consequence, I am \n     probably one of the few living persons who heard the \n     testimony before the Naval Court of Inquiry, accompanied \n     Admiral Kimmel when he testified before the Army Board of \n     Investigation and later heard substantially all the testimony \n     before the members of Congress who carried on the lengthy \n     Congressional investigation of Pearl Harbor. In the \n     intervening fifty years I have followed very carefully all \n     subsequent developments dealing with the Pearl Harbor \n     catastrophe and the allocation of responsibility for that \n     disaster.\n       On the basis of this experience and further studies over a \n     fifty year period I feel strongly:\n       (1) That the odious charge of ``dereliction of duty'' made \n     by the Roberts Commission was the cause of almost irreparable \n     damage to the reputation of Admiral Kimmel despite the fact \n     that the finding was later repudiated and found groundless;\n       (2) I am satisfied that Admiral Kimmel was subject to \n     callous and cruel treatment by his superiors who were \n     attempting to deflect the blame ultimately ascribed to them, \n     particularly on account of their strange behavior on the \n     evening of December 6th and morning of December 7th in \n     failing to warn the Pacific Fleet and the Hawaiian Army \n     Department that a Japanese attack on the United States was \n     scheduled for December 7th at 1:00 p.m. Washington time (dawn \n     at Pearl Harbor) and that intercepted intelligence indicated \n     that Pearl Harbor was a most probable point of attack; \n     (Washington had this intelligence and knew that the Navy and \n     Army in Hawaii did not have it or any means of obtaining it).\n       (3) Subsequent investigations by both services repudiated \n     the ``dereliction of duty'' charge and in the case of Admiral \n     Kimmel the Naval Court of Inquiry found that his plans and \n     dispositions were adequate and competent in light of the \n     information which he had from Washington.\n       The proposed legislation provides some measure of remedial \n     Justice to a conscientious officer who for years unjustly \n     bore the odium and disgrace associated with the Pearl Harbor \n     catastrophe. You may be interested to know that a Senator \n     from Massachusetts, Honorable David I. Walsh then Chairman of \n     the Naval Affairs Committee, was most effective in securing \n     legislation by Congress which ordered the Army and Navy \n     Departments to investigate the Pearl harbor disaster--an \n     investigation conducted with all the ``due process'' \n     safeguards for all interested parties not observed in other \n     investigations or inquiries.\n       I sincerely hope that you will support the Roth/Biden \n     Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Edward B. Hanify.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  On December 7, 1941, when Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan, the \ncommanders on the ground were Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General \nShort. Rear Admiral Kimmel was serving in the grade of admiral as \ncommander in chief of the U.S. Fleet and commander in chief, U.S. \nPacific Fleet. Major General Short was serving in the grade of \nlieutenant general as commander of the U.S. Army Hawaiian Department. \nBased on their performance at Pearl Harbor, both officers were relieved \nof their commands and were returned to their permanent ranks of rear \nadmiral and major general on December 16, 1941.\n  The duty performance of Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short \nhas been the subject of numerous military, governmental, and \ncongressional inquiries since that time. The most recent examination \nwas by Under Secretary of Defense Edwin Dorn in 1995.\n  The Defense Department, after reviewing all of these inquiries, has \nconcluded that posthumous advancement in rank is not appropriate. In \nshort, in this 1995 review, the Department of Defense concluded that \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short, as commanders on the scene, were \nresponsible and accountable for the actions of their commands. \nAccountability as commanders is a core value in our Armed Forces.\n  Rear Admiral Kimmel's and Major General Short's superiors at the time \ndetermined that their service was not satisfactory and relieved them of \ntheir commands and returned them to their permanent grades. We should \nnot, in my judgment, some 57 years later, substitute the judgment of a \npolitical body--the Congress--for what was essentially a military \ndecision by the appropriate chain of command at the time.\n\n  Those who were in the best position to characterize their service \nhave done so. Their superiors concluded that Rear Admiral Kimmel and \nMajor General Short did not demonstrate the judgment required of people \nwho serve at the three- and four-star level. I do not believe that this \npolitical body should now attempt to reverse that decision made by the \nchains of command in our military service. So I join the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee in opposing this amendment.\n  I also note the letter from the Secretary of Defense to the then \nchairman of our committee, Strom Thurmond, saying the following:\n\n       While Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \n     Readiness, Mr. Edwin Dorn, conducted a thorough review of \n     this issue in 1995. He carefully considered the information \n     contained in nine previous formal investigations, visited \n     Pearl Harbor and personally met with the Kimmel and Short \n     families. His conclusion was that responsibility for the \n     Pearl Harbor disaster must be broadly shared, but that the \n     record does not show that advancement of Admiral Kimmel and \n     General Short on the retired list is warranted.\n       I appreciate the fact that the overwhelming consensus of \n     the organizations and personnel mentioned in your letter \n     recommend exoneration of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. \n     Absent significant new information, however, I do not believe \n     it appropriate to order another review of this matter.\n       Ed Dorn and I both agree that responsibility for this \n     tragic event in American history must be broadly shared, yet \n     I remain confident in the findings that Admiral Kimmel and \n     General Short remain accountable in their positions as \n     leaders.\n\n  To highlight very briefly the findings of the Under Secretary of \nDefense in the Dorn report, referred to by the Secretary of Defense, I \nwill quote three or four of the findings.\n  Finding 1:\n\n       Responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not \n     fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short; it should be broadly shared.\n\n  Finding 2:\n\n       To say that responsibility is broadly shared is not to \n     absolve Admiral Kimmel and General Short of accountability.\n       Military command is unique. A commander has plenary \n     responsibility for the welfare of the people under his or her \n     command, and is directly accountable for everything the unit \n     does or fails to do. . . . Command at the three- and four-\n     star level involves daunting responsibilities. Military \n     officers at that level operate with a great deal of \n     independence. They must have extraordinary skill, \n     foresight and judgment, and a willingness to be \n     accountable for things about which they could not possibly \n     have personal knowledge. . . .\n       It was appropriate that Admiral Kimmel and General Short be \n     relieved.\n\n  Then he goes into the information that he had.\n  I yield myself just 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, finally in finding 3, the Dorn report says:\n\n       The official treatment of Admiral Kimmel and General Short \n     was substantively temperate and procedurally proper.\n\n  Then finally:\n\n       There is not a compelling basis for advancing either \n     officer to a higher grade.\n       Their superiors concluded that Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short did not demonstrate the judgment required of people who \n     serve at the three- and four-star level.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In sum, I cannot conclude that Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short were victims of unfair official actions and thus I \n     cannot conclude that the official remedy of advancement on \n     the retired list [is] in order.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that portions of the Dorn \nreport and the Secretary of Defense letter in opposition to the \nadvancement of these two gentlemen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\n            [Memorandum for the Deputy Secretary of Defense]\n\n       Advancement of Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short\n\n       1. Responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not \n     fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short; it should be broadly shared.\n       2. To say that responsibility is broadly shared is not to \n     absolve Admiral Kimmel and General Short of accountability.\n       3. The official treatment of Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short was substantively temperate and procedurally proper.\n       There is not a compelling basis for advancing either \n     officer to a higher grade.\n       His nomination is subject to the advice and consent of the \n     Senate. A nominee's errors and indiscretions must be reported \n     to the Senate as adverse information.\n       In sum, I cannot conclude that Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short were victims of unfair official actions and thus I \n     cannot conclude that the official remedy of advancement to \n     the retired list in order. Admiral Kimmel and General Short \n     did not have all the resources they felt necessary. Had they \n     been provided more intelligence and clearer guidance, they \n     might have understood their situation more clearly and \n     behaved differently. Thus, responsibility for the magnitude \n     of the Pearl Harbor disaster must be shared. But this is not \n     a basis for contradicting the conclusion, drawn consistently \n     over several investigations, that Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short committed errors of judgment. As commanders, they were \n     accountable.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your interest in \n     exonerating the names of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. In \n     the years since the fateful events at Pearl Harbor there have \n     been numerous formal investigations of the events leading up \n     to the attack, including sharp debate over our state of \n     readiness at the time.\n       While Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \n     Readiness, Mr. Edwin Dorn conducted a thorough review of this \n     issue in 1995. He carefully considered the information \n     contained in nine previous formal investigations, visited \n     Pearl Harbor and personally met with the Kimmel and Short \n     families. His conclusion was that responsibility for the \n     Pearl Harbor disaster must be broadly shared, but that the \n     record does not show that advancement of Admiral Kimmel and \n     General Short on the retired list is warranted.\n       I appreciate the fact that the overwhelming consensus of \n     the organizations and personnel mentioned in your letter \n     recommend exoneration of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. \n     Absent significant new information, however, I do not believe \n     it appropriate to order another review of this matter.\n       Ed Dorn and I both agree that responsibility for this \n     tragic event in American history must be broadly shared, yet \n     I remain confident in the findings that Admiral Kimmel and \n     General Short remain accountable in their positions as \n     leaders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I rise to address the Kimmel-Short resolution which I and Senators \nBiden, Thurmond, and Kennedy introduced to redress a grave injustice \nthat haunts us from World War II.\n  That injustice was the scapegoating of Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort for the success of the disastrous Pearl Harbor attack. This \nunjust scapegoating was given unjust permanence when these two officers \nwere not advanced on the retirement list to their highest ranks of \nwartime command, an honor that was given to every other senior \ncommander who served in wartime positions above his regular grade.\n  Our amendment is almost an exact rewrite of Senate Joint Resolution \n19, that benefits from the support of 23 cosponsors. It calls for the \nadvancement on the retirement lists of Kimmel and Short to the grades \nof their highest wartime commands--as was done for every other officer \neligible under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n  Such a statement by the Senate would do much to remove the stigma of \nblame that so unfairly burdens the reputation of these two officers. It \nis a correction consistent with our military tradition of honor.\n  Allow me to review some key facts about this issue.\n  First, it is a fact that Kimmel and Short were the only two World War \nII officers eligible under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 for \nadvancement on the retired list who were not granted such advancement. \nNo other officer or official paid a price for their role in the Pearl \nHarbor disaster. That fact alone unfairly perpetuates the scapegoating \nthey endured for the remainder of their lives.\n  Second, there have been no less than nine official investigations on \nthis matter over the last five decades. They include the 1944 Naval \nCourt of Inquiry which completely exonerated Admiral Kimmel and the \n1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board who found considerable fault in the War \nDepartment--General Short's superiors. These investigations include \nthat conducted by a 1991 Board for the Correction of Military Records \nwhich recommended General Short's advancement on the retired list.\n  I can think of few issues of this nature that have been as \nextensively investigated and studied as the Pearl Harbor matter. Nor \ncan I think of a series of studies conducted over five decades where \nconclusions have been so remarkably consistent.\n  They include, first, the Hawaiian commanders were not provided vital \nintelligence they needed and that was available in Washington prior to \nthe attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and \nconsistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short.\n  Third, these investigations found that the handling of intelligence \nand command responsibilities in Washington were characterized by \nineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of \nclarification followup.\n  Fourth, these investigations found that these failures and \nshortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington contributed \nsignificantly, if not predominantly, to the success of the surprise \nattack on Pearl Harbor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 4 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I understand under the previous order I \nhave 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have the highest regard for Senator Roth, \nour distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. One can tell by \nlooking at all the books on his desk that he has done considerable \nresearch in this area. I have not done similar research in this area. \nBut this is an issue that I have followed for my period of service in \nCongress, and I have followed it in part because of an interest in it, \nand in part because of my interest in the efforts of Dr. Samuel Mudd to \nexonerate his name from the role that he is alleged to have played and \nin fact was convicted of playing in the post-assassination activities \nrelated to President Lincoln.\n  But I have come to the floor today to oppose this amendment because I \nstrongly object to Congress getting into the business of rewriting \nhistory.\n  This is an old issue. There has been a lot of talk over the years \nabout Admiral Kimmel and about General Short, and about the facts in \nthe wake of the greatest military disaster in American history at Pearl \nHarbor. And there is no question about the fact that we were asleep on \nDecember 7th of 1941. There is no question about the fact that Kimmel \nand Short had a great shortcoming in that they did not talk to each \nother and put together the information they had. But there is probably \nno question about the fact that in the wake of that disaster, there was \nan effort to put the blame on someone. It is also true that subsequent \nstudies have concluded there was broad culpability.\n  But here is the point I want to make. We have a Board for the \nCorrection of Military Records. We have an on-going process within the \nDepartment of Defense to reevaluate decisions that have been made. This \ndecision about Kimmel and Short bubbled all the way up to President \nBush, who as you know, was the youngest naval aviator in American \nhistory in World War II.\n  President Bush decided to let contemporaries be the judge of \nhistorical events, and so he made the decision not to override the \ndecision of military leaders at the time of Pearl Harbor.\n  We had another review that ended on December 15th of 1995. That \nreview was headed by Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \nReadiness, Edwin S.\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\nDorn. Dorn concluded that, while it was clear that there was broad \nculpability, there was not sufficient evidence available now to \noverride the previous decision, which did not include court-martial of \nthese two military leaders; it simply included retiring them at their \npermanent rank rather than their temporary rank.\n  Some of you will remember this issue because we went through it with \na four-star admiral when there were questions about the abuse of women \non his watch in the Navy. Some of you will remember that we actually \nhad to cast a vote in that case. The issue was whether he should retire \nat his permanent rank, which was a two-star admiral, or as a four-star \nadmiral. We had a very close vote on the decision to allow him to \nretire with his four-star rank, which he held on the day he left the \nmilitary.\n  It is true that normally, military flag officers are allowed to \nretire above their permanent rank to the higher temporary rank held on \nthe day they are severed from the military. But that is not always the \ncase, and it is normally done as an indication that they have provided \nexcellent service.\n  It was not an extraordinary thing in the wake of Pearl Harbor to, No. \n1, retire the two officers in charge and, No. 2, retire them at their \npermanent rank rather than elevating their rank upon retirement.\n  I urge my colleagues, with all due respect to Senator Roth, to let \nhistory be the judge of what happened at Pearl Harbor. We have a \nprocess within the Defense Department where recommendations can be \nmade, where facts can be gathered on an objective basis, where the \nreview can come up to the level of the Secretary of Defense and then \ncome to the President, if necessary, to make a final decision. \nPresident Bush refused to override the judgment of history. The Clinton \nadministration, through Under Secretary Dorn, has refused to override \nthe judgment of history.\n  Now, there is no doubt about the fact that Senator Roth believes he \nis sufficiently knowledgeable about this case to override the judgment \nof history here. But I ask the other 99 Members of the Senate, are we \nsufficiently informed? Do we want to set a precedent here or build on \nprecedents, bad precedents in my opinion, that have been set in the \npast, of trying to write history on the floor of the Senate? I think we \nneed to leave it to the official process. We need to leave it to \nhistorians to make these judgments.\n  I have been personally involved now for several years with the Dr. \nMudd case. What has happened in that case is that Dr. Mudd has many \ninfluential heirs and they have set a goal of exonerating him. We now \nhave gone through this extraordinary process where we literally are on \nthe verge of making a decision, where the Federal courts have gotten \ninvolved, not on the issue of whether Dr. Mudd was guilty. Having met \nJohn Wilkes Booth three times, being a physician whose job it was to \nrecognize traits in people, he supposedly treated John Wilkes Booth and \nnever recognized him. Contemporaries at the time said no. As a result, \nthey sent him to prison. He was later pardoned due to some of the good \nwork he did in prison. Never again in his lifetime did he challenge the \njudgment. But yet now we are on the verge of having, because of the \npolitical influence of that family, a decision in the Defense \nDepartment to override history.\n  I think we make a mistake by doing that. In this case, we have had a \njudgment by President Bush, a naval aviator, a hero of the very war \nwhere this decision was made, who decided not to rewrite history.\n  I think we should not decide to rewrite history here today. I think \nthis amendment is well intended and based on tremendous research and on \na great deal of fact. The point is, we are not the body that should be \nmaking this judgment. There is a process underway. That process has \ncome to the level of the President once; it has come to the level of \nthe Under Secretary of Defense once; and in both cases, they have said \nthey would allow the judgment of history to stand.\n  It is not as if these two military leaders were court-martialed. They \nwere simply retired, something that happens every day in the military. \nAnd they were retired at their permanent rank, which is not ordinary \nbut it is certainly not extraordinary.\n  What should be extraordinary is that retirement at temporary rank \nought to be a reward for conspicuous service. And while each of us can \nmake our judgment about history that occurred in 1941, almost 58 years \nago, I do not believe we have the ability, nor do I believe we have the \nmoral authority as a political body, to go back and rewrite history. I \nask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  We are not rewriting history. We are merely correcting the record. \nJust let me point out that the Dorn report, which has been mentioned \ntime and again by those in opposition, specifically concluded that \nresponsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on \nthe shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be broadly \nshared. Let me emphasize that: It should be broadly shared. In other \nwords, there were others responsible, primarily in Washington. To place \nthe blame on these two gentlemen, who had distinguished military \ncareers, is wrong and is unfair. I believe we have a responsibility, a \nduty, to recommend to the President action that corrects this \nunfortunate misdeed.\n  In making this decision, let me point out that a number of \nendorsements of my resolution have been received from senior retired \nofficers of the highest rank. For example, Arleigh Burke sent a letter \nin which he concluded that:\n\n       It is my considered judgment that when all the \n     circumstances are considered that you should approve this \n     posthumous promotion and recommend it to the President.\n       The record is clear that important information, available \n     to the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, was never \n     made available to Admiral Kimmel in Hawaii.\n       Lastly, the Naval Court of Inquiry, which exonerated \n     Admiral Kimmel, concluded that his military decisions were \n     proper based on the information available to him.\n\n  Let me now refer to a letter we received from several distinguished \nmembers of the Navy: Thomas Moorer, Admiral, U.S. Navy; former \nChairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, William J. Crowe, Admiral, U.S. Navy; \nJ.L. Holloway, Admiral, U.S. Navy; Elmo Zumwalt, Admiral, U.S. Navy. \nThey wrote:\n\n       We ask that the honor and reputations of two fine officers \n     who dedicated themselves to the service of their country be \n     restored. Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short \n     were singularly scapegoated as responsible for the success of \n     the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941. The \n     time is long overdue to reverse this inequity and treat \n     Admiral Kimmel and [G]eneral Short fairly and justly. The \n     appropriate vehicle for that is the current Roth-Biden \n     Resolution.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last night the distinguished Senator Roth \nand I had an extensive debate on this issue, and we are basically \ncovering much of the same ground this morning. I repeat, I just got off \nthe phone with the Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, his predecessor, \nBill Perry.\n  The Dorn report went through this whole case very carefully.\n  I recited the list of some nine tribunals, including the Congress of \nthe United States, that reviewed this matter, and certainly did not \nreach any conclusion that the action to which my good friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Delaware, asks the Senate to do today.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of our colleague from Texas.\n  But it is interesting. This is very extensive research performed by \nour colleague. I took the liberty of taking the book last night and \ngoing home to read it, which is a summary of the congressional \nhearings. What I find interesting is that the Congress absolutely put \nforward some of the most distinguished Members of the House and the \nSenate to form the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl \nHarbor Attack: Alben Barkley, Senator from Kentucky was the chairman; \nJere Cooper, Representative from Tennessee, was the Vice Chairman. On \nthe Senate side, just look at the names of the individuals. Based on my \nown not personal knowledge but study of their careers in the Senate, \nthey certainly were viewed as among the giants of the Senate during \nthat critical period in history of\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\nWorld War II: Walter F. George, Senator from Georgia; Scott Lucas, \nSenator from Illinois; Owen Brewster, Senator from Maine; Homer \nFerguson, Senator from Michigan. They were the elderly statesmen, the \nleaders of the Senate.\n  In their report, this is what the Committee on the Investigation of \nthe Pearl Harbor Attack found. I refer to page 252. It says:\n  ``Specifically, the Hawaiian commands failed'' to do the following. \nBy ``the Hawaiian commands,'' of course, they are referring to the \nNaval command under Admiral Kimmel and the Army command under General \nShort:\n\n       (a) To discharge their responsibilities in the light of the \n     warnings received from Washington, other information \n     possessed by them, and the principle of command by mutual \n     cooperation.\n\n  The record astonishingly shows that these two senior officers, \nlocated on the principal islands of Hawaii, just did not collaborate \ntogether and share information and ideas as to how best to plan for the \ndefense of the men and women of the Armed Forces, our interest in the \nislands at that time, and the critical assets; namely, Naval ships and \naircraft that were located at that forward deployed area.\n\n       (b) To integrate and coordinate the facilities for defense \n     and to alert properly the Army and Navy establishments in \n     Hawaii, particularly in the light of the warnings and \n     intelligence available to them during the period November 27 \n     to December 7, 1941.\n       (c) To effect liaison on a basis designed to acquaint each \n     of them with the operations of the other, which was necessary \n     to their joint security, and to exchange fully all \n     significant intelligence.\n\n  I am going to repeat that--failure to exchange between the two of \nthem and with their subordinant significant intelligence.\n\n       (d) To maintain a more effective reconnaissance within the \n     limits of their equipment.\n       (e) To effect a state of readiness throughout the Army and \n     Navy establishments designed to meet all possible attacks.\n       (f) To employ the facilities, materiel, and personnel at \n     their command, which were adequate at least to have greatly \n     minimized the effects of the attack, in repelling the \n     Japanese raiders.\n       (g) To appreciate the significance of intelligence and \n     other information available to them.\n\n  In fairness, I will read another finding, and that is:\n\n       The errors made by the Hawaiian commands were errors of \n     judgment and not derelictions of duty.\n\n  Had there been dereliction of duty, these two men would have been \ncourt-martialed. But that was the decision made by the President of the \nUnited States, two successive Presidents--Roosevelt and Truman--not to \ndo that. But they found them guilty of errors of judgment.\n  What we are asked to do is to put this body on notice that we are \nreversing the findings of the distinguished bipartisan panel of \nSenators and Members of the House of Representatives after taking all \nof this factual evidence into consideration. Look at the voluminous \nfactual situation.\n  I asked my good friend last night: Are there any new facts on which \nthe Senate could have as a predicate the changing of this decision of \nthe joint congressional committee? And, quite candidly, my colleague \nfrom Delaware said no.\n  Just to bring to the attention of the Senate one other part in this \nreport, it states on page 556:\n\n       The commanding officers in Hawaii had a particular \n     responsibility for the defense of the Pacific Fleet and the \n     Hawaiian coastal frontier. This responsibility they failed to \n     discharge.\n\n  I repeat, Mr. President, ``This responsibility they failed to \ndischarge.''\n\n       The failure of the Washington authorities to perform their \n     responsibility provides extenuating circumstances for the \n     failures of these commanders in the field.\n\n  This committee took into consideration that there were other failures \nbut there were extenuating circumstances to bring the judgment of this \npanel to the conclusion that a court-martial was not to be held. But \nthey were to be retired in the grades which they were in at permanent \nrank.\n  In this record is a request by these two officers to be retired, and \nthe decision was made not to advance them at the time of retirement to \nthe higher grade. That decision was made by individuals who had fresh \nof mind the facts of this case.\n  For us at this date and time to try to reverse that, in my judgment, \nwould be to say to all of the tribunals that looked at this case--I \nwill recite them again--the Knox investigation of December 1941; the \nRoberts Commission of January 1941; the Hart investigation of June \n1944; Army Pearl Harbor Board, October of 1944; Navy Court of Inquiry, \nOctober of 1944; Clark investigation, September of 1944; Hewitt \ninquiry, July of 1945----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The time of the Senator from \nVirginia has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia be given an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Clausen investigation, September 12, 1945; and, the \njoint congressional committee of May of 1945. It is the joint \ncongressional committee record--to now, after these many 50-plus years, \ngo back and reverse the decisions of all of this work done by \nindividuals, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, with the authority \nto render such judgments would be to say to them: All of you are in \nerror for not having done what the Senator from Delaware requested the \nSenate do these 50-plus years later.\n\n  I just think that is a very unwise decision. I think the Senator from \nDelaware has put an awful lot of hard work into this. I respect him for \nit. But I simply cannot support the Senator, nor can the current \nSecretary of Defense, and, indeed, the previous Secretary of Defense, \nand others who have looked at this set of documents previously.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my senior \ncolleague, Senator Roth, for carrying the load on this.\n  As we look forward to Memorial Day observances this weekend, most of \nus will take time to reflect on the honorable and noble traditions of \nour military. The amendment sponsored by myself and my good friends \nSenator Roth, Thurmond, and Kennedy is an effort to make sure Congress \ndoes its part to uphold those noble traditions.\n  Just to highlight two or three points: First of all, my friend from \nVirginia talks about the historical record. The historical record was \nmade at that time when history was least likely to be served in the \nimmediate aftermath of a national tragedy, and a need for an \nexplanation that the country yearned and desired. I am not suggesting \nthose who conducted the original investigation had any benevolent \nintent. I am suggesting that history is best viewed with a little bit \nof distance. There was not any distance. I just ask everyone to think \nabout what would happen if something, God forbid, similarly happened \ntoday and this Senate, this body, and the administration decided they \nneeded to investigate something immediately. My overwhelming instinct \ntells me there would be a need to find specific individuals who were \nresponsible in order to satisfy our collective need for an answer.\n  I respectfully suggest that that is what happened here, and I \nrespectfully suggest, as well, that we should not be fearful of the \ntruth and we should not be fearful of going back in this open society \nof ours and not rewriting history, but setting the facts straight.\n  Ultimately, it is the President who must take action, but it is \nimportant that we in the Senate send the message that the historical \ntruth matters and that it is never too late to acknowledge that the \ngovernment did not treat the two commanding officers at Pearl Harbor on \nDecember 7, 1941, fairly.\n  Here's how I see it. Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter \nShort were publicly vilified and never given a chance to clear their \nnames.\n  If we lived in a closed society, fearful of the truth, then there \nwould be no need for the President to take action. But we don't. We \nlive in an open society. Eventually, we are able to declassify \ndocuments and evaluate our past based on at least a good portion of the \nwhole story. I believe sincerely that one of our greatest strengths as \na nation comes from our ability to honor truth and learn the lessons \nfrom our past.\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\n  If we perpetuate the myth that Admiral Kimmel and General Short bear \nall of the blame for Pearl Harbor then we miss the real story. We fail \nto look at the readiness shortfalls they were facing--the lack of \nadequate reconnaissance planes, pilots, spare parts, and maintenance \ncrews. We fail to look at the flawed intelligence model that was used--\nthe disconnect between what was obtained and what got to the commanders \nin the field.\n  I mention these things in particular because there are some striking \nparallels to the problems facing today's military. Today's problems are \nof a different scope and scale, but it is important to see the \nparallels so that we can accurately judge our progress and our endemic \nproblems.\n  The historic record is not flattering to our government in the case \nof the two commanding officers at Pearl Harbor and that is why it is \nour government's responsibility to acknowledge its mistake. I want to \nemphasize that point, because it is important.\n  In last night's debate over this amendment, both those for and \nagainst it agreed on most of the facts. Where there was disagreement, \nit seems to me, was in what to do about the facts. I believe we should \nurge the President to take action, because government action in the \npast shrouded the truth and scapegoated Kimmel and Short.\n  I know Senator Roth and Senator Thurmond discussed some of the \nhistory last night, so I will just briefly review some of the critical \nparts.\n  In 1941, after lifetimes of honorable service defending this nation \nand its values, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were denied the most \nbasic form of justice--a hearing by their peers. Instead of a proper \ncourt-martial, their ordeal began on December 18th with the Roberts \nCommission. A mere 11 days after the devastating attack at Pearl \nHarbor, this Commission was established to determine the facts.\n  In this highly charged atmosphere, the Commission conducted a speedy \ninvestigation, lasting little over a month. In the process, they denied \nboth commanders counsel and assured both that they would not be passing \njudgement on their performance. That assurance was worthless. Instead, \nthe Commission delivered highly judgmental findings and then \nimmediately publicized those findings. The Roberts Commission is the \nonly investigative body to find these two officers derelict in their \nduty and it was this government that decided to publicize that false \nconclusion. As one might expect, the two commanders were vilified by a \nnation at war.\n  Every succeeding investigation was clear in finding that there was no \ndereliction of duty. The first of these were the 1944 Army Board and \nNavy Court reviews. Again, it was government action that prevented a \ntruthful record from reaching the public--a decision by the President. \nThe findings of both of these bodies that placed blame on others than \nKimmel and Short were sequestered and classified.\n  Fifty-seven years later, such falsehoods and treatment can no longer \nbe justified by the necessities of war. Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel \nand Major General Walter Short were not singularly to blame for the \ndisastrous events of Pearl Harbor in 1941. In fact, every investigation \nof Admiral Kimmel and General Short's conduct highlights significant \nfailings by their superiors.\n  This amendment does not involve any costs, nor does it seek any \nspecial honor or award for these two officers. It does not even seek to \nexonerate them from all responsibility. Instead, it seeks simple \nfairness and their equal treatment. They are the only two eligible \nofficers from World War II denied advancement on the retirement lists \nto their highest held wartime ranks.\n  I know my colleague from Virginia is concerned that there may be a \nlong list of junior officers who can make similar claims. It is my \nunderstanding that there was a list of officers from World War II \neligible for advancement under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short were the only officers on that list \nthat were denied advancement on the retirement list.\n  I want to stress again for all my colleagues that this amendment \nsimply sets the record straight--responsibility for Pearl Harbor must \nbe broadly shared. It cannot be broadly shared if we fail to \nacknowledge the government's historic role in clouding the truth, nor \nif we continue to perpetuate the myth that Kimmel and Short bear \nsingular responsibility for the tragic losses at Pearl Harbor.\n  These two officers were unjustly stigmatized by our nation's failure \nto treat them in the same manner with which we treated their peers. To \nreverse this wrong would be consistent with this nation's sense of \nmilitary honor and basic fairness.\n  As we honor those who have given their lives to preserve American \nideals and national interests this coming Memorial Day, we must not \nforget two brave officers whose true story remains shrouded and \nsingularly tarnished by official neglect of the truth.\n  We introduced this amendment as S.J. Res. 19 earlier this year and it \nnow has 23 co-sponsors. As I know Senator Roth indicated last night, it \nhas the support of numerous veterans organizations and retired Navy \nflag officers. These knowledgeable people and about a quarter of the \nSenate have already spoken up on behalf of justice and fairness.\n  I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I cannot accept the basic premise on which \nthe distinguished Senator from Delaware addresses his case; that is, \nthat there was a disposition among good and honest men not to accord \nfairness, equity, and justice to these two individuals. They were the \nsubject of repeated inquiries. As a matter of fact, the Roberts \nCommission was headed by a Supreme Court Justice. Throughout the whole \njudicial history, in the common law of England, which we incorporated \nin our judicial history, speedy trial is the essence of our justice. \nThe appellate procedure has to thereafter proceed with some expedition. \nYou cannot wait 50-some-plus years to address an issue such as this. \nWhat do you say to the congressional committee? Do you dispute the \nfindings of this committee?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. We gave the names of some of the most revered elder \nstatesmen of this body who presided, such as Alben Barkley. And, \nindeed, President Truman had to address, in 1947, as Senator Roth and I \ncovered last night, the tombstone promotions, which were given to \nofficers of this category, and deny them. Truman himself had to make \nthat decision. So I say to my good friend, many fair-minded individuals \nhave reviewed this case and have come up with the determination that \nthey were not the only ones who had culpability, but certainly, as I \nread it, this commission of the Congress of the United States found a \nserious basis for holding the action and making the decision that they \ndid.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield a minute?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as the Senator from Michigan needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just add to what the Senator from \nVirginia just said in response to our good friend from Delaware. What I \nreally fear, perhaps the most, is the substitution of the judgment of a \npolitical body for the judgment and findings of the appropriate chain \nof command. We are a political body. The chain of command at the time, \nwhich has been reviewed by the Defense Department, repeatedly made \nfindings and held these two officers accountable. For us now to \nsubstitute our judgment more than five decades later for that of the \nchain of command, it seems to me, is a very, very bad precedent in \nterms of holding officers accountable for events.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense recently reviewed this \nentire matter--the so-called Dorn report--and I have quoted these \nfindings before, but I will pick out two of them, which seems to me go \nto the heart of the matter.\n  This is a quote:\n\n       To say that responsibility is broadly shared is not to \n     absolve Admiral Kimmel and General Short of accountability.\n\n  Of course, accountability should be broadly shared, and maybe it \nwasn't as broadly shared as it should have been, but the issue is \nwhether or not this accountability, 57 years ago, is going to be set \naside by a political body 57 years later.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. My time is over, but I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is a rhetorical question. The report \nsuggested that Generals Marshall and Stark were also partially \nresponsible. My point is that the idea that the entirety of the blame, \nthat the children and the children of the children of these two men \nwill live forever thinking that they were the only two people \nresponsible for this, is a historical inaccuracy, unfair, and a blemish \nthat is not warranted to be carried by the two proud families whose \nnames are associated with them. It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what we are talking about today is a matter \nof justice and fairness, a matter that goes to the core of our military \ntradition and our Nation's sense of military honor. Just let me point \nout once again the Dorn report says:\n\n       Responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not \n     fall solely on the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General \n     Short. It should be broadly shared.\n\n  Unfortunately, it was not broadly shared. The only two people who \nwere singled out for punishment, or not to be promoted to their wartime \nrank, were Admiral Kimmel and General Short. They were held singularly \nresponsible for what happened in Pearl Harbor. That is not fair. That \nis not just. Just let me point out that we have had the essence of the \ntremendous number of endorsements we have received from senior retired \nofficers of the highest rank. Once again, I point out that admiral \nafter admiral--Burke, Zumwalt, Moorer and Crowe--have asked that this \nbe corrected. All we seek today is justice and fairness to two officers \nwho served their Nation with excellence.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the admirals the Senator enumerated were \nones I had the pleasure of knowing, serving with several, and for whom \nI have a great deal of respect. But I note the absence of any similar \nnumber of Army generals coming forward on behalf of General Short. \nPerhaps the Senator has something in the Record. But I think that \nsilence speaks to authenticate the position that this Senator and \nothers have taken.\n  To the very strong, forceful statement of my colleague who said it is \nimplicit that all responsibility for this tragedy is assigned to these \ntwo individuals, that is not correct. The Dorn report said it is to be \nshared. In fact, General Marshall stepped forward with courage and \naccepted publicly, at the very time this was being examined, his share \nof responsibility.\n  So I say others, indeed, General Marshall and others, stepped \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. May I just make a 15-second statement?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Chair has ordered the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say, as a courtesy to my good friend and others who \nhave sponsored this, we will not, of course, move to table.\n  Mr. ROTH. I point out the Army Board for Correction of Military \nRecords, in 1991, recommended that General Short be restored to his \nfull wartime rank.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 377\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question now is on \nthe Roberts amendment. There is an hour equally divided.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have had the privilege this year to \nserve as the first chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. I would like to \nrecognize Senator Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nfor his vision and foresight in creating this subcommittee to deal with \nthe nontraditional threats to U.S. national security.\n  The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities was established \nto provide oversight for the Department of Defense's efforts to counter \nnew and emerging challenges to vital United States interests. Through a \nseries of hearings and detailed oversight of budget accounts, the \nsubcommittee highlighted: the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction; terrorism directed at U.S. targets both at home and \nabroad; information warfare and the protection of our defense \ninformation infrastructure; and trafficking of illegal drugs. The \nsubcommittee sought to identify the technology, operational concepts \nand capabilities we need to deter--and, if necessary--combat these \nperils.\n  I would like to briefly highlight the initiatives included in this \nbill to address the emerging threats to our national security:\n  Protection of our homeland and our critical information \ninfrastructure are two of the most serious challenges facing our Nation \ntoday. In the area of counterterrorism, the bill before the Senate \nincludes full funding for the five Rapid Assessment and Initial \nDetection (RAID) teams requested by the administration, and an increase \nof $107 million to provide a total of 17 additional RAID teams in \nfiscal year 2000. We have further required the Department to establish \na central transfer account for the Department's programs to combat \nterrorism to provide better visibility and accounting for this \nimportant effort.\n  We have included an Information Assurance Initiative to strengthen \nthe Department's critical information infrastructure, enhance oversight \nand improve organizational structure. As a part of this initiative, we \nadded $120 million above the President's budget request for programs to \nenhance our ability to combat cyber-attacks. In addition, this \ninitiative will provide for a test to plan and conduct simulations, \nexercises and experiments against information warfare threats, and \nallow the Department to interact with civil and commmercial \norganizations in this important effort. The provision encourages the \nSecretary of Defense to strike an appropriate balance in addressing \nthreats to the defense information infrastructure while at the same \ntime recognizing that Department of Defense has a role to play in \nhelping to protect critical infrastructure outside the DOD.\n  We have included a legislative package to strengthen the science and \ntechnology program. This legislation will ensure that since the science \nand technology program is threat-based and that investments are tied to \nfuture warfighting needs. The legislation is also aimed at promoting \ninnovation in laboratories and improving the efficiency of RDT \noperations. The bill also includes a $170 million increase to the \nscience and technology budget request.\n  And finally, in the area of nonproliferation, we have authorized over \n$718 million for programs to assist Russia and other states of the \nformer Soviet Union destroy or control their weapons of mass \ndestruction. However, it is important to note, this is an increase of \n$29.6 million over the fiscal year 1999 funding level. I would like to \ntake a moment to share my thoughts on this issue.\n  I am very concerned about the findings of the recently released GAO \nreport that the U.S. cost of funding the nuclear material storage \nfacility in Mayak, Russia has increased from an original estimate of \n$275 million to $413 million. This Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) \nproject may eventually have a price tag of $1 billion. These increased \ncosts to the U.S. have occurred because Russia has failed to fund its \nshare of the costs of this project. I also understand that the chemical \nweapons destruction facility will not be open until 2006, in part due \nto Russia's failure to provide the needed information about the \nchemical weapons to be destroyed.\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\n  The CTR program is becoming more and more one-sided. This program is \nalso in the interest of the Russians. Matter of fact, much of the \ndestruction of the Russian inventory, funded by the CTR program, \nenables Russia to meet its obligations under existing arms control \ntreaties.\n  In addition, I am concerned with the daily press reports that the \nRussians are enhancing their military capabilities. For example:\n  Earlier this month, President Yeltsin reportedly ordered the Russian \nmilitary to draw up plans for the development and use of tactical \nnuclear forces.\n  On May 4, The Russian Defense Minister threatened to reconsider \nRussian support for the revision of the Conventional Forces in Europe \n(CFE) Treaty.\n  On April 16, the Duma unanimously adopted a resolution calling for \nincreased defense budgets.\n  Although I have serious concerns about this program, we included an \nauthorization for CTR at the budget request of $475.5 million, an \nincrease of $35 million over the FY 99 level. However, before FY 2000 \nfunds may be obligated we require the President to recertify that the \nRussians are foregoing any military modernization that exceeds \nlegitimate defense requirements and are complying with relevant arms \ncontrol agreements. The most recent certification by the Administration \nwas completed before these numerous statements by Yeltsi and other \nRussian officials.\n  I am also concerned with the deficiencies in the management and \noversight of the DOE programs in Russia--in particular, the Initiative \nfor Proliferation Prevention (IPP) and the Nuclear Cities Initiative \n(NCI). If these programs are to succeed, we need to get past the \nimplementation problems pointed out in the GAO report, in press \nreports, by our House colleagues, and by the Russians. In addition, the \nRussian economic crisis and lack of infrastructure are making these \nprograms more difficult to manage. I am afraid if we do not exercise \nstrong oversight now we are in danger of losing these programs.\n  I have proposed a number of initiatives that I believe will go a long \nway towards correcting the deficiencies in the management of the IPP \nprogram, establishing a framework for effective implementation and \noversight of both programs, and ensuring that sufficient accountability \nexists. Further, I believe the U.S. nonproliferation goals and U.S. \nnational security will be better served by these improvements.\n  Finally, I believe DoE should spend FY 2000 tightening up the \nimplementation of IPP and NCI rather than broadening the program. \nTherefore, the committee authorized the IPP and NCI below the \nadministration's request of $30 million for each program. The bill \nincludes an authorization of $15 million for NCI and an authorization \nof $25 million for IPP, an increase of $2.5 million for each program \nover FY 99 levels. These are the only programs in the entire DoE \nnonproliferation budget that the committee authorized below the budget \nrequest. Overall, we authorized $266.8 million for DoE nonproliferation \nprograms in the former Soviet Union countries--an increase of $13.4 \nmillion over FY 99.\n  I believe the bill before you takes significant steps to focus the \nDepartment of Defense's efforts to counter new and emerging threats to \nvital national security interests. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I am asking the support of my colleagues \nfor a simple sense of the Senate that calls also for complete \ntransparency on the part of the President and Senate consideration \nregarding the de facto editing of the original North Atlantic Treaty.\n  My sense of the Senate asks the President to certify whether the new \nStrategic Concept of NATO, the one adopted at the 50th anniversary of \nNATO in Washington about a month ago--this formalization of new and \ncomplicated United States responsibilities in Europe, as evidenced by \nthe war in Kosovo and the possibility of future Kosovos around the \nworld--is in fact a document that obligates the United States in any \nway, shape, or form.\n  If so, my sense of the Senate affirms that this body be given the \nopportunity to debate, to accept or to reject, the new blueprint for \nfuture NATO operations, these actions which will undoubtedly include \nsubstantial components of our own Armed Forces engaged completely \noutside the province of the original treaty.\n  Yesterday the distinguished Senator from Michigan, my colleague and \nmy friend, Senator Levin, asked where the Congress was in 1990, in \nregard to the last Strategic Concept adoption. The Senator has rightly \npointed out there were changes made in the Concept at that particular \ntime. Without question, that should have been an alarm bell of things \nto come. But there are key differences, I tell my friend, in the world \ntoday as opposed to the world in 1990.\n  Second, and just as important, there are significant differences \nregarding the Strategic Concept adopted in April of 1999, just a month \nago, which is the document that I hope is still on the desk of all \nSenators, and the Concept that was adopted in 1990 as referenced by the \nSenator.\n  First of all, Bosnia had not occurred and, more especially, Kosovo \nwas not the proof of the direction that NATO intended to go. That \ndirection is an offensive direction. That is not meant to be a pun.\n  The crafting of language in the new Strategic Concept was carefully \ndone. Look, my colleagues, if you will, at the removal of the following \nwording of paragraph 35 of the 1991 Concept. I will repeat it:\n\n       The alliance is purely defensive in purpose. None of its \n     weapons will ever be used except in self defense.\n\n  That was removed. That removal was not an oversight. The current \nStrategic Concept sets in motion a new NATO that is inconsistent with \narticle 1 of the 1990 treaty or concept. The North Atlantic Treaty, \narticle 1:\n\n       The parties undertake as set forth in the Charter of the \n     United Nations to settle any international dispute which they \n     may be involved in by peaceful means, in such a manner that \n     international peace and security and justice are not \n     endangered, and to refrain in their international relations \n     from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent \n     with the purpose of the United Nations.\n\n  That was in 1990, the reference to the United Nations, to settle any \ninternational dispute by peaceful means, not by military means.\n  The original wording and intent of article 4 of the North Atlantic \nTreaty is straightforward. The North Atlantic Treaty, article 4:\n\n       The parties will consult together when in the opinion of \n     any of them the territorial integrity--\n\n  All the debate about whether we are conducting a military campaign \nand crossing borders of a sovereign state, I say it again:\n\n       The parties will consult together when in the opinion of \n     any of them the territorial integrity or political \n     independence or the security of any of the parties is \n     threatened.\n\n  However, paragraph 24 of the new Concept significantly alters article \n4 of the NATO treaty in the following way:\n\n       Arrangements exist within the alliance for consultation \n     among the allies under article 4 of the Washington Treaty--\n\n  My colleagues, pay attention to this--\n\n     and, where appropriate, the coordination of their efforts \n     including the responses to such risks.\n\n  The portion that includes ``the coordination of their efforts \nincluding their responses to such risk,'' it is new, and strongly \nsuggests offensive action, i.e., Kosovo. It is a possible response to a \nthreat, and that is a radical shift for NATO--not from 1949 but also \nfrom 1990.\n  The new Concept has significantly expanded the global coverage of \nNATO. For example, paragraphs 20, 21, and 22 clearly indicate a global \nreach for NATO.\n  Paragraph 20 states:\n\n       The resulting tensions could lead to crises affecting Euro-\n     Atlantic stability, to human suffering and to armed \n     conflicts. Such conflicts could affect the security of the \n     conference by spilling over to neighboring countries \n     including NATO countries or in other ways, and could also \n     affect the security of neighboring states.\n\n  The point is that NATO justifies action well beyond the original \nboundaries of NATO and now includes threats to member states anywhere \nin the world. Is that what we want the NATO of the future to be?\n  I say to my friend from Michigan, he is right that Congress was \nasleep at the switch when the Strategic Concept of 1990 was adopted. \nBut there is no reason for Congress to remain asleep in\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\n1999. In fairness to my colleagues, no one envisioned that in less than \n9 years the purely defensive alliance of NATO would have conducted \noffensive action out of area, against a sovereign nation, albeit a \nterribly oppressive nation, in an action that was not in our vital \nnational interests.\n  Let me share some comments I have gleaned from the Foreign Media \nReaction Daily Digest which all Members receive from the U.S. \nInformation Agency. This is from the leading press around the world, as \nthey view, in terms of their commentary, what this Strategic Concept \nmeans to them.\n  I know some critics, myself included, will say their views, some of \nthe views, are unimportant or biased or that they are from state-run \npresses. I know that. But I think they are a valuable tool to \nunderstand how we and NATO are being perceived by non-NATO members--and \nsome NATO members as well. Here is the summary--early May:\n\n       The Alliance's adoption of a ``new strategic concept''. . . \n     has swung to the negative [in regard to the comments by the \n     foreign press]. Criticism of the Alliance's vision of a \n     ``new world order''. . . . many underscored the problems \n     with NATO's expanded purview and questioned the \n     feasibility of trying to promote and impose--beyond \n     European borders and ``by force if necessary''--a \n     ``consistent'' standard on human rights. The vast majority \n     of media outside of Europe remained harshly critical of \n     NATO's [read the U.S.'s] new blueprint, with most \n     reiterating their concerns that NATO is ``transforming \n     itself into a global police force, ignoring the role of \n     the U.N.'' . . . NATO is being enlarged--both spatially \n     and doctrinally--in order to ensure U.S. military and \n     political dominance over Europe, Russia and the rest of \n     the world.\n\n  I don't buy that, but it is important to understand that other \ncountries certainly think that.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The idea that a part of the world, formed by the most \n     ``civilized'' nations, can be responsible for the respect of \n     human rights in the whole world--resorting, if necessary, to \n     the use of force . . . is neither viable nor fair.\n\n  They are asking:\n\n       . . . whether Kosovo is an exception or a rule in NATO's \n     new strategy, and whether the Allies will be equally firm, \n     but also consistent, when its comes to the Kurds . . . \n     Tibetans, Palestinians, Tutsis, Hutus [or] Native Americans. \n     Ethnic cleansing in Chechnya, Turkey, Colombia, Indonesia \n     show that NATO is now punishing randomly, that is only \n     enemies and only those countries that don't have any nuclear \n     weapons.\n\n  Mr. President, several headlines--and I do not agree with all of \nthese headlines--in May should be brought to the attention of my \ncolleagues.\n  The newspaper Reforma in Mexico:\n\n       What is the reason for the desire to impose a solution in \n     defense of the Albanians in Yugoslavia while at the same time \n     three ethnic groups that hate each other are forced to co-\n     exist in Bosnia? What could happen in Mexico in the future? \n     Within several months, NATO members [have now agreed] to \n     intervene anywhere they see fit without the need to consult \n     with the U.N. and to run the risk of a veto from Russia or \n     China. This will be a two century jump backwards.\n\n  That is from Mexico. I am not saying it speaks for the entire country \nof Mexico, although President Zedillo said much the same thing.\n  Ethnos, a paper in Greece:\n\n       What occurred in Washington was the U.N.'s \n     complete weakening. It is now a mere onlooker of NATO's \n     decisions and initiatives. What has taken place is the \n     complete overthrow of the legal system.\n\n  A newspaper called Folha de S. Paulo in Brazil:\n\n       NATO celebrates its 50th anniversary and in practice \n     formalizes the end of the U.N. As it has become clear this \n     past month, the world's power is, in fact, in NATO, meaning \n     in the hands of the United States. And, almost no Government \n     dares to protest against it.\n\n  The Economist in Great Britain, a respected newspaper:\n\n       Limping home from Kosovo would certainly oblige NATO to \n     rethink its post-Cold War aims of intervention, not just for \n     member's defense, but also for broader interest in \n     humanitarian and international order. NATO might go into \n     terminal decline. The Alliance needs to persist in explaining \n     to other countries the principles that guided NATO's decision \n     to intervene in Kosovo. This necessity is not so much to \n     prove that this was a just cause but to reassure a suspicious \n     world that NATO has not given itself the right to attack \n     sovereign nations at whim.\n\n  Il Sole 24-Ore. of Italy:\n\n       We cannot say what emerged from the weird birthday-summit \n     war council in Washington is a strategic concept. Indeed, \n     NATO should have been more precise about its future. The war \n     in Kosovo forces us to revise international law as we have \n     known it.\n\n  This is from a newspaper in a country that is a NATO ally:\n\n       The concept suggests laying the foundation of an ``ethical \n     foreign policy.'' A democratic West which tolerates ethnic \n     and religious diversities, which is stable and economically \n     free, can even fight to give these values to other people. It \n     is a very nice picture, but to impose freedom is a \n     contradiction in terms.\n\n  Another headline: Al-Dustur in Jordan, the new King of which just \npaid a visit to this country:\n\n       The Anglo-American alliance imposed on NATO during the \n     summit in Washington is a new orientation marked by \n     imperialist arrogance and disregard for the rest of the \n     world.\n\n  Those are pretty strong words.\n\n       This is a serious danger that faces the world, and to \n     overcome it all non-NATO countries should cooperate and seek \n     to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Is that what the new Strategic Concept is leading to in the minds of \nsome of the critics in foreign countries?\n  Al Watan in Kuwait, the country we freed in regard to Desert Storm:\n\n       NATO does not have a strategy for the next 50 years, except \n     America will remain the master, Europe the subordinate, \n     Russia a marginalized state and the rest of the world \n     secondary actors.\n\n  That is pretty tough criticism.\n  Asahi newspaper in Japan:\n\n       One such lesson is that members of an alliance often resort \n     to their own military activities, paying scant attention to \n     the trend of the U.N. Security Council, or international \n     opinion. Another lesson is that the United States, the only \n     superpower, often acts in accordance with its own logic or \n     interests rather than acting as supporter for its allies.\n\n  This newspaper sums it up:\n\n       This has relevance to the U.S.-Japanese military alliance.\n\n  The newspaper Hankyoreh Shinmun of South Korea, an ally:\n\n       The summit decision to give the Alliance an enlarged role \n     in the future is a dangerous one in that it may serve in the \n     long term to merely prop up America's hegemonic endeavors. \n     The talk of NATO's expanded role confuses everyone and even \n     threatens global peace. NATO's new role could unify countries \n     like Russia and China that oppose U.S. dominance, provoking a \n     new global conflagration between them and the West.\n\n  In Taiwan, The China Times:\n\n       NATO's new order requires different agents to act on the \n     U.S.'s behalf in different regions and to share the peace-\n     keeping responsibility for the peace of greater America. In \n     the Kosovo crisis, NATO on one hand tries to stop the \n     Yugoslav government's slaughter. On the other hand, to show \n     respect for Yugoslav sovereignty it also opposes Kosovar \n     independence. This means that a country cannot justify human \n     rights violations by claiming national sovereignty. By the \n     same token, calls for independence in a high tension area are \n     forbidden since they would naturally lead to war. These two \n     principles have now become the pillars of the NATO strategic \n     concept. Both sides of the Taiwan Strait have also repeatedly \n     received similar signals: Beijing should not use force \n     against Taiwan, and Taiwan should not declare independence.\n\n  There is a parallel.\n  Finally, in India, the newspaper Telegraph:\n\n       NATO will definitely try to make things difficult for \n     nations like India which are planning to join the nuclear \n     league. Though Russia, and now China, are seeking India's \n     cooperation and active participation to build a multi-polar \n     world order against the United States, Deli appears to be \n     reluctant to play. This reluctance stems from the fear that \n     the West, with help from Pakistan, might turn Kashmir into \n     another Kosovo, highlighting human rights violations in the \n     valley and Kashmir then might become a fit case for NATO \n     intervention.\n\n  I do not buy that. I do not think we are going to do that. Some of \nthe warnings, some of the descriptions that I have just read to my \ncolleagues, I do not buy, but it shows you the attitude, it shows you \nhow other people feel about the new Strategic Concept.\n  We have the same kind of commentaries from Argentina, from Canada, \nfrom Mexico again.\n  La Jornada, a newspaper in Mexico:\n\n       The decision by NATO leaders to turn that organization from \n     a defensive into an offensive entity and to carry out \n     military actions regardless of the U.N. is a defeat of \n     civilized mechanisms that were so painfully put in place \n     after World War II. If the Alliance really wanted to impose \n     democratic values by force, it should start by attacking some \n     of its own members, like Turkey, which carries out systematic \n     ethnic cleansing campaigns against the Kurds.\n\n  Tough words.\n  My point remains that this new Strategic Concept, a concept that \nradically alters the focus and direction of NATO, has been adopted \nwithout the consultation of the Senate. Are we willing, as\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\nSenators, to stand by and not debate, discuss, or give consent to a \ndocument that fundamentally alters the most successful alliance in \nhistory? What we discussed, what we ratified in regard to expansion is \ntotally different than the new Strategic Concept. It has had no debate, \nit has had no discussion and, yet, it is a blueprint for our \ninvolvement in the future of NATO.\n  It is a document that fundamentally alters the most successful \nalliance in history and one that may cost the blood of our men and \nwomen and billions of dollars from our Treasury. We should at least \ndebate it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be voting for this amendment because \nit is worded very differently from earlier versions. This version of \nthe amendment simply requires the President to certify whether or not \nthe new Strategic Concept of NATO imposes any new commitment or \nobligation on the United States.\n  In 1991, we had major changes in the alliance's Strategic Concept. \nThese were huge changes. Section 9 of the alliance's new Strategic \nConcept in 1991, for instance, said:\n\n       Risks to allied security are less likely to result from \n     calculated aggression against the territory of the allies but \n     rather from the adverse consequences of instabilities that \n     may arise from serious economic, social and political \n     difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial \n     disputes which are faced by many countries in Central and \n     Eastern Europe. They could lead to crises inimical to \n     European stability and even to armed conflicts which could \n     involve outside powers or spill over into NATO countries.\n\n  Then in paragraph 12, it says:\n\n       Alliance security must--\n\n  This is 1991--not this new one, but the Strategic Concept that was \nadopted in 1991.\n\n       Alliance security must take into account the global \n     context. Alliance security interests can be affected by other \n     risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction, disruption of the flow of vital \n     resources, and actions of terrorism and sabotage.\n\n  The reason that this 1991 Strategic Concept was not sent over to the \nSenate for ratification was very straightforward, very simple, in my \njudgment; and that is that the Strategic Concept then did not contain \nnew commitments or obligations for the United States. This is a \nstrategic concept; this is not a legally binding document. This is not \na treaty-specific document which contains obligations and commitments \non the part of the parties. This is a strategic concept document, both \nin 1991 and in 1999.\n  So when my good friend from Kansas says that I said the Congress was \nasleep in 1991, the Congress was not asleep in 1991. The Congress was \nexactly right in 1991. When this Strategic Concept was adopted in 1991, \nthere were no new obligations or commitments that required the Senate \nto ratify this document. And there are no new obligations or \ncommitments now.\n  The President has already told us that. He has already sent a letter \nto Senator Warner. The President has sent a letter to Senator Warner \ndated April 14, 1999, that says:\n\n       The Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or \n     obligations for the United States.\n\n  So the certification, which is required in this amendment--and \nrightfully so, by the way, in my judgment--has already been made. I see \nno reason it would not be made again.\n  So I do not believe that the Congress was sleeping in 1991, and it \nsurely is not sleeping now. Senator Roberts is, as far as I am \nconcerned, very appropriately saying to the administration, if this \ncontains new commitments or obligations--if it contains new obligations \nand commitments--then you should send this to us as a treaty amendment.\n\n  Of course, I happen to think that is correct. This amendment does not \nfind that there are new obligations and commitments. An earlier version \nof this amendment, by the way, did. This amendment does not do that. \nThis amendment says to the President: Tell the Congress whether or not \nthe new Strategic Concept--those are the precise words of this \namendment--constitutes, involves, contains, new obligations or \ncommitments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator points out that the letter was sent to me--\ncorrect--in response to a letter that I forwarded to the President. \nThat is in last night's Record.\n  First, we welcome the Senator's support on this. But I think he would \nagree with me that that letter was written at the time when the \nlanguage was still being worked, and of course it predates the final \nlanguage as adopted by the 50th anniversary summit. That language is \nthe object of this, I think, very credible inquiry by Mr. Roberts, \nmyself, and others.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is very appropriate.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is very well that the Senate may forward a letter that \nputs this matter to rest and, most importantly, clarifies in the minds \nof our other allies, the other 18 nations, exactly what this document \nis intended to say from the standpoint of America, which, I point out \ntime and time again, contributes 25 percent of the cost to the NATO \noperations.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that is correct. The timing of the letter is \nexactly as the chairman says it is. But the statement of the President \nis that ``the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or \nobligations for the United States.''\n  The caption of the amendment by the Senator from Kansas is ``Relating \nto the legal effect of [this] new Strategic Concept.'' I think it is \nquite clear from our conversations with the State Department that the \nPresident can, indeed, and will, indeed, make this certification, and \nshould--and should. I think it is an important certification.\n  I commend the Senator from Kansas. I think we need clarity on this \nsubject. If there is a legally binding commitment on the United States \nin this new Strategic Concept, it ought to be sent to the Senate for \nratification. But if this 1999 Strategic Concept is like the 1991 \nStrategic Concept--not a legally binding document but a planning \ndocument, a document setting out concepts, not legal obligations--that \nis a very different thing.\n  NATO has adopted strategic concepts continually during its existence. \nBy the way, again, let me suggest there is nothing much broader than \nsection 12 of the 1991 Strategic Concept which said: ``Alliance \nsecurity must take into account the global context.'' Does that \nrepresent a binding commitment on the United States? It surely did not, \nin my judgment, and need not have been submitted to the Senate for \nratification. I believe that the current Concept, which has been \nadopted, does not contain legally binding commitments.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, the amendment, as carefully \ncrafted, does not have the word ``legal'' in it. It imposes any ``new \ncommitment.'' Indeed, there are political commitments that give rise to \nactions from time to time. So I recognize the Senator's focus on \n``legal,'' but it does not limit the certification solely to legal. It \nembraces any new commitment or obligation of the United States.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I think it clearly means the legal effect of \nthis. But let us, rather than arguing over what is in or not in this \namendment--I understand that there was going to be an effort made here \nto clarify language on the certification. If there is going to be such \nan effort, I would ask that be made now and that we then ask for the \nyeas and nays so we are not shooting at a moving target here. Really, I \nthink it would be useful, if in fact that change relative to the \ncertification requirement is going to be sent to the desk, it be sent \nto the desk at this point; and then I am going to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do yield.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 377, As Modified\n\n(Purpose: Relating to the legal effect of the new Strategic Concept of \n                                 NATO)\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I do have that clarification in the form of an \namendment, which I send to the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that \nin title X, at the end of subtitle D, that this amendment would be \nadded.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. There is objection. I would like to reserve the right to \nobject, if you let me explain; otherwise, I will just simply object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I reserve the right to object because if, in fact, the \nSenator wishes to change his amendment, I ask that we consider on line \n7 adding the word ``legal,'' because failure to do so rewrites \nconstitutional history here. Presidents make commitments all the time. \nCommitments and obligations do not a treaty make and do not require a \nsupermajority vote under the Constitution by the Senate to ratify those \ncommitments. I, at least for the time being, object and hope that after \nwe finish this debate, before we vote, my colleague and I can have a \nfew minutes in the well to see whether he will consider amending it to \nadd the word ``legal'' on line 7 of his amendment. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just 2 minutes. I \nread this document quite clearly as meaning any new commitment or \nobligation, because it uses the word ``impose.'' I know no other way to \nimpose an obligation or a commitment other than legal. When you use the \nword ``impose,'' it seems to me it is quite clear that that means it is \nimposed. So that is the way I read this language. If others want to \nread the language in a different way, they may. But I think that the \ncertification requirement, which the Senator from Kansas wants to move \ninto the front of this amendment instead of in the sense-of-the-Senate \npart of it, is simply a clarification of what was always the clear \nintent, which is that there be such a certification. And I think that \nthat is more of a technical change than anything.\n  I have no objection to an amendment which moves the certification \nrequirement to the front of the amendment before the sense-of-the-\nSenate language and imposes that as a certification requirement--not \nsense of the Congress but as a requirement on the President. In my \njudgment, there is no doubt but that it is only if there is a legally \nbinding commitment or obligation that this would require a referral to \nthe U.S. Senate, because no other requirement or obligation other than \none that is legally binding on us would rise to the dignity of a \ntreaty.\n  I hope the Senator will have a chance to move the certification \nrequirement to an earlier position in his amendment. If I could just \nask one question of my friend from Kansas, as I understand, that is \nwhat the modification does provide and nothing more; is that correct?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I say to the Senator, I am not sure. I had thought we \nhad an agreement that there would not be an objection to the amendment \nby unanimous consent. That obviously is not the case. We are going to \nhave to consider this. Let us work on this.\n  I will be happy to visit here on the floor with the Senator from \nDelaware and my good friend from Michigan. I am not entirely clear, \nafter listening to the Senator, that his description of this amendment \nis the one that I have. Let us work it out, and if push comes to shove, \nalthough I think it is entirely reasonable for a Senator to be allowed \nto amend his own amendment, if this has caused some concern on the part \nof both Senators, we can always bring this up as a separate amendment, \nwhich may be the best case. If, in fact, you say ``legal,'' you put the \nword ``legal'' in there, obviously I do not think the President is \ngoing to have any obligation to report on anything. In terms of \nobligation, if I might say so, if the Senator will continue to yield, \nif Kosovo is not an obligation, I am not standing here on the floor of \nthe Senate. That is my response.\n  Why don't we visit about this if we can, and then, if necessary, we \nwill just introduce an amendment at a later time as a separate \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield me 1 \nminute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Just 1 minute and then afterwards I see others will seek \nrecognition to speak.\n  I want to make it clear, I do not know where the Senator got the \nimpression that there would be no objection. I did not agree to that. \nWhat I suggested was that when he asked me whether or not I objected, I \nasked him to withhold until after I made my talk and asked some \nquestions. Then I would not object. We are getting the ``cart before \nthe horse'' here. I want to make it clear, I may not ultimately object. \nI just want to have an opportunity to speak to this before he sends his \namendment to the desk.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire be added as an original cosponsor of Roberts \namendment No. 377.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for pursuing this, because I do think \nit is a very important amendment. I think it is very important that we \nask the President to come forward and tell us if this new Strategic \nConcept we have all been reading imposes a new commitment or obligation \non the United States.\n  The original NATO treaty, the whole treaty, is very clear. It is a \ndefensive alliance. That has never been questioned until what is \nhappening today in Kosovo, which is clearly not defensive. It is \noffensive. NATO has started airstrikes on a sovereign nation that is \nnot a member of NATO. So I think it is, before our eyes, evolving into \na new Strategic Concept for NATO, and I think we most certainly must \nhave the right to approve it. It is an addition to a treaty obligation \nthat was made 40-plus years ago.\n  Now, I am not necessarily against NATO having an offensive part of a \ntreaty obligation, but I am absolutely certain that the Senate must \napprove this kind of added obligation and that we not walk away from \nthe very important concept that a treaty sets out certain obligations \nand it is required to be ratified by Congress. And most certainly, we \nmust ratify the changing of a treaty obligation from a defensive \nalliance to an offensive alliance.\n  There is no question that the founders of our country chose to make \nit difficult to declare war. They chose to make it difficult to declare \nwar by giving the right to Congress. They could have given it to the \nPresident, but they were going away from the English system, where the \nKing declared war and implemented the same war. They wanted a division \nof responsibility, and they wanted it to be difficult to put our troops \nin harm's way. Indeed, every President we have had has said that it \nshould be difficult to put our troops in harm's way; perhaps until this \nPresident, that is.\n  So it is important that we pass this amendment and that the President \ncertify that we either do have a new obligation or we do not. I think \nwe do, and I think we need to debate it.\n  As I said, I am not against NATO having some offensive \nresponsibilities. I do question that they have in our NATO treaty the \nright to do what they are doing right now. I think we need to debate \nit, and I think we need to clarify exactly what would be in a new \noffensive strategy that would be a part of a NATO treaty obligation of \nthe United States of America.\n  I can see a role for NATO that would declare that we have security \ninterests that are common and that we would be able to determine what \nthose common security interests are and that we would fight them \ntogether, stronger than any of us could fight independently. I do not \nknow that Kosovo meets that test, but I think others certainly do \nbelieve that. I do believe that a Desert Storm does meet the test or \nKim Jong-Il, with nuclear capabilities, does meet that test.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment, and I ask unanimous consent \nto be added as a cosponsor of the amendment. I think it is incumbent on \nthe Senate to stand up for our constitutional responsibility and that \nis what this amendment does.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I do not know if the Senator from Delaware would like to \nspeak at this moment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The distinguished Senator from Michigan indicated that I \ncould yield myself such time as he has remaining.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kansas, I have no objection, \nafter talking to him, if he wishes to send his amendment to the desk \nnow. I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I send a modification to my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 377), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In title X, at the end of subtitle D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1061. LEGAL EFFECT OF THE NEW STRATEGIC CONCEPT OF NATO.\n\n       (a) Certification Required.--Not later than 30 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall \n     determine and certify to the Senate whether or not the new \n     Strategic Concept of NATO imposes any new commitment or \n     obligation on the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, if the President certifies under subsection (a) that \n     the new Strategic Concept of NATO imposes any new commitment \n     or obligation on the United States, the President should \n     submit the new Strategic Concept of NATO to the Senate as a \n     treaty for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification \n     under Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n       (c) Report.--Together with the certification made under \n     subsection (a), the President shall submit to the Senate a \n     report containing an analysis of the potential threats facing \n     NATO in the first decade of the next millennium, with \n     particular reference to those threats facing a member nation, \n     or several member nations, where the commitment of NATO \n     forces will be ``out of area'' or beyond the borders of NATO \n     member nations.\n       (d) Definition.--For the purpose of this section, the term \n     ``new Strategic Concept of NATO'' means the document approved \n     by the Heads of State and Government participating in the \n     meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., on \n     April 23 and 24, 1999.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that ``In title X \nat the end of subtitle D'' be added to my original amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one of the things that we sometimes confuse \nhere--I know I do--is what is a political obligation and what is a \nconstitutional obligation. I respectfully suggest that there is no \nconstitutional requirement for the President of the United States--this \nPresident or any future President--to submit to the Senate for \nratification, as if it were an amendment to a treaty, a Strategic \nConcept that is a political document. We use the words interchangeably \non this floor. A new commitment or obligation, as I said, does not a \ntreaty make.\n  Our Strategic Concept has always been a political, not legal \ndocument. Before last month's summit, NATO had revised the Strategic \nConcept five times in the past and never once had required the Senate's \nadvice and consent. Doing so now would gravely undermine NATO's \nalliance and our efforts, as well as being a significant overreach in \nterms of our constitutional authority.\n  Let's not be fooled by the fact that the Roberts-Warner amendment \nonly expresses the sense of the Senate. My concern is that unless we \nknow exactly its dimension, it will be read in other NATO capitals as \nmuch more than it is. Just as my friend from Kansas quoted from the \nheadlines and editorials of other newspapers--I might note that they \nwere not governments, but other newspapers--I point out that people in \nother countries can misread actions taken by a country or group of \ncountries. My concern is that in NATO capitals our actions will be \nmisread.\n  The amendment sets out political criteria in point 1; and then in \npoint 2 transforms them into legally binding ones that would require \nthe Senate's advice and consent. This is a clever use of a non \nsequitur.\n  NATO's Strategic Concept has always given political guidance to the \nalliance's members. To that extent, this sixth revision of the \nStrategic Concept imposes commitments. But contrary to the assertions \nmade by my distinguished friend from Kansas, it in no way changes the \nfundamental purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949.\n  We should oppose this amendment for four reasons, but if we are not \ngoing to oppose it now that it has been changed from its original \namendment, we should at least recognize four important points:\n  One, to suggest that--if it were to be suggested--the Strategic \nConcept should be treated as an amendment to the treaty would set a \nterrible precedent and send a horrible signal at a time when we are \nstriving to maintain alliance unity.\n  It would signal our NATO allies that the United States will not \nimplement the new Strategic Concept without formal Senate advice and \nconsent.\n  If we pass this amendment, couldn't the British, French, or Germans \nsay tomorrow that they are going to disregard NATO's operating \nprocedures? Couldn't they say tomorrow that they are no longer going to \nbe bound by their commitment to beef up their military capacity as they \ncommitted to in 1991?\n  Given that NATO's decisions require unanimity, and that all 19 NATO \nmember parliaments might then assert that they would have to ratify \neach and every future change in an operating procedure, we would be \nbuilding in chaos to the alliance. How could we operate under \nthose circumstances?\n\n  The second point I want to make is that we should remember that there \nhave been many other changes in the Strategic Concept, as my friend \nfrom Michigan has pointed out, and they were never considered the \nequivalent of a new international treaty.\n  As I mentioned, before this year, NATO's original 1949 Strategic \nConcept had been revised five other times. Included among those were \nthree fundamental transformations.\n  In 1957, the alliance adopted a new strategy, which would have \nshocked my friend from Kansas. It was called Massive Retaliation. Talk \nabout a commitment--a commitment that was, I might add, totally \nconsistent with the provisions of the treaty. It was an operating \nprocedure.\n  In 1967, NATO abandoned the doctrine of Massive Retaliation in favor \nof the doctrine of Flexible Response. And then, in 1991, to continue to \nmake the treaty relevant operationally, NATO recognized that after the \nend of the Soviet threat, NATO would nonetheless be confronted by a \nseries of new threats to the alliance's security, such as ethnic \nrivalries and territorial disputes. It altered the Strategic Concept \naccordingly.\n  These were dramatic changes to alliance strategy, yet not once did \nthe Senate, notwithstanding the fact it was not asleep, believe it had \nto provide its advice and consent.\n  There was a great deal of discussion about the 1991 Strategic \nConcept. I participated in it, others participated in it, and it \nrevolved around what was the purpose of NATO and how we were \noperationally going to function now that the worry was no longer having \n50 Soviet divisions coming through the Fulda Gap in Germany--a \nrecognition that the territorial integrity of member states was still \nthreatened, and instead of Soviet divisions rolling through the Fulda \nGap with Warsaw Pact allies, there was a different threat, nonetheless \nreal, nonetheless warranting this mutual commitment made to defend the \nterritorial integrity of member states.\n  We discussed it. We debated it. There were those who thought it \ndidn't go far enough. There are those who thought it went too far. But \nit wasn't that we were asleep and didn't pay attention. In fact, maybe \nit was because--and I am not being facetious--my friend was in the \nHouse where they don't deal with treaties, where it is not their \nconstitutional obligation, and where foreign policy is not the thing \nthey spend the bulk of their time on. But we weren't asleep over here. \nIn fact, the current 1999 version of the Strategic Concept is much more \nsimilar to its 1991 predecessor than the 1991 document was to any of \nits predecessors.\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\n  My third point is simple. The revised Strategic Concept does not \nrequire advice and consent because it is not a treaty.\n  The rules under U.S. law on what constitutes a binding international \nagreement are set forth in the Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of \nthe United States, as well as in the State Department regulations \nimplementing the Case-Zablocki Act.\n  Under the Restatement, the key criterion as to whether an \ninternational agreement is legally binding is if the parties intend \nthat it be legally binding and governed by international law. \n(Restatement, Sec. 301(1)).\n  Similarly, the State Department regulations state that the ``parties \nmust intend their undertaking to be legally binding and not merely of \npolitical or personal effect.'' (22 Code of Federal Regulations \nSec. 181.2(a)(1)).\n  Thus, many agreements that are not binding are essentially political \nstatements. There is a moral and political obligation to comply in such \ncases, but not a legal one.\n  The most well-known example of such a political statement is the \nHelsinki Final Act of 1975, negotiated under the Ford administration \nand credited by most of us as the beginning of the end of the Soviet \nUnion, the most significant political act that began to tear the Berlin \nWall down. That was a political statement--commitments we made, but not \nof treaty scope requiring the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The second key criterion is whether an international agreement \ncontains language that clearly and specifically describe the \nobligations that are to be undertaken.\n  An international agreement must have objective criteria for \ndetermining the enforceability of the agreement. (22 C.F.R. \nSec. 181.2(a)(3)).\n  Another criterion is the form of the agreement. That is, a formal \ndocument labeled ``Agreement'' with final clauses about the procedures \nfor entry into force is probably a binding agreement. This is not a \ncentral requirement, but it does provide another indication that an \nagreement is binding. (22 C.F.R. Sec. 181.2(a)(5)).\n  A reading of the Strategic Concept clearly indicates that it is not a \nbinding instrument of which treaties are made.\n  Rather, the Strategic Concept is merely a political statement with \nwhich my colleague from Kansas and others disagree. I respect that. I \nrespect their disagreement with the political commitment that was made. \nBut their political disagreement with a political commitment does not \ncause it to rise to the level of a binding treaty obligation requiring \nthe advice and consent of the Senate, no matter how important each of \nthem may be, no matter how relevant their objectives may be, no matter \nhow enlightened their foreign policy may be.\n  Rather, the Strategic Concept is merely a political statement that \noutlines NATO's military and political strategy for carrying out the \nobligations of the North Atlantic Treaty.\n  Nowhere in the Strategic Concept can you find binding obligations \nupon the members of NATO.\n  For, if that were the case, all of our European allies as of a year \nago, with the exception of Great Britain, would have been in violation \nof their treaty obligations--would have been in violation of their \ntreaty obligations because of the commitments they made to build up--I \nwill not bore the Senate with the details--their military capacity. Yet \nno one here on the floor has risen to suggest over the past several \nyears, even though we have decried their failure to meet their \nobligations, that they have violated their treaty obligations.\n  Instead, the language of the Strategic Concept contains general \nstatements about how NATO will carry out its mission.\n  The most important question, as I stated, is the intent of the \nparties. As the President wrote to the Chairman of the Committee on \nArmed Services on April 14, ``the Strategic Concept will not contain \nnew commitments or obligations for the United States.''\n  Of course, the Strategic Concept creates a political commitment. And \nwe take our political commitments seriously.\n  All member states, the United States included, assume political \nobligations when they take part in the alliance's integrated military \nplanning.\n  That is what target force goals are all about. And, Mr. President, \nthat lies at the heart of burden-sharing, whose importance several of \nus continually stress to our NATO allies.\n  The 1999 Strategic Concept creates a planning framework for NATO to \nact collectively to meet new threats if they arise.\n  So I would summarize the key point in this way: the Strategic Concept \nimposes political obligations to create military capabilities, but it \ndoes not impose legal obligations to use those capabilities.\n  My fourth point is that I understand the concern that NATO's core \nmission--alliance defense--not be altered. It has not been.\n  Our negotiators at last month's NATO summit did exactly what the vast \nmajority of Senators wanted.\n  They consciously incorporated the Senate's concerns that NATO remain \na defensive alliance when they negotiated the revised Strategic \nConcept.\n  The revised Strategic Concept duplicates much of the language \ncontained in the Kyl amendment to the Resolution of Ratification on \nNATO Enlargement.\n  You all remember the Kyl amendment. We were not asleep at the switch. \nWe were not failing to pay attention. We debated at length--my friend \nfrom Virginia, and I, and others--NATO enlargement. It is one of the \nfew areas on which we have disagreed.\n  We debated at length the Kyl amendment. Let me remind my colleagues \nthat the amendment was adopted by the Senate in April of 1998 by a 90-9 \nvote.\n  Rather than reviewing the specifics of the document, because time \ndoes not permit, nor do I think memories have to be refreshed that \nclearly, because everyone remembers, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to enter into the Record a document provided by the Clinton \nadministration that reviews paragraph by paragraph the similarities \nbetween the Kyl amendment and the 1999 Strategic Concept.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          The Kyl Amendment and the Strategic Concept of NATO\n\n(Document drafted for Assistant Secretary of the State Marc Grossman on \n April 29, 1999 and handed out by Secretary Grossman to Members of the \n                         Senate on May 5, 1999)\n\n       Assistant Secretary for European Affairs Marc Grossman in \n     SFRC testimony on April 21: ``During the NATO enlargement \n     debate some 90 Senators led by Senator Kyl passed an \n     amendment laying out clear criteria for NATO's updated \n     Strategic Concept. We heard your message and made the \n     criteria established by Senator Kyl our own.''\n       Language from the Kyl Amendment: ``The Senate understands \n     that the policy of the United States is that the core \n     concepts contained in the 1991 Strategic Concept of NATO, \n     which adapted NATO's strategy to the post-Cold War \n     environment, remain valid today, and that the upcoming \n     revision of that document will reflect the following \n     principles:''\n\n\n               I.

Mr. President, let me also remind my colleagues that \nNATO's decisions require unanimity. I know we all know that. We got \nthat unanimity at a recent Washington summit after long and tough \nnegotiations.\n  By appearing to withhold U.S. support for the revised Strategic \nConcept--and perhaps eventually even blocking its implementation--this \namendment, if misread, would put the alliance in great jeopardy.\n  And that could lead to the collapse of NATO, which I am sure is not \nthe goal of my colleague from Kansas.\n  One final comment. I know that my friend from Kansas is strongly \nopposed to the conduct of the current war in Yugoslavia, and, while \ndisagreeing with him, I respect his views.\n  But, I would remind him and the rest of my colleagues that the 1999 \nrevision of the Strategic Concept is neither the justification for, nor \nthe driving force behind, NATO's bombing campaign or actions in Kosovo.\n  NATO's bombing campaign began a full month before the newest revision \nof the Strategic Concept was approved at the Washington Summit.\n  To sum up, there are no compelling political or legal arguments for \nthe Roberts amendment. in terms of making this concept subject to \ntreaty amendment.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, might I inquire of the distinguished \nacting Presiding Officer how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, be added as an original cosponsor of the Roberts \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, my friend and colleague, 3 minutes of the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Kansas for yielding.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be made a cosponsor of the Roberts \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Doug Flanders \nof my staff have floor privileges during the entire debate on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Roberts \namendment. The reason I do that is I think that the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization, which we refer to as NATO in this debate, is \nsuffering from mission creep. I look at what has happened with the \nStrategic Concept in 1991. I look at the passing of the 1999 new \nStrategic Concept, and I think it becomes clear how mission creep is \nmoving in.\n  In 1991, NATO established a new Strategic Concept which altered the \nconcept dramatically from the original treaty. It allowed for more \nflexibility in the ability to get into a wide range of military \noperations. However, I add that it did maintain in part 4, under \nGuidelines for Defense, entitled ``Principle of Alliance Strategy''--I \nwant to quote specifically from that Strategic Concept.\n\n       The alliance strategy will continue to reflect a number of \n     fundamental principles. The alliance--\n\n  And this is underlined--\n\n       The alliance is purely defensive in purpose. None of its \n     weapons will ever be used except in self defense. And it does \n     not consider itself to be anyone's adversary.\n\n  Then, if we look at the 1999 new Strategic Concept, it still says \nthat their core purpose is the collective defense of NATO members. It \nadds that NATO:\n\n       . . . should contribute to peace and stability in the \n     region.\n\n  But, while a lot of the debate here on the floor has been about what \ndoes the Concept say, the important point I want to make here is what \nis important is what it does not say. In the 1999 new Strategic \nConcept, there is no mention that the alliance will never use its \nweapons except in self-defense. So, in 1991 the new Strategic Concept \nsaid the alliance was purely defensive in purpose. In 1999, there is no \nmention that the alliance will never use its weapons other than in \nself-defense.\n  I think that is a real important distinction. That is why I think it \nis so important we have a debate on the mission of NATO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Kansas for \nthis amendment. I know there are additional speakers--on this side, at \nleast--who desire to speak on it, so I ask unanimous consent both sides \nhave an additional 8 minutes to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will my colleague yield 3 minutes?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am delighted to yield my distinguished colleague and \nfriend 3 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for this amendment. I \nthink this is a very important amendment. I wish we would debate it at \nmuch greater length, because I am afraid, from some of the things I \nhave read, from comments made by the President of the United States, \nthat he is expanding NATO's role, commitment, obligation, frankly, far \nbeyond the treaty we have signed, which has been so successful, the \n50th anniversary of which we commemorated this year.\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\n  I look at the President's statement he made on May 27, 1997. He did \nthis in concert with French President Chirac and Russian President \nYeltsin in France. He stated:\n\n       In turn, we are building a new NATO. It will remain the \n     strongest alliance in history, with smaller, more flexible \n     forces, prepared to provide for our defense, but also trained \n     for peacekeeping.\n\n  He goes on, and I will just read the last sentence:\n\n       It will be an alliance directed no longer against a hostile \n     bloc of nations, but instead designed to advance the security \n     of every democracy in Europe--NATO's old members, new \n     members, and non-members alike.\n\n  A couple of days later he made a speech at the United States Military \nAcademy, a commencement speech at West Point, May 31, 1997:\n\n       To build and secure a new Europe, peaceful, democratic and \n     undivided at last, there must be a new NATO, with new \n     missions, new members and new partners. We have been \n     building that kind of NATO for the last three years with \n     new partners in the Partnership for Peace and NATO's first \n     out-of-area mission in Bosnia. In Paris last week, we took \n     another giant stride forward when Russia entered a new \n     partnership with NATO, choosing cooperation over \n     confrontation, as both sides affirmed that the world is \n     different now. European security is no longer a zero-sum \n     contest between Russia and NATO; but a cherished, common \n     goal.\n\n  Clearly, President Clinton is trying to redefine NATO's mission far \nbeyond a defensive alliance, as our colleague from Kansas pointed out. \nThe purpose in the charter of NATO under article 5 was a defensive \nalliance. Now he is expanding it to include nonmembers. He is including \nout-of-area conflicts. He includes ethnic conflicts or trying to \nresolve ethnic conflicts. I think, clearly, if he is going to do so, he \nneeds to rewrite the NATO charter and submit that as a treaty to the \nSenate for its ratification.\n  So I compliment my colleague for this amendment. I think it is one of \nthe most important amendments we will consider on this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the Roberts amendment, and I thank him \nfor his leadership.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 7 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSessions be added as an original cosponsor of the Roberts amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the distinguished Senator 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for \nbringing forward a very critical amendment. I spent 17 years as a U.S. \nattorney or assistant U.S. attorney, representing the United States in \ncourt. I am looking at the legal implications of this amendment as a \nlawyer for the United States.\n  What we are doing here is very, very historic. This Congress has \nratified a defensive treaty. We are moving into a new world. We are \nlooking at an entirely different approach to life, and the President is \nunilaterally expanding the commitments of this Nation under the guise \nof a new NATO that is involved in new missions, as the Senator from \nOklahoma has just noted; committing us solemnly with the same depth of \ncommitment that we put our lives, our fortunes, and our honor to \npreserve the integrity of democracy against totalitarian communism for \nall of these years.\n  That is what is being asked here. To have that done without full \ndebate and full approval of this Congress is astounding and would \nrepresent a major legal erosion of the powers of the Senate and the \nCongress, particularly the Senate, to review these matters. So I cannot \nexpress too strongly how important it is this Senate reassert its \nhistoric responsibility to advise and consent to involvement in these \nkind of foreign policies.\n  Once the President commits us, we pay for it. Right now this action \nin Kosovo amounts to 19 NATO nations meeting and deciding how to deploy \nthe U.S. Air Force. We are paying for this war in their own backyard, \nand they are voting on how to conduct it. We simply have to get a \nbetter grip on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague whether I could have 10 seconds to \nhave some fellows granted the privilege of the floor? They have been \nwaiting outside. May I do that without taking anybody's time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Certainly.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ben \nHighton, Rachel Gragg, John Bradshaw, and Michelle Vidovic, who are \nfellows, be granted the privilege of the floor for the duration of the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Delaware, the \nSenator from Alabama, and others have been talking about the legal \nramifications of what this amendment is all about. You can study the \nsections and subsections and sub-subsections and quote all of these \nthings, but I think we all know this was an alliance that was set up to \nbe a defensive alliance. Now we are getting into something that is far \nmore than that.\n  But I would put out two things that have not been said. First of all, \nI just came back from the Canada-United States interparliamentarian \nmeeting up there. It is very clear to me they are involved in this, \nwith a very modest contribution, only because we are in there. I wonder \nhow many other of these countries are getting involved because we are \nproviding that leadership.\n  No. 2, my concern about this is not a legalistic concern. It is what \neffect is this having on our state of readiness. I happen to be \nchairman of the Readiness Subcommittee. This is what is very \nfrightening. We can remember in this Chamber in 1994, in 1995, talking \nabout Bosnia; we were going to be sending people over to Bosnia. What \nwas the main argument used? We have to protect the integrity of NATO. \nThen we have the same thing coming up on Kosovo. It has come up in \nother places, too.\n  These are areas where we do not have national strategic interests. \nWhat it has done is to put us in a position where we cannot carry out \nthe minimum expectations of the American people or our national \nmilitary strategy, which is to defend America on two fronts.\n  I want to tell you how proud I was of General Hawley the other day, \nAir Combat Command, who came out and said we, right now, are not in a \nposition to respond if we should be called upon to respond in areas \nwhere we do have a national strategic interest such as North Korea or \nthe Persian Gulf.\n  It is very, very important that we get to the bottom of this and we \nmake a determination as to what our future commitments are going to be \nas far as NATO is concerned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe this debate is taking on \nexcellent participation. I think we can allocate another 10 minutes to \nboth sides--10 minutes under the control of the Senator from Kansas and \n10 minutes under the control of my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I do not plan to \nobject, I wonder if the Chair can inform us as to how much time is \nremaining on both sides under the previous extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost 3 minutes on this side and 8 minutes on \nthe side of the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to protect the rights of the Senator from Minnesota \nwho has been waiting.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, this is an \nimportant debate. I agree with both of the managers. We should go on \nwith the debate. I ask the question whether or not I may bring this \namendment up after the caucuses or speak for a while but then have some \ntime later.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I can address that and make a suggestion. \nOn this side, we are prepared to accept the third amendment. I suggest \nperhaps at the hour of 12:25, the distinguished ranking member and I \nand Mr. Wellstone can address the three amendments and conclude them \nbefore the caucus. Will that be convenient?\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I thank him for two of the \namendments. I am committed to having a rollcall vote on the welfare \ntracking amendment, so that would not work out for me. I am pleased to \ngo on with this debate, and I will come back later.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is the first time we have known of \nthe Senator's desire to have a rollcall vote on the third amendment. We \nare prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Virginia, I \nappreciate working with him on the other amendments. I have been down \nthis path before with voice votes and then it is out in conference. I \nam committed to having a debate and vote on this. I am sorry my \ncolleague is surprised by this. I am more than willing to wait. I think \nthis debate is very important. I will come back later and do this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want the opportunity to consult with the \nchairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over the subject matter \nof the third amendment and with the majority leader and presumably the \nminority leader, and set a time for the rollcall vote, which the \nSenator is entitled to have. For the moment, we are prepared to accept \nthe two amendments and then allow the debate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time is set for \nthe Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. On the two amendments from Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the chairman will yield, may I make a \nsuggestion that after we conclude the debate on the pending amendment, \nwe immediately proceed to the first of the two Wellstone amendments, \naccept those before lunch, and then determine at that time whether to \nconclude the debate on the third. In any event, the rollcall vote on \nthe third amendment will have to come after lunch under the existing \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, basically how much additional \ntime to the time we have left has the Senator asked for? I am not sure \nthere are any more Members who want to speak on the minority side. I \ncan wrap up in 5 minutes or less. I am adding cosponsors every minute, \nso I am happy to stay here for a while.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the purpose of the party caucuses, we \nhope to complete all debate on the underlying amendment circa 12:30, \nwhich is roughly a half hour. I wish to speak a few more minutes on the \namendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, as does the ranking \nmember.\n  My suggestion is, if possible, while Senator Wellstone is on the \nfloor, do the voice voting of his two amendments, reserving, of course, \nscheduling the third, and then we can continue with this debate. It \nwill not take but a minute on the two voice votes on the two Wellstone \namendments.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have no problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. We have not put it in the form of a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I apologize. I was in a discussion with \nthe staff on the majority side. What are we talking about here?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the suggestion was we immediately take up \nthe two Wellstone amendments that we are going to voice vote, then go \nback to the Roberts amendment, and then come back to the third \namendment afterwards.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That will be fine with me.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 381, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first, on amendment No. 381, I send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 83, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 329. PROVISION OF INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE TO THE PUBLIC \n                   REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT U.S. \n                   MILITARY INSTALLATIONS FORMERLY OPERATED BY THE \n                   UNITED STATES THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED.\n\n       (a)(1) Requirement To Provide Information and Guidance.--\n     The Secretary of Defense shall publicly disclose existing, \n     available information relevant to a foreign nation's \n     determination of the nature and extent of environmental \n     contamination, if any, at a site in that foreign nation where \n     the United States operated a military base, installation, and \n     facility that has been closed as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (2) Congressional list.--Not later than September 30, 2000, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall provide Congress a list of \n     information made public pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (b) Limitation.--The requirement to provide information and \n     guidance under subsection (a) may not be construed to \n     establish on the part of the United States any liability or \n     obligation for the costs of environmental restoration or \n     remediation at any site referred to in subsection (a).\n       (c) National Security.--Information the Secretary of \n     Defense believes could adversely affect U.S. National \n     Security shall not be released pursuant to this provision.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take a very brief period of time \non each amendment. Basically what this amendment says is:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall publicly disclose existing, \n     available information relative to a foreign nation's \n     determination of the nature and extent of environmental \n     contamination, if any, at a site in that foreign nation where \n     the United States operated a military base, installation, and \n     facility that has been closed as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  I thank both colleagues, and I really hope these amendments will be \nsupported in conference committee.\n  To make a long story short, when we leave a country, close our base, \nquite often what happens is that there is some environmental \ncontamination. We want to make sure those countries have access to \ninformation as to the extent of what chemicals or substances are there \nwhich might pose a danger to their citizens.\n  It is a very reasonable amendment. It is important for our foreign \nrelations with these countries. I believe it has strong bipartisan \nsupport. I thank Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their support and \nmake the request--I think both Senators will do this--that this be kept \nin conference committee. That is why I do not need a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I seek clarification of our colleague from Minnesota, \non his third amendment: What number does he designate this being? He \njust mentioned he wanted to send an amendment--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thought we were going to do two amendments right \nnow: One is on environmental impact when we close bases, and the second \namendment is on atomic vets, both of which the Senator is prepared to \naccept.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The third amendment, No. 382, deals with tracking, \nreporting on what is actually happening in the country right now with \nwelfare reform.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am familiar with that, and the Senator \nfirst wishes to amend the text of No. 382?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No; I just did--\n  Mr. WARNER. You just did it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I modified amendment No. 381.\n  Mr. WARNER. Addressing No. 382, what amount of time will the Senator \nrequire for debate on No. 382?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The UC provides for an hour equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. And does the Senator wish to adhere to that previous \norder?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, yes, I have been trying to get \nthis amendment on the floor for some time. I am talking to a good \nfriend, my friend from Virginia, as I make my case. I believe my friend \nfrom Virginia will agree that this is well worth the focus on the part \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am only addressing procedure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. One hour equally divided is the UC.\n  Mr. WARNER. We would like to complete that amendment by 1 o'clock. \nWill the Senator reduce his amount of time? In all likelihood, we will \nyield back the half hour reserved for us, because there is not likely \nto be any opposition.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am delighted if there is not any \nopposition. If the Senator is going to yield back his time, clearly--I \ndo need to go to the caucus, but I would rather not yield back time. I \nwill try to shorten\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\nmy presentation. If there is not a response, so be it; we will get a \nstrong vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the convenience of the Senate, does the Senator think \nhe can give us any estimate as to how he can shorten it from a half \nhour down to, say, 10 or 12 minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am not going to shorten this \namendment to 10 or 12 minutes in any way, shape or form, because it is \ntoo important to have a chance to talk about what is happening to these \nwomen and children and make sure that we track what is happening.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am just seeking to try to accommodate the Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We should stay with the UC agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Beg your pardon?\n  I have to address the Chair. There is a UC requirement of the \nexpenditure of that time prior to the normal weekly recess today at \n12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is the dilemma that the Senator from Virginia, the \nmanager of the bill has, in that, as drawn, the UC of last night \nrequires it to be completed prior to 12:30. So now let's figure out how \nwe accommodate the Senate. Perhaps we can move your amendment to some \npoint this afternoon, that is, amendment No. 3, when the Senator could \navail himself of the full 30 minutes, if he so desires.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would be more than willing --if \nseveral of my colleagues want to speak on the very important amendment \nthat Senator Roberts has offered, I would be willing to bring my \namendment up right after the caucuses and go to it right then.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may say, Mr. President, right after our caucuses are \nvotes on other amendments, including Senator Roberts' amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. After we have those votes then I would bring the \namendment up.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will need to check other commitments we made with \nregard to time. I will work on it and come back in a minute or two and \nclarify this.\n  In the meantime, if we can proceed with the Roberts amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 377, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I inquire, after all that, how much time \ndo we have remaining on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes on the Senator's side; 8 minutes \non the other side.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. But was there a request by unanimous consent that either \nparty wanted some additional time? The minority has 8 minutes \nremaining; is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Does the chairman want to speak on this? Is that \ncorrect? You wish to speak on the Roberts amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct, for about 3 minutes, in support.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I can get my remarks done in 5, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that we add 8 minutes, along with the other 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBingaman of New Mexico be added as a cosponsor of the Roberts \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the distinguished chairman--what was the \nrequest, Mr. Chairman, 3 minutes, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would suggest that we try to conclude the Roberts \namendment in 5 or 10 minutes. Then we will proceed to the Wellstone \namendment, and then we can adhere to the time agreements.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask the distinguished chairman, how much time would \nthe distinguished chairman like?\n  Mr. WARNER. Just 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the distinguished Senator 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to address the document that was \nsubmitted to the Senate by the Senator from Delaware entitled: The Kyl \nAmendment and the Strategic Concept of NATO. I went back and asked the \nSenator from Delaware to clarify the date, time, group, and when it was \nprepared and submitted to the Senate. He is doing that.\n  But I just wish to draw the attention to the Senate, as I read this \ndocument--and I have seen it before--it simply refers to those portions \nin the Kyl amendment that were incorporated into the final draft of the \nStrategic Concept. But it does not, on its face, nor do I believe it \nwas intended to, say that it covered everything by the new Strategic \nConcept.\n  Indeed, I agree with the Senator from Kansas this document in no way \nis intended to represent that it encompasses all of the new Strategic \nConcept. The Senator from Kansas is quite properly pointing out there \nare those of us--the Senator from Kansas, myself, and others--who feel \nthe Strategic Concept went beyond the Kyl amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Might I inquire of my distinguished friend from Michigan \nif he, the minority, seeks any additional time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are just using about 3 of our 8 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy if the Senator would like to proceed at \nthis time. I would like to close, if that is all right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support this amendment for the reasons \npreviously given. It does not reach any conclusion as to whether there \nare any additional obligations upon the United States. Unlike earlier \nversions, it simply asks the President to certify whether or not there \nare additional obligations imposed on the United States.\n  I have read from what was called then the new Strategic Concept of \nNATO in 1991. At the heading of that Concept, it was stated that:\n\n       The alliance recognizes that developments taking place in \n     Europe would have a far-reaching impact on the way in which \n     its aims would be met in the future.\n\n  And, indeed, adopted language such as:\n\n       Alliance security must also take into account the global \n     context. Alliance security interests can be affected by other \n     risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons \n     of mass destruction, disruption of flow of vital resources, \n     actions of terrorism and sabotage.\n\n  That did not impose any new obligations. It is very broad language.\n  Listen to some of this language in this 1991 alliance new Strategic \nConcept:\n\n       The primary role of the alliance military forces to \n     guarantee security and territorial integrity of member states \n     remains unchanged [we said in 1991]. But this role must take \n     account of the new strategic environment in which a single \n     massive and global threat has given way to diverse and \n     multidirectional risks. Allied forces have different \n     functions to perform in peace, crises, and war.\n\n  That is section 40 in 1991.\n  How about this one, section 41:\n\n       Allies could be called upon to contribute to global \n     stability and peace by providing forces for United Nations \n     missions.\n\n  How about that for a mission in 1991? Did that impose an obligation \non us, legal obligation on this body, or on this Nation? Boy, I hope \nnot. Not in my book it did not.\n\n       Allies could be called upon to contribute to global \n     stability and peace by providing forces for United Nations \n     missions.\n\n  This was adopted in 1991 as a new Strategic Concept. That did not \nimpose a thing on us. It was a new Strategic Concept adopted by NATO, \nnot a legally binding commitment on the alliance.\n  It was not submitted to us then as a treaty change because it was not \na treaty change, nor is this new Strategic Concept of 1999 legally \nbinding upon us any more than the 1991 Strategic Concept was.\n  So I think we ought to adopt this amendment. It is something which is \nhighly appropriate to ask the President whether or not the new \nStrategic Concept of NATO imposes any new commitment or obligation on \nthe United States, the key word there to me being ``imposes.''\n  I ask, Mr. President, before I yield the floor, that the yeas and \nnays be ordered on this amendment.\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privileges \nof the floor be granted to the following Pearson Fellow on the staff of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Joan Wadelton, during the pendency of \nthe Department of Defense Authorization legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Again, I will be supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. With the debate we have had on the floor, although there \nis support--and the better part of judgment would be for me to simply \nyield the floor--we will try to split the shingle one more time. The \ndebate is centered around whether or not the new Strategic Concept \nadopted at the 50th anniversary of NATO is legally binding, a treaty, \nor different from the 1991 Concept, let alone the 1949 Concept.\n  Let me just say that the 1991 document really stressed that--as a \nmatter of fact, it assured--no NATO weaponry will ever be used \noffensively. We are sure doing that now in regard to Kosovo. In \naddition, in terms of the 19 parties who met in Washington, I am sure \nthat each one of them certainly thought it was binding. And if the men \nand women in the uniform of all our allies do not think it is binding, \nI think they had better look for a new definition.\n\n  I believe any document that contains even tacit commitment by the \nUnited States and other nations to engage in new types of NATO \nmissions--and let me simply say that these missions are now described \nas problems with drugs, problems with social progress, with reform, \nwith ethnic strife; about the only thing that is not in there is don't \nput gum in the water fountain--outside the domain of the original \ntreaty, as well as a commitment to structure military forces \naccordingly, can be considered an international agreement.\n  I refer again to the U.S. Department of State Circular 175, the \nProcedure on Treaties, that sets forth eight considerations available \nfor determining whether or not an agreement or an accord should be \nsubmitted to the Senate for ratification. Four of them I will repeat \nagain: The extent to which the agreement involves commitments or risks \naffecting the Nation as a whole--if Kosovo is not a risk, I do not know \nwhat is--whether the agreement can be given effect without the \nenactment of subsequent legislation by the Congress; past U.S. \npractices as to similar agreements; the preference of Congress as to a \nparticular type of agreement.\n  It seems to me, if I recall the debate and the two copies of the \noriginal 1949 document, and then the Strategic Concept document, No. 1, \nthey said no offensive weapons. No. 2, they said we are going to stay \nwithin our borders and we will meet with you before we go outside the \nborders and go wandering in the territory of a sovereign nation. Then \nlastly, we are going to consult with the U.N. It is going to be in \ncooperation with the U.N. All that is different.\n  I think to say that it is not different in regard to 1991 is simply \nnot accurate.\n  I don't know. I suppose per se, legally--I am not a lawyer--that this \nStrategic Concept is not a treaty. But it sure walks like a treaty duck \nand it quacks like a treaty duck and it is wandering into different \nareas like a treaty duck. In the quacking and the walking, it is \ncausing a lot of problems.\n  I simply say, in closing, I do respect the Senator from Michigan and \nhis support and the Senator from Delaware for his accommodating my \namendment. It is true that the Senator from Delaware said that I was in \nthe House of Representatives, the other body, what Senator Byrd refers \nto as the lower body. In 1990 we were not asleep. We were not asleep at \nall. We admired the Senator from Delaware from afar. We were \nspellbound, as a matter of fact, by his oratorical skills, his \nsartorial splendor, and his ability to be heard above all in the \nSenate, regardless of whether the acoustical system was working or not. \nSo I thank the Senator from Delaware for his comments.\n  I urge Senators to support this amendment and send a strong message \nthat we are adhering to our constitutional right when we change an \nagreement that in effect directly affects the lives of our American men \nand women and our national security, that the Senate stepped up to the \nplate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. Under the \nprevious order, the Roberts-Warner amendment No. 377 will be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the vote will occur, Mr. President, if you continue \nto read the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur after the Roth amendment \nat 2:15.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are ready to receive the comments under the \nstanding order for the day from our distinguished colleague from \nMinnesota. These comments will be relative to what I call the third \namendment, No. 382. Perhaps we could take this time to vote the first \ntwo by voice.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, besides the environmental assessment \namendment, the second amendment we are taking deals with atomic vets--\nis that correct--compensation for atomic vets? I am pleased to do so, \nand I thank both my colleagues for their help and comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are happy to be of accommodation. Would the Senator \nurge the adoption of the two amendments?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I urge the adoption of the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the two amendments are \nagreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. These are amendments Nos. 380 and 383?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendments 380 and 381.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry, 380 and 381.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As modified.\n  The amendments (No. 380 and No. 381), as modified, were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 380\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I \noffered that would remove some of the frustrating and infuriating \nobstacles that have too often kept veterans who were exposed to \nradiation during military service from getting the disability \ncompensation they deserve. This amendment would add three radiogenic \nconditions to the list of presumptively service-connected diseases for \nwhich atomic veterans may receive VA compensation, specifically: lung \ncancer; colon cancer; and tumors of the brain and central nervous \nsystem. It is based on a bill I introduced during the last Congress, S. \n1385, the Justice for Atomic Veterans Act.\n  At the outset, let me say that this amendment was accepted and \nadopted by the Senate just a few months ago as a part of S. 4, the \nSoldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. \nBecause that bill appears to be dead on arrival in the House, I am \noffering it on the Defense Authorization bill. I think this amendment \nwas relevant to S. 4 and it is certainly relevant to this bill. But I \nmention the history of this amendment to my colleagues in the belief \nthat what was acceptable to the Senate three months ago will be \nacceptable today.\n  I want to explain why this amendment is topical to the Defense \nAuthorization bill. I believe that the way we treat our veterans does \nsend an important message to young people considering service in the \nmilitary. When veterans of the Persian Gulf War don't get the kind of \ntreatment they deserve, when the VA health care budget loses out year \nafter year to other budget priorities, when veterans benefits claims \ntake years and years to resolve, what is the message we are sending to \nfuture recruits?\n  How can we attract and retain young people in the service when our \ngovernment fails to honor its obligation to provide just compensation \nand health care for those injured during service?\n  One of the most outrageous examples of our government's failure to \nhonor its obligations to veterans involves\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\n``atomic veterans,'' patriotic Americans who were exposed to radiation \nat Hiroshima and Nagasaki and at atmospheric nuclear tests.\n  For more than 50 years, many of them have been denied compensation \nfor diseases that the VA recognizes as being linked to their exposure \nto radiation--diseases known as radiogenic diseases. Many of these \ndiseases are lethal forms of cancers.\n  I received my first introduction to the plight of atomic veterans \nfrom some first-rate mentors, the members of the Forgotten 216th. The \nForgotten 216th was the 216th Chemical Service Company of the U.S. \nArmy, which participated in Operation Tumbler Snapper. Operation \nTumbler Snapper was a series of eight atmospheric nuclear weapons tests \nin the Nevada desert in 1952.\n  About half of the members of the 216th were Minnesotans. What I've \nlearned from them, from other atomic veterans, and from their survivors \nhas shaped my views on this issue.\n  Five years ago, the Forgotten 216th contacted me after then-Secretary \nof Energy O'Leary announced that the U.S. Government had conducted \nradiation experiments on its own citizens. For the first time in \npublic, they revealed what went on during the Nevada tests and the \ntragedies and trauma that they, their families, and their former \nbuddies had experienced since then.\n  Because their experiences and problems typify those of atomic \nveterans nationwide, I'd like to tell my colleagues a little more about \nthe Forgotten 216th. When you hear their story, I think you have to \nagree that the Forgotten 216th and other veterans like them must never \nbe forgotten again.\n  Members of the 216th were sent to measure fallout at or near ground \nzero immediately after a nuclear blast. They were exposed to so much \nradiation that their Geiger counters went off the scale while they \ninhaled and ingested radioactive particles. They were given minimal or \nno protection. They frequently had no film badges to measure radiation \nexposure. They were given no information on the perils they faced.\n  Then they were sworn to secrecy about their participation in nuclear \ntests. They were often denied access to their own service medical \nrecords. And they were provided no medical follow-up.\n  For decades, atomic veterans have been America's most neglected \nveterans. They have been deceived and treated shabbily by the \ngovernment they served so selflessly and unquestioningly.\n  If the U.S. Government can't be counted on to honor its obligation to \nthese deserving veterans, how can young people interested in military \nservice have any confidence that their government will do any better by \nthem?\n  I believe the neglect of atomic veterans should stop here and now. \nOur government has a long overdue debt to these patriotic Americans, a \ndebt that we in the Senate must help to repay. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to help repay this debt by supporting this \namendment.\n  My legislation and this amendment have enjoyed the strong support of \nveterans service organizations. Recently, the Independent Budget for FY \n2000, which is a budget recommendation issued by AMVETS, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans (DAV), Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), and the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), endorsed adding these radiogenic \ndiseases to VA's presumptive service-connected list.\n  Let me briefly describe the problem that my amendment is intended to \naddress. When atomic veterans try to claim VA compensation for their \nillnesses, VA almost invariably denies their claims. VA tells these \nveterans that their radiation doses were too low--below 5 rems.\n  But the fact is, we don't really know that and, even if we did, \nthat's no excuse for denying these claims. The result of this \nunrealistic standard is that it is almost impossible for these atomic \nveterans to prove their case. The only solution is to add these \nconditions to the VA presumptive service-connected list, and that's \nwhat my amendment does.\n  First of all, trying to go back and determine the precise dosage each \nof these veterans was exposed to is a futile undertaking. Scientists \nagree that the dose reconstruction performed for the VA is notoriously \nunreliable.\n  GAO itself has noted the inherent uncertainties of dose \nreconstruction. Even VA scientific personnel have conceded its \nunreliability. In a memo to VA Secretary Togo West, Under Secretary for \nHealth Kenneth Kizer has recommended that the VA reconsider its \nopposition to S. 1385 based, in part, on the unreliability of dose \nreconstruction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Dr. Kizer's \nmemo be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In addition, none of the scientific experts who \ntestified at a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing on S. 1385 on \nApril 21, 1998, supported the use of dose reconstruction to determine \neligibility for VA benefits.\n  Let me explain why dose reconstruction is so difficult. Dr. Marty \nGensler on my staff has researched this issue for over five years, and \nthis is what he has found.\n  Many atomic veterans were sent to ground zero immediately after a \nnuclear test with no protection, no information on the known dangers \nthey faced, no badges or other monitoring equipment, and no medical \nfollowup.\n  As early as 1946, ranking military and civilian personnel responsible \nfor nuclear testing anticipated claims for service-connected disability \nand sought to ensure that ``no successful suits could be brought on \naccount of radiological hazards.'' That quotation comes from documents \ndeclassified by the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation \nExperiments.\n  The VA, during this period, maintained classified records \n``essential'' to evaluating atomic veterans' claims, but these records \nwere unavailable to veterans themselves.\n  Atomic veterans were sworn to secrecy and were denied access to their \nown service and medical records for many years, effectively barring \npursuit of compensation claims.\n  It's partly as a result of these missing or incomplete records that \nso many people have doubts abut the validity of dose reconstructions \nfor atomic veterans, some of which are performed more than fifty years \nafter exposure.\n  Even if these veterans' exposure was less than 5 rems, which is the \nstandard used by VA, this standard is not based on uncontested science. \nIn 1994, for example, GAO stated: ``A low level dose has been estimated \nto be somewhere below 10 rems [but] it is not known for certain whether \ndoses below this level are detrimental to public health.''\n  Despite persistent doubts about VA's and DoD's dose reconstruction, \nand despite doubts about the science on which VA's 5 rem standard is \nbased, these dose reconstructions are used to bar veterans from \ncompensation for disabling radiogenic conditions.\n\n  The effects of this standard have been devastating. A little over two \nyears ago the VA estimated that less than 50 claims for non-presumptive \ndiseases had been approved out of over 18,000 radiation claims filed.\n  Atomic veterans might as well not even bother. Their chances of \nobtaining compensation are negligible.\n  It is impossible for many atomic veterans and their survivors to be \ngiven ``the benefit of the doubt'' by the VA while their claims hinge \non the dubious accuracy and reliability of dose reconstruction and the \nhealth effects of exposure to low-level ionizing radiation remain \nuncertain.\n  This problem can be fixed. The reason atomic veterans have to go \nthrough this reconstruction at all is that the diseases listed in my \namendment are not presumed to be service-connected. That's the real \nproblem.\n  VA already has a list of service-connected diseases that are presumed \nservice-connected, but these are not on it.\n  This makes no sense. Scientists agree that there is at least as \nstrong a link between radiation exposure and these diseases as there is \nto the other diseases on that VA list.\n  You might ask why I've included these three diseases in particular--\nlung cancer; colon cancer; and tumors of the brain and central nervous \nsystem--in my amendment. The reason is very simple. The best, most \ncurrent, scientific evidence available justifies\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\ntheir inclusion. A paper entitled ``Risk Estimates for Radiation \nExposure'' by John D. Boice, Jr. of the National Cancer Institute, \npublished in 1996 as part of a larger work called Health Effects of \nExposure to Low-Level Ionizing Radiation, includes a table which rates \nhuman cancers by the strength of the evidence linking them to exposure \nto low levels of ionizing radiation. According to this study, the \nevidence of a link for lung cancer is ``very strong''--the highest \nlevel of confidence--and the evidence of a link for colon and brain and \ncentral nervous system cancers is ``convincing''--the next highest \nlevel of confidence. So I believe I can say with a great deal of \ncertainty, Mr. President, that science is on the side of this \namendment. And I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the table I just \nmentioned be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Last year, the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee reported out a \nversion of S. 1385, the Justice for Atomic Veterans Act, which included \nthree diseases to be added to the VAs presumptive list. Two of those \ndiseases, lung cancer and brain and central nervous system cancer, I \nhave included in my amendment. The third disease included in the \nreported bill was ovarian cancer. Mr. President, I'd like to explain \nwhy I substituted colon cancer for ovarian cancer. It is true that the \n1996 study I just cited states that the evidence of a linkage for \novarian cancer to low level ionizing radiation is ``convincing,'' just \nas it is for colon cancer. But Mr. President, there are no female \natomic veterans. The effect of creating a presumption of \nservice connection for ovarian cancer is basically no effect--because \nno one could take advantage of it. However, the impact of adding colon \ncancer as a presumption for atomic veterans is significant; atomic \nveterans will be able to take advantage of that presumption.\n\n  The President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \nagreed in 1995 that VA's current list should be expanded. The Committee \ncited concerns that ``the listing of diseases for which relief is \nautomatically provided--the presumptive diseases provided for by the \n1988 law--is incomplete and inadequate'' and that ``the standard of \nproof for those without presumptive disease is impossible to meet and, \ngiven the questionable condition of the exposure records retained by \nthe government, inappropriate.'' The President's Advisory Committee \nurged Congress to address the concerns of atomic veterans and their \nfamilies ``promptly.''\n  The unfair treatment of atomic veterans becomes especially clear when \ncompared to both Agent Orange and Persian Gulf veterans. In \nrecommending that the Administration support S. 1385, Under Secretary \nfor Health Kenneth Kizer cited the indefensibility of denying \npresumptive service connection for atomic veterans in light of the \npresumption for Persian Gulf War veterans and Agent Orange veterans.\n  In 1993, the VA decided to make lung cancer presumptively service-\nconnected for Agent Orange veterans. That decision was based on a \nNational Academy of Sciences study that had found a link only where \nAgent Orange exposures were ``high and prolonged,'' but pointed out \nthere was only a ``limited'' capability to determine individual \nexposures.\n  For atomic veterans, however, lung cancer continues to be non-\npresumptive. In short, the issue of exposure levels poses an almost \ninsurmountable obstacle to approval of claims by atomic veterans, while \nthe same problem is ignored for Agent orange veterans.\n  Persian Gulf War veterans can receive compensation for symptoms or \nillnesses that may be linked to their service in the Persian Gulf, at \nleast until scientists reach definitive conclusions about the etiology \nof their health problems. Unfortunately, atomic veterans aren't given \nthe same consideration or benefit of the doubt.\n  I believe this state of affairs is outrageous and unjust. The \nstruggle of atomic veterans for justice has been long, hard, and \nfrustrating. But these patriotic, dedicated and deserving veterans have \npersevered. My amendment would finally provide them the justice that \nthey so much deserve.\n  Let me say this in closing. As I have worked with veterans and \nmilitary personnel during my time in the Senate, I have seen a \ntroubling erosion of the Federal Government's credibility with current \nand former service members. No salary is high enough, no pension big \nenough to compensate our troops for the dangers they endure while \ndefending our country. Such heroism stems from love for America's \nsacred ideals of freedom and democracy and the belief that the nation's \ngratitude is not limited by fiscal convenience but reflects a debt of \nhonor.\n  This is one of those issues which test our faith in our government. \nBut the Senate can take an important step in righting this injustice. I \nurge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in helping \natomic veterans win their struggle by supporting my amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                                   April 21, 1998.\n     From: Under Secretary for Health (10).\n     Subject: Request for Reconsideration of the Department's \n         Position on S. 1385 (Wellstone).\n     To: Secretary (00).\n       1. I request that you reconsider the Department's position \n     on S. 1385 (Wellstone), which would add a number of \n     conditions as presumptive service-connected conditions for \n     atomic veterans to those already prescribed by law. I only \n     learned that the Department was opposing this measure last \n     night on reading the Department's prepared testimony for \n     today's hearing; I had no input into that testimony. Indeed, \n     my views on this bill have not been obtained. I would \n     strongly support this bill as a matter of equity and \n     fairness.\n       2. I do not think the Department's current opposition to S. \n     1385 is defensible in view of the Administration's position \n     on presumed service-connection for Gulf War veterans, as well \n     as its position on Agency Orange and Vietnam veterans.\n       3. While the scientific methodology that is the basis for \n     adjudicating radiation exposure cases may be sound, the \n     problem is that the exposure cannot be reliably determined \n     for many individuals, and it never will be able to be \n     determined in my judgment. Thus, no matter how good the \n     method is, if the input is not valid then the determination \n     will be suspect.\n       4. I ask that we formally reconsider and change the \n     Department's position on S. 1385. I feel the proper and \n     prudent position for the Department is to support S. 1385.\n     Kenneth W.

Mr. President, my amendment, amendment 381, entitled \n``Provision of Information and Guidance to the Public Regarding \nEnvironmental Contamination at U.S. Military Installations Formerly \nOperated by the United States that Have Been Closed,'' is a simple, \nstraightforward amendment, but one which can potentially go a long way \ntoward ensuring that the United States leaves a positive environmental \nlegacy behind when we withdraw from military bases overseas. As we have \nwithdrawn from our bases around the world, the U.S. military has taken \nsome steps to clean-up contamination at those bases before leaving. But \nthere are still many convincing reports that contamination has been \nleft behind. As the New York Times noted last December in an editorial, \n``Fuels, lubricants, cleaning fluids and other chemicals are leaching \ninto groundwater, and unexploded shells linger on testing grounds long \nafter American soldiers leave.'' This is especially true in the \nPhilippines, where we withdrew from Subic Bay and Clark Air Base, in \n1992. And it will soon apply to Panama where will finish our withdrawal \nat the end of 1999.\n  I understand very well that the Pentagon has no legal obligations \nunder our treaties with these countries to pay for a clean-up of \nenvironmental contamination. And I am not calling for any funding for \nsuch a clean-up. What this amendment requires the Pentagon to do is \nsimply to provide as much information as possible and to cooperate in \ninterpreting that information so that nations such as the Philippines \ncan complete environmental\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\nstudies to tell them exactly what has been left behind.\n  So far the Pentagon has turned over substantial information to the \nPhilippine government, but it has done so slowly and grudgingly. We \nneed to be more forthcoming to help the Filipinos deal with this issue \nbefore the contamination in the Subic and Clark areas causes further \nhealth problems.\n  This amendment is intended to protect the legacy of the U.S. in those \ncountries where we maintained bases. It does not look at the \nenvironmental issue as a legal issue but as a moral one. At a time when \nanti-Americanism may be growing in certain parts of the world we need \nto ensure that in those countries that are our longtime allies, we do \nwhat we can to promote a positive image of the U.S. even after we leave \nour bases.\n  We will continue to have close military and political relations with \ncountries such as the Philippines and Panama and we should not let this \nenvironmental issue fester and become an impediment to good relations.\n  The amendment as modified applies only to bases already closed. \nInitially I had intended to extend it to bases which would be closing \nin the future, which would include our facilities in Panama. However, \nsince I understand that sensitive negotiations are underway on this \nvery issue between the U.S. and Panama and I did not want this \namendment to in any way interfere with the successful conclusion of \nthose negotiations. But I want the record to show that I believe that \nwe should be very forthcoming in releasing information on environmental \nconditions at our facilities in Panama as we close them. I would like \nto see the Pentagon avoid the long delays in providing information \nwhich we have seen in the Philippine case by following the spirit of \nthis amendment. Of course, if we see a similar problem in the case of \nPanama we may have to revisit this issue next year and propose a \nsimilar provision to require the Department of Defense to make \ninformation available publicly.\n  If we assist our strategic partners in their efforts to complete \nenvironmental baseline studies, it is quite likely that any clean-up \nwhich occurs down the road will be done by American companies, who are \nthe leaders in this field. Without the information and the necessary \nstudies these countries are unable to identify the scope of the problem \nand begin to move toward some type of amelioration. Once the studies \nare in hand they may be able to approach international lenders, such as \nthe World Bank, for funding and subsequently some clean-up contracts \nmay go to U.S. companies.\n  Mr. President, when we close our bases and leave behind environmental \ncontamination, the people who suffer from the contamination are almost \nalways people already living in poverty and already struggling to \nmaintain good health. They do not also need to contend with a toxic \nlegacy left by the U.S. military. Just to highlight one of the most \ndisturbing cases, I want to discuss the situation in the Philippines \nand especially at the site of the former Clark Air Base.\n  According to a recent report in the Philippine Star Newspaper, a \nforensic expert at the Commission of Human Rights (CHR) identified 29 \npersons who were living at volcano evacuation centers who were found to \nbe suffering from various ailments attributed to mercury and nitrate \nelements left by the Americans when they abandoned their air base at \nClark in 1991.\n  ``The clinical manifestation exhibited by the patients were \nconsistent with chemical exposure,'' the report said. It noted that 13 \nchildren aged one to seven ``manifested signs and symptoms of birth \ndefects and neurological disorders,'' adding that ``four females \nsuffered spontaneous abortions and still births.''\n  ``These can be attributed to mercury exposure,'' the report said. It \nalso reported ``central nervous system disorders, Kidney disorder and \ncyanosis'' among the persons at evacuation center at Clark, ailments he \nsaid can be traced to nitrates exposure.''\n  Earlier, the CHR forensic office staff collected water samples from \nthe deep wells at the evacuation center in Clark and the Madapdap \nresettlement site for volcano victims in Mabalacat, Pampanga.\n  The samples were later brought to the metals lab of the Environmental \nManagement Bureau (EMB) for analysis. In a report dated April 16, the \nEMB found 200 milligrams of mercury per liter of water and from 386 to \n27 mg of nitrate per liter of water in the Clark area.\n  ``These two chemicals, together with coliform for bacteria were found \nto be present in water in values exceeding the standard set by the \nWHO,'' the report said.\n  The report recommended the immediate removal of the residents at \nClark, and the thorough diagnosis and treatment of the patients.''\n  Among the victims identified in the report were Edmarie Rose Escoto, \n5; Kelvin, 7; Martha Rose Pabalan, 4; 8-month-old Alexander; Sara \nTolentino, and Abraham Taruc, who all had deformities to their lower \nlimbs and cannot walk.\n  Rowell Borja, 5, and Sheila Pineda, 3, both had congenital heart \nailments. Skin disorders were also found prevalent in other children, \nwhile cysts and kidney disorders were observed in adults.\n  The People's Task Force for Bases Cleanup (PTFBC) has pointed out \nthat ``there is more than enough preliminary evidence of the toxic \nwaste problem at the former U.S. bases in the Philippines.''\n  Among the documents that have confirmed the presence of toxic wastes \nat the former bases are pamphlets from the U.S. Department of Defense \nentitled ``Environmental Review of the Drawdown Activities at Clark \nAirbase'' (September 1991) and ``Potential Restoration sites on Board \nthe U.S. Facility, Subic Bay.'' (October 1992).\n  The PTFBC also cited 2 reports of the U.S. Government Accounting \nOffice titled ``Military Base Closure, U.S. Financial Obligations at \nthe Philippines'' (Oct. 1992) as well as an independent report of the \nWHO on May 9, 1992.\n  Mr. President, I recently received a letter from the Philippine Study \nGroup of Minnesota expressing their concerns about the environmental \ncontamination left by the U.S. military at the former Clark Air Base. \nThey reported the results of a trip to the Philippines by two young \nFilipina-American women, Christina Leano and Amy Toledo, who have been \nworking with the affected populations near Clark field and have been \nmeeting with my staff in Minnesota and here in Washington.\n  When these two young women returned from the Philippines, they \ncommunicated the concern of the Filipino people about the problems of \ntoxic waste remaining at both Clark and Subic. The problems are of \nsufficient concern to municipal governments near Clark that they tried \nto develop systems to deliver alternative water sources to the affected \npopulations. However, they do not have the necessary resources. They \nsaid that the concerns of the people near Clark have been front page \nnews in the Philippines and Philippine Senator Loren Legarda will soon \nhold hearings in this issue. The Philippine Study Group of Minnesota \nwrote to me, and I quote:\n\n       These bases . . . have severe problems that demand \n     immediate attention. It is very unfortunate that the U.S. \n     Department of Defense will not admit that they left polluted \n     sites when they vacated the bases. Contrary to statements \n     made by Secretary of State Albright, when she was in the \n     Philippines last summer, the Department of Defense will not \n     even release important documents needed by Philippine \n     Development authorities.\n\n  We need at a minimum to see that all relevant documents are turned \nover to Philippine authorities. This includes key documents such as \ninformation on the construction of the wells and water supply system at \nClark and hydrologic surveys for Clark which should be released to the \nClark Development Corporation (CDC). Currently, the CDC does not have \ndrawings or data on the water system and they are trying to improve the \nwater delivery system without the data they need. The Philippine Study \nGroup of Minnesota say they ``are incredulous that the Defense \nDepartment will not even release those non-military technical documents \nthat would be of great help to Philippine authorities.''\n  This amendment would require the Defense Department to do that. It is \na simple, reasonable step toward improving the environmental situation \nfor the people of the Philippines. It is a step in the direction of \nassuring our allies that when the U.S. closes a military base, it \nleaves behind a legacy of friendship,\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\ncooperation, and sensitivity to environmental justice--not a toxic \nlegacy.\n  Mr. President, we have a long history with the Philippines. From the \nturn of the century until 1991, except for the period of Japanese \noccupation during WWII, U.S. military forces used lands in Central \nLuzon and around Subic Bay in the Philippines as military bases which \ngrew to be among the largest U.S. overseas bases in the world. The main \npurpose of Subic Bay Naval Base was to service the U.S. Navy Seventh \nFleet. Forested lands were also used for training exercises. Clark Air \nBase served as a major operations and support facility during the \nKorean and Vietnam conflicts.\n  In 1991, more than 7,000 military personnel were stationed at Clark \nin addition to dependents and civilian support. Operations carried out \non the bases included, but were not limited to: fuel loading, storage, \ndistribution, and dispensing; ship servicing, repair, and overhaul; \nammunition transfer, assembly, destruction, and storage; aircraft \nservicing, cleaning, repair, and storage; base vehicle fleet servicing, \ncleaning, repair, overhaul, and operation; power generation; \nelectricity transformation and distribution; steam generation; water \ntreatment and distribution; sewage collection and treatment; hazardous \nwaste storage and disposal; bitumen production; electroplating; \ncorrosion protection; and weed and pest control.\n\n  These activities, for many years not conducted in a manner protective \nof the environment, lead to substantial contamination of the air, soil, \ngroundwater, sediments, and coastal waters of the bases and their \nsurroundings. This was not unique to the Philippines. Military and \nindustrial activities in the U.S. and around the world have had similar \neffects. Contaminants include, but are not limited to, petroleum \nhydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, \npesticides, PCB's metals, asbestos, acids, explosives and munitions. \nWhether or not radioactive wastes are present is uncertain.\n  The Philippine Senate voted in 1991 not to renew the bases agreement \nbetween the two countries. In June of that same year, Mt. Pinatubo \nerupted hastening U.S. withdrawal from Clark Air Base. U.S. forces left \nSubic Naval Base in 1992, ending almost a century of occupation of \nthese vast areas of Luzon. Notwithstanding initial Department of \nDefense protestations to the contrary, substantial amounts of hazardous \nmaterials and wastes were left behind at the time of the U.S. departure \nboth on the surface and in various environmental media. According to a \nGAO report issued in 1992,\n\n       If the United States unilaterally decided to clean up these \n     bases in accordance with U.S. standards, the costs for \n     environmental clean-up and restoration could approach \n     Superfund proportions.\n\n  Environmental officers at both Subic Bay Naval Facility and Clark Air \nBase have proposed a variety of projects to correct environmental \nhazards and remedy situations that pose serious health and safety \nthreats.'' None of these projects was undertaken prior to U.S. \ndeparture from the baselands. A study commissioned by the WHO in 1993, \nin order to assess potential environmental risks at Subic Bay, \nidentified a number of contaminated and potentially contaminated sites \nand recommended a complete environmental assessment.\n  Two study teams visited the sites in 1994, under the sponsorship of \nthe Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, and not only found \nevidence of environmental contamination but carefully documented the \nlack of existing capacity in the Philippines, whether in government, \nuniversity, or private sectors, to assess and remediate this complex \nproblem.\n  The health and safety issues are not theoretical or contingent on \nfuture development of the bases. At the present time rusting and \nbulging barrels of hazardous materials are sitting uncovered at Clark. \nThere are reports of exposed asbestos insulation in buildings vacated \nby departing U.S. personnel. For years waste materials from the ship \nrepair facility were dumped or discharged directly into Subic Bay, \ncontaminating sediments, and now residents from surrounding communities \neat fish and shellfish harvested from this area. Thousands of evacuees \ndisplaced from homes destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and lava \nflows which followed have been temporarily housed in tents and \nmakeshift wooden structure on Clark Air Base at a site previously \noccupied by a motorpool. They obtain drinking and bathing water from \ngroundwater wells.\n  Just beyond the Dau gate, about 300 yards from this evacuation \ncenter, is the permanent community of Dau where many thousands of \nresidents routinely use groundwater for drinking, cooking, and bathing. \nBecause of complaints of gross contamination of water from some of the \nwells in the evacuation area, including visible oily sheen, foul taste, \nand gastrointestinal illness, one sample was tested at the laboratories \nof the University of the Philippines in early 1994 and found to contain \noil and grease. Limited by laboratory capability, the analysis did not \ninclude the wide range of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, \nfuels, fuel additives, and other compounds which commonly contaminate \ngroundwater in the U.S. and in other countries where similar military \nand industrial activities have taken place.\n  Many of these substances have important health effects when present \neven in extremely small amounts--health effects which may take years to \nbecome apparent--including cancer, birth and developmental \nabnormalities, and neurological or immunological damage. Moreover, \nthere are numerous instances in the U.S. where contaminated groundwater \nat military bases has migrated off-base, sometimes for a distance of \nseveral miles, entering the drinking water of surrounding communities \nand posing a threat to public health. This is not only possible but \nlikely at Clark Air Base, only one of numerous sites of concern at both \nbases, and one which is beyond existing Philippine capacity to assess \nlet alone to remediate.\n  When President Clinton visited the Philippines in November 1994 both \nhe and President Ramos acknowledged that the issue of base \ncontamination would need to be further investigated. However, President \nClinton stated that, ``We have no reason to believe at this time that \nthere is a big problem that we left untended. We clearly are not \nmandated under treaty obligations to do more.'' He went on to say ``. . \n.we decided we should focus on finding the facts now, and when we find \nthem, deal then with the facts as they are.''\n  Though there may be no treaty obligation to address this issue, there \nare obvious moral and public health arguments which should compel the \nU.S. to accept responsibility for environmental assessment and \nremediation of the former bases in the Philippines. There are other \noverseas bases in, for example, Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan, where \nin response to host-country discovery and complaints of environmental \ncontamination, the U.S. has provided assessment and clean-up. After \nnearly a century of occupation of these Philippine baselands, the \nobligation is no less. Meanwhile, as the political resolution of this \nissue unfolds, thousands of Filipinos, many of whom are living in \nmarginal refugee conditions, and drinking and bathing in water which \nmay be contaminated with hazardous substances resulting from U.S. \nmilitary activities.\n  If these circumstances were to exist in the U.S. the groundwater \nwould already have been comprehensively tested for a broad spectrum of \nsubstances and the public's health protected, while resulting plumes of \ncontamination were being mapped and remediation strategies executed. \nUntil we can answer with certainty whether or not this water is safe \nfor consumption, an answer which neither Philippine government, public \nhealth officials, nor academicians are able to provide without \nassistance, and eliminate any identified hazardous exposures, the U.S. \nmay be viewed as bearing responsibility for any resulting health \neffects.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Having done that, we will now proceed to amendment No. \n382, on which the Senator will address the Senate pursuant to the \nstanding order, and then at a time later we will schedule the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be ready to go, if I could have \njust 30 seconds to also say on the floor of Senate, when I say ``we,'' \nI don't mean as in me. I mean the collective us. This is for both \nSenator Levin and Senator Warner. You also, in a bipartisan way,\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nthrough your efforts, were able to put an amendment into this bill that \ndeals with family violence. I thank you. I think this is an extremely \nimportant amendment.\n  The problem was that all too often, when a spouse usually a woman--\nwould report violence, there was no real right of guarantee of \nconfidentiality, which we needed. In other words, a woman could go to a \ndoctor and then her report to a doctor could get out publicly. This \nreally will enable women who are the victims of this violence to be \nable to go to someone and receive some support and help. It is \nextremely important. Both of you have supported this. I think there is \nsimilar language over in the House side. I thank the two of you. This \nis an amendment I am really proud of. I thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. Once again, Mr. President, I am advised that the vote on \nNo. 382, the amendment the Senator is about to debate in the Senate \nunder the standing agreement, can be voted as the third vote in \nsequence this afternoon.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on that amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if it would be in order, if there \nwould be any objection, to ask unanimous consent that no further \nbusiness be held between now and the recess so that people know there \nis not going to be any additional----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am not objecting, but I think we should \njust simply say that at 1, at which time the 30 minutes expires, the \nSenate will stand in recess until the first vote, which is scheduled \nfor 2:15.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But for some of us who planned to actually leave here at \n12:30, I think it is important, if there is an understanding to this \neffect, that there be no further amendments offered or any other \nbusiness carried on between now and the time that we recess for the \nluncheons. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have no agreement, but let's make it \nvery clear that we will now begin to address amendment No. 382. As soon \nas that debate is concluded, the Senate will stand in recess until the \nhour of 2:15, when the first vote is to take place, and there would be \nno intervening business transacted.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, just to clarify, I don't have any \nobjection to that unanimous consent request, but I want to make some \ngeneral remarks in regard to the total bill. I just wanted to try----\n  Mr. WARNER. I am prepared to accommodate the Senator. What about the \nhour of 4 today? You have 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That would be fine. I appreciate that. I think if we set \naside 20 minutes, that would be fine. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. WARNER. We would be glad to do that and make it a part of the \nunanimous consent request which we are jointly propounding, Mr. Levin \nand myself. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I apologize.\n  Mr. WARNER. We just added, 4 to 4:20, this colleague may speak on the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to restate it, but I think the Chair is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment speaks to the priorities \nof the Senate or lack of priorities of the Senate.\n  We have here a bill that really talks about authorization, leading to \nappropriation of hundreds of billions of dollars for defense, for the \nPentagon.\n  I will talk about the priorities of some low-income families in our \ncountry. Their priorities are how to keep a roof over their children's \nheads. Their priorities are how to get food in their children's \nstomachs. Their priorities are how to earn a wage that pays their \nbills.\n  And their priorities are how to obtain medical assistance when they \nare sick or when their children are sick.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago we passed a welfare bill, and as we start \nto see more and more families slide deeper and deeper into poverty, and \nas we see around the country some of these families losing their \nbenefits, I have not heard so much as a whisper of concern, let alone a \nshout of outrage, from the Senate.\n  So I rise to propose an amendment. It is an amendment that I hope \nwill receive the support of every Senator, Democrat and Republican \nalike. It is simple and it is straightforward.\n  Current law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nprovide an annual report to Congress. My amendment requires the \nSecretary to include information about families who have moved off the \nwelfare rolls. What kind of jobs do they have? What is their employment \nstatus? What kind of wages are they making? Is it a living wage? What \nis the child care situation with their children? Have they been dropped \nfrom medical assistance? Do they have any health insurance coverage at \nall?\n  Mr. President, like my colleagues, I had hoped that the welfare \nreform bill--though I voted against it because I had real reservations \nabout how it would really take shape and form throughout the country--\nwould work. But I have my doubts. On the basis of some of the evidence \nI present here today, I believe we need to find out with certainty what \nis happening to families, mainly women and children, when they no \nlonger receive welfare assistance in our country.\n  Since August of 1996, 1.3 million families have left welfare. They \nare no longer receiving welfare assistance. That is 4.5 million \nrecipients, and they are mainly women and children. The vast majority \nof these 4.5 million citizens are children. On the basis of these \nnumbers, too many people have deemed welfare reform a success.\n  But to see the welfare rolls reduced dramatically does not mean \nnecessarily that we have reduced poverty in this country. It doesn't \nmean these families have moved from welfare to self-sufficiency. It \ndoesn't mean these families have moved from welfare to economic self-\nsufficiency. These statistics, the drop in the welfare caseload, which \nhas been so loudly talked about as evidence of success by Republicans, \nDemocrats, and by this Democratic administration, doesn't tell us what \nis really happening. It doesn't tell us anything about how these women \nand children are doing. It doesn't tell us whether or not these \nfamilies are better off now that they are no longer receiving welfare \nassistance, or whether they have fallen further into poverty. It \ndoesn't tell us if the mothers can find work. It doesn't tell us if \nthey are making enough of an income to lift themselves and their \nchildren out of poverty. It doesn't tell us whether these mothers have \nadequate access to affordable child care, and it doesn't tell us \nwhether or not these mothers and these children have any health care \ncoverage at all.\n  No one seems to know what has happened to these families. Yet, we \nkeep trumpeting the ``victory'' of welfare reform. The declining \ncaseloads tell us nothing at all about how families are faring once \nthey no longer receive assistance. I am worried that they are just \ndisappearing and this amendment is all about a new class of citizens in \nour country. I call them The Disappeared.\n  Let me give you some examples. We are hearing a lot about the plunge \nin food stamp participation. Over the last 4 years, the number of \npeople using food stamps dropped by almost one-third--from 28 million \nto 19 million people. Some people want to interpret this as evidence of \ndiminished need. But just like the decline in the welfare rolls, there \nare important questions left unanswered. I hope this drop in food stamp \nassistance means that fewer people are going hungry, but I have my \ndoubts. If people are no longer needy, then how can we account for the \nfact that 78 percent of the cities surveyed by the U.S. Conference of \nMayors for its ``Report on Hunger'' reported increases in requests for \nemergency food\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nin 1998? This January, a survey conducted by Catholic Charities U.S.A. \nreported that 73 percent of the diocese had an increase by as much as \n145 percent in requests for emergency food assistance from the year \nbefore.\n\n  How can we account for such findings without questioning whether or \nnot the reformers' claim of success are premature?\n  What is going on here? What is happening to these women and children? \nShould we not know? The esteemed Gunnar Myrdal said, ``Ignorance is \nnever random.'' Sometimes we don't know what we don't want to know.\n  This amendment says we ought to do an honest evaluation and have the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services provide a report to us as to \nexactly what is happening with these women and children.\n  A story Friday from the New York Times suggests one explanation. One \nwelfare recipient was told incorrectly that she could not get food \nstamps without welfare. Though she is scraping by, raising a family of \nfive children and sometimes goes hungry, she has not applied for food \nstamps. ``They referred me to the food pantry,'' she said. ``They don't \ntell you what you really need to know; they tell you what they want you \nto know.''\n  The truth of the matter is that there is an information vacuum at the \nnational level with regard to welfare reform. What has happened to the \nmothers and children who no longer receive any assistance? In a moment, \nI am going to talk about some findings from NETWORK, a national \nCatholic social justice organization--findings that should disturb each \nand every Senator. At the outset, let me read a brief excerpt from the \nreport that outlines the problem:\n\n       Even though government officials are quick to point out \n     that national welfare caseloads are at their lowest point in \n     30 years, they are unable to tell us for the most part what \n     is happening to people after they leave the welfare rolls--\n     and what is happening to people living in poverty who never \n     received assistance in the first place.\n\n  I am especially concerned because the evidence we do have suggests \nthat the goals of welfare reform are not being achieved. People are \ncontinuing to suffer and continuing to struggle to meet their basic \nneeds, and I am talking primarily about women and children. I challenge \nthe Senate today with this amendment. At the very minimum, we should \ncall on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give us a report \non the status of those women and those children who no longer receive \nany welfare assistance. Should we not at least know what is happening \nto these families?\n  I have already mentioned the dramatic decline in welfare caseloads. \nWe must recognize that it is naive to assume that all of the 1.3 \nmillion of these families have found jobs and are moving toward a life \nof economic self-sufficiency. After all, the caseload decline has not \nbeen matched by a similar decline in poverty indicators. Moreover, \nsince 1995, colleagues, what we have seen is an increase among the \nseverest and harshest poverty. This is when income is less than one-\nhalf of what the official definition of poverty is. We have found an \nincrease of 400,000 children living among the ranks of the poorest of \npoor families in America. Could this have something to do with these \nfamilies being cut off welfare assistance? We ought to at least know.\n  I have already mentioned the NETWORK report. What this group did was \ncollect data on people who visited Catholic social services facilities \nin 10 States with large numbers of people eligible for aid, and I will \nsummarize these very dramatic findings.\n  Nearly half of the respondents report that their health is only fair \nor poor; 43 percent eat fewer meals or less food per meal because of \nthe cost; they can't afford it. And 52 percent of soup kitchen patrons \nare unable to provide sufficient food for their children, and even the \nworking poor are suffering as 41 percent of those with jobs experience \nhunger. The people who are working work almost 52 weeks a year, 40 \nhours a week, and they are still so poor that they can't afford to buy \nthe food for their children. I am presenting this evidence today \nbecause I want us to have the evidence.\n  In another study, seven local agencies and community welfare \nmonitoring coalitions in six States compared people currently receiving \nwelfare to those who stopped getting welfare in the last few months.\n  The data show that people who stopped getting welfare were less \nlikely to get food stamps, less likely to get Medicaid, more likely to \ngo without food for a day or more, more likely to move because they \ncouldn't pay rent, more likely to have a child who lived away or was in \nfoster care, more likely to have difficulty paying for and getting \nchild care, more likely to say ``my life is worse'' compared to 6 \nmonths ago.\n  Is that what we intended with this welfare reform bill?\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures did its own assessment \nof 14 studies with good information about families leaving welfare. It \nfound that:\n\n       Most of the jobs [that former recipients get] pay between \n     $5.50 and $7 an hour, higher than minimum wage but not enough \n     to raise a family out of poverty. So far, few families who \n     leave welfare have been able to escape poverty.\n\n  Just this month, Families USA released a very troubling study. It \nfinds that:\n\n       Over two-thirds of a million low-income people--\n     approximately 675,000--lost Medicaid coverage and became \n     uninsured as of 1997 due to welfare reform. The majority (62 \n     percent) of those who became uninsured due to welfare reform \n     were children, and most of those children were, in all \n     likelihood, still eligible for coverage under Medicaid. \n     Moreover, the number of people who lose health coverage due \n     to welfare reform is certain to grow rather substantially in \n     the years ahead.\n\n  Let me just translate this into personal terms.\n  Here is the story of one family that one of the sisters in the \nNETWORK study worked with:\n\n       Martha and her seven-year-old child, David, live in \n     Chicago. She recently began working, but her 37-hour a week \n     job pays only $6.00 an hour. In order to work, Martha must \n     have childcare for David.\n\n  That is the name of my oldest son, David.\n\n       Since he goes to school, she found a sitter who would \n     receive him at 7 a.m. and take him to school. This sitter \n     provided after school care as well. When Sister Joan sat down \n     with Martha to talk about her finances, they discovered that \n     her salary does not even cover the sitter's costs.\n\n  By the way, as long as we are talking about afterschool care, let me \njust mention to you that I remember a poignant conversation I had in \nEast L.A. I was at a Head Start center, and I was talking to a mother. \nShe was telling me that she was working. She didn't make much by way of \nwages, but she was off welfare, and she wanted to work. As we were \ntalking and she was talking about working, all of a sudden she started \nto cry. I was puzzled. I felt like maybe I had said something that had \nupset her. I said: Can I ask you why you are crying?\n  She said: I am crying because one of the things that has happened is \nthat my first grader--I used to, when I was at home, take her to \nschool, and I also could pick her up after school.\n  She lived in a housing project. It is a pretty dangerous \nneighborhood.\n  She said: Now, every day when my daughter, my first grader, finishes \nup in school, I am terrified. I don't know what is going to happen to \nher. There is no care for her, and she goes home, and I tell her to \nlock the door and take no phone calls.\n  Colleagues, this amendment asks us to do a study of what is going on \nwith these children. How many children don't play outside even when the \nweather is nice because there is nobody there to take care of them?\n  Let me talk about an even scarier situation-- families that neither \nreceive government assistance nor have a parent with a job. We don't \nknow for certain how large this population is, but in the NETWORK study \n79 percent of the people were unemployed and not receiving welfare \nbenefits. Of course this study was focused on the hardest hit.\n\n  Let me just say that in some of the earlier State studies, what we \nare seeing is that as many as 50 percent of the families who lost \nwelfare benefits do not have jobs.\n  Can I repeat that?\n  Close to 50 percent perhaps--that is what we want to study--of the \nfamilies who have been cut off welfare assistance do not have jobs, \nmuch less the number of families where the parents--usually a woman--\nhas a job, but it is $6 an hour and she can't afford child care and her \nchildren don't have the necessary child care. Now her medical \nassistance is gone and she is worse off\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\nand her children are worse off. They are plunged into deeper poverty \nthan before we passed this bill.\n  Don't we want to know what is happening in the country?\n  How are these families surviving? I am deeply concerned and worried \nabout them. They are no longer receiving assistance. And they don't \nhave jobs. They are literally falling between the cracks and they are \ndisappearing. I want us to focus on the disappeared Americans.\n  What do we do about this? I want to have bipartisan support.\n  I was a political science teacher before becoming a Senator. In \npublic policy classes, I used to talk about evaluation all the time. \nThat is one of the key ingredients of good public policy. That is what \nI am saying today. We want to have some really good, thorough \nevaluation. We have some States that are doing some studies. But the \nproblem is there are different methodologies and different studies that \nare not comprehensive.\n  Before we passed this bill, when we were giving States waivers--\nMinnesota was one example--43 of 50 States have been granted waivers. \nThey were all required to hire an outside contractor to evaluate the \nimpact of the program.\n  After this legislation passed, we didn't require this any longer of \nStates. Now we are only getting very fragmentary evidence. As a result, \nwe do not really know what is happening to these women. We don't know \nwhat is happening to these children. The money that we have earmarked \nis Labor-HHS appropriations, for Health and Human Services--$15 million \nto provide some money for some careful evaluation. That is what we \nneed, policy evaluation. But the money has been rescinded.\n  What I am saying--I am skipping over some of the data--is at the very \nleast, what we want to do is to make sure that we do some decent \ntracking and that we know in fact what is really going on here.\n  Let me just give you some examples that I think would be important \njust to consider as I go along. Let me read from some work that has \nbeen done by the Children's Defense Fund.\n  Alabama: Applying for cash assistance has become difficult in many \nplaces. In one Alabama county, a professor found workers gave public \nassistance applications to only 6 out of 27 undergraduate students who \nrequested them despite State policy that says anyone who asks for an \napplication should get one.\n  In other words, I know what was going on. This professor was saying \nto students, go out there as welfare mothers and apply and see what \nhappens. They did. What they found out is that very few of them were \neven given applications.\n  Arizona: 60 percent of former recipients were taken off welfare \nbecause they did not appear for a welfare interview.\n  We are talking about sanctions.\n  After holding fairly steady from 1990 to 1993, the number of meals \ndistributed to Arizona statewide, Food Charity Networks, has since \nrisen to 30 percent, and a 1997 study found that 41 percent of \nNetworks' families had at least one person with a job.\n  Quite often what happens is the people who are off the rolls aren't \noff the rolls because they found a job, but because they have been \nsanctioned. The question is, Why have they been sanctioned? The \nquestion is, What happened to them? What has happened to their \nchildren?\n  California: Tens of thousands of welfare beneficiaries in California \nand Illinois are dropped each month as punishment. In total, half of \nthose leaving welfare in these States are doing so because they did not \nfollow the rules.\n  This was from an AP 50-State survey. It was also cited in the \nSalvation Army Fourth Interim Report.\n  In an L.A. family shelter, 12 percent of homeless families said they \nhad experienced benefit reductions or cuts that led directly to their \nhomelessness.\n  One of the questions, colleagues, is this rise of homelessness and \nthis rise of the use of food pantry shelves. Does it have something to \ndo with the fact that many of these women have found jobs but they \ndon't pay a living wage, or they haven't found work but the families \nhave been cut off assistance?\n  Florida: More than 15,000 families left welfare during a typical \nmonth last year. About 3,600 reported finding work, but nearly 4,200 \nleft because they were punished. The State does not know what happened \nto almost 7,500 others.\n  Iowa: 47 percent of those who left welfare did so because they did \nnot comply with requirements such as going to job interviews or \nproviding paperwork.\n  Kentucky: 58 percent of the people who leave welfare are removed for \nnot following the rules.\n  Minnesota: In Minnesota, case managers found that penalized families \nwere twice as likely to have serious mental health problems, three \ntimes as likely to have low intellectual ability, and five times more \nlikely to have family violence problems compared with other recipients.\n  Mississippi Delta region: Workfare recipients gather at 4 a.m. to \ntravel by bus for 2 hours to their assigned workplaces, work their full \ndays, and then return another 2 hours home each night. They are having \ntrouble finding child care during these nontraditional hours and for \nsuch extended days.\n  I could give other reports of other States. Let me just say to every \nsingle Senator here, Democrat and Republican alike, you may have a \ndifferent sense of what is going on with the welfare bill. That is \nfine. But what I am saying here is if you look at the NETWORK study, if \nyou look at the Conference of Mayors study, if you look at the \nConference of State Legislatures study, if you look at the Children's \nDefense Fund study, and if you just travel --I am likely to do quite a \nbit of travel in the country over the next couple of years to really \ntake a look at what is happening--but if you just travel and talk to \npeople, you have reason to be concerned. Right now we do not know and \nwe cannot remain deliberately ignorant. We cannot do that.\n  Policy evaluation is important. So I challenge each and every Senator \nto please support this amendment which calls for nothing more than \nthis, that every year when we get a report from the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services we get a report on what has happened to these women \nand children--that is mainly the population we are talking about--who \nno longer receive welfare assistance. Where are they? What kind of jobs \ndo they have? Are they living-wage jobs? Is there decent child care for \nthe children? Do they have health care coverage? That is what we want \nto know.\n  I remember in the conference committee last year, and I will not use \nnames because no one is here to debate me, I remember in a conference \ncommittee meeting last year we got into a debate. I wanted mothers to \nat least have 2 years of higher education and have that not counted \nagainst them. I was pushing that amendment. I remember, it was quite \ndramatic. In this committee, there were any number of different \nRepresentatives from the House, and some Senators, who said: You are \ntrying to reopen the whole welfare reform debate and you are trying to \nchange welfare policy. This has been hallmark legislation, the most \nimportant legislation we passed since Franklin Delano Roosevelt's \nlegislation.\n  I said to them: Let me ask you a question. Can any of you give me any \ndata from your States? I know the rolls have been cut substantially.\n  I hear my own President, President Clinton, talking about this. But, \nPresident Clinton, you have not provided one bit of evidence that \nreducing the welfare rolls has led to reduction of poverty. The real \nquestion is not whether or not people are off the rolls; the real \nquestion is, Are they better off? I thought the point of welfare reform \nwas to move families, mainly women and children, from welfare to \neconomic self-sufficiency, from welfare to a better life. I thought all \nSenators think it is important that people work, but if they work, they \nought not to be poor in America.\n  We can no longer turn our gaze away from at least being willing to do \nan honest evaluation of what is happening. This amendment calls for \nthat. I cannot see how any Senator will vote against this. I tried to \nbring this amendment to the juvenile justice bill. It would have been a \ngood thing to do, because, frankly, there is a very strong correlation \nbetween poverty and kids getting into trouble and which kids get \nincarcerated. I think this piece of legislation is creating a whole new \nclass\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\nof people disappeared Americans. Many of them are children. That is my \nown view.\n\n  But as that bill went along, I agreed I would not do it if I could \nintroduce this amendment to the next piece of legislation, which is the \nDOD legislation right now. I hope there will be an up-or-down vote. I \nhope there will be strong support for it.\n  If colleagues want to vote against it--I do not know how you can. We \nought to be willing to do an honest evaluation. I tell my colleagues, \nif you travel the country, you are going to see some pretty harsh \ncircumstances. You are going to see some real harsh circumstances. I do \nnot remember exactly, and I need to say it this way because if I am \nwrong I will have to correct the record, but I think in some States \nlike Wisconsin that have been touted as great welfare reform States, \nand I talked to my colleague, Senator Feingold, about this, and there \nis low unemployment so it should work well--I think, roughly speaking, \ntwo-thirds of the mothers and children now have less income than they \ndid before the welfare bill was passed. That is not success. That is \nnot success.\n  Do you all know that in every single State all across the country--\nand it depends upon which year, it is up to the State--there is a drop-\ndead date certain where families are going to be eliminated from all \nassistance? Shouldn't we know, before we do that, before we just toss \npeople over the cliff--shouldn't we know what is going on? Shouldn't we \nhave some understanding of whether or not these mothers are able to \nfind jobs? Shouldn't we know what is going on with their children? \nShouldn't we know whether there are problems with substance abuse or \nviolence in the homes? Shouldn't we make sure we do that before we \neliminate all assistance and create a new class of the disappeared, of \nthe poorest of the poor--of the poor who are mainly children?\n  I have brought this amendment to the floor before, but this time \naround I do not want a voice vote. I want a recorded vote. If Senators \nare going to vote against this, I want that on the record. If they are \ngoing to vote for it, I will thank each and every one of them. Then, if \nthere is an effort to drop this in conference committee because it is \non the DOD bill, do you know what. Here is what I say: At least the \nSenate has gone on the record saying we are going to be intellectually \nhonest and have an honest policy evaluation. That is all I want. That \nis all I want to see happen. If it gets dropped, I will be back with \nthe amendment again, and again, and again and again--until we have this \nstudy. Until we are honest about being willing--I am sorry--until we \nare willing to be honest about what is now happening in the country and \nat least collect the data so we can then know.\n  I feel very strongly about this, colleagues, very strongly about \nthis. I am going to speak on the floor of the Senate about this. I am \ngoing to do some traveling in the country. I am going to try to focus \non what I consider to be really some very harsh conditions and some \nvery harsh things that are happening to too many women and to too many \nchildren.\n  I also speak with some indignation. I can do this in a bipartisan \nway. I want us to have this evaluation. I say to the White House, to \nthe administration--I ask unanimous consent I have 1 more minute. I \nactually started at 12:30, so I do not know how I could be out of time. \nI had a half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The official clock up here shows time expired, \nbut without objection, 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I don't want to get into a big \nargument with the Chair. I can do it in 1 minute.\n  I think I have heard the administration, Democratic administration, I \nhave heard the President and Vice President talk about how we have \ndramatically reduced the welfare rolls with huge success. Has the \ndramatic reduction in the welfare rolls led to a dramatic reduction in \npoverty? Are these women and children more economically self-\nsufficient? Are they better off or are they worse off? That is what I \nwant to know. I say that to Democrats. I say that to Republicans. We \nought to have the courage to call upon the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to provide us with this data. As policymakers, we need \nthis information.\n\n  Please, Senators, support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Daniel J. \nStewart, a fellow in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring the debate on the defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided on the Roth amendment. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, for 58 years, two distinguished commanders, \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short, have been unjustly scapegoated for \nthe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Numerous studies have made it \nunambiguously clear that Short and Kimmel were denied vital \nintelligence that was available in Washington. Investigations by \nmilitary boards found Kimmel and Short had properly disposed their \nforces in light of the intelligence and resources they had available.\n  Investigations found the failure of their superiors to properly \nmanage intelligence and to fulfill command responsibilities contributed \nsignificantly, if not predominantly, to the disaster. Yet, they alone \nremain singled out for responsibility. This amendment calls upon the \nPresident to correct this injustice by advancing them on the retired \nlist, as was done for all their peers.\n  This initiative has received support from veterans, including Bob \nDole, countless military leaders, including Admirals Moorer, Crowe, \nHalloway, Zumwalt, and Trost, as well as the VFW.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the managers of this bill, we \nvigorously oppose this amendment. Right here on this desk is perhaps \nthe most dramatic reason not to grant the request. This represents a \nhearing held by a joint committee of the Senate and House of the \nCongress of the United States in 1946. They had before them live \nwitnesses, all of the documents, and it is clear from this and their \nfindings that these two officers were then and remain today accused of \nserious errors in judgment which contributed to perhaps the greatest \ndisaster in this century against the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  There are absolutely no new facts beyond those deduced in this record \nbrought out by my distinguished good friend, the senior Senator from \nDelaware. For that reason, we oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 388. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Is the Senator from Virginia correct that the next vote \nwill be on the amendment by the Senator from Kansas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, amendment No. 377 by the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Kansas and I understand, also, that \nour colleague, the ranking member of the committee, likewise supports \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, noting the presence of the Senator from \nKansas, the amendment by the Senator from Kansas raises a very good \npoint; that is, at the 50th anniversary of the NATO summit, those in \nattendance, the 19 nations, the heads of state and government, adopted \na new Strategic Concept.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that that Concept does not \ngo beyond the confines of the 1949 Washington Treaty and such actions \nthat took place in 1991 when a new Strategic Concept was drawn.\n  A number of us are concerned, if we read through the language, that \nit opens up new vistas for NATO. If that be the case, then the Senate \nshould have that treaty before it for consideration. This is a sense of \nthe Senate, but despite that technicality, it is a very important \namendment; it is one to which the President will respond.\n  I understand from my distinguished colleague and ranking member, in \nall probability, we will receive the assurance from the President that \nit does not go beyond the foundations and objectives sought in the 1949 \nWashington Treaty.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support this amendment. It says that the \nPresident should say to us whether or not the new Strategic Concept \nimposes new commitments or obligations upon us. It does not find that \nthere are such new obligations or commitments. The President has \nalready written to us in a letter to Senator Warner that the Strategic \nConcept will not contain new commitments or obligations.\n  In 1991, the new Strategic Concept, which came with much new language \nand many new missions, was not submitted to the Senate. Indeed, much of \nthe language is very similar in 1991 as in 1999.\n  In my judgment, there are no new commitments or obligations imposed \nby the 1999 Strategic Concept. The President could very readily certify \nwhat is required that he certify by this amendment, and I support it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote be \nlimited to 10 minutes and the next vote following it to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe that under the order 1 minute was \nreserved for anybody in opposition, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. KYL. I don't think the Senator from Michigan spoke in opposition \nto the amendment, as I understand it. Therefore, would it not be in \norder for someone in opposition to take a minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from Arizona is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire of the Senator from Delaware--I am prepared \nto speak for 30 seconds or a minute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If he can reserve 20 seconds for me, I would appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. KYL. I will take 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both Senators \nbe given 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that, as Senator Levin \njust pointed out, this is a totally unnecessary amendment, because the \nadministration has already expressed a view that it has not gone beyond \nthe Concepts this Senate voted for 90 to 9 when the new states were \nadded to NATO. Those are the Strategic Concepts.\n  One might argue whether or not they are being applied correctly in \nthe case of the war in Kosovo. That is another debate. But in terms of \nthe Strategic Concepts themselves, this body voted on them, and I would \nhate for this body now to suggest to the other 18 countries in NATO \nthat perhaps they should resubmit the Strategic Concepts to their \nlegislative bodies as in the nature of a treaty so that the entire NATO \nagreement on Strategic Concepts would be subject to 19 separate votes \nof our parliamentary bodies. I don't think that would be a good idea \ngiven the fact that, as Senator Levin already noted, the President has \nalready said the Strategic Concepts do not go beyond what the Senate \nvoted for 90 to 9.\n  This an unnecessary amendment. I suggest my colleagues vote no.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Strategic Concept does not rise to the \nlevel of a treaty amendment, and the Senator from Michigan has pointed \nthat out. Therefore, it is a benign amendment, we are told, and in all \nprobability it is. But it is unnecessary. It does mischief. It sends \nthe wrong message. It is a bad idea, notwithstanding the fact that it \nhas been cleaned up to the point that it is clear it does not rise to \nthe level of a treaty requiring a treaty vote on the Strategic Concept.\n  But I agree with the Senator from Arizona. He painstakingly on this \nfloor laid out in the Kyl amendment during the expansion of NATO debate \nexactly what we asked the President to consider in the Strategic \nConcept that was being negotiated with our allies. They did that. We \nvoted 90 to 9.\n  This is a bad idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nOn this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 382\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the next amendment is in the jurisdiction \nof the Finance Committee. Therefore, I have consulted with Chairman \nRoth.\n  Does Senator Roth have any comments on this?\n  Mr. ROTH. No comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. We yield back such time as we may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  I have been trying to get this amendment on the floor. This is simple \nand straightforward. This requires the Department of Health and Human \nServices to provide us with a report on the status of women and \nchildren who are no longer on welfare. There are 4.5 million fewer \nrecipients. We want to know what kinds of jobs, at what wages, do \npeople have health care coverage. This is based on disturbing reports \nby Family U.S.A., Catholic Organization Network, Children's Defense \nFund, Conference of Mayors and, in addition, National Conference of \nState Legislatures.\n  Good public policy is good evaluation, and we ought to know what is \ngoing on in the country right now on this terribly important question \nthat dramatically affects the lives of women and children, albeit low-\nincome women and children. I hope to get a strong bipartisan vote. It \nwill be a good message.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Wellstone's \namendment to require states to collect data on the employment, jobs, \nearnings, health insurance, and child care arrangements of former \nwelfare recipients.\n  This information is essential. The most important indicator of \nwelfare reform's success is not just declining welfare caseloads. It is \nthe well-being of these low-income parents and their children after \nthey leave the welfare system. We do not know enough about how they \nhave fared, and states should be required to collect this information. \nMillions of families have left the welfare rolls, and we need to know \nhow they are doing now. We need information on their earnings, their \nhealth care, and other vital data. The obvious question is whether \nformer welfare recipients are doing well, or barely surviving, worse \noff than before.\n  The data we do have about former welfare recipients is not \nencouraging. According to a study by the Children's Defense Fund and \nthe National Coalition on the Homeless, most former welfare recipients \nearn below poverty wages after leaving the welfare system. Their \nfinancial hardship is compounded by the fact that many former welfare \nrecipients do not receive the essential services that would enable them \nto hold jobs and care for their children. The cost of child care can be \na crushing expense to low-income families, consuming over one-quarter \nof their income. Yet, the Department of Health and Human Services \nestimates that only one in ten eligible low-income families gets the \nchild care assistance they need.\n  Health insurance trends are also troubling. As of 1997, 675,000 low-\nincome people had lost Medicaid coverage due to welfare reform. \nChildren comprise 62 percent of this figure, and many of them were \nstill eligible for Medicaid. We need to improve outreach to get more \neligible children enrolled in Medicaid. We also need to increase \nenrollment in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which \noffers states incentives to expand health coverage for children with \nfamily income up to 200 percent of poverty. it is estimated that 4 \nmillion uninsured children are eligible for this assistance.\n  In addition to problems related to child care and health care, many \nlow-income families are not receiving Food Stamp assistance. Over the \nlast 4 years, participation in the Food Stamp Program has dropped by \none-third, from serving nearly 28 million participants to serving fewer \nthan 19 million. But this does not mean children and families are no \nlonger hungry. Hunger and undernutrition continue to be urgent \nproblems. According to a Department of Agriculture study, 1 in 8 \nAmericans--or more than 34 million people--are at risk of hunger.\n  The need for food assistance is underscored by he phenomenon of \nincreasing reliance on food banks and emergency food services. Many \nfood banks are now overwhelmed by the growing number of requests they \nreceive for assistance. The Western Massachusetts Food Bank reports a \ndramatic increase in demand for emergency food services. In 1997, it \nassisted 75,000 people. In 1998, the number they served rose to 85,000. \nMassachusetts is not alone. According to a recent U.S. Conference of \nMayors report, 78 percent of the 30 cities surveyed reported an \nincrease in requests for emergency food in 1998. Sixty-one percent of \nthe people seeking this assistance were children or their parents; 31 \npercent were employed.\n  These statistics clearly demonstrate that hunger is a major problem. \nYet fewer families are now receiving Food Stamps. One of the unintended \nconsequences of welfare reform is that low-income, working families are \ndropping off the Food Stamps rolls. Often, these families are going \nhungry or turning to food banks because they don't have adequate \ninformation about Food Stamp eligibility.\n  A Massachusetts study found that most people leaving welfare are not \ngetting Food Stamp benefits, even though many are still eligible. Three \nmonths after leaving welfare, only 18 percent were receiving Food \nStamps. After one year, the percentage drops to 6.5 percent. It is \nclear that too many eligible families are not getting the assistance \nthey need and are entitled to.\n  Every state should be required to collect this kind of data. We need \nbetter information about how low-income families are faring after they \nleave welfare. Adequate data will enable the states to build on their \nsuccesses and address their weaknesses. Ultimately, the long-term \nsuccess of welfare reform will be measured state by state, person by \nperson with this data.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Ignorance is not \nbliss. We can't afford to ignore the need that may exist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Is there any Senator who wishes to speak in opposition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n382. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I have a colleague who is ready to go, Senator Specter, so I will not \ntake much time. But I just want to make it clear to colleagues that on \nthis vote I agreed to a time limit. I brought this amendment out to the \nfloor. There could have been debate on the other side. Somebody could \nhave come out here and debated me openly in public about this \namendment.\n  I am talking about exactly what is happening with this welfare bill. \nI am talking about good public policy evaluation. Shouldn't we at least \nhave the information about where these women are? Where these children \nare? What kind of jobs? What kind of wages? Are there adequate child \ncare arrangements?\n  The Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal once said: ``Ignorance is never \nrandom.'' Sometimes we don't know what we don't want to know.\n\n  I say to colleagues, given this vote, I am going to bring this \namendment out on the next bill I get a chance to bring it out on. I am \nnot going to agree to a time limit. I am going to force people to come \nout here on the majority side and debate me on this question, and we \nwill have a full-fledged, substantive debate. We are talking about the \nlives of women and children, albeit they are poor, albeit they don't \nhave the lobbyists, albeit they are not well connected. I am telling \nyou, I am outraged that there wasn't the willingness and the courage to \ndebate me on this amendment. We will have the debate with no time \nlimits next bill that comes out here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I tried to accommodate the Senator early \non on this matter. To be perfectly candid, it was a jurisdictional \nissue with this committee. It was not a subject with which this Senator \nhad a great deal of familiarity. I did what I could to keep our bill \nmoving and at the same time to accommodate my colleague. The various \npersons who have jurisdiction over it were notified, and that is as \nmuch as I can say.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 90 minutes \nequally divided in the usual form prior to a motion to table with \nrespect to amendment 383 and no amendments be in order prior to that \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I further ask that following that vote, \nprovided it is tabled, that Senator Gramm of Texas be recognized to \nmake a motion to strike and there be 2 hours equally divided in the \nusual form prior to a motion to table and no amendments be in order to \nthat language proposed to be stricken prior to that vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the only \nquestion I have is that on the second half here, which is the one that \nis before us, I suggest that it read ``prior to a motion to table or a \nmotion on adoption'' so that there is an option as to whether there is \na motion to table or a vote on the amendment itself.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we find no objection to that. I so amend \nthe request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as amended? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 383\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides that:\n\n       None of the funds authorized or otherwise available to the \n     Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for the \n     deployment of ground troops from the United States Armed \n     Forces in Kosovo, except for peacekeeping personnel, unless \n     authorized by declaration of war or a joint resolution \n     authorizing the use of military force.\n\n  The purpose of this amendment, obvious on its face, is to avoid \nhaving the United States drawn into a full-fledged war without \nauthorization of the Congress. This authorization is required by the \nconstitutional provision which states that only the Congress of the \nUnited States has the authority to declare war, and the implicit \nconsequence from that constitutional provision that only the Congress \nof the United States has the authority to involve the United States in \na war. The Founding Fathers entrusted that grave responsibility to the \nCongress because of the obvious factor that a war could not be \nsuccessfully prosecuted unless it was backed by the American people. \nThe first line of determination in a representative democracy, in a \nrepublic, is to have that determination made by the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  We have seen the bitter lesson of Vietnam where a war could not be \nsuccessfully prosecuted by the United States, where the public was not \nbehind the war.\n  This amendment is being pressed today because there has been such a \nconsistent erosion of the congressional authority to declare war. Korea \nwas a war without congressional declaration. Vietnam was a war without \na congressional declaration. There was the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, \nwhich some said justified the involvement of the United States in \nVietnam--military involvement, the waging of a war. But on its face, \nthe Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was not really sufficient.\n  The Gulf War, authorized by a resolution of both Houses of Congress, \nbroke that chain of the erosion of congressional authority. In January \nof 1991, the Senate and the House of Representatives took up the issue \non the use of force. After a spirited debate on this floor, \ncharacterized by the media as historic, in a 52-47 vote, the Senate \nauthorized the use of force. Similarly, the House of Representatives \nauthorized the use of force so that we had the appropriate \ncongressional declaration on that important matter.\n  We have seen the erosion of congressional authority on many, many \ninstances. I shall comment this afternoon on only a few.\n  We have seen the missile strikes at Iraq really being acts of war. In \nFebruary of 1998, I argued on the floor of the Senate that there ought \nnot to be missile strikes without authorization by the Congress of the \nUnited States. There may be justification for the President to exercise \nhis authority as Commander in Chief, if there is an emergency \nsituation, but where there is time for deliberation and debate and \ncongressional action, that ought to be undertaken.\n  As the circumstances worked out, missile strikes did not occur in \nearly 1998, after the indication that the President might authorize or \nundertake those missile strikes.\n  When that again became an apparent likelihood in November of 1998, I \nonce more urged on the Senate floor that the President not undertake \nacts of war with missile strikes because there was ample time for \nconsideration. There had been considerable talk about it, and that \nreally should have been a congressional declaration. The President then \ndid order missile strikes in December of 1998.\n  As we have seen with the events in Kosovo, the President of the \nUnited States made it plain in mid-March, at a news conference which he \nheld on March 19 and at a meeting earlier that day with Members of \nCongress, that he intended to proceed with airstrikes. At a meeting \nwith Members of Congress on March 23, the President was asked by a \nnumber of Members to come to Congress, and he did. The President sent a \nletter to Senator Daschle asking for authorization by the Senate. In a \ncontext where it was apparent that the airstrikes were going to be \npursued with or without congressional authorization, and with the \nprestige of NATO on the line and with the prestige of the United States \non the line, the Senate did authorize airstrikes, specifically \nexcluding any use of ground troops. That authorization was by a vote of \n58 to 41.\n  The House of Representatives had, on a prior vote, authorized U.S. \nforces as peacekeepers, but that was not really relevant to the issue \nof the airstrikes. Subsequently, the House of Representatives took up \nthe issue of airstrikes, and by a tie vote of 213-213, the House of \nRepresentatives declined to authorize the airstrikes. That was at a \ntime when the airstrikes were already underway.\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\n  I supported the Senate vote for the authorization of airstrikes. I \ntalked to General Wesley Clark, the Supreme NATO Commander. One of the \npoints which he made, which was telling on this Senator, was the morale \nof the troops. The airstrikes were an inevitability, as the President \nhad determined, and it seemed to me that in that context we ought to \ngive the authorization, again, as I say, expressly reserving the issue \nnot to have ground forces used.\n  So on this state of the record, with the vote by the Senate and with \nthe tie vote by the House of Representatives, you have airstrikes which \nmay well, under international law, be concluded to be at variance with \nthe Constitution of the United States, to put it politely and not to \narticulate any doctrine of illegality, at a time when my country is \ninvolved in those airstrikes. But when we come to the issue of ground \ntroops, which would be a major expansion and would constitute, beyond \nany question, the involvement of the United States in a war--although \nmy own view is that the United States is conducting acts of war at the \npresent time--the President ought to come to the Congress.\n\n  When the President met with a large group of Members on Wednesday, \nApril 28, the issue of ground forces came up and the President made a \ncommitment to those in attendance--and I was present--that he would not \norder ground troops into Kosovo without prior congressional \nauthorization. He said he would honor that congressional authorization, \nreserving his prerogative as President to say that he didn't feel it \nindispensable constitutionally that he do so. However, he said that he \nwould make that commitment, and he did make that commitment to a large \nnumber of Members of the House and Senate on April 28 of this year. He \nsaid, as a matter of good faith, that he would come to the Congress \nbefore authorizing the use of ground troops.\n  So, in a sense, it could be said that this amendment is duplicative. \nBut I do believe, as a matter of adherence to the rule of law, that the \ncommitment the President made ought to be memorialized in this defense \nauthorization bill. I have, therefore, offered this amendment.\n  It is a complicated question as to the use of ground forces, whether \nthey will ever be requested, because unanimity has to be obtained under \nthe rules that govern NATO. Germany has already said they are opposed \nto the use of ground forces. But this is a matter that really ought to \ncome back to the Congress. I am prepared--speaking for myself--to \nconsider a Presidential request for authorization for the use of ground \nforces. However, before I would vote on the matter, or give my consent \nor vote in the affirmative, there are a great many questions I will \nwant to have answered--questions that go to intelligence, questions \nthat go to the specialty of the military planners. I would want to know \nwhat the likely resistance would be from the army of the former \nYugoslavia. How much have our airstrikes degraded the capability of the \nSerbian army to defend? How many U.S. troops would be involved? I would \nlike to know, to the extent possible, what the assessment of risk is.\n  When we talked about invading Japan before the dropping of the atomic \nbomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we had estimates as to how many would \nbe wounded and how many fatalities there would be. So while not easy to \npass judgment on something that could be at least estimated or \napproximated, I would want to know, very importantly, how many ground \ntroops would be supplied by others in NATO. I would want to know what \nthe projection was for the duration of the military engagement, and \nwhat the projection was after the military engagement was over.\n  These are only some of the questions that ought to be addressed. In \n16 minutes, at 4 o'clock, members of the administration, the Secretary \nof Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff are scheduled to give another congressional briefing. \nBefore we have a vote on a matter of this importance and this \nmagnitude, those are some of the questions I think ought to be \nanswered. That, in a very brief statement, constitutes the essence of \nthe reasons why I have offered this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. He and I are of the same mind in \nterms of the authority and responsibility of Congress when it comes to \na declaration of war. It is interesting to note that last year when a \nsimilar amendment was called on the defense appropriation bill, offered \nby a gentleman in the House, David Skaggs, only 15 Members of the \nSenate voted in favor of it, including the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthe Senator from Delaware, myself, and a handful of others. It will be \ninteresting to see this debate now in the context of a real conflict.\n\n  I have seen a copy of this amendment, and I want to understand the \nfull clarity and intention of the Senator. As I understand it, there \nare two paragraphs offered as part of this amendment. They use \ndifferent language in each paragraph. I wish the Senator would clarify.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond to the Senator, I would be glad to \nrespond to the questions. I thank him for his leadership in offering a \nsimilar amendment in the past. When I undertook to send this amendment \nto the desk, I had called the Senator from Illinois and talked to him \nthis morning and will consider this a joint venture if he is prepared \nto accept that characterization.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Depending on the responses, I may very well be prepared \nto do so.\n  Would the Senator be kind enough to enlighten me? The first paragraph \nrefers to the introduction of ground troops. The second paragraph \nrefers to the deployment of ground troops. Could the Senator tell me, \nis there a difference in his mind in the use of those two different \nterms?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Responding directly to the question, I think there would \nbe no difference. But I am not sure the Senator from Illinois has the \nprecise amendment I have introduced, which has only one paragraph. I \ncan read it quickly:\n\n       None of the funds authorized or otherwise available to the \n     Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for \n     deployment of ground troops from the United States Armed \n     Forces in Kosovo, except for peacekeeping personnel, unless \n     authorized by a declaration of war or a joint resolution \n     authorizing the use of military force.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The version I have----\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, I am holding this draft \namendment. You are referring to two paragraphs, and it appears to me \nthat the first paragraph is the title; am I correct? I find that \ninconsistent with what I believe was paragraph 2. The first paragraph \nis the title, and there is really only one paragraph in the body of the \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia. If the Senator from \nPennsylvania will yield, I will confine myself to the nature of the \namendment. Could the Senator tell me why reference is only made to the \ndeployment of grounds troops from U.S. Armed Forces in Kosovo and not \nin Yugoslavia?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The amendment was drafted in its narrowest form. Perhaps \nit would be appropriate to modify the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think it might be. I ask the Senator a second question. \nWould he not want to make an exception, as well, for the rescue of the \nNATO forces in Yugoslavia if we would perhaps have a downed flier and \nground troops could be sent in for rescue, and that would not require \ncongressional authorization. I think that would be consistent with the \nSenator's earlier statements about the emergency authority of the \nPresident as Commander in Chief.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be prepared to accept that exception.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The final question is procedural. The Senator from \nPennsylvania has been here----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to amend it for a downed flier--we just \nwitnessed ground troops being caught, and they have now been released. \nI would be careful in the redrafting and not just to stick to a downed \nflier. That is just helpful advice.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. A rescue of NATO forces in Yugoslavia was the question. \nLast, I will ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, if this requires a \njoint resolution, under the rules of the Senate,\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\nMembers in a filibuster, a minority, say, 41 Senators, could stop us \nfrom ever taking action on this measure. How would the Senator from \nPennsylvania respond to that? Does that, in effect, give to a minority \nthe authority to stop the debate and a vote by the Senate and thereby \ntie the President's hands when it comes to committing ground troops, \nshould we ever reach the point where that is necessary?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I respond to my colleague from Illinois by saying that \nwith a declaration of war where the Senate has to join under the \nConstitution and there could be a filibuster requiring 60 votes, the \nsame rule applies. To get that authorization, either by declaration of \nwar or resolution for the use of force, we have to comply with the \nrules to get an affirmative vote out of the Senate. Under those rules, \nif somebody filibusters, it requires 60 votes. So be it. That is the \nrule of the Senate and that is the way you have to proceed to get the \nauthorization from the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know I am speaking on the Senator's time. I thank him \nfor responding to those questions. I have reservations, as he does, \nabout committing ground troops. I certainly believe, as he does, that \nthe Congress should make that decision and not the President \nunilaterally. He has promised to come to us for that decision to be \nmade. I hope Mr. Milosevic and those who follow this debate don't take \nany comfort in this. We are speaking only to the question of the \nauthority of Congress, not as to any actual decision of whether we will \never commit to ground troops. I think that is the sense of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I thank him for offering the amendment, and I \nsupport this important amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will speak in opposition to the \namendment. But I don't wish to interfere with the presentation of the \nSenator. At such time, perhaps, when I could start by propounding a few \nquestions to my colleague and friend, would he indicate when he feels \nhe has finished his presentation of the amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It would suit me to have the questions right now.\n  Mr. WARNER. I remind the Senator of the parliamentary situation. \nWhile I have given him some suggestions, if he is going to amend it, it \nwould take unanimous consent to amend the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. To modify the amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. The time agreement has been presented under the rules. I \nwill address the question to the Chair. I think that would be best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to modify the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Just as a friendly gesture, I advise my colleague of \nthat.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \nfriendly gesture.\n  Mr. WARNER. As the Senator reads the title and then the text, I have \ntrouble following the continuity of the two. For example, first it is \ndirecting the President of the United States pursuant to the \nConstitution and the War Powers Resolution. I have been here 21 years. \nI think the Senator from Pennsylvania is just a year or two shy of \nthat. This War Powers Resolution has never been accepted by any \nPresident, Republican or Democrat or otherwise. Am I not correct in \nthat respect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, we would not be precipitating in another one \nof those endless debates which would consume hours and hours of the \ntime of this body if we are acting on the predicate that this President \nis now going to acknowledge that he, as President of the United States, \nis bound by what is law? I readily admit it is the law. But we have \nwitnessed, over these 20-plus years that I have been here and over the \nyears the Senator from Pennsylvania has been here, that no President \nwill acknowledge that he is subservient to this act of Congress because \nhe feels that it is unconstitutional; that the Constitution has said he \nis Commander in Chief and he has the right to make decisions with \nrespect to the Armed Forces of the United States on a minute's notice. \nReally, this is what concerns me about this amendment, among other \nthings.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield so I can respond to the \nquestion.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If it took hours and hours, I think those hours and \nhours would be well spent, at least by comparison to what the Senate \ndoes on so many matters. And we might convene a little earlier. We \nmight adjourn a little later. We might work on Mondays and Fridays and \nmaybe even on Saturdays. I would not be concerned about the hours which \nwe would spend.\n  I think this Senator, after the 18 years and 5 months that I have \nbeen here, has given proper attention to the constitutional authority \nof the Congress to declare and/or involve the United States in war, or \nto the War Powers Act. This is a matter which first came to my \nattention in 1983 on the Lebanon matter when Senator Percy was chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee and I had a debate, a colloquy, \nabout whether Korea was a war, and Senator Percy said it was. Vietnam \nwas a war.\n  At that time, I undertook to draft a complex complaint trying to get \nthe acquiescence of the President--President Reagan was in the White \nHouse at that time--which Senator Baker undertook to see if we could \nhave a judicial determination as to the constitutionality of the War \nPowers Act.\n  It is true, as the Senator from Virginia says, that Presidents have \nalways denied it. They have denied it in complying with it. They send \nover the notice called for under the act, and then they put in a \ndisclaimer.\n  But I think the War Powers Act has had a profoundly beneficial \neffect, because Presidents have complied with it even while denying it.\n  But I think it is high time that Congress stood up on its hind legs \nand said we are not going to be involved in wars unless Congress \nauthorizes them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, perhaps when I said hours and hours, it \ncould be days and days. But we would come out with the same result. \nPresidents haven't complied with the act. They have ``complied with the \nspirit of the act.'' I believe that is how they have acknowledged it in \nthe correspondence with the Congress.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, I think ``complied with the act''--the \nact requires certain notification, certain statements of the President. \nThey make the statements which the act calls for, and then they add an \naddendum, ``but we do not believe we are obligated to do so.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me ask another question of my \ncolleague. We will soon be receiving a briefing from the Secretaries of \nState, Defense and the National Security Adviser and the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs. I will absent myself during that period, and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania will have the opportunity to control the \nfloor. I hope there would be no unanimous consent requests in my \nabsence. I hope that would be agreeable with my good friend, because I \nhave asked for this meeting.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator may be assured there will be no unanimous \nconsent requests for any effort to do anything but to play by the \nMarquis of Queensberry rules.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is fine. I asked for this meeting and have arranged \nit for the Senate. So I have to go upstairs. But I point out: Suppose \nwe were to adopt this, and supposing that during the month of August \nwhen the Senate would be in recess the President had to make a decision \nwith regard to ground troops. Then he would have to, practically \nspeaking, bring the Congress back to town. Would that not be correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That would be correct. That is exactly what he ought to \ndo. Before we involve ground troops, the Congress of the United States \ncould interrupt the recess and come back and decide this important \nissue.\n  Mr. WARNER. But the reason for introducing ground troops, whatever it \nmay be, might require a decision of less than an hour to make on behalf \nof the Chief Executive, the Commander in Chief, and he would be then \nshackled with the necessary time of, say, maybe 48 hours in which to \nbring the Members of Congress back from various places throughout the \nUnited States and throughout the world. To me, that imposes on the \nPresident something that was never envisioned by the Founding Fathers. \nAnd that is why he is given the power of Commander in Chief. Our power \nis the power of the purse, to\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nwhich I again direct the Senator's attention in the text of the \namendment. But it seems to me I find the title in conflict with the \ntext of the amendment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I said during the course of my presentation, Mr. \nPresident, I think the Commander in Chief does have authority to act in \nan emergency. I made a clear-cut delineation as I presented the \nargument that when there is time for deliberation, as, for example, on \nthe missile strikes in Iraq, or as, for example, on the gulf war \nresolution, it ought to be considered, debated and decided by the \nCongress.\n  Mr. WARNER. How do we define ``emergency?'' Where the President can \nact without approval by the Congress, and in other situations where he \nmust get the approval, who makes that decision?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think that our English language is capable of \nstructuring a definition of what constitutes an emergency.\n  Mr. WARNER. Where is it found in this amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think the President has the authority to act as \nCommander in Chief without that kind of specification, and it is not \nnow on the face of this amendment. However, it may be advisable to take \nthe extra precaution, with modification offered and agreed to by \nunanimous consent in the presence of the Senator from Virginia, to \nspell that out as well, although I think unnecessarily so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I must depart and go upstairs to this \nmeeting. But I will return as quickly as I can. I thank the Senator for \nhis courtesy of protecting the floor in the interests of the manager of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is aware that the Senator from Virginia will \nat an appropriate time move to table, and in all probability I will \nreserve the right to object to this amendment until the Senator from \nPennsylvania seeks to amend the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Members of the \nSenate that under the previous order Senator Allard is to be recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \nfrom Colorado will work that out between them. I hope they can reach an \naccommodation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may, I understand that the Senator \nfrom Virginia has articulated his views about a unanimous consent, and \nthat is fine. Those are his rights. But it may be that there will be an \nadditional amendment which I will file taking into account any \nmodifications which I might want to make which might be objected to. So \nwe can work it out in due course.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Does the Senator from Colorado have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is to have 20 \nminutes at 4 o'clock under the previous order. The 20 minutes is on the \namendment, not on the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might clarify the situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before the Senator from Pennsylvania specifically advised \nme he was going to assert his rights, which he has since his amendment \nwas the pending business of the Senate following the three votes, I put \nin place a modest time slot for our colleague from Colorado, such that \nhe could address the Senate on the general provisions of the underlying \nbill. But then we reached a subsequent time agreement to accommodate \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  It is my request, in the course of this debate, if the Senator could, \nwithin the parameters of the two unanimous consents, work out a \nsituation where he could have about 15 minutes and then we could return \nto your debate?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do not understand that. If you are \nasking me to give time----\n  Mr. WARNER. Not from your time agreement. It would be totally \nseparate. In other words, your 90 minutes, now the subject of the \nsecond unanimous consent agreement, would be preserved. That is as it \nwas written. But can the Senator accommodate sliding that to some point \nin time to allow the Senator from Colorado to have 15 minutes?\n  Mr. ALLARD. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Senator from Colorado \nhas the floor for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be delighted to accommodate the Senator from \nColorado one way or the other. He can speak now and then we can go back \nto our time agreement on the pending amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have been waiting. I was here most of the morning and \nthen waiting this afternoon for 3 hours to have an opportunity to make \nsome general comments on this bill. I do not anticipate taking much \nlonger. My agreement is 20 minutes, if I remember correctly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Maybe there would be an opportunity--I would like to get \nin on this meeting Senator Warner is attending at some point in time--\nprobably the last part of it. But I would like to have the opportunity \nto address this bill.\n  What is it the Senator from Pennsylvania is seeking, as far as the \nprivilege of the floor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond, I am delighted to have \nthe Senator from Colorado use his 20 minutes, which is ordered at this \ntime.\n  Mr. WARNER. With no subtraction whatsoever from the unanimous consent \nin place for the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is the understanding the Senator had spoken to \nearlier.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point in time, the Senator from \nColorado has the floor for 20 minutes. The Senator is advised, with \nregard to the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania, 25 minutes \nremains for the Senator from Pennsylvania and 38\\1/2\\ minutes, \napproximately, remains for the opposition.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of S. 1059, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.\n  As the Personnel Subcommittee chairman, I take great pleasure in \nwhich Senator Cleland, the ranking member, and the other members of the \nsubcommittee were able to provide for our men and women in uniform. \nEvery leader in the military tells me the same thing, without the \npeople the tools are useless. We must take care of our people and the \npersonnel provisions in this bill were developed in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n  This bill is responsive to the manpower readiness needs of the \nmilitary services; supports numerous quality of life improvements for \nour service men and women, their families, and the retiree community; \nand reflects the budget realities that we face today and will face in \nthe future.\n  First, military manpower strength levels. The bill adds 92 Marine \npersonnel over the administration's request for an active duty end \nstrength of 1,384,889. It also recommends a reserve end strength of \n874,043--745 more than the administration requested.\n  The bill also modifies but maintains the end-strength floors. While I \ndo not believe that end-strength floors are a practical force \nmanagement tool, I am personally concerned that the strength levels of \nthe active and reserve forces are too low and that the Department of \nDefense is paying other bills by reducing personnel. Therefore, it is \nnecessary to send a message to the administration that they cannot \npermit personnel levels to drop below the minimums established by the \nCongress.\n  On military personnel policy, there are a number of provisions \nintended to support the recruiting and retention and personnel \nmanagement of the services. Among the most noteworthy, are the several \nprovisions that permit the services to offer 2-year enlistments with \nbonuses and other incentives. This is a pilot program in which students \nin college or vocational or technical schools could enlist and remain \nin school for 2 years before they actually go on active duty.\n  Many Senators have expressed their concerns about the operational \ntempo of the military. That is why this bill attempts to address this \nproblem by requiring the services to closely manage the Personnel and \nDeployment Tempo of military personnel. We would require a general or \nflag officer to approve deployments over 180 days in a\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\nyear; a four-star general or admiral to approve deployments over 200 \ndays and would authorize a $100 per diem pay for each day a service \nmember is deployed over 220 days. The briefings and hearings in the \npersonnel subcommittee have found that the single most cited reason for \nseparation is time away from home and families. At the same time, the \nservices have not been effective in managing the Personnel and \nDeployment Tempo for their personnel. I am confident that the provision \nwill focus the necessary attention on the management of this problem.\n\n  Another important provision is the expansion of Junior ROTC or JROTC \nprograms. A number of members and the service Chiefs and personnel \nChiefs told me that they believed Junior ROTC is an important program \nand that an expansion was not only warranted but needed. Thus we have \nadded $39 million to expand the JROTC programs. These funds will permit \nthe Army to add 114 new schools; the Navy to add 63 new schools; the \nAir Force to add 63 new schools; and the Marine Corps to exhaust their \nwaiting list to 32 schools. This is a total of 272 new JROTC programs \nin our school districts across the country. I am proud to be able to \nsupport these important programs that teach responsibility, leadership, \nethics, and assist in military recruiting.\n  In military compensation, our major recommendations are extracted \nfrom S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of \nRights Act of 1999. First, this bill authorizes a 4.8-percent pay raise \neffective January 1, 2000 and a restructuring of the pay tables \neffective July 1, 2000.\n  Another provision includes a Thrift Savings Plan for active forces \nand the ready reserves and a plan to offer service members who entered \nthe service on or after August 1, 1986, the option to receive a $30,000 \nbonus and remain under the ``Redux'' retirement or to change to the \n``High-three'' retirement system. In order to assist the active and \nreserve military forces in recruiting, there are a series of bonuses \nand new authorities to support the ability of our recruiters to attract \nqualified young men and women to serve in the armed forces. There are \nalso several new bonuses and special pays to incentivize aviators, \nsurface warfare officers, special warfare officers, air crewmen among \nothers to remain on active duty. Two additional provisions from S. 4 \nare in this bill. A special retention initiative would permit a service \nsecretary to match the thrift savings contribution of service members \nin critical specialties in return for an extended service commitment. \nAlso, thanks to the hard work of Senator McCain and Senator Roberts, \nanother provision authorizes a special subsistence allowance for junior \nenlisted personnel who qualify for food stamps.\n  In health care, there are several key recommendations. There is a \nprovision that would require the Secretary of Defense to implement a \nnumber of initiatives to improve delivery of health care under TriCare. \nAnother provision would require each Lead Agent to establish a patient \nadvocate to assist beneficiaries in resolving problems they may \nencounter with TriCare.\n  Finally there are a number of general provisions including one to \nenforce the reductions in management headquarters personnel Congress \ndirected several years ago and several to assist the Department of \nDefense Dependents School System to provide quality education for the \nchildren of military personnel overseas.\n  Before I close, as a first time Senator subcommittee chair, I express \nmy appreciation to Senator Cleland for his leadership and assistance \nthroughout this year as we worked in a bipartisan manner to develop \nprograms which enhance personnel readiness and quality of life \nprograms. I also thank the members of the subcommittee, Senator \nThurmond, Senator McCain, Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy, and Senator \nReed, and their staffs. Their hard work made our work better and helped \nme focus on those issues which have the greatest impact on soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines.\n  Mr. President, I finish by thanking Chairman Warner for the \nopportunity to point out some of the highlights in the bill which the \nPersonnel Subcommittee has oversight and to congratulate him and \nSenator Levin on the bipartisan way this bill was accomplished and ask \nthat all Senators strongly support S. 1059.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under control. If neither side \nyields time, time will simply run equally.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. The Senator from Delaware is here and I \nwill be happy to yield--how much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents of the amendment have 38 minutes \nand approximately 10 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that divided in some way or under the control of \nSenator Warner and myself? How is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager of the bill is designated to be in \ncharge of the opposition.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be necessarily brief.\n  It is not often I disagree with my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter. I think he is right in the fundamental sense that if the \nPresident is going to send American ground forces into a war, it needs \ncongressional authority.\n  Very honestly, this amendment is, in my view, flawed. First of all, \nit is clear that the President has to come to Congress to use ground \nforces and that the President has already stated--I will ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record a copy of his letter dated April 28, \n1999, to the Speaker of the House in which he says in part:\n\n       Indeed, without regard to our differing constitutional \n     views on the use of force, I would ask for Congressional \n     support before introducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo \n     into a non-permissive environment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 28, 1999.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: I appreciate the opportunity to continue \n     to consult closely with the Congress regarding events in \n     Kosovo.\n       The unprecedented unity of the NATO Members is reflected in \n     our agreement at the recent summit to continue and intensify \n     the air campaign. Milosevic must not doubt the resolve of the \n     NATO alliance to prevail. I am confident we will do so \n     through use of air power.\n       However, were I to change my policy with regard to the \n     introduction of ground forces, I can assure you that I would \n     fully consult with the Congress. Indeed, without regard to \n     our differing constitutional views on the use of force, I \n     would ask for Congressional support before introducing U.S. \n     ground forces into Kosovo into a non-permissive environment. \n     Milosevic can have no doubt about the resolve of the United \n     States to address the security threat to the Balkans and the \n     humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. The refugees must be allowed \n     to go home to a safe and secure environment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, not only must the President, but he said he \nwould.\n  This amendment is flawed in two respects. First, as a constitutional \nmatter, I believe it is unnecessary. The Constitution already bars \noffensive military action by the President unless it is congressionally \nauthorized or under his emergency powers.\n  The Senate resolution we adopted only authorizes the use of airpower. \nIf Congress adopts this amendment, it seems to me we will imply the \nPresident has carte blanche to take offensive action, and anywhere else \nunless the Congress makes a specific statement to the contrary in \nadvance. In short, I think it will tender an invitation to Presidents \nin the future to use force whenever they want unless Congress provides \na specific ban in advance.\n  Putting that aside, however, the amendment is flawed because its \nexceptions are much too narrowly drawn. The amendment purports to bar \nthe use of Armed Forces in response to an attack against Armed Forces.\n  For example, we have thousands of soldiers now in Albania and \nMacedonia.\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\n Let's suppose the Yugoslav forces launch an attack against U.S. forces \nin Albania or in Macedonia. This amendment would bar the use of ground \nforces to respond by going into Kosovo.\n  The power to respond against such an attack is clearly within the \npower of the Commander in Chief. So, too, does the President have the \npower to launch a preemptive strike against an imminent attack. The \nU.S. forces do not have to wait until they take the first punch.\n  The second point I will make in this brief amount of time I am taking \nis that the amendment does not appear to permit the use of U.S. forces \nin the evacuation of Americans. Most constitutional scholars concede \nthe President has the power to use force in emergency circumstances to \nprotect American citizens facing an imminent and direct threat to their \nlives.\n  In sum, notwithstanding the fact that my colleague from Pennsylvania \nis going to amend his own amendment, it does not, in my view, appear to \nbe necessary and it unconstitutionally restricts recognized powers of \nthe President.\n  This comes from a guy--namely me--who has spent the bulk of the last \n25 years arguing that the President has to have congressional authority \nto use force in circumstances such as this, and he does. But to bar \nfunds in advance, before a President even attempts to use ground \nforces, in the face of him saying he will not use them and in the face \nof a letter in which he says he will not send them without seeking \nCongress' authority, seems to me to not only be constitutionally \nunnecessary but sends an absolutely devastating signal to Mr. Milosevic \nand others.\n  For example, I, for one, have been encouraging the Secretary of \nDefense, our National Security Adviser, and the President of the United \nStates to get about the business of prepositioning right now the 50,000 \nforces they say will be needed in a permissive environment. That is an \nenvironment where there is a peace agreement. If tomorrow peace broke \nout in Yugoslavia, if Mr. Milosevic yielded to the demands of NATO, \nthere would be chaos in Kosovo because there would be no force to put \nin place in order to ensure the agreement.\n  I worry that an amendment at this moment not only is unnecessary but \nwould send a signal to suggest that we should not even be \nprepositioning American forces for deployment in a peaceful \nenvironment. I think it is unnecessary.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence and my colleague for the time. I \noppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Before the distinguished Senator from Delaware leaves \nthe floor, if I may have his attention. I say to Senator Biden, may I \nhave your attention?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The arguments which you have made stem from your stated \nposition that the President really ought to have congressional \nauthorization to use force. If the legislative approach is not to \nrequire him to come to Congress before the use of force, but to await \nhis using force, then are we not really in a situation where we face \nthe impossible predicament of seeking to cut off funds from the middle \nof a military operation which is untenable? Or to articulate the \nquestion more precisely: What would you suggest as a way to accomplish \nthe constitutional principle you agree with, that only the Congress has \nthe authority to authorize the use of force, with the current \ncircumstances?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I may respond, I think that is a fair \nquestion. I think I, quite frankly and bluntly, accomplished that. The \nway I did that--the Senator was in that same meeting. We were in the \nsame meeting. I think it was the 28th, you said. I do not remember the \nexact date.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It was.\n  Mr. BIDEN. He may recall that I am the one who stood up and said: Mr. \nPresident, you do not have the authority to send in ground troops \nwithout congressional authorization. Since you have said, Mr. \nPresident, you have no intention of doing that, why don't you \naffirmatively send a letter to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives committing that you will not do that without their \nauthority? He said: I will. And he did. I think we accomplished that.\n  To now say that we are going to add to that the requirement to cut \noff funds, that we will cut off funds, is a very direct way of saying: \nWe don't trust you, Mr. President. You gave your word; you put it in \nwriting; you put your signature on it; and we still don't trust you.\n  I am not prepared to vote for that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would disagree with the statement of my \ncolleague from Delaware that we say, ``we do not trust you, Mr. \nPresident,'' by noting that the President might change his mind. He has \nbeen known to do that. Other Presidents have, and even the Senator from \nDelaware and the Senator from Pennsylvania have been known to change \ntheir minds.\n  The other concern is that if you have it on a personal basis, in a \nletter, it really does not have the force of law. And we are \nconsistently moving in the Congress to where there has been an \nexecutive order, which is a good bit more formal than the letter that \nthe Senator from Delaware refers to, to make sure that it is governed \nby law as opposed to a personal commitment or what might be said.\n  But let me articulate a question in a different context.\n  Aside, hypothetically, absent a letter, what would the legislative \napproach be to limit a President from exercising his powers as \nCommander in Chief short of cutting off funds once he has already done \nso? It seems to me that we have a choice. We can either say in advance: \nYou may not do it unless you have our prior approval; or say nothing \nonce the President uses force, and then cut off the funds, which \nappears to me to be untenable.\n  Is there a third alternative?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, Mr. President. I think there is. If I may respond.\n  There are several. There is a third and a fourth alternative. One of \nthe alternatives would be, were the resolution merely to say: Mr. \nPresident, by concurrent resolution, we believe you do not have the \nauthority to put ground troops in place without our authorization; we \nexpected that you would request of us that authorization before you \ndid, that would create an incredibly difficult political barrier for \nany President to overcome. It would not be an advance cutoff of funds.\n\n  I do not recall where we have in advance--in advance of a President \ntaking an action--told him that we would limit the availability of \nfunds for an action he says he has not contemplated undertaking in \nadvance. I think it is a bad way to conduct foreign policy. I think it \ncomplicates the circumstance. It sends, at a minimum, a conflicting \nmessage. At a minimum, it sends the message to Europe, for example, and \nour allies, that we, the U.S. Congress, think the President is about to \nsend American forces in when he has not said he wishes to do that.\n  Secondly, it says in advance, to our enemies, that the President \ncannot send in ground forces unless he undoes an action already taken, \ngiving an overwhelming prejudice to the point of view that the \nPresident could never get the support to use ground forces.\n  I understand my friend from Pennsylvania--and I have said this \nbefore, and I mean it sincerely, there is no one in this body I respect \nmore than him, but he has indicated that he would be amenable to a \nconsideration of the use of ground forces, if asked. But I suspect that \nis not how this will be interpreted in not only Belgrade but other \nparts of the world. I think it will be interpreted as the Senate saying \nthey do not want ground troops to be put in under any circumstances. \nThat is not what he is saying. But that is, I believe, how it will be \ninterpreted.\n  So let me sum up my response to the Senator's question: A, we could, \nin fact, say to the President: Mr. President, if you are going to use \nground forces, come and ask us, with no funds cut off in terms of a \nresolution.\n  Secondly, we could say to the President: Mr. President, we have your \nletter in hand. We take you at your word and expect that that is what \nyou would do, memorializing the political context in which this \ndecision was made, which Presidents are loath to attempt to overcome.\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\n  The bottom line is, the President of the United States can in fact go \nahead and disregard this as easily as he could disregard the provisions \nof the Constitution. If a President were going to decide that he would \ndisregard the constitutional requirement of seeking our authority to \nuse ground forces, I respectfully suggest he would not be at all \nhesitant to overcome a prohibition in an authorization bill saying no \nfunds authorized here could be used.\n  He could argue that funds that have already been authorized have put \nforce in place, with bullets in their guns, gasoline in their tanks, \nfuel in their aircraft; that he has the authority to move \nnotwithstanding this prohibition.\n  I understand the intention of my friend from Pennsylvania. I applaud \nit. I think it is unnecessary in a very complex circumstance and \nsituation in which the President of the United States has indicated he \ndoes not intend to do it anyway. And I just think it sends all the \nwrong messages and is unnecessary and is overly restrictive.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Delaware has mentioned a third option \nto the two I suggested.\n  The third option is for us to send a resolution saying don't do it \nunless we authorize it, but not binding him. Saying that would \ncertainly impose a political restraint on the President--not doing it, \nin the face of our requesting him not to without our prior \nauthorization. I understand his third alternative, but I do not draw \nmuch solace from it, just as a matter of my own response.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator would yield, I am not suggesting----\n  Mr. SPECTER. My time is running out. Let me finish my statement. Then \nyou have quite a bit of time left. Let me just finish the thought.\n  I do not think it goes far enough to say: We request that you not do \nit unless we give you prior authorization. Because that kind of a \ngentle suggestion--and I can understand the gentility of my colleague \nfrom Delaware--would not go very far, I think, with this President or \nmight not go very far with the Senator from Delaware or would not \npredetermine what the Senator from Pennsylvania would do.\n  When the Senator from Delaware talks about the President flying in \nthe face of a cutoff of funds, I think that the President would be \nloath to do that. I think there he might really get into the Boland \namendment or challenging the Congress on the power of the purse.\n  The Presidents have gotten away with disregarding the congressional \nmandate that only Congress can declare war. They have gotten away with \nit for a long time. It has been eroded. Presidents feel comfortable in \ndoing that. But if the Congress said: No funds may be used, as this \namendment does--maybe it needs to be a little tighter here or there--I \nthink the President would proceed at his peril to violate that \nexpressed constitutional authority in Congress to control the power of \nthe purse. I am very much interested in my colleague's response, but I \nhope it will be on his time.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield me 2 \nminutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield. May I inquire of the Chair how \nmuch time the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-two minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and I had an \namendment to attempt to preauthorize the use of ground forces. The \nCongress debated, as the Parliamentarian can tell us, in the context of \nthe War Powers Act, having been triggered by a letter sent by the \nPresident to the Congress.\n  We have already spoken. We have already spoken as a Congress. We have \nmade it clear to the President of the United States, unfortunately, in \nmy view, that under the War Powers Act, we believe he should not at \nthis moment be introducing ground forces because the McCain-Biden \namendment was defeated, which was an affirmative attempt to give him \nauthority in advance to use ground forces. So we have already debated \nthis issue of ground forces in the context of the War Powers Act, which \nwas one of the two documents cited by the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nthe other being the U.S. Constitution. I argue we have done that.\n  Second, I point out that I can't imagine a modern-day President, in \nthe face of an overwhelming or even majority congressional decision, \nsaying you should not use force and having the political will or \ncourage to go ahead and use it anyway. I do not think such a \ncircumstance exists. If you think this President is likely to do that, \nthen you have a view of his willingness to take on the Congress that \nexceeds that of almost anyone I know.\n  The idea that this President, in this context, having said so many \ntimes that he would not and does not want to use ground forces, would \nfly in the face of a majority of the Members of the Congress saying he \nshould not do it without coming here, in what everyone would \nacknowledge would be a difficult political decision to make in any \ninstance and difficult military decision to make, and then if, in fact, \nhe is not immediately successful, I believe everyone in this Chamber \nwould acknowledge that it would probably effectively bring this \nPresidency down. I just can't imagine that being the matter.\n  Let me conclude by saying, Professor Corwin is credited with having \nsaid that the Constitution merely issues an invitation to the President \nand the Senate does battle over who controls the foreign policy. Seldom \nwill Presidents take action that is totally contrary to the expressed \nviews of the Congress which risk American lives and clearly would \nresult in American body bags coming home.\n  I wish he had a view different than the one I am asserting, because I \nthink we need to have that option open and real. I am not sure it is. I \nam almost positive there is no reasonable prospect this President, or \nfor that matter the last President, would have moved in the face of the \nCongress having already stated its views that it was not willing to \ngive him that power in advance, which is another way of saying: Mr. \nPresident, if you want this power, come and ask us.\n  So I think it is unnecessary. I think it is redundant. I think it has \nalready been spoken to as it relates to the War Powers Act. I think it \nis a well-intended, mistaken notion as to how we should be limiting \nthis President's use of ground forces.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding me that time.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nthose comments. I think it all boils down to whether the President \nwould feel compelled by a political situation, a statement by Congress, \nto not send in ground troops.\n  I acknowledged in my opening comments that he had made that \ncommitment, which I heard and spoke about, on April 28. But I believe \nwe ought to be bound by the rule of law, not be dependent upon a change \nof mind by the President, and memorialize it in this statute. Congress \nought to assert its authority to declare war and have the United States \nengaged in war and to do it with the force of law with this kind of an \namendment, perhaps somewhat modified.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. It would send the \nworst possible signal, I believe, to Milosevic at this time. A kind of \n``don't worry'' signal, if you weather the storm, no matter how \nweakened your military is, the President isn't going to be able to go \nin even in a semipermissive environment in order to return the \nrefugees, because Congress has tied his hands, tied the purse to say \nthat only if Congress affirmatively approves the expenditure of funds, \nthen and only then could ground forces go in, even in a semipermissive \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-seven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  I can't think of a worse signal to send to Milosevic in the middle of \na conflict than this amendment would send to him. Congressional \ngridlock is not unheard of around here. We have plenty of examples of \nCongress being unable to act. We had a recent example\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\nin the House where the House could not even agree to support an air \ncampaign that is presently going on, a tie vote.\n  Under this funding cutoff approach, that air campaign presumably \nwould not be able to continue under a comparable resolution applying to \nthe use of military forces.\n  I know this only applies to ground forces and not to an air campaign, \nbut that vote in the House of Representatives is a wonderful example of \nhow Milosevic, when he looked at this resolution, would say, well, gee, \nthis would require Congress to affirmatively act, and since the House \ncan't even get a majority to act to support an ongoing operation, I \ncould comfortably rely, he would say to himself, on the fact that they \nwould never authorize in advance a ground campaign, even in a \nsemipermissive environment.\n  The President has been criticized for taking the possibility of \nground troops off the table. The argument is that Milosevic doesn't \nhave to worry as much about that possibility, given the position of the \nadministration. I think we ought to want Milosevic to worry and to \nworry more, not less. This is a ``worry less'' amendment, not a ``worry \nmore'' amendment. This says Congress would have to affirmatively \napprove ground forces in advance, even in a semipermissive environment, \nand it seems to me Milosevic could quite comfortably say to himself \nthat is not a very strong likelihood.\n  There are a lot of practical problems with the wording of this \namendment. For instance, what happens if U.S. intelligence discovered \nthat American forces in Albania or in Macedonia were about to be \nattacked by Yugoslav army forces and it was determined to be necessary \nfor U.S. ground forces to conduct a preemptive attack into Kosovo in \nself-defense? We are just about ready to be attacked; can we hit the \nattacker? Not under this amendment. You have to come to Congress first.\n  Our military would be told, whoops, you are about to be attacked in \nAlbania or Macedonia, but Congress passed a law saying they have to \nauthorize the use of ground forces. Do we want to tie the hands of our \ncommanders that way in the middle of a conflict, to tell our commanders \nthat even in circumstances where they think they are about to be hit \nthat they cannot preemptively go after the attackers in Kosovo with \nground forces? They have to then just take it on the chin?\n  And what if U.S. forces in Albania or Macedonia were attacked by \nYugoslav army forces, actually attacked in Macedonia or Albania. Would \ncounterattacking U.S. forces have to stop at the Kosovo border, thereby \ngiving the Yugoslav army a haven from which they could conduct ground \nattacks across the border but not be pursued by American ground forces? \nThe commander would have to stop at the border and come to Congress? So \nit is the worst kind of signal we could give in the middle of a \nconflict to Mr. Milosevic, and it creates burdens on our commanders \nthat are intolerable in the middle of a conflict.\n\n  We have been advised by the Department of Defense on this amendment \nthat ``it is so restrictive of U.S. operations and so injurious to our \nrole in the alliance that the President's senior advisers would \nstrongly recommend that the final bill be vetoed if this language is \nincluded in the bill.'' That is information we have just received from \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Gridlock. Fifty votes in the House. Now, under this amendment, we \nhave to affirmatively approve something. What happens if a majority of \nus want to approve it but we are filibustered? The Senator from \nPennsylvania said, well, those are the rules.\n  Those are the rules. But under his amendment, it would mean that even \nif a majority of the Senate wanted to give approval to ground forces, a \nminority in the Senate could thwart that action.\n  I think this is the kind of tying of our hands in the middle of a \nconflict that would tell Milosevic this country is not serious about \nthe NATO mission. This NATO mission is so critical in terms of the \nfuture of Europe; it is so critical in terms of the stability not only \nof Europe but of the North Atlantic community that for us to adopt \nlanguage that in advance says you can't do something without Congress \nacting, knowing, as we do, how difficult it is to get Congress to act \neven in the middle of a conflict, would be simply a terrible result for \nthe success of our mission.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we want, I hope, to do two things. One is \nto tell the President, as we have, how important it is that there be \nconsultation and that he seek support from the Congress, and he has \ncommitted to do so. But that is a very different thing from what this \namendment provides. This is an advance funding cutoff, unless something \nhappens that can be thwarted by gridlock.\n  We should not ever forget the likelihood of gridlock in this \nCongress. Even if a majority wanted to support the use of ground forces \nin a nonpermissive environment, a minority of the Senate could thwart \nthat majority view. I believe the signal to Milosevic that he will be \nthe beneficiary of gridlock, and only if gridlock can be overcome would \nhe then have to fear the possibility of the use of ground forces, is a \nsignal that would undermine the current mission in a very significant \nway.\n  Again, reading from the information paper the Department of Defense \nhas shared with us this afternoon:\n\n       The Department strongly opposes this amendment because it \n     would unacceptably put at risk the lives of U.S. and NATO \n     military personnel, jeopardize the success of Operation \n     Allied Force, and inappropriately restrict the President's \n     options as Commander in Chief.\n\n  These are now the words of the information paper shared with us by \nthe Department:\n\n       . . . effectively give Milosevic advance notice of ground \n     action by NATO forces, should NATO commanders request \n     consideration of this option.\n\n  While we have made no decision to use ground forces in a \nnonpermissive environment, it would be a mistake to hamstring this \noption with a legislative requirement for prior congressional approval. \nThe Department says:\n\n       This would be construed to prohibit certain intelligence or \n     reconnaissance operations essential to a successful \n     prosecution of Operation Allied Force. It would prohibit any \n     preemptive attack by U.S. forces based on advance warning or \n     suspicion of an impending attack by the Yugoslav forces. It \n     would prohibit U.S. ground personnel from pursuing those \n     forces, conducting hit and run, or similar attacks across \n     international boundaries.\n\n  But the words that we should pay the most heed to in this memorandum \nfrom the Department of Defense--the words that I hope this Senate will \nthink very carefully about before we consider adopting this amendment--\nare that the Department strongly opposes amendment No. 383 because it \nwould ``unacceptably put at risk the lives of U.S. and NATO military \npersonnel and jeopardize the success of Operation Allied Force.''\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in listening to the comments of the \nSenator from Michigan, every single objection and argument he has \nraised applies equally to the President's commitment by letter to come \nto the Congress before he would use ground forces.\n  When he says it would be the worst signal to Milosevic, the President \ngave that signal personally when he said it gives Milosevic advance \nnotice. That is exactly what the President would be doing in coming to \nCongress. When he says there could be no intelligence or \nreconnaissance, that is exactly what would happen by the President's \ncommitment. When he says it would preclude a preemptive strike, that is \nexactly what the President has done. When he says it puts at risk U.S. \nmilitary personnel, that is precisely what the President has done.\n  When they talk about a veto, it is the same old threat--senior \nadvisers threatening to veto. I think this may be a better amendment \nthan I had originally contemplated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the opponents have how much time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 16 minutes 44 seconds. The \nproponents have 11 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for what he is \ntrying to do with his amendment, to protect the prerogatives of the \nSenate and the requirements of the War Powers Resolution with respect \nto the actions of our armed services abroad. Although I understand it \nmay be modified, I think I will be able to support this amendment. I \nshare the Senator's commitment to protecting the war powers granted to \nthe Congress by the Founding Fathers and reaffirmed in the War Powers \nResolution.\n  That said, I hope that, should this amendment be adopted, the \nconferees will make an effort to better define the term \n``peacekeeping,'' for which the Senator has made an exception in his \namendment. I believe that all military deployments, subject to the \nexceptions laid out in the War Powers Resolution including peacekeeping \noperations, should receive authorization of the Congress. And, since \nthere currently is no peace to keep in Kosovo--and in fact NATO \ncontinues air strikes to this day--I hope that the Congress will define \nthe parameters of such an exception more specifically.\n  Mr. President, today is May 25, 1999, and in the context of the \nSenator's amendment I want to take the opportunity to remind the Senate \nof the significance of today's date.\n  Exactly 62 days ago, U.S. forces, as part of a NATO force, began air \nstrikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  Today marks the expiration of the 60-day time period after which the \nPresident--under the provisions of the War Powers Resolution--is \nrequired to withdraw our Armed Forces from their participation in the \nair strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  Exactly 60 days ago--48 hours after the air strikes began--the \nPresident was required under section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers \nResolution to submit a detailed report to the Congress regarding the \nactions he ordered our troops to take.\n  No such report has been submitted. Rather, the Congress was notified \nof the U.S. participation in the NATO air strikes by a letter from the \nPresident that he says is--``consistent''--with the War Powers \nResolution.''\n\n  ``Consistent'' or not, I do not believe that the President's letter \nsatisfies the requirements of the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, \nin my view, the War Powers Resolution stands as the law of the land, \nand the President should comply with it. So it follows, then, that if \nthe President fails to withdraw our troops by midnight tonight--and of \ncourse it is clear that they will remain in the region long after the \nclock strikes twelve--the President will be in violation of the \nprovisions of the War Powers Resolution.\n  I find it disturbing that this important date of May 25 will come and \ngo with no action to remove our troops from the region. Indeed, I am \nafraid that this Congress is ignoring the significance of this date \ncompletely. In fact, I am not sure that the significance of this date \nhas been noted by any of my colleagues during debate on this Specter \namendment.\n  The War Powers Resolution provides that the President shall terminate \nthe use of our Armed Forces for the purpose outlined in the report \nrequired under section 4(a)(1) of the Act after 60 days unless one of \nthe three things has happened:\n  The Congress has declared war or has enacted a specific authorization \nfor the use of the military; the Congress has extended by law the 60-\nday time period; or the President is not able to withdraw the forces \nbecause of an armed attack against the United States.\n  In addition, the President may extend this time period by 30-days if \nhe certifies in writing to the Congress that it is unsafe to withdraw \nthe forces at the end of the 60 days.\n  Sixty days have come and gone, Mr. President, and none of these \nthings has happened.\n  The Congress has not declared war, nor has it authorized this action.\n  The Congress has not extended the 60-day time period.\n  The United States has not been attacked.\n  The President has not certified in writing to the Congress that an \nadditional 30 days are necessary to ensure the safe withdrawal of our \ntroops.\n  As my colleagues know, I voted against the ongoing NATO air strikes \nagainst the FRY, and I am deeply troubled that U.S. participation in \nthem continues despite the fact that Congress was divided on whether to \nauthorize them. In addition, the resolution which this body adopted and \non which the other body deadlocked was not a joint resolution that \nwould have authorized the military action, by law.\n  No, Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 21 is a sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution that does not carry the force of law.\n  The Senate also considered a joint resolution offered by the Senator \nfrom Arizona [Mr. McCain] which, if adopted by both Houses of Congress, \nwould have given the President the specific statutory authorization \nrequired under the War Powers Resolution to continue the use of our \nArmed Forces in the action against the FRY. In fact, Mr. President, \nthat sweeping resolution would have allowed the President to expand \nthis participation as he saw fit. While I opposed this resolution, I am \npleased that the Senate debated it and voted on it as we unequivocally \nwere obliged to do under the War Powers Resolution.\n  I am afraid that the debate and votes on the participation of the \nUnited States in Kosovo both here in the Senate, as well as in the \nother body, reflect the fact that there is no consensus in the Congress \nor in the country with regard to what we have already done in Kosovo, \nlet alone a consensus on whether to expand the U.S. mission there.\n  Sixty days have come and gone since the President failed to submit \nthe required report regarding U.S. participation in the air strikes \nagainst the FRY. Despite this regrettable inaction, the War Powers \nResolution clock began to tick 48 hours after the first bombs fell--the \ndate on which the President's report under section 4(a)(1) of the Act \nwas required to have been submitted. That's right, Mr. President, the \nclock begins to tick whether the President fulfills his obligation to \nsubmit the report or not. The vitality of the War Powers Resolution is \nunmistakable because that law states that the troops must be removed \n``. . . within 60 calendar days after a report is submitted or is \nrequired to be submitted pursuant to section 4(a)(1). . . .'' unless \none of the actions I mentioned earlier has occurred.\n  As the clock draws closer to midnight today, the sixtieth day, our \ntroops are performing admirably under hostile conditions. But time has \nalmost run out on the President to fulfil this legal obligations under \nthe War Powers Resolution.\n  Despite the fact that many in Congress oppose the current air \ncampaign, and despite the fact that our troops will soon be \nparticipating in this campaign in violation of the War Power \nResolution, members of this body last week adopted a massive spending \npackage in support of a military action that many of them oppose. I \nsupport fully our efforts to give our men and women in the field \neverything they need to maximize their chances of success and to \nminimize the risks they face.\n  Still, I voted against that package, both because of my continuing \nconcern over our unauthorized military involvement in the FRY and \nbecause of the non-emergency spending that was jammed into the so-\ncalled emergency bill.\n  So we are not at a critical juncture, Mr. President. The Congress has \nvoted to fund a military mission that it has not authorized, and the \nPresident has signed this bill even though he knows, as we know, that \nthe continued participation of our troops in this mission is in \nviolation of the War Powers Resolution.\n  One way or the other, consistent with the safety of our troops, it is \ntime for the President to comply with the War Powers Resolution by \nseeking--and gaining--the legal authorization of Congress to continue \nthis war, or by withdrawing our forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have not had an opportunity to read the \nletter from the President to the Speaker. It goes far short of the kind \nof commitment that has been represented--honestly represented. But the \nletter says in pertinent part: ``I can assure you\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nthat I will fully consult with the Congress'', which doesn't amount to \na whole lot. And then another line, ``I would ask for congressional \nsupport before introducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo into a \nnonpermissive environment''.\n  The language of support here again goes far short of committing to \ncongressional authorization such as is contained in this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask how much time I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, we have been conducting a \nmeeting for almost an hour in S-407, attended by the Secretary of \nState, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Adviser to \nthe President, Mr. Berger, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. In the \ncourse of their presentations to some 40-plus Senators, in response to \nquestions and in direct presentation, they reiterated that the \nPresident will formally come before the Congress and ask for any \nchanges he deems necessary involving ground troops before he would \nimplement or agree to implement with other NATO nations such a plan. \nThat has just been stated on two occasions up in S-407. There was no \nequivocation. It was very clear in their declaration on behalf of the \nPresident. I acquainted them with the amendment which is now being \ndebated on the floor of the Senate.\n  Earlier indications from the Secretary of Defense to me today were \nthat should this amendment as drawn now appear in a conference report, \nit would be the recommendation of the Secretaries of State and Defense \nto veto.\n  I am pointing out to the Senate that again we revisit many, many \ntimes this whole war powers concept. We acknowledge that both \nRepublican Presidents and Democrat Presidents have absolutely \nsteadfastly refused to comply with the letter of the law, but they have \ncomplied with the spirit of the law.\n  In this instance, the President has indicated to the Senate in that \nletter--and just now in the briefings by his principal Cabinet \nofficers--that he would formally--I use the word ``formal'' to \nclarify--come to the Congress and request their concurrence for any \ndeparture from his preposition. That preposition was just moments ago \nrestated by Secretaries Cohen and Albright in response to my question, \nwhich was, question No. 1, to allow me to return to the floor with \nregard to any nonpermissive force being put in place, which I favor, by \nthe way, to send a signal. They said that would not be done. The \nPresident has no intention of doing it, nor do the NATO allies. And \nshould the President decide at some later date, for whatever reason, to \nbegin to preposition such forces, then he would come before the \nCongress prior thereto and get legislative approval.\n\n  I believe very strongly that this amendment would put this bill in \nsevere jeopardy in terms of getting it signed, and that the President \nand his principal advisers have in the past and again today advised the \nCongress that the President is prepared to deal with the spirit of this \namendment and to come before the Congress and seek its formal \nconcurrence by legislative action should he and other NATO allies in \nthe future make a decision to depart from the present policy.\n  I have just been handed a modification. It is one that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and I have discussed. I don't know if my colleague \nhas had an opportunity to see it.\n  If there are other Senators who wish to speak, I need time within \nwhich to consider this modification. Unless other Senators seek \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank my distinguished senior colleague. One minute will \nbe sufficient because I know the chairman of the committee is about to \nmake a unanimous consent request.\n  I state to my good friend from Pennsylvania, I am very much opposed \nto this amendment. I cannot imagine a modification of this amendment \nthat would cause me to be supportive. We have already debated this \nessential question twice.\n  Congress has the power to declare war. If we are concerned about \nconsultation with the executive branch, as we speak consultation is \ntaking place up in S-407 in a classified briefing where the Secretary \nof Defense, the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been briefing all \nSenators on what is taking place, what has taken place, what will take \nplace and have again reaffirmed the intention of the President to \nconsult with the Congress before any change, particularly with respect \nto the implementation of any particular plan that might involve the \ncommitment of ground troops, takes place.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to look very seriously \nat the long-term implications. Think of the kind of message this sends \nto Milosevic. Think of the kind of message this sends to our 18 \nalliance partners, if we were to continue to try to take this type of \naction on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I urge a rejection of this particular amendment and I \nyield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that strong \nstatement. I am certainly of the same view.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when all time is used on \nthe pending Specter amendment, the amendment be temporarily set aside \nwith a vote occurring on or in relation to the amendment--there will be \na tabling motion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator repeat \nthat?\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me repeat it in its entirety. I have not asked \nunanimous consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when all time is used on the pending \nSpecter amendment, the amendment be temporarily set aside with a vote \noccurring on or in relation to the amendment following the debate on \nthe Gramm amendment.\n  That is the time sequence. As I have indicated, I will move to table \nthe Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the information of all Senators, the Gramm amendment \nwill be presented with a 1\\1/2\\-hour time agreement. Following that \ndebate, the Senate will proceed to two stacked votes, first on the \nSpecter amendment--and we have to reserve in here the amending of that \namendment, which could be amended--to be followed by a vote on the \nGramm amendment.\n  So we just have the sequencing of the debate, sequencing of the \nvotes. And we will momentarily, Senator Levin and I--I am prepared to \naccept the amendment as amended. The Senator is waiting for just one \nSenator to get concurrence.\n  So we have the unanimous consent in place. I have given information \nto the Senate with respect to the sequencing of the Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I ask my colleague from \nVirginia to insert 2 minutes on each side to argue in advance of the \nvote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have certainly no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Is there objection to \nthe request as modified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do Senators yield back their time on the \npending amendment? Who yields time on the pending amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, does Senator Specter want to reserve his \ntime, and I will reserve my time, and then we can proceed to the Gramm \namendment and come back to Senator Specter's amendment? I am sure he \nwill allow that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is agreeable. We will take up the Gramm amendment \nnow and then come back with the time I have reserved at that time.\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. And the time under the control of the Senator from \nVirginia, jointly shared with Senator Levin.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May the Record show I have made a request for a \nmodification of the amendment and I will send a copy of the requested \nmodification to the desk. I have already provided it to the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \ntime?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object and we will have to object--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Modifying the time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Chair just asked if there is objection to the \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Modification of the time. Is there objection \nto the modification? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, just so everybody can figure out when we \nare likely to vote, how much time remains on the Specter amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the Senator from Virginia has 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, hopefully, we can beat this 90-minute time \nlimit and have this debate more quickly.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 392\n\n(Purpose: To delete language which the Department of Justice has stated \nwould ``. . . seriously undermine the safety and security of America's \n                           federal prisons'')\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for myself, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Thurmond and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mr. Gramm), for himself, Mr. Hatch, \n     and Mr. Thurmond, proposes an amendment numbered 392.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 284, strike all on line 7 through line 14 on page \n     286.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Levin and I every year or two have \nthis debate. It is well known. We have debated it before. People have \nvoted before. In fact, 61 Members of the Senate voted with me 2 years \nago to substitute a study for the Levin amendment.\n  Let me add, the amendment is a little different than it was then. The \nthrust of it is basically the same. Two years ago, the Levin amendment \napplied to all procurement related to the prison industry system. This \nyear, it applies to only defense procurement. But while its focus has \nnarrowed, its impact on the work system within our prisons remains very \nbroad.\n  I remind my colleagues that we took up this issue on July 10 of 1997. \nThere was a vote at that time, and 62 Members--61 of whom are still \nMembers of the Senate--voted on this issue on a different day in a \nslightly different version. But the thrust of the issue, in terms of \nprocurement from the Federal prison industry system, is and was \nbasically the same.\n  Let me set out what I want to do in my opening statement. I want to \ntry to explain the problem in historical context, and I want to begin \nwith Alexis de Tocqueville. Then I want to come to the Depression, \nwhich was really fork in the road with regard to prison labor in \nAmerica. I want to talk about the fork we took, the wrong fork in my \nopinion. I want to talk about how the Levin amendment fits into the \nsystem which has evolved since then. I want to talk about why this \nprovision by Senator Levin, which Senator Hatch and Senator Thurmond \nand I hope to strike from the bill, is so devastating to the prison \nindustry system in America and why that, in turn, is harmful to every \ntaxpayer, to every victim of crime, to everyone who wants prisoners \nrehabilitated when they go back out on the street. In fact, there is no \ngood argument, it seems to me, when you fully understand this issue, \nfor the Levin amendment. I then want to talk in some detail about each \nof these items and then, obviously, at that point we will begin the \ndebate.\n  Let me start with de Tocqueville. As many of my colleagues will \nremember, de Tocqueville came to America in the 1830s. He wrote a book \nthat has become the greatest critique of America ever written--\n``Democracy in America.'' We forget that de Tocqueville came to America \nnot to study democracy but to study prisons. In fact, he wrote a book \non prisons, together with a fellow named Beaumont. We have forgotten \nBeaumont, but we remember de Tocqueville.\n  In his analysis of American prisons, which were very much studied in \nthe 1830s because they were part of the most enlightened prison system \nin the world, de Tocqueville praised at great length the fact that we \nrequired American prisoners to work. In that period, prison labor of 12 \nhours a day, 6 days a week was the norm. De Tocqueville says in his \nanalysis on American prisons:\n\n       It would be inaccurate to say that in the Philadelphia \n     penitentiary labor is imposed. We may say with more justice \n     that the favor of labor is granted. When we visit this \n     penitentiary, we successively conversed with all its inmates. \n     There was not a single one among them who did not speak of \n     labor with a kind of gratitude and who did not express the \n     idea that without the relief of constant occupation, life \n     would be insufferable.\n\n  The principal characteristic of the American prison system in the age \nthat Alexis de Tocqueville wrote that remark was that prisoners worked \nand they worked hard. They helped pay for the cost of incarceration by \nworking, and they produced things. Those products were sold on the open \nmarket in many cases. So the first obligation for feeding prisoners and \nincarcerating prisoners was borne not by the taxpayer but by the \nprisoner and, as de Tocqueville argues, I think quite impressively in \nthe book and in the quote I used, prisoners actually benefited from \nlabor because of the extreme boredom of being incarcerated with nothing \nto do. This was the norm in America from the 1830s, when Alexis de \nTocqueville wrote, for 100 years, until the 1930s.\n  What happened in the 1930s was that we passed a series of laws driven \nby special interests, principally labor and business, and you cannot \nget bigger special interests than that. These laws consisted basically \nof the following laws: the Hawes-Cooper Act which authorized States to \nban commerce in prison-made goods within their borders; the Sumners-\nAshurst Act which made it a Federal crime to transport prison-made \ngoods across State lines; and then another provision that said not only \ncan you not sell what prisoners produce, not only can you not transport \nit for sale, but if you do force prisoners to work, you have to pay \nthem the union scale set by the local union.\n  Guess what the result of those three laws was. The result of those \nthree laws was that we destroyed the greatest prison industry system \nthat the world had ever known. We destroyed that prison system by \neliminating our ability to force people in prison to work; and in doing \nso, force them to pay for part of the cost of their incarceration; and \nwe eliminated our ability to collect from them part of what they would \nearn working in prison or what would be earned by their work to pay for \nrestitution to victims of crime.\n  What was left after we destroyed the ability of American prisons to \nforce prisoners to work was the ability of prisoners to produce things \nthat were used by Government. As a result, we now find ourselves in a \nsituation where we have 1,100,000 Americans in prison. They are almost \nall male. They are almost all of prime working age. We spend $22,000 a \nyear keeping people in prison, which is nearly the cost of sending \nsomebody to the University of Chicago or to Harvard, and the cost of \nkeeping Americans in prison costs the average American taxpayer $200 a \nyear in taxes--just to keep people in prison.\n  The impact of the Levin amendment--I am sure he is going to gild this \nlily with lots of gold around the edges--but the impact of his \namendment is to take another major step in destroying prison labor in \nAmerica. What his bill would do is, for all practical purposes, take \naway about 60 percent of the work that Federal prisoners do now.\n  There are, obviously, two sides to these arguments. You can argue \nthat\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nwhen people are working in prison that there is someone else who might \nbenefit from getting the job if the prisoner were not working. It is \nhard to make that argument in America today when we have the lowest \nunemployment rate in 30 years and when, in towns like my hometown of \nCollege Station, college students go out and relax after classes and \nimpressment gangs come and virtually knock them in the head and drag \nthem off to a factory. So if there ever was an argument here that we \nneeded to take away prison work to protect American jobs, it is very \nhard to make that argument in May of 1999.\n  But here is the system we have now. We have a system called Federal \nPrison Industries where the Federal Government has work programs for \nprisoners. It pays them a very small incentive payment. It withholds \nabout 20 percent of that payment as restitution to victims of the \ncrimes they have committed. It produces component parts for various \nthings used by the Government. It produces furniture, it produces some \nelectronic components. Through this system, we have about 20,000 \nFederal prisoners who work.\n  Under this amendment, about 60 percent of that work would be taken \naway. Not only do I oppose this amendment, but the administration, in \nits Statement of Administration Policy on this defense bill, on page 3, \n``Federal Prison Industries Mandatory Source Exemption,'' opposes the \nLevin amendment.\n  I have a letter here from the Attorney General. Among other things, \nshe says:\n\n       I am extremely concerned about this legislation because it \n     could have a negative impact on [the Federal Prison \n     Industries], which is the Bureau of Prisons most important, \n     efficient, and cost-effective tool for managing inmates and \n     for preparing them to be productive, law abiding citizens \n     upon release from prison.\n\n  I also have a letter from the National Center for Victims of Crime. \nAnd they say, among other things:\n\n       Dollars that go to the crime victims through the [Federal \n     Prison Industries] program are coming out of criminal \n     offenders' pockets--the notion that the offender must be held \n     accountable and pay for the harm caused by crimes he [or] she \n     committed is at the heart of jurisprudence. Crime victims \n     often tell us that the amount of restitution an offender pays \n     is far less important to them than the fact that their \n     offender is paying restitution. Financial assistance from \n     offenders has a tremendous healing and restorative power for \n     criminal victims.\n  No. 1, the administration opposes the Levin amendment, supports our \neffort to knock it out of the bill. The Attorney General, the Director \nof Federal Prisons, and the National Center for Victims of Crime all \noppose this amendment. They all oppose it basically for the same \nreason; and that is, it will end up raising the cost of incarceration. \nIt will end up lowering the amount of restitution going to victims. It \nwill idle prisoners, and you do not get rehabilitated sitting around in \nair-conditioning watching color television.\n  If there is anything we know about the Federal prison work system, \nand about the work system in States, it is that working is an important \npart of rehabilitation. I personally would support proposals that would \nforce every able prisoner in America to work. I would like them to work \n10 hours a day, 6 days a week, and go to school at night. But I know \nwith the vested interest that is built up against that, that we cannot \nsucceed in changing it today. I hope we will someday. But I do not want \nto destroy what we have now.\n  Let me talk about recidivism.\n  In South Carolina--and you are going to hear from the distinguished \nformer chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, a \nvery active member of the Judiciary Committee. In South Carolina, the \nprobability that a person who serves in a penitentiary in South \nCarolina, when they will be released, will ever come back into a State \nor Federal penitentiary again is 17 times higher for those who did not \nwork while they were in prison than it is for those who did work in \nprison. Part of the reason is that people acquire skills in working \nthat allow them to go out into the private sector and get a job when \nthey get out of prison.\n  In Florida, the probability that a person in prison, when they are \nreleased, will ever come back to prison is three times as high for \npeople who did not work while they were in the penitentiary in Florida \nas it is for those who did work while they were in the penitentiary in \nFlorida.\n  For Wisconsin, it is twice as high; for Kentucky, it is almost twice \nas high.\n  In the Federal system, the recidivism rate, the chances that someone \nwill come back to Federal prison, after having been released, is 24 \npercent lower for those who participate in work programs. We have \nestimates that a 10-percent reduction in recidivism rates would lower \nthe overall social cost of crime and incarceration by $6.1 billion.\n  So another strong argument against the Levin amendment is that we \nhave hard data, not just from the Federal Government, but from many \nStates, that indicate conclusively if people work when they are in \nprison, the probability that they will go out and commit another crime \nthat will get them sent back to prison is substantially, markedly lower \nif they work than if they do not work.\n  You are going to hear Senator Levin argue that, well, this is not \nprice competition. And it is not. Let's make it clear, this is not a \ncompetitive issue. I would defy anyone to pick up this defense \nauthorization bill and hold it out as a paragon of virtue in terms of \ndefense procurement efficiency. The defense procurement system is full \nof protectionism and special interests, where we give all kinds of \nspecial deals to all kinds of producers in selling things to the \nDefense Department.\n\n  I say competition in procurement is a good thing. I swear by it. I \nsupport it. But when you have page after page of acquisition rules that \nsay we pay inflated prices to buy things domestically rather than \nbuying them on the world market, it is hard to suddenly be concerned \nabout competition in prices with regard to prison-made goods.\n  This is not about competition. This is about using a resource we have \nwith 1.1 million people in prison.\n  Now, having said that, the GAO recently did a study of the Federal \nPrison Industries of 20 different products that were bought by the \nDefense Department. What the GAO concluded was the Federal Prison \nIndustries prices were within the market range for virtually every \nproduct that was bought by the Defense Department. So it is true that \nin the strictest terms, we don't have competitive bidding on goods \nproduced in prison, but we have market surveys. We have negotiations \nbetween the Defense Department and the prison, and we have a simulation \nof what the market system would look like if you had a competitive \nbidding system.\n  Also, the Department of Defense Inspector General recently completed \na study of the Federal Prison Industries prices and concluded that DOD \ncould have saved millions of dollars by buying more items from the \nFederal Prison Industries if it had bought more items from them rather \nthan buying them in the open market.\n  Now, let me remind my colleagues--I know Senator Thurmond is here and \nis very busy; I want to give him an opportunity to speak--that 2 years \nago, when we debated this same issue in a slightly different form with \nthe thrust identical, I offered a substitute amendment that mandated a \nstudy be done by the Department of Defense and by the Federal Prison \nIndustries and Department of Justice. That study has just been \ncompleted, and it was reported to the Armed Services Committee and then \nto Members of the Senate. I draw my colleagues' attention to page 4 of \nthe executive summary to the conclusions that were reached in the \nstudy.\n  The question was what recommendations did they have as to changes we \nmight make in current law with regard to the Defense Department buying \nthings produced in Federal prisons. They concluded, the recommendations \ncan be made within existing statutory authority and will not require \nlegislative action. Department of Defense and Federal Prison Industries \nsay they believe that implementing the recommendations will improve the \nefficiency and reduce the cost of procurement transactions between the \ntwo agencies. Implementation of the administrative actions should \nfacilitate and enhance the working relationship between the two \nagencies.\n  So in short, 2 years ago when we debated this issue and we decided to \nstudy the problem that was raised by Senator Levin, we had that study \ncompleted jointly by the Defense Department and the Department of \nJustice,\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons, and they have concluded that they should \nundertake a modernization system, but they do not need any legislative \nauthority to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember, if we adopt this amendment and we \nkill off 60 percent of the remaining prison labor in America, we are \ngoing to spend more money to incarcerate prisoners. We are going to \nhave less money go to victims. We are going to have a higher recidivism \nrate as people come out of prison and commit crimes again. And the net \nresult will be that we will have taken work that was being done in \nprison, and we will have put it into the private sector. But in a \nperiod when we have an acute labor shortage and in a period when we \nhave 1.1 million people in prison, 1 percent of the labor force, it \nmakes absolutely no sense, it is destructive of our criminal justice \nsystem to destroy the remnants of prison labor.\n  I remind my colleagues that when you bring Senator Thurmond, Senator \nHatch and myself into an alliance with the administration, into an \nalliance with Janet Reno, the Attorney General, and then you have the \nsupport of victims' rights groups all over the country, that is a \npretty broad coalition. What each and every one of these entities is \nsaying is, do not kill off prison labor.\n\n  When we have 130 million Americans who go to work every day and \nstruggle to make ends meet, I do not understand what is wrong with \nforcing prisoners to work. I want prisoners to work. It is good for \nthem. It is good for the taxpayer. It is good policy, and we should not \nallow that system to be destroyed.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, but I yield whatever time he \nmight need to our distinguished colleague, Senator Thurmond, who today \nwas recognized for the 75th anniversary of being commissioned an \nofficer and a gentleman in the U.S. Army. For 75 years, three quarters \nof a century, Senator Thurmond has borne that commission to uphold, \nprotect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic, and whether it was on D-Day in Normandy or whether it was on \nthe Supreme Court of South Carolina or whether it was Governor or \nwhether it is our most distinguished Member of the Senate, Strom \nThurmond is truly a man to hold against the mountain and the sky.\n  I yield whatever time he might need to Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, for the magnificent remarks he made on this important subject \nand also thank him for the kind remarks he made about me.\n  I rise in strong support of the amendment to strike section 806 of S. \n1059, the Defense Authorization Act, which was added in Committee by \nSenator Levin. This provision could endanger Federal Prison Industries \nor UNICOR, which is the most important inmate program in the Federal \nBureau of Prisons.\n  To protect our citizens, America is placing more and more dangerous \nand violent criminals in prison. Indeed, one of the main reasons crime \nrates in America are going down is because the number of criminals we \nare putting behind bars is increasing. The Bureau of Prisons has an \nextremely important and complex task in housing and, to the extent \npossible, rehabilitating these inmates. FPI is critical to this task.\n  Prisoners must work. Idleness and boredom in prison leads to mischief \nand violence. FPI keeps inmates productively occupied, which helps \nmaintain the safety and security for staff, other inmates, and the law-\nabiding public outside.\n  Moreover, prisoners who work in FPI develop job skills and learn a \nwork ethic. As a result, they adjust better in prison and are better \nprepared to become productive members of society when they leave.\n  Mr. President, the program works. Studies show that inmates who \nworked in Prison Industries are 24 percent more likely to find and hold \njobs and remain crime-free after they are released. Inmates in FPI are \nmore likely to become responsible, productive citizens.\n  I am very concerned that section 806, the Levin provision, could \nthreaten this essential program. FPI may sell its products only to \nFederal agencies, and the Department of Defense represents almost 60 \npercent of its sales. Yet, the Levin provision would make it much \neasier for Defense purchasers not to use FPI based on a very vague and \nnuclear standard. Further, this provision would eliminate entirely the \nmandatory source preference for any Defense order under $2,500. \nPurchases under this amount account for 78 percent of FPI orders. Also, \nthe amendment would exempt Defense purchases in a wide range of \ntelecommunications or information systems under the broad name of \nnational security. This could be very harmful to FPI's production of \nelectronic products.\n  Drastic changes of this nature are not warranted, as even the \nDepartment of Defense recognizes. The DoD and BoP have just completed a \njoint study that we ordered in a previous Defense Authorization Bill. \nIn a survey taken as part of the study, DoD customers generally rated \nFPI in the good to excellent or average ranges in all categories, \nincluding price, quality, delivery, and service. As the report states, \nthe working relationship between FPI and DoD remains strong and vital.\n  The study concludes that no legislative changes are warranted in \nDefense purchases from FPI. It made some recommendations for \nimprovements that are currently being implemented. We should give the \nstudy time to work.\n  Indeed, the Administration strongly opposes the Levin provision. The \nStatement of Administration Policy on S. 1059 explains that this \nprovision ``would essentially eliminate the Federal Prison Industries \nmandatory source with the Defense Department. Such action could harm \nthe FPI program which is fundamental to the security in Federal \nprisons.''\n  FPI does not have an advantage over the private sector. Although \ninmates make less money than other workers, FPI must deal with many \nhidden costs and constraints that do not apply to the private sector.\n  Working inmates must be closely supervised, adding to labor costs, \nand extensive time-consuming security procedures must be followed. For \nexample, when inmates go to work, they must pass through a metal \ndetector and check their tools in and out, even if they just leave for \nlunch.\n  While the private sector often specializes in certain products, FPI \nby law must diversity its product lines to lessen its impact on any one \nindustry. Also, the private sector tries to keep labor costs low, while \nFPI intentionally keeps its factories as labor-intensive as possible. \nMoreover, inmate workers generally have little education and training \nand often have never held a steady job. Indeed, the productivity rate \nof an employee with the background of an average inmate has been \nestimated at one-fourth that of a civilian worker.\n  FPI is not used for every Federal purchase. In fact, it only \nconstitutes a small minority. If a customer does not feel that FPI can \nmeet its delivery, price, or technical requirements, then the customer \ncan request a waiver of the mandatory source. Last year, 90 percent of \nwaiver requests were approved, generally within four days.\n  Moreover, some private businesses depend on FPI for their existence. \nFPI purchased over $418 million in raw materials and component parts \nfrom private industry in 1998. Contracts for such purchases are awarded \nin nearly every state, and more than half go to small businesses.\n  Further, Prison Industries helps crime victims recover the money they \nare due. The program requires that 50 percent of all inmate wages be \nused for victim restitution, fines, child support, or other court-\nordered payments. Last year, FPI collected nearly $2 million for this \npurpose.\n  The Levin provision falls within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee and should be evaluated there. Indeed, my Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight held a hearing yesterday on \nPrison Industries. We discussed in detail the importance of the program \nand how damaging the changes we are considering in this bill could be.\n  FPI is a correctional program that is essential to the safe and \nefficient operation of our increasingly overcrowded Federal prisons. \nWhile we are putting\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\nmore and more criminals in prison, we must maintain the program that \nkeeps them occupied and working.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am authorized by Senator Levin to speak at \nthis time. But I am going to ask Mr. Gramm if he will yield me some \ntime.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Levin, knew my \nposition on this matter, but he accommodated me by suggesting that I \nmight proceed at this time while he is away from his chair. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas for yielding time to me.\n  I am strongly opposed to the inclusion of section 806 in the fiscal \nyear 2000 Defense authorization bill. This section would substantially \nundermine Federal Prison Industries--the Bureau of Prisons' most \nimportant skill-developing program for inmates.\n  I believe that this matter should not be included in the defense \nauthorization bill. It is a matter that is being considered by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I am advised that the Criminal Justice \nOversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by \nthe senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, conducted an \noversight hearing on this matter on May 24--yesterday.\n  The Attorney General of the United States, in a letter addressed to \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has indicated that she \nis concerned about this legislative provision. The Attorney General's \nletter asserts that the legislative provision would have a negative \nimpact on Federal Prison Industries,\n\n       . . . which is the Bureau of Prisons' most important, \n     efficient, and cost-effective tool for managing inmates and \n     for preparing them to be productive, law-abiding citizens \n     upon release from prison.\n\n  I am also advised that the administration has taken a strong position \nin opposition to section 806 because of the harm it would do to the FPI \nprogram, which is fundamental to the security in Federal prisons. The \nadministration believes that to ensure Federal inmates are employed in \nsufficient numbers, the current mandatory source requirement should not \nbe altered until an effective alternative program is designed and put \ninto place.\n  Mr. President, in the State of West Virginia there are three Federal \nprisons--the Federal prison at Alderson, the Robert C. Byrd Federal \nCorrectional Institution at Beckley, and the Robert F. Kennedy Prison \nat Morgantown. And each of these has an FPI operation. At these three \nFederal prisons alone, the Bureau of Prisons is able to keep more than \n500 inmates productively occupied, and employ nearly 40 staff at no \ncost to the taxpayer. How about that! That sounds like a good deal to \nme.\n  Mr. President, a somewhat similar amendment was offered to the \nDefense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1998. The Senate instead \nadopted a substitute amendment offered by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Texas (Mr. Gramm), which required a joint study by the \nDepartment of Defense and FPI on this matter. That study has recently \nbeen completed and transmitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nThe joint study made several recommendations that could be accomplished \nwithin existing authority, without requiring legislative action.\n  In summary, I am opposed to section 806 to the Defense authorization \nbill because it is unwarranted, and not only is it unwarranted, but it \nwould have a debilitating effect on Federal Prisons Industries. This is \na matter within the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nshould not be included in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Statement of \nAdministration Position on Section 806 of the Defense authorization \nbill be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Administration Position on Section 806 of the Defense \n                      Authorization Bill (S. 1059)\n\n\n          federal prison industries mandatory source exemption\n\n       The Administration opposes Section 806 which would \n     essentially eliminate the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) \n     mandatory source with the Defense Department. Such action \n     could harm the FPI program which is fundamental to the \n     security in Federal prisons. In principle, the Administration \n     believes that the Government should support competition for \n     the provision of goods and services to Federal agencies. \n     However, to ensure that Federal inmates are employed in \n     sufficient numbers, the current mandatory source requirement \n     should not be altered until an alternative program is \n     designed and put in place. Finally, this provision would only \n     address mandatory sourcing for the Defense Department, \n     without regard to the rest of federal government.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, and I likewise express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, for his leadership \noverall on this bill. He is very dedicated, very able, and he works \nvery hard. I am proud to serve with him on the Armed Services \nCommittee. But in this case, I regret that I have to oppose his \nposition.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my 10 minutes that \nwas yielded to me from that side to Mr. Hatch, if I may ask unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the President and I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this \namendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor. I congratulate Senators \nGramm, Thurmond, and Byrd for their excellent statements on this \nmatter, and for their leadership on this issue.\n  This amendment strikes section 806 of the bill, a provision that \nwould effectively eliminate the Department of Defense purchasing \npreference for products supplied by Federal Prison Industries (FPI), \nalso known by its trade name of UNICOR.\n  FPI is the federal corporation charged by Congress with the mission \nof training and employing federal prison inmates.\n  For more than 60 years, this correctional program has provided \ninmates with the opportunity to learn practical work habits and skills. \nIt has enjoyed broad, bipartisan support in Congress and from each \nRepublican and Democrat administration. An important part of this \nsupport has been the cooperative relationship between FPI and the \nDepartment of Defense--a relationship that has helped supply our armed \nforces in every war since 1934.\n  FPI is an irreplaceable corrections program. FPI and its training \nprograms at federal prisons across the nation have been credited with \nhelping to lower recidivism and ensuring better job-related success for \nprisoners upon their release--a result that all of us applaud.\n  Finally, FPI is an essential tool for ensuring a safe and secure \ncorrectional environment for staff, guards, and inmates in the federal \nprison system. Simply put, FPI keeps inmates productively occupied. And \nsince the limited number of FPI jobs are coveted by inmates, getting \nand keeping these jobs are important incentives for good behavior by \ninmates.\n  These are important considerations as the federal inmate population \ncontinues to rise. In the last ten years, the federal inmate population \nhas more than doubled, from 51,153 in 1989 to 108,207 in 1998. As \nPhilip Glover, President of the Council of Prison Locals, AFGE, \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee yesterday, ``We cannot afford \nto simply warehouse inmates.''\n  Any corrections officer will tell you that the most dangerous inmate \nis the idle inmate. Idleness breeds frustration, and provides ample \ntime to plan mischief--a volatile combination. Yet, despite the \nreferences to the costs imposed by FPI by my colleagues who oppose this \namendment, I have heard no one suggest how the taxpayers will pay for \nthe new prison programs and the additional prison guards that might be \nneeded if FPI factories are forced to close.\n  Section 806 of this bill, which our amendment strikes, puts the FPI \nprogram at substantial risk, and would certainly result in the \nshuttering of some FPI factories. Section 806 exempts from the FPI \nmandatory source\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nrequirement products priced below $2,500, products integral to or \nembedded in another product not made by FPI, or products which are \ncomponents of a larger product used for military intelligence or \nweaponry. Together, these categories make up over 80 percent of DoD's \npurchases from FPI. FPI, in turn, depends on sales to the Pentagon for \nnearly 60 percent of its business.\n  Some may reasonably ask, why should there be a government procurement \npreference for FPI goods? The answer is simply this: when FPI was \nestablished, in perhaps an unnecessary effort ensure the program did \nnot affect private sector jobs, FPI was barred from selling its \nproducts in the commercial market. This is still the law. Thus, under \ncurrent law, FPI may sell its products and services only to the federal \ngovernment. Section 806 does not alter this sales restriction, and I do \nnot understand the Senator from Michigan to be supporting such a \nchange.\n\n  To ensure that FPI has adequate work to keep inmates occupied, \ncongress created a special FPI ``procurement preference,'' under which \nfederal agencies are required to make their purchases from FPI instead \nof other vendors, as long as FPI can meet price, quality, and delivery \nrequirements.\n  Section 806 would remove this procurement preference, as it relates \nto the vast majority of sales to the Department of Defense. Without \nthis preference, FPI could be crippled. Again, FPI is not permitted to \ncompete for sales in the private market. It may only sell to the \nfederal government, and then only if it can meet price, quality, and \ndelivery requirements. And even then, waivers are available.\n  Nothing short of the viability of Federal Prison Industries is at \nissue here. Under full competition for federal contracts, combined with \nmarket restrictions, FPI could not survive.\n  My colleagues should remember that the primary mission of FPI is not \nprofit. The primary mission of FPI is the safe and effective \nincarceration and rehabilitation of federal prisoners. Needless to say, \nFPI operates under constraints on its efficiency no private sector \nmanufacturer must operate under. For example:\n  Most private sector companies invest in the latest, most efficient \ntechnology and equipment to increase productivity and reduce labor \ncosts. Because of its different mission, FPI frequently must make its \nmanufacturing processes as labor-intensive as possible--in order to \nkeep as many inmates as possible occupied.\n  The secure correctional environment FPI in which FPI operates \nrequires additional inefficiencies. Tools must be carefully checked in \nand out before and after each shift, and at every break. Inmate workers \nfrequently must be searched before returning to their cells. And FPI \nfactories must shut down whenever inmate unrest or institutional \ndisturbances occur. No private sector business operates under these \ncompetitive disadvantages.\n  The average federal inmate is 37 years old, has only an 8th grade \neducation, and has never held a steady legal job. Some studies have \nestimated that the productivity of a worker with this profile is about \none-quarter of that of the average worker in the private sector. This \nis another disadvantage that, by and large, private companies do not \nhave to operate under.\n  Finally, FPI is required to diversify its product line to minimize \nthe impact on any one industry. Moreover, FPI can only enter new lines \nof business, or expand existing lines, after an exhaustive review has \nbeen undertaken to the impact on the private sector. Again, this is a \nrestraint that most other businesses do not have imposed on them.\n  All of us share the goal of ensuring that FPI does not adversely \nimpact private business. FPI has made considerable efforts to minimize \nany adverse impact on the private sector. Over the past few years, it \nhas transferred factory operations from multiple factory locations to \nnew prisons, in order to create necessary inmate jobs without \nincreasing FPI sales. FPI has also begun operations such as a mattress \nrecycling factory, a laundry, a computer repair factory, and a mail bag \nrepair factory, among others, to diversify its operations and minimize \nits impact on the private sector, while providing essential prison \njobs.\n\n  Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that FPI actually creates \na substantial number of private sector jobs. In FY 1998, thousands of \nvendors nationwide registered with FPI, and supplied nearly $419 \nmillion in purchases to FPI. And at the same time FPI trained and \nemployed 20,200 federal inmates at no expense to the taxpayer in FY \n1998, it also directly supported 4,600 jobs outside prison walls.\n  Every dollar FPI receives in revenue is recycled into the private \nsector. Out of each dollar, 76 cents goes to the purchase of raw \nmaterials, equipment, services, and overhead, all supplied by the \nprivate sector; 18 cents goes to salaries of FPI staff; and 6 cents \ngoes to inmate pay, which in turn if passed along to pay victim \nrestitution, child support, alimony, and fines. Incidentally, FPI \ninmates are required to apply 50 percent of their earnings to these \ncosts.\n  Thus, while I have some sympathy for the intent of Senator Levin, who \nsponsored this provision in the bill, I must join Senator Gramm in \noffering this amendment to strike Section 806. I would like to remind \nmy colleagues that the Senate has addressed this matter before. Two \nyears ago, Senator Levin offered a similar amendment. Mr. President, 62 \nmembers of the Senate voted instead for an amendment offered by Senator \nGramm and myself, requiring the Departments of Defense and Justice to \nundertake a joint study of the procurement and purchase processes \ngoverning FPI sales to the Department of Defense.\n  Just last month, this study was delivered to Congress. Interestingly, \nthe report does not support the action proposed by section 806. To the \ncontrary, the Departments of Defense and Justice jointly concluded that \nthe report's ``recommendations can be made within existing statutory \nauthority, and will not require legislative action.''\n  In fact, neither of the Departments affected by section 806 support \nits inclusion in this bill. The Administration's official Statement of \nAdministration policy is equally clear, stating that ``the \nAdministration opposes Section 806.''\n  In summary, either we want Federal inmates to work, or we do not. I \nbelieve that we do want inmates to work, and therefore I must oppose \nsection 806. I say to my colleagues, if you believe in maintaining good \norder and discipline in prisons, or if you believe in the \nrehabilitation of inmates when possible, you should support this \namendment.\n  I agree with those of my colleagues who believe that we must address \nthe issues raised by prison industries nationwide. As we continue, \nappropriately, to incarcerate more serious criminals in both Federal \nand State prisons, productive work must be found for them. At the same \ntime, we must ensure that jobs are not taken from law-abiding workers. \nUnder the leadership of Senator Thurmond, the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Criminal Justice Oversight yesterday held a hearing on \nthis issue. Witnesses at that hearing urged Congress not to gut FPI \nwithout addressing the broader need for productive prison work.\n\n  FPI is a proven correctional program. It enhances the security of \nfederal prisons, helps ensure that federal inmates work, furthers \ninmate rehabilitation when possible, and provides restitution to \nvictims. Section 806 would do immense harm to this highly successful \nprogram, and I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to strike \nit.\n  I also ask unanimous consent a letter to me from the Office of the \nAttorney General be printed in the Record with the accompanying \ndocuments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Fiscal Year 2000 Defense \n     Authorization bill that was recently reported out of the \n     Armed Services Committee includes a provision regarding \n     Department of Defense (DoD) purchases from Federal Prison \n     Industries (FPI). We believe that the statutory changes \n     required by this provision are premature in light of the \n     recommendations of the congressionally mandated two-year \n     study recently completed by the Department of Defense and FPI \n     that explored the procurement relationship between these two \n     agencies. For the reasons stated in the Deputy Attorney \n     General's letter (copy attached), I am extremely concerned \n     about\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\n     this legislation because it could have a negative impact on \n     FPI, which is the Bureau of Prisons most important, \n     efficient, and cost-effective tool for managing inmates and \n     for preparing them to be productive, law abiding citizens \n     upon release from prison.\n       Federal Prison Industries is first and foremost a \n     correctional program intended to train the Federal inmate \n     population and minimize adverse impact on the private sector \n     business community. As such, it adheres to several \n     statutorily mandated principles, including diversifying its \n     product line to avoid hurting any particular industry and \n     remaining as labor intensive as possible. These practices \n     render FPI less competitive than private sector \n     manufacturers. The mandatory source status (which would be \n     effectively eliminated as a result of provision) helps \n     ameliorate these circumstances by achieving customer contact \n     which reduces competitive advertising costs. It also assists \n     FPI in its efforts to partner with private sector \n     manufacturers who are attracted to the steady work flow \n     provided by this preference. These partnerships are essential \n     to FPI since it cannot, on its own, produce many complicated \n     products such as systems furniture.\n       This provision would alter the requirement that the \n     Department of Defense purchase products from FPI, and it \n     could require FPI to compete with the private sector for \n     sales of products that are components of products not \n     produced by FPI, are part of a national security system, or \n     the total cost of which is less than $2,500. Even with \n     respect to other products, DoD is no longer required to \n     purchase from FPI, rather the Secretary of Defense must \n     ``conduct market research'' to determine whether the FPI \n     product is ``comparable in price, quality, and time of \n     delivery'' to products available from the private sector \n     before making purchases. If the Secretary concludes that the \n     FPI product is not comparable, the purchase may be made from \n     any source.\n       Purchases by the Department of Defense account for almost \n     60% of FPI's sales. Moreover, 78 percent of the DoD orders \n     are for small purchases of less than $2,500, and much of the \n     remaining 22 percent is made up of products or components of \n     products made by other manufacturers and products used in \n     national security systems. Accordingly, if this provision is \n     enacted into law, the continued existence of FPI will depend \n     in large part on its ability to compete with the private \n     sector for the limited Department of Defense market.\n       A recently completed report conducted by the Department of \n     Defense and FPI concluded that no legislative changes were \n     warranted by the investigation of procurement transactions \n     between these two entities. Rather, while the study, entitled \n     ``A Study of the Procurement, Procedures, Regulations and \n     Statutes that Govern Procurement Transactions between the \n     Department of Defense and Federal Prison Industries,'' \\1\\ \n     made a number of recommendations for facilitating and \n     enhancing the working relationship between the two agencies \n     that could be accomplished within existing statutory \n     authority, the study recommends the FPI and DoD create a \n     pilot program at eight DoD locations to test the \n     effectiveness of administrative waivers for purchases of less \n     than $2,500 where expedited delivery is required. \n     Additionally, FPI will continue to monitor and evaluate \n     delivery performance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ This study was mandated by Section 855 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (P.L. 105-85), \n     and was released to the Senate and House Armed Services \n     Committee several weeks ago.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Issues surrounding FPI, such as the mandatory source status \n     affect all agencies, not just the Department of Defense. \n     Therefore, this issue should be reviewed in the broader \n     context.\n       If you should have any questions or if we may provide \n     further information about FPI, please feel free to contact \n     the Department. The Office of Management and Budget has \n     advised us that from the perspective of the Administration's \n     program, there is no objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janet Reno.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Office of the\n\n\n                                      Deputy Attorney General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1999.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We anticipate that an amendment will be \n     offered to the Defense Authorization bill that would \n     eliminate mandatory source status for Federal Prison \n     Industries (FPI). We believe that the amendment would have a \n     devastating impact upon FPI, a program that is critical to \n     the safe and orderly operations of federal prisons.\n       FPI is the Bureau of Prisons most important, efficient, and \n     cost-effective tool for managing inmates. It keeps inmates \n     productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the \n     violence and disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus, it \n     is essential to the security of the Federal Prison System, \n     its staff, inmates, and the communities in which they are \n     located. By eliminating FPI's mandatory source status, the \n     amendment would dramatically reduce the number of inmates FPI \n     would be able to employ. The inmate idleness this would \n     create would seriously undermine the safety and security of \n     America's federal prisons.\n       In addition to being a tool for managing the growing inmate \n     population,\\1\\ FPI programs provide inmates with training and \n     experience that develop job skills and a strong work ethic. \n     Bureau of Prisons' research has confirmed the value of FPI as \n     a correctional program. Findings demonstrate that inmates who \n     work in FPI, compared to similar inmates who do not have FPI \n     experience, have better institutional adjustment. Moreover, \n     after release, they are more likely to be employed and \n     significantly less likely to commit another crime. A long-\n     term post-release employment study by the Bureau of Prisons \n     has found that inmates who were released as long as 8 to 12 \n     years ago and who participated in industries work or \n     vocational training programs were 24 percent less likely to \n     be recommitted to federal prisons than a comparison group of \n     inmates who had no such training. Clearly, the FPI program \n     contributes to public safety by enhancing the eventual \n     reintegration of offenders into the community after release.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The federal inmate population is growing at an \n     unprecedented rate and crowding at secure institutions is \n     already at critical levels and expected to increase in the \n     near term.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Opponents of FPI have asserted that FPI is an unfair \n     competitor and that it is damaging the private sector. This \n     is not accurate. Throughout its history, FPI has followed a \n     number of practices deliberately designed to reduce its \n     impact on the private sector, such as diversifying its \n     product line to avoid hurting any particular industry and \n     remaining as labor intensive as possible. Further, far from \n     taking jobs from the private sector, FPI actually creates \n     jobs in the private sector by purchasing over $418 million \n     annually in supplies from the private sector.\n       It is important to explain why FPI's status as a mandatory \n     source is critical to FPI's viability. The mandatory source \n     status was established as a means of creating a steady flow \n     of work for the employment of inmates. FPI views the \n     mandatory source status as a method of not only maintaining \n     this work flow but also achieving customer contact which \n     reduces competitive advertising costs.\n       FPI does not abuse its mandatory source status. If a \n     customer feels that FPI cannot meet its delivery, price, or \n     technical requirements, the customer may request a waiver of \n     the mandatory source. These waivers are processed quickly (an \n     average of 4 days) and, in 1998, FPI approved over 80 percent \n     of the requests from federal agencies for waivers.\n       FPI does not have the capability to produce many \n     sophisticated products, such as systems furniture, \n     independently. It relies on the private sector to provide \n     space planning, design, engineering, installation and \n     customer service. By entering into partnerships with private \n     companies through the use of federal acquisition procedures, \n     FPI vertically integrates the manufacturing of a company's \n     product using inmate labor. In order to attract a private \n     sector partner, there must be some incentive. That incentive \n     is the mandatory source. Without the mandatory source status, \n     FPI would be unable to attract the private sector partners \n     necessary for it to diversify its product offerings and to \n     offer products which are contemporary and attractive to its \n     federal customers.\n       Last week, the report of a congressionally mandated study \n     conducted by the Department of Defense (DoD) and FPI \n     concluded that no legislative changes were warranted by the \n     investigation of procurement transactions between these two \n     entities. The study, entitled ``A Study of the Procurement, \n     Procedures, Regulations and Statutes that Govern Procurement \n     Transactions between the Department of Defense and Federal \n     Prison Industries,'' was mandated by Section 855 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (P.L. \n     105-85), and was released to the Senate and House Armed \n     Services Committee last week. The report noted that some \n     steps could be taken to improve the procurement relationship \n     between DoD and FPI, but such steps are most appropriately \n     accomplished within the executive branch.\n       FPI is a law enforcement issue more than a government \n     supply issue because it is essential to the management of \n     federal prisons and because FPI is operated as a correctional \n     program, not as a for-profit business. As a result, we \n     continue to develop pilot programs that will make FPI a more \n     efficient and cost competitive source. We believe that the \n     amendment would benefit from consideration by the Judiciary \n     Committee to consider the mandatory source issue in the \n     context of the full FPI program. Simply considering the \n     amendment as affecting a source of goods for the federal \n     sector would completely overlook the law enforcement \n     significance of FPI and threaten a program that is \n     fundamental to public safety.\n       We are enclosing a copy of the study report conducted by \n     DoD and FPI for your review. If you should have any questions \n     or if we may provide further information about FPI, please \n     feel free to contact the Department.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Deputy Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                            Office of the Deputy Attorney General,\n\n\n                                 Washington, DC, May 11, 1999.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We anticipate that an amendment will be \n     offered to the Defense Authorization bill that would \n     eliminate mandatory source status for Federal Prison\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\n     Industries (FPI). We believe that the amendment would have a \n     devastating impact upon FPI, a program that is critical to \n     the safe and orderly operations of federal prisons.\n       FPI is the Bureau of Prisons most important, efficient, and \n     cost-effective tool for managing inmates. It keeps inmates \n     productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the \n     violence and disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus, it \n     is essential to the security of the Federal Prison System, \n     its staff, inmates, and the communities in which they are \n     located. By eliminating FPI's mandatory source status, the \n     amendment would dramatically reduce the number of inmates FPI \n     would be able to employ. The inmate idleness this would \n     create would seriously undermine the safety and security of \n     America's federal prisons.\n       In addition to being a tool for managing the growing inmate \n     population,\\1\\ FPI programs provide inmates with training and \n     experience that develop job skills and a strong work ethic. \n     Bureau of Prisons' research has confirmed the value of FPI as \n     a correctional program. Findings demonstrate that inmates who \n     work in FPI, compared to similar inmates who do not have FPI \n     experience, have better institutional adjustment. Moreover, \n     after release, they are more likely to be employed and \n     significantly less likely to commit another crime. A long-\n     term post-release employment study by the Bureau of Prisons \n     has found that inmates who were released as long as 8 to 12 \n     years ago and who participated in industries work or \n     vocational training programs were 24 percent less likely to \n     be recommitted to federal prisons than a comparison group of \n     inmates who had no such training. Clearly, the FPI program \n     contributes to public safety by enhancing the eventual \n     reintegration of offenders into the community after release.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The federal inmate population is growing at an \n     unprecedented rate and crowding at secure institutions is \n     already at critical levels and expected to increase in the \n     near term.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Opponents of FPI have asserted that FPI is an unfair \n     competitor and that it is damaging the private sector. This \n     is not accurate. Throughout its history, FPI has followed a \n     number of practices deliberately designed to reduce its \n     impact on the private sector, such as diversifying its \n     product line to avoid hurting any particular industry and \n     remaining as labor intensive as possible. Further, far from \n     taking jobs from the private sector, FPI actually creates \n     jobs in the private sector by purchasing over $418 million \n     annually in supplies from the private sector.\n       It is important to explain why FPI's status as a mandatory \n     source is critical to FPI's viability. The mandatory source \n     status was established as a means of creating a steady flow \n     of work for the employment of inmates. FPI views the \n     mandatory source status as a method of not only maintaining \n     this work flow but also achieving customer contact which \n     reduces competitive advertising costs.\n       FPI does not abuse its mandatory source status. If a \n     customer feels that FPI cannot meet its delivery, price, or \n     technical requirements, the customer may request a waiver of \n     the mandatory source. These waivers are processed quickly (an \n     average of 4 days) and, in 1998, FPI approved over 80 percent \n     of the requests from federal agencies for waivers.\n       FPI does not have the capability to produce many \n     sophisticated products, such as systems furniture, \n     independently. It relies on the private sector to provide \n     space planning, design, engineering, installation and \n     customer service. By entering into partnerships with private \n     companies through the use of federal acquisition procedures, \n     FPI vertically integrates the manufacturing of a company's \n     product using inmate labor. In order to attract a private \n     sector partner, there must be some incentive. That incentive \n     is the mandatory source. Without the mandatory source status, \n     FPI would be unable to attract the private sector partners \n     necessary for it to diversify its product offerings and to \n     offer products which are contemporary and attractive to its \n     federal customers.\n       Last week, the report of a congressionally mandated study \n     conducted by the Department of Defense (DoD) and FPI \n     concluded that no legislative changes were warranted by the \n     investigation of procurement transactions between these two \n     entities. The study, entitled ``A Study of the Procurement, \n     Procedures, Regulations and Statutes that Govern Procurement \n     Transactions between the Department of Defense and Federal \n     Prison Industries,'' was mandated by Section 855 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (P.L. \n     105-85), and was released to the Senate and House Armed \n     Services Committee last week. The report noted that some \n     steps could be taken to improve the procurement relationship \n     between DoD and FPI, but such steps are most appropriately \n     accomplished within the executive branch.\n       FPI is a law enforcement issue more than a government \n     supply issue because it is essential to the management of \n     federal prisons and because FPI is operated as a correctional \n     program, not as a for-profit business. As a result, we \n     continue to develop pilot programs that will make FPI a more \n     efficient and cost competitive source. We believe that the \n     amendment would benefit from consideration by the Judiciary \n     Committee to consider the mandatory source issue in the \n     context of the full FPI program. Simply considering the \n     amendment as affecting a source of goods for the federal \n     sector would completely overlook the law enforcement \n     significance of FPI and threaten a program that is \n     fundamental to public safety.\n       We are enclosing a copy of the study report conducted by \n     DoD and FPI for your review. If you should have any questions \n     or if we may provide further information about FPI, please \n     feel free to contact the Department.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Deputy Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Statement of Administration Position on Section 806 of the Defense \n                      Authorization Bill (S. 1059)\n\n\n          federal prison industries mandatory source exemption\n\n       The Administration opposes Section 806 which would \n     essentially eliminate the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) \n     mandatory source with the Defense Department. Such action \n     could harm the FPI program which is fundamental to the \n     security in Federal prisons. In principle, the Administration \n     believes that the Government should support competition for \n     the provisions goods and services to Federal agencies. \n     However, to ensure that Federal inmates are employed in \n     sufficient numbers, the current mandatory source requirement \n     should not be altered until an alternative program is \n     designed and put in place. Finally, this provision would only \n     address mandatory sourcing for the Defense Department, \n     without regard to the rest of federal government.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Michigan \ncontrols the remaining time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, section 806 of the defense authorization \nbill which is before the Senate is a commonsense provision. It was \nadopted by the Armed Services Committee. Basically, it says the private \nsector ought to be allowed to bid on items that the Department of \nDefense is buying, if the Department of Defense declares that it is \nnecessary that the private sector be allowed to bid.\n  That may sound so obvious that people may be scratching their heads \nsaying, well, obviously the private sector ought to be allowed to bid \nif the Department of Defense believes the product which is offered by \nthe private sector is what is needed by the Department of Defense. But \nthat is not the way it is now. The way it is now is that Federal Prison \nIndustries can make a unilateral decision that it is going to supply \nthe Department of Defense with a product, and the private business \npeople out there who want to just simply compete for a product can be \nprohibited from doing so. That, it seems to me, is the height of \nunfairness in a society which has a private sector, has private \nbusinesses, has labor that is working in those private businesses, and \nwhere a Government agency says that product, produced by that private \ncompany, is a product that we want because it is a better product than \nFPI can give us or it is a product that can be given to us more cheaply \nthan the prisons can give it to us.\n  What an extraordinary way it is to run a Government, that we have \nagencies in this Government that want to buy a product, be it textiles \nor furniture or what have you, that are told they cannot compete that \nproduct with the private sector competing; they have to buy it from \nFederal Prison Industries even though it costs the agency more or it is \nof lower quality. What an extraordinary way to be inefficient, to waste \ntaxpayers' money, and to force agencies that are supposed to be \nprotecting taxpayers' money to spend it on lesser quality items or on \nmore expensive items--just because Federal Prison Industries \nunilaterally has decided it is going to supply the Department of \nDefense. That is not fair. That is not fair and we have to eliminate \nit.\n  Section 806 simply says that the Department of Defense--not Federal \nPrison Industries--should determine whether or not a product \nmanufactured by Federal Prison Industries meets the needs of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  The approach that is taken by Section 806 is consistent with the \nbasic tenet of how our whole procurement system works, which is the \npeople who buy and use products should be the ones who decide whether \nthe quality, price, and delivery of those products meet their needs. \nYet amazingly enough, the FPI, Federal Prison Industries' current rules \nprohibit Federal agencies from even looking at private sector products \nto determine whether they might be superior to what Federal Prison \nIndustries has.\n  The regulations of Federal Prison Industries say:\n\n       A contracting activity should not solicit bids, proposals, \n     quotations or otherwise test the market for the purpose of \n     seeking alternative sources to the Federal Prison Industries.\n\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n\n  If that is not absolutely extraordinary, that Federal Prison \nIndustries is telling the Department of Defense, when they go and buy \ntextiles or shoes or whatever they are buying, that they may not even \ntest the market, seeking alternative sources to Federal Prison \nIndustries.\n  They may not solicit bids, proposals, quotations, or test the market \nfor the purpose of seeking alternative sources to Federal Prison \nIndustries.\n  What kind of an upside-down situation is this? What kind of a topsy-\nturvy situation is it that the Department of Defense cannot even \nsolicit a quote from somebody to supply a product if Federal Prison \nIndustries says they may not do so? Unilaterally, the seller is telling \nthe buyer: You can't even go out and seek other quotes or seek \ncompetition.\n  Boy, that sure turns the purchasing process of the Department of \nDefense and our other agencies right on its head.\n  What the Department of Defense is required to do, instead of doing \nwhat ordinary buyers do, which is to seek the best product at the best \nprice, is to accept Federal Prison Industries' determination. Federal \nPrison Industries is the sole arbiter of whether its products meet the \nrequirements of the Department of Defense.\n  Section 8104 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act requires the \nDepartment of Defense and other agencies to conduct market research \nbefore soliciting bids or proposals for products that may be available \nin the commercial marketplace. They are supposed to solicit bids, but \nthey do not do that. They are not allowed to do that. Under the FPI \nrules, they have to buy it from Federal Prison Industries if the \nIndustries on their own, unilaterally, decide they are going to force \nthe Department of Defense to buy a product.\n  All that the provision does is to reverse the rule which prohibits \nthe Department of Defense from conducting market research and permits \nthe Department of Defense to look at what private sector companies have \nto offer, as it would do in the case of any other procurement.\n  If Federal Prison Industries offers a product that is comparable in \nprice, quality, and time of delivery to products available from the \nprivate sector, the Department would still be required to purchase that \nproduct on a sole-source basis from Federal Prison Industries. But if \nthe DOD determines that Federal Prison Industries' product was not \ncompetitive, then it would be permitted to conduct a competition and go \nto another source.\n  That seems to me to be the least that we can do to protect the \ntaxpayers from the misuse of Federal funds on products that fail to \nmeet the needs of the Department of Defense.\n  Federal Prison Industries has repeatedly claimed that it provides \nquality products at a price that is competitive with current market \nprices. The statute, indeed, is intended to do exactly that, provided \nFederal Prison Industries will provide the Federal agencies products \nthat meet their requirements and prices that do not exceed current \nmarket prices. But the FPI is unwilling to permit agencies to compare \ntheir products at prices with those available in the private sector.\n  Under Federal Prison Industries' current interpretation of the law, \nit need not offer the best product at the best price. It is sufficient \nfor it to offer an adequate product at an adequate price and insist on \nits right to make the sale. When Federal Prison Industries sets the \nprice, it then seeks to charge what it calls a market price, which \nmeans that at least some vendors in the private sector charge a higher \nprice, and the FPI's proposed regulation specifies that the \ndetermination of what constitutes the current market price, the \nmethodology employed to determine the current market price and \nthe conclusion that a product of Federal Prison Industries does not \nexceed that price is--you got it--the sole responsibility of Federal \nPrison Industries.\n\n  That is the situation. They are supposed to buy at market price, but \nthey make a determination as to whether or not, in fact, what they are \nforcing an agency to buy is being set at a market price.\n  The General Accounting Office reported in August of 1998:\n\n       The only limit the law imposes on Federal Prison \n     Industries' price is that it may not exceed the upper end--\n\n  Upper end--\n\n     of the current market price range.\n\n  Moreover, the manner in which Federal Prison Industries seeks to \nestablish the current market price range appears calculated to result \nin a price far higher than the Department of Defense would pay under \nany other circumstances. According to the proposed regulation codifying \nFPI's pricing policies, ``a review of commercial catalog prices will be \nused to establish a `range' for current market price.''\n  The contrast is very sharp because when the Department of Defense \nbuys from commercial vendors, it seeks to negotiate, and generally \nobtains, a steep discount from catalog prices.\n  FPI appears to have difficulty even matching the undiscounted catalog \nprices. Last August, the General Accounting Office compared Federal \nPrison Industries' prices for 20 representative products to private \nvendors' catalog prices for the same or comparable products and found \nthat for four of these products, FPI's price was higher than the price \noffered by any private vendor. That is 4 out of 20. In 4 out of 20 \ncases, GAO found that the price FPI charged was higher than the price \noffered by any private vendor. For five of the remaining products, the \nFPI price was at the ``high end of the range.'' Those are the words of \nthe General Accounting Office. FPI's price was at the ``high end of the \nrange'' of prices offered by private vendors--ranking sixth, seventh, \nseventh, eighth, and ninth of the 10 vendors reviewed. In other words, \nfor almost half of the FPI products reviewed, the FPI approach appeared \nto be to charge the highest price possible rather than the lowest price \npossible to the Federal consumer.\n  We have complaint after complaint from frustrated private sector \nvendors asking us: Why can't we compete? Why are we in the private \nsector precluded from bidding on an item?\n  Here is one vendor's letter:\n\n       Federal Prison Industries bid on this item, and simply \n     because Federal Prison Industries did, it had to be given to \n     Federal Prison Industries. FPI won the bid at $45 per unit. \n     My company bid $22 per unit. The way I see it, the Government \n     just overspent my tax dollars to the tune of $1,978. Do you \n     seriously believe that this type of procurement is cost-\n     effective? I lost business, my tax dollars were misused \n     because of unfair procurement practices mandated by Federal \n     regulations. This is a prime example, and I'm certain not the \n     only one, of how the procurement system is being misused and \n     small businesses in this country are being excluded from \n     competition with the full support of Federal regulations and \n     the seeming approval of Congress.\n\n      It is far past time . . . to require [FPI] to be competitive \n     for the benefit of all taxpayers.\n  A third frustrated vendor, who had been driven out of business by \nFPI, told a House committee:\n\n       Is it justice that Federal Prison Industries would step in \n     and take business away from a disabled Vietnam veteran who \n     was twice wounded fighting for our country . . . therefore \n     effectively destroying and bankrupting that . . . business \n     which the Veterans' Administration suggested he enter?\n\n  There is a very fundamental unfairness which exists in this system. \nIt is one that we need to correct. The Department of Defense took a \nsurvey recently of DOD customers for Federal Prison Industries' \nproducts. The results are eye-opening. The survey provided DOD \ncustomers five categories in which to rate Federal Prison Industries' \nproducts: excellent, good, average, fair, or poor.\n  According to the data reported jointly by the Department of Defense \nand the Federal Prison Industries in April, a majority of Department of \nDefense customers rated FPI as average, fair, or poor in price, \ndelivery, and as an overall supplier.\n  On price: 54 percent of the Department of Defense's electronics \ncustomers, 70 percent of DOD clothing and textile customers, 46 percent \nof DOD dorm and quarters furniture customers, 53 percent of DOD office \ncase goods customers, 57 percent of DOD systems furniture customers \nrated FPI prices as average, fair, or poor.\n  On delivery, the same kind of figures: 50 percent of DOD electronics \ncustomers rated FPI delivery as averaged, fair, or poor; 62 percent of \nDOD clothing and textile customers rated FPI delivery as average, fair, \nor poor. That did not make any difference. FPI said it was going to \nsell, and once FPI made\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nthat determination, the Department had no alternative. It does not make \nany difference whether the delivery is lousy, whether the price is too \nhigh, whether the overall performance is poor. It makes no difference. \nForget competition. FPI said: We are going to sell. Forget fairness to \na business with workers in that business. FPI said: Tough. You have to \nbuy from us.\n  So the bottom line is that fully 35 percent of the Department of \nDefense customers indicated they have had a problem with an FPI product \ndelivered in the last 12 months. The reason they are having problems is \nbecause there is a lack of competition.\n  We think, given the fact that such a small amount of money is paid to \nprisoners for their labor, that Federal Prison Industries could supply \nthese products much more cheaply than the private sector. But that is \nnot the case. The case is that the private sector very often can supply \nthese products to our agencies more cheaply than can the prison \nindustries. But if the Federal Prison Industries decides in its \nunilateral, sole, exclusive judgment that it is going to supply the \nDepartment of Defense, that is it. That is it. This is an injustice to \nthe people who have worked hard to put together a business. It is an \ninjustice to the people who work for those businesses.\n  This is one of those weird cases where you have business and labor \ncoming together before us on the same side of an issue. The American \nFederation of Labor, AFL-CIO, urges that this section remain in the \nbill. We have the alert from the Chamber of Commerce as well. Members \nof the Senate, business and labor--our good friend from Texas calls \nthose special interests, business and labor. People who have worked \nhard to put together a business and people who work in those businesses \nare not being allowed to compete. Sorry. Federal Prison Industries says \nyou are going to buy that product. That is what they tell the DOD. You \nare going to buy it. You may not like the price, you may not like the \ndelivery, you may not like the quality, but we are not going to let \nanybody else compete for that sale.\n\n  So that is the fundamental unfairness that this language would \ncorrect. It does not tell the Department of Defense they cannot buy it \nfrom Federal Prison Industries. It simply says that if the Department \nof Defense determines on price or quality that the private sector can \ndo as well, then it--not the FPI; the Department of Defense--may \ncompete and determine whether or not they can save the taxpayers any \nmoney.\n  I am going to close and then turn this over to my friend and my \ncolleague from Michigan for his comments. But I just want to read one \nadditional quote from the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy before \nthe National Security Committee of the House a couple years ago. He \nsaid that the FPI monopoly on Government furniture contracts has \nundermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions for its \nsailors.\n  Master Chief Petty Officer John Hagan said:\n\n       Speaking frankly, the [FPI] product is inferior, costs \n     more, and takes longer to procure. [The Federal Prison \n     Industries] has, in my opinion, exploited their special \n     status instead of making changes which would make them more \n     efficient and competitive. The Navy and other Services need \n     your support to change the law and have FPI compete with \n     [private sector] furniture manufacturers. Without this \n     change, we will not be serving Sailors or taxpayers in the \n     most effective and efficient way.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I am happy to yield time to my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 24 minutes 48 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time would the Senator wish?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suspect I will not use all of the time that I have been allotted, \nbut I do want to speak here today in opposition to the amendment before \nus offered by the Senator from Texas.\n  Especially in light of the grave concerns that all of us share about \nthe readiness of our Armed Forces and the significant steps that \nCongress took in the supplemental appropriations bill to address this \nproblem, as well as in the budget which we passed earlier this year, I \nstrongly believe that section 806 of the defense reauthorization bill \nshould be retained.\n  This is not because I think that having Federal prisoners working is \nnot important. To the contrary, I think it is very important. I firmly \nbelieve that the development through work, self-discipline and other \nvirtues that enable people to lead productive lives is probably the \nsingle greatest hope for rehabilitation in a prison setting. Indeed, it \nis disappointing that, according to the May 20 Wall Street Journal, \nonly 17 percent of Federal prisoners work under the current Federal \nPrison Industries program.\n  But providing for national defense is the Federal Government's \nparamount responsibility. Given the very serious problems we are facing \nwith respect to our military readiness, we need to take every possible \nstep to rectify these problems as quickly and as effectively as \npossible.\n  There is no question in my mind that the requirement that the \nDepartment of Defense contract with FPI for certain products, and \ngiving FPI a veto over the Defense Department's going elsewhere, is an \nobstacle to our efforts to fix these problems. The routine, significant \nfailure by FPI to provide goods that the Defense Department has \ncontracted for on a timely basis--almost half of the time in 1995, and \nover a third of the time in 1996--is simply unacceptable. To have the \nDefense Department depend on FPI for over 300 different products under \nthese circumstances is also simply unacceptable.\n  Finally, in this era of tight budgets, to be spending precious \ndefense resources on FPI goods that we could be obtaining at lower \nprices from the private sector is also unacceptable.\n  We should obviously address these problems by allowing the Department \nof Defense to go elsewhere and to do so without getting advance \npermission from FPI. I am glad the Armed Services Committee, at the \nprompting of my colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, has so provided in the reauthorization bill that recently passed \nout of committee.\n  I would add that the provision adopted by the Armed Services \nCommittee still requires the Department of Defense to give FPI the \nopportunity to compete for contracts for almost all products and only \npermits the Department of Defense to go elsewhere if it determines that \nthe product being offered by FPI is not comparable in price, quality, \nand time of delivery to products available from the private sector.\n  The only exceptions are for national security systems, products \nintegral to or embedded in a product not available from FPI, or \nproducts that cost less than $2,500. In those instances, under section \n806, the Department of Defense does not have to seek a bid from FPI, \nbut in all other instances DOD would continue to be required to do so.\n  It will be argued that we cannot follow this course without \njeopardizing another important Federal policy, that of putting Federal \ninmates to work. But if that were really our only option, we would be \nfacing a much harder choice, since we would arguably be having to \nchoose between pursuing a course critical to securing tranquility \nabroad and a course important to securing domestic tranquility. I do \nnot believe we are really faced with that dilemma.\n  Rather, I am convinced that the limits this legislation imposes on \nthe FPI monopoly can plainly be offset by expanding other opportunities \nfor prisoners to work. This could be done, for example, by having the \nFPI focus on products that we do not produce domestically and that we \nare now importing from abroad. Or it could be done by putting prisoners \nto work on functions that are currently being assigned to government \nentities such as recycling.\n  It will be argued that we should come up with the new opportunities \nfirst and then consider proposals along the lines of section 806 if the \nother options prove workable. I disagree. I believe we should put the \nneeds of our national defense ahead of the needs of prisoners. I have \nno real question that if we do so,\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\nwe will discover that in fact we are able to devise policies that \nadequately address both sets of needs.\n  I will just close by restating what I said last year in a similar \ndebate. None of us who are advocating a change in policy here are \nadvocating the elimination of work requirements for Federal prisoners. \nBut when Federal prisoners in the work they do are taking jobs away \nfrom law-abiding Americans who have never committed a crime, then I \nthink we have to reexamine our policy.\n  To me, it makes sense to devise a prison work policy that does not \ninjure law-abiding citizens. I believe that requiring the FPI to be \ncompetitive in its bidding process and not granting it a monopoly are \nthe right way to achieve this end. That way the taxpayers are protected \nfrom paying excessively for furniture or other items that are produced \nby the Prison Industries, and those individuals working in the private \nsector in competition with the Prison Industries have a legitimate \nopportunity to secure government contracts. To me, that is the American \nway, the competitive process.\n  To me, if the Federal Prison Industries can't be competitive in that \nsetting, where it has so much of a subsidy advantage to begin with, \nthen it seems to me that the system isn't working the way it should be.\n  I hope that we will vote to retain in place section 806 and that, at \nleast in the specific context of the Department of Defense, we will \nfollow the lead that has already been laid out by Senator Levin in the \nauthorization bill as it comes to the floor.\n  To me, that is a sensible course for us to pursue. It strikes the \nright balance. It by no means eliminates the work requirement for \nprisoners, but it does provide people who are law-abiding citizens, \ncompanies that are law-abiding companies, a chance to do business with \nthe government in a very vital and sensitive area, specifically that of \nnational security. To me, that is a sensible middle ground. Therefore, \nI hope that our colleagues will vote in opposition to this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a matter which the Armed Services Committee \nconsidered with some care and considerable debate. It is not as if we \njust accepted it. There was discussion, and our former chairman spoke \nvery strongly on behalf of the other side of the issue.\n  I am just astonished that we cannot seem to convince the prison group \nthat competition would be good. It would raise the quality. That is \nwhat concerns so many of us on the committee. It would provide \nincentives for the Federal Prison Industries to deliver quality goods \nin a timely fashion and at a reasonable price. That is what this whole \ncountry is predicated on.\n  This is interesting. The Department of the Air Force gets 2 million \nplus in launchers, guided-missile launchers, fiber optic cable \nassemblies. People think they are doing little, simple things, crafts \nand so forth, but there is a lot of high-tech equipment at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Here is the Army, another guided-missile remote control; the Army, \nlaunchers, rocket and pyrotech; the Army, fiber rope, cordage; the \nArmy, radio and TV communications equipment; the Army, antennas, wave \nguides and related; the Army, fiber optic cable assemblies.\n  I mean, these are hardly simple matters. These are very complicated \nsystems. We simply have to have quality for the Department of Defense. \nThis is what concerns me.\n  I could go on into some of the Navy engine electrical systems, all \nkinds of high-tech stuff listed in here. You see the office furniture, \nthe office supplies. Here is one for some armor. In other words, we are \ntalking about serious business for the Department of Defense. It is \nvery serious business. We cannot be giving the strong disadvantage in \nthe competitive world to the prisons and have them supply inferior \nequipment. I strongly urge Senators to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I had \nthe good fortune of having Senator Byrd, Senator Hatch and Senator \nThurmond speak on behalf of my amendment, and those are riches you \ndon't turn down. But there have been many points made that I have not \nhad an opportunity to respond to. If the Senator is not going to use \nthe rest of his time, I would like about 4 minutes to respond. I ask \nunanimous consent that I might have it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am sorry. I was discussing something with \nthe chairman. I know that he is conscience of the time. I am wondering \nwhether he might repeat the unanimous consent request so that we could \nboth hear it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am sorry. I didn't hear.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I apologize. I was discussing something with the chairman. \nWe didn't hear the unanimous consent request relative to time, at least \nI didn't.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not want to throw off the vote, but I made an opening \nstatement. I had several other of my colleagues speak on behalf of my \namendment more articulately than I was able to, and I am grateful, but \nI would like to have 4 minutes to sort of answer some of the points \nthat have been made. It just turned out, because people that were for \nthe amendment came to the floor, that they all spoke before any of \nthose that were opposed to it had the opportunity to speak. So if it \ndoesn't mess up our timetable, I would like to have 4 minutes to \nrespond to some of the issues that have been raised.\n  Mr. WARNER. We certainly can accede to that. It is a perfectly \nreasonable request. I think my colleague and I will be just about ready \nto yield back the balance of our time. Then we will turn to the \namendment by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. The first \norder of business will be for him to amend the amendment that is at the \ndesk. Then we will complete the debate on that, and we should meet the \ntarget of about 7:00 to have two stacked votes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, how much time is left to \nthe opponents of Senator Gramm's amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 12 minutes 30 seconds. The \nproponents' time has been exhausted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How many seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds, 12 minutes 30 seconds.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, let me make it clear, the \nDefense Department does not support this amendment. The Defense \nDepartment issued a joint report with the Department of Prisons, the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons, outlining ways of improving the system that \nrequired no legislation. The administration, on behalf of the Defense \nDepartment and the Department of Justice, opposes the Levin provision \nand supports the amendment that we have offered to strike it.\n  The Attorney General supports our motion to strike the Levin \namendment, as do many groups such as the National Center for Victims of \nCrime.\n  It is obviously a very strong argument with me to talk about, ``why \nnot competition?'' The problem is, you have to understand the history \nthat competition was the rule prior to the Depression. Prior to the \nDepression, virtually everyone in prison in America worked on average \n12 hours a day, 6 days a week. But during the Depression, we passed \nthree pieces of legislation, all of them driven by special interests, \ntriggered by the Depression, which made it illegal for prisoners to \nwork to sell goods in the market. There had been previous provisions so \nthat they didn't glut the market in one area, but the problem is, now \nit is criminal for prisoners to work to produce anything to sell in \nAmerica.\n  When my colleagues say why not have competition, my answer is, yes, \nlet's have it. But you cannot have it without letting prison labor \ncompete, and now that is prohibited all over America. The only thing \nleft for prisoners today is to produce things that the Government uses. \nThat is the only thing that we have not prohibited by law. As a result, \nwe have 1.1 million prisoners and about 900,000 of them have no work to \ndo.\n\n  If the amendment of Senator Levin passed, 60 percent of the prison \nlabor at\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\nthe Federal level in America would be eliminated because there would be \nno work for these people to do. So this is an argument about \ncompetition that sounds great until you understand that Government, \ndriven by the same groups that support this amendment, eliminated the \nability to use prison labor to produce and sell anything.\n  When you are talking about the taxpayer, it sounds great. But what \nabout the taxpayer that is spending $22,000 a year to keep somebody in \nprison and we are not allowing them to work? If taxpayers are working, \nwhy are they better than taxpayers? Why should they not have to work? \nWhy can't we find things in the private sector for them to produce? If \nwe can do that, I would support this amendment. I know that many of the \npeople who support it would never do that.\n  The Defense Department is not for this amendment. They are not for \nthe Levin amendment. They are not objecting to the provisions. In fact, \nthey just put out a joint report saying the Defense Department supports \nthe program with these reforms, which they can undertake without \nlegislation.\n  So, basically, I believe that the system is not perfect, but it is \nbasically a good system where prices are negotiated and the Defense \nDepartment gets 90 percent of the waivers that they seek. If they don't \nthink the quality is right or the price is right or the delivery is \nright, they can ask for a waiver. In 90 percent of the cases, they get \nthe waiver.\n  This is basically an amendment, I am sad to say, that would idle 60 \npercent of Federal prisoners. It would allow private companies to come \nin and take the business. But the point is, when we have full \nemployment in America and we have a million prisoners idle, how does it \nmake sense to prohibit them from working? I thank my colleague for \ngiving me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the language in the bill that the Senator \nfrom Texas seeks to strike makes it possible for the private sector to \ncompete. That sounds so fundamental in our country that maybe it comes \nas a shock that I would even suggest that you need to have language in \na bill to permit the private sector to do this. But we do.\n  We just want to make it legal for the private sector to offer a \nproduct to its Government, our Government, and not to have Federal \nPrison Industries say: Sorry, you cannot bid. It is almost bizarre to \nme that we would have to pass any kind of legislation for that to come \nabout, but we do because under the current law and regulations, Federal \nPrison Industries has the sole, exclusive determining voice. If it says \nthat its product is within a range in the market--maybe at the high end \nof that range, and they may be wrong--but once FPI says that, that is \nit; private business cannot compete.\n  In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week, \nthe Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, David Oliver, \ndescribed the results of the survey we referred to.\n  He said the following:\n\n       I think if you looked at the study, you would see that \n     people were generally not satisfied with Federal Prison \n     Industries as a provider. Essentially, with regard to \n     efficiency, timeliness, and best value, they found that \n     Federal Prison Industries was worse than the other people \n     they bought from.\n\n  Now, we know that the administration has decided to oppose this \nchange, to prohibit the private sector from bidding on things that \nFederal Prison Industries says it wants to supply exclusively. So we \nunderstand what the Department of Defense's official position is. But I \nalso understand what the testimony of their acquisition people is. The \nstudy shows that people were generally not satisfied with Federal \nPrison Industries as a provider with regard to efficiency, timeliness, \nand best value. They found that Federal Prison Industries was worse \nthan the other people they bought from.\n\n  I don't believe for one minute that Federal Prison Industries is \ngoing to be able to sell anything to the Department of Defense just \nbecause they are going to have to compete. They have such a huge \nadvantage in terms of cost and price of labor that they are going to be \nable to sell a huge amount. But they are going to have to compete.\n  If a private company can outbid them or provide the same product at a \ncheaper price, then the private company is going to get it. But for the \nSenator from Texas to say, suddenly, that wipes out all of the sales to \nthe Department of Defense, that is a terrible indictment about what \nFederal Prison Industries is now doing. That would mean they can't \ncompete on anything they are selling to the Department of Defense. That \nis a huge exaggeration. It is not the case.\n  But it is the case that now they don't have to compete when they \ndecide that the Department of Defense must buy that missile part. If \nFederal Prison Industries says the Department of Defense must buy that \nmissile part Senator Warner referred to, that has to happen--even \nthough a private contractor can sell a better quality at a better \nprice. Once FPI, in its unilateral judgment, says we can supply it \nwithin a price range of what the private sector can do, that is it, no \ncompetition. DOD can't bid it out--the opposite of what we should be \ndoing in this free enterprise society of ours.\n  Mr. President, I hope the language in the Senate bill will be \nretained and that the amendment of the Senator from Texas to strike \nthat language will be defeated.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague. Again, it was \ncarefully considered by the committee. It has very fundamental \nobjectives: competition, fairness, and to get quality.\n  Mr. President, I am anxious to complete this amendment. I believe the \nSenator from Texas has finished his presentation?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I have.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 383\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate returns to the amendment of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 5 \nminutes 30 seconds, and the Senator from Virginia controls 3 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I note that will bring us very close, if \nnot precisely, to the hour of 7 o'clock, at which time the managers \nrepresented to the leadership and other Senators that two back-to-back \nvotes would commence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides, simply stated, \nthat there shall be no funds expended for ground forces in Yugoslavia, \nin Kosovo, unless specifically authorized by the Congress.\n  This amendment is designed to uphold the Constitution of the United \nStates, which grants the exclusive authority to declare war to the \nCongress of the United States. Regrettably, there has been a \nsignificant erosion of this constitutional authority, as Presidents \nhave taken over this power without having the Congress stand up. The \none place where the Congress clearly has authority to determine \nmilitary action is by controlling the purse strings. This amendment \ngoes to the heart of that issue by prohibiting that spending.\n\n  It has been a lively and spirited debate. Now we will have an \nopportunity to say whether the Senate will seek to uphold the \nConstitution and whether the Senate will seek to uphold its own \ninstitutional authority--the institutional authority of the Congress to \ndetermine whether the United States should be involved in war.\n  A few of the problems which have been raised have been clarified. The \namendment has been modified, and I ask that it formally be approved \nwith the concurrence of the managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no objection to the Senator \nsending to the desk the amendment as modified.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the general counsel of the committee for helping \nme on the modification that we have worked out so that the restriction \nwill not apply to intelligence operations, to\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nrescue operations, or to military emergencies.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is no objection on this side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator from Pennsylvania add me as a \ncosponsor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThurmond be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 383), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION ON DEPLOYMENT OF GROUND TROOPS IN THE \n                   FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA.\n\n       (a) None of the funds authorized or otherwise available to \n     the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for \n     the deployment of ground troops of the United States Armed \n     Forces in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, except for \n     peacekeeping personnel, unless authorized by a declaration of \n     war or a joint resolution authorizing the use of military \n     force.\n       (b) The prohibition in subsection (a) shall not apply to \n     intelligence operations, or to missions to rescue United \n     States military personnel or citizens of the United States, \n     or otherwise meet military emergencies, in the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the main argument against this amendment \nhas been that the President has said that he would come to Congress in \nadvance of deploying ground troops. He made that commitment in a \nmeeting at the White House on April 28. Then he sent a letter, which is \nsubstantially equivocal, saying that he will fully consult with the \nCongress, and that he would ask for congressional support before \nintroducing U.S. ground forces into Kosovo, into a nonpermissive \nenvironment.\n  That doesn't go far enough.\n  The distinguished chairman has reported that the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff have confirmed that there would be congressional \nauthorization.\n  That doesn't go far enough.\n  We are a government of laws--not a government of men. And minds may \nbe changed. We ought to be sure we have this nailed down.\n  This amendment is entirely consistent with what the Senate has \nheretofore done--58 to 41 to authorize air strikes but no ground \nforces. Seventy-seven Senators voted not to grant the President \nauthority to use whatever force he chose. To remain consistent, those \n77 Senators would have to say, we are not going to allow you to use \nground forces unless you come to us for approval, just as we said we \nwill not allow you to use whatever force you choose, in effect, without \ncoming to us for prior approval. Consistency may be the hobgoblin of \nsmall minds, but consistency and the institutional prerogatives of the \nCongress and the Senate call for an affirmative vote, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains for me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 50 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan wishes to \naddress the amendment. We are together on it in the strongest possible \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment would send the \nworst possible signal to Milosevic, which is don't worry, weather the \nstorm--that even though there is going to be gridlock in the Congress, \nyou will be the beneficiary of any gridlock and any effort that \nauthorizes in advance the use of ground forces. This is not the message \nwhich we should be sending to Milosevic--that he would be the \nbeneficiary of the congressional gridlock, which would almost certainly \noccur before any such resolutions could be passed.\n  I hope we will not send that signal to Milosevic. I think our troops \ndeserve better. Our commanders deserve better.\n  The administration believes so strongly in this that a veto would \nalmost certainly occur, if this provision were in, and understandably \nso, because the hands of our commanders in the field would be tied by \nthis resolution. They would have to come to Congress to see whether or \nnot the terms were met. That is not the way to fight either a war or to \nengage in combat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of the afternoon, as I said \nto my good friend and colleague, some 40 Senators have received the \nbenefit of a full debate with the Secretaries of State and Defense, and \nthe President's National Security Adviser, Mr. Berger, and with the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs. Three times--twice by this Senator, one \nby another Senator--this very issue was posed to the national security \nteam. They said without any equivocation whatsoever that the President \nwould formally come to the Congress and seek legislation, not unlike \nwhat is described in this amendment prior to any change. In other \nwords, the President of the United States is presently unchanged in the \ncourse of action that he is recommending to other leaders of the NATO \nnations, and the matter remains and will not be changed with reference \nto ground troops unless the President comes up and seeks from the \nCongress of the United States formal legislative action.\n\n  I say to my good friend that I think we have achieved, in essence, \nwhat he seeks. As I pointed out in my first comments this morning and, \nindeed, in the title to the first amendment prior to the amending by \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, he referred to the War Powers Act, this \nis precisely what this debate is--a debate over the War Powers Act. \nThat debate has not in my 21 years in this body ever been resolved, and \nI doubt it is going to be resolved on this vote.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I reject the argument of the Senator from \nVirginia who wants to rely on assurances. This is a government of laws, \nand not men, and you get it done by this amendment.\n  I reject the argument of the Senator from Michigan who says it is a \nbad signal to Milosevic. Whatever signal goes to Milosevic from this \namendment has already been sent by the assurances of the President.\n  It is a bad signal to America to tell the Country that the Congress \nis delegating its authority to involve this Nation in war to the \nPresident. We don't have the authority to delegate our constitutional \nauthority. Our job is to analyze the facts and let the President come \nto us to state a case for the use of ground forces. I am prepared to \nlisten. But, on this record, we ought to maintain the institutional \nauthority of Congress and uphold the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, does any time remain on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 10 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could I use the 10 seconds?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Michigan can use 5, and I will use 5. \nTake 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Department of Defense strongly opposes \nthe amendment because it would unacceptably put at risk the lives of \nU.S. military personnel.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, a vote against this amendment is \nconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 383, as modified. On this question, the yeas and \nnays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 145 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I have a motion to reconsider. I enter a \nmotion to reconsider the vote, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to advise the Senate with regard to the \nimportant business remaining to be performed tonight, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate now proceed to an amendment to be offered by \nSenators McCain and Levin re: BRAC and that there be 3\\1/2\\ hours of \ndebate equally divided between the proponents and opponents.\n  I further ask consent that all debate time be consumed during \nTuesday, May 25, except for 2 hours, to be equally divided, and to \nresume at 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday.\n  I further ask consent that the vote occur on or in relation to the \nBRAC amendment on Wednesday at 1:45 p.m. and no amendments be in order \nto the amendment prior to the 1:45 p.m. vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there \nwill be no reinstitution of a vote tonight. It is not the leader's \ndesire; I wish to make that clear.\n  Mr. GRAMM. My intention would be to try to have the reconsideration \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder whether or not we might be able to \nschedule an amendment earlier in the morning for Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are working on that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. At 10:30; is that the effort?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. Let me just finish this and then I think \nit will be clear.\n  Now, Mr. President, if I may continue, in light of this agreement, \nthere will be no further votes this evening. Senators interested in the \nBRAC debate should remain this evening. The Senate will resume the DOD \nbill at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, and two amendments are expected to be \noffered prior to the 11:45 a.m. resumption of the BRAC debate. \nTherefore, at least one vote, if not more votes, will occur beginning \nat 1:45 p.m. on Wednesday.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could inquire of the chairman as to the two \namendments he is referring to.\n  Mr. WARNER. One under consideration is Senator Brownback's, and it \nrelates to India and Pakistan and the current sanctions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What was the other amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Robert Kerrey on strategic nuclear delivery \nsystems.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And it is the hope of the chairman that both of those be \ndebated in the morning?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would hope so, together with the remainder of BRAC.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope that during this evening we will be able to try to \nschedule timing for those amendments, if possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would be happy to----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not know the status, particularly, of the first one, \nbut I would like to work on that this evening.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 393\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Levin, \nSenator Bryan, Senator Leahy, Senator Kohl, Senator Lieberman, Senator \nRobb, Senator Kyl, Senator Hagel, and Senator Chafee, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Robb, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Chafee, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 393.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 450, below line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2822.

Mr. President, this amendment authorizes a single round \nof U.S. military installation realignment and base closures to occur in \nthe year 2001.\n  It is an argument and a debate that we have had several times in the \npast few years, but obviously the argument deserves to be ventilated \nagain. I am reminded, in considering this amendment, of a comment made \nby my old dear and beloved friend, Morris Udall, of my home State of \nArizona, who once said after a long discussion of an issue that had \nbeen fairly well ventilated:\n\n       Everything that could possibly be said on this issue has \n     been said, only not everyone has said it.\n\n  I think that, again, will be the case with this base closing \namendment, because we have been around this track on several occasions. \nBut I do have to credit the imagination and inventiveness of the \nopponents of the base closing round because they continue to invent new \nreasons to oppose a round of base closings. They are charming ideas. \nOne of them you will probably hear is that base closings don't save \nmoney. That is a very interesting and entertaining argument. I wish we \nhad held to that argument after World War II was over, because we would \nstill have some 150 bases in my State of Arizona, which I am sure would \nbe a significant benefit to our economy.\n  Another aspect of this debate you will hear is that the issue of base \nclosings has been politicized and, therefore, we can't have one. I \nthink my friend, the distinguished chairman, has come up with a new and \nentertaining argument that every time we go through a base closing, \nevery town, city, and State goes through a very difficult period of \ntime. I agree with him. I certainly agree with him as he will pose that \nargument. But that doesn't in the slightest change the requirement that \nwe need to close some bases.\n  I have to tell my friend, the chairman, it doesn't ring true to stand \nand lament the state of the military, our declining readiness, our lack \nof modernization of the force, all of the evils, the recruitment \nproblems, and the failure to fund much-needed programs, and then not \nsupport what is clearly most needed, according to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and according to the Secretary of Defense--and \naccording, really, to every objective observer of our military \nestablishment.\n  Why is it that it took us a month to get Apache helicopters from \nGermany to Albania? Why is it that we are now hearing if we decided \ntomorrow to prepare for ground troops--an idea which was soundly \nrejected by this body--but if finally the recognition came about that \nwe are really not winning this conflict, that Mr. Milosevic is \nachieving all of his objectives, and we continue to hear great reports \nabout how we have destroyed so much of their capability, yet, the \nethnic cleansing is nearing completion and Mr. Milosevic has more \ntroops now than less, why is\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\nit that it would take many, many weeks, if not months, to get a force \nin place in order to move into Kosovo to help right the atrocities that \nhave been committed there? It is because we have not restructured our \nmilitary establishment. It is that simple.\n  The military establishment in the cold war, very correctly, was \nstructured for a massive conventional tank war on the plains of Europe, \nthe central plains of Europe. That was what our military was all about, \nand that was the major threat to our security. And now we have a \nmilitary, which we have failed to restructure, we have failed to make \nmobile, we have failed to become capable to move anyplace in the \nworld--in this case rather a short distance, from Germany to Albania--\nand, once there, decisively impact the battlefield equation. There are \nmany reasons for this.\n\n  There was a great article in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago \nabout how the Army had plans to restructure; yet, at the end of the \nday, they failed to do so for various reasons--by the way, the lesson \nbeing that the military will not restructure itself. It has to be done \nwith an active role by the Congress.\n  But to sit here, as we are today, with all these shortages, where all \nof us are lamenting the incredible problems we have; yet, we then \nsupport a base structure which cannot be justified for any logical \nreason, is something that I think causes us great credibility \nproblems--first, with people who pay attention to these kinds of \nthings, and, second, at the end of the day with the American people.\n  I say this with full realization and appreciation that there are \nbases in my home State that may be in danger of being closed. There was \na base closed in the round of base closings before the last one, which, \nby the way, is now generating more revenue for the State of Arizona \nthan it did while it was a functioning military base. But setting that \naside, when the base was closed, of course, there was great trauma. \nThere was great dislocation among many civilians who worked out at \nWilliams Air Force Base. But the fact is that we have to reduce the \nsize of our base structures or we will continue to not be able to fund \nthe much-needed improvements that are absolutely vital to us being able \nto conduct a conflict or war.\n  Our former colleague, Secretary Cohen, says.\n\n       Nevertheless, no other reform even comes close to offering \n     the potential savings afforded by even a single round of \n     BRAC. There simply is no substitute for base closure and \n     realignment.\n       The two additional rounds under consideration will \n     ultimately save $20 billion and generate $3.6 billion \n     annually,\n       Moreover, the Department continues to streamline the \n     process, making it even easier for communities to dispose of \n     base property and to create new jobs in the future.\n\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote:\n\n       We are writing to you to express our strong and unified \n     support for authorization for additional rounds of base \n     closures . . . .\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The importance of BRAC goes beyond savings, however. BRAC \n     is the single most effective tool available to the Services \n     to realign their infrastructure to meet the needs of changing \n     organizations and to respond to new ways of doing business. \n     No other initiative can substitute for BRAC in terms of \n     ability to reduce and reshape our infrastructure. Simply \n     stated, our military judgment is that further base closures \n     are absolutely necessary.\n\n  Signed by all of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Cohen and the \nletter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                        1000 Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Armed Services Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Carl: As I have on many occasions, I want to convey my \n     strong support for approval of additional rounds of Base \n     Realignment and Closure (BRAC) authority as part of the FY \n     2000 Department of Defense Authorization Bill, which the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee is marking up this week.\n       As you are aware, the first three rounds of BRAC have \n     already yielded some $3.9 billion net savings in FY 1999 and \n     will generate more than $25 billion by the year 2003. These \n     savings have proven absolutely critical to sustaining ongoing \n     operations and current levels of military readiness, \n     modernization and the quality of life of our men and women in \n     uniform. Even still, the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     points out that the Department of Defense continues to retain \n     excess infrastructure, which we estimate at roughly 23 \n     percent beyond our needs.\n       As you know, we are aggressively reforming the Department's \n     business operations and support infrastructure to realize \n     savings wherever possible. Nevertheless, no other reform even \n     comes close to offering the potential savings afforded by \n     even a single round of BRAC. There simply is no substitute \n     for base closure and realignment.\n       The two additional rounds under consideration by the \n     Committee will ultimately save $20 billion and generate $3.6 \n     billion dollars annually. Both the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the GAO affirm the reasonableness and credibility \n     of our estimates for savings from BRAC. In exchange for \n     property that we neither want nor need, we can direct $3.6 \n     billion on an annual basis into weapons that give our troops \n     a life-saving edge, into training that keeps our forces the \n     finest in the world, and into the quality of life of military \n     families.\n       I well appreciate both the difficult decision you and your \n     colleagues now face, as well as the legitimate concerns of \n     bases and communities potentially affected by additional \n     rounds of BRAC. At the same time, many success stories across \n     the nation prove that base closure and realignment can \n     actually lead to increased economic growth. In fact, the GAO \n     recently noted that in most post-BRAC communities incomes are \n     actually rising faster and unemployment rates are lower than \n     the national average. Moreover, the Department continues to \n     streamline the process, making it even easier for communities \n     to dispose of base property and to create new jobs in the \n     future.\n       The Department's ability to properly support America's men \n     and women in uniform today and to sustain them into the \n     future hinge in great measure on realizing the critical \n     savings that only BRAC can provide. As such, the Chairman and \n     Joint Chiefs are unanimous in their support of our \n     legislative proposals, and I most strongly solicit your \n     support and that of your colleagues.\n     Bill Cohen.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1999.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to you to express our \n     strong and unified support for authorization for additional \n     rounds of base closures when the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee marks up the FY 2000 Department of Defense \n     Authorization Bill next week.\n       Previous BRAC rounds are already producing savings--$3.9 \n     billion net in 1999 and $25 billion thorugh 2003. We believe \n     that two additional rounds of BRAC will produce even more \n     savings--an additional $3.6 billion each year after \n     implementation. This translates directly into the programs, \n     forces, and budgets that support our national military \n     strategy. Without BRAC, we will not have the maximum possible \n     resources to field and operate future forces while protecting \n     quality of life for our military members. We will also be \n     less able to provide future forces with the modern equipment \n     that is central to the plans and vision we have for \n     transforming the force.\n       The Department's April 1998 report to Congress demonstrates \n     that 23 percent excess capacity exists. The Congressional \n     Budget Office agrees that our approach to estimating excess \n     capacity yields a credible estimate. The General Accounting \n     Office also agrees that DOD continues to retain excess \n     capacity.\n       The importance of BRAC goes beyond savings, however. BRAC \n     is the single most effective tool available to the Services \n     to realign their infrastructure to meet the needs of changing \n     organizations and to respond to new ways of doing business. \n     No other initiative can substitute for BRAC in terms of \n     ability to reduce and reshape infrastructure. Simply stated, \n     our military judgment is that further base closures are \n     absolutely necessary.\n       BRAC will enable us to better shape the quality of the \n     forces protecting America in the 21st century. As you \n     consider the 2000 budget, we ask you to support this \n     proposal.\n                                    General Henry H. Shelton, USA,\n                                  Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                    General Dennis J. Reimer, USA,\n                                          Chief of Staff, US Army.\n                                    General Michael E. Ryan, USAF,\n                                     Chief of Staff, US Air Force.\n                                  General Joseph W.

Johnson, USN,\n                                        Chief of Naval Operations.\n                                   General Charles C. Krulak, USMC\n                                   Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, \nwe have been over this many, many times. The annual net savings from \nprevious BRAC rounds will grow from almost $4 billion this year to \n$5.67 billion per year by 2001. The savings are real. They are coming \nsooner and are greater than anticipated.\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\n  GAO recently noted that in most communities where bases were closed \nincomes are actually rising faster and unemployment rates are lower \nthan the national average. Additionally, a provision in the bill allows \nfor the no-cost transfer of property from the military to the community \nin areas that are affected by the closures.\n  Our Armed Services are carrying the burden of managing and paying for \nan estimated 23 percent of excess infrastructure that will cost $3.6 \nbillion this year alone, $3.6 billion that could be spent in efforts to \nretrain our pilots who are getting out faster than we can train them. \nIt could be spent on recruiting qualified men and women of which there \nare significant shortfalls, especially in the U.S. Navy. It could be \nspent on retaining the highly qualified men and women who are leaving \nthe Armed Forces in droves. There are so many things we can do with an \nadditional $3.6 billion. But it will probably not happen.\n\n  I want to tell my colleagues that occasionally we lose credibility \naround here because of some of the things we do--the pork barrel \nspending, for example, that seems to be on the rise rather than \ndecreasing, if you had the chance to examine the supplemental emergency \nbill we just passed. That, of course, is not pleasant for me to \ncontemplate.\n  But when we are fooling around with national security, when we are \nfooling around with our Nation's ability to defend our vital national \ninterests in these very unsettling times, then I would argue that we \nbear a heavy responsibility.\n  This is a simple amendment--one round, year 2001. The Commission is \nnot appointed until May 2001. So this President does not have any hand \nin the appointment of a base closing commission. We really need two \nrounds. But this is at the request of the Senator from Michigan. It \nwill only be one round.\n  Savings over the next 4 years are conservatively estimated to reach \n$25 billion. We probably won't do it. We probably won't do it. We \ncouldn't do it in the Armed Services Committee, the committee that is \nsupposed to have the most knowledgeable people on national defense.\n  Again, there are really some of the most interesting arguments I have \never heard. We save money by not closing bases. That is an interesting \nargument. Again, I wish we had never closed a base after World War II, \nusing that logic. Or perhaps we should build more bases. The fact is \nthat this causes discomfort to towns, communities, and States around \nthe country when a base closing commission is appointed. I agree with \nthat. I am sorry that happens. I stack that discomfort up against the \nfact that we still have 11,000 enlisted men and women on food stamps.\n  I hope we will have the American people at least weigh in on this \nissue, because they understand. They get it. They get what is going on \nhere. They get why we are not having a base closing round when we need \nit. They know why it is being done. It will not pass but for one simple \nreason; that is, strictly parochial concerns that somehow there may be \nsome political backlash associated with the closure of a base. I find \nthat disgraceful.\n  I appeal again to the better angels of our nature, and recognize that \nevery military expert within the military establishment, both within \nthe Government and without, says that we need to close bases. We need \nto have a base closing round, and we do not have to make it political.\n  We have put in every possible constraint to prevent there being so \nmany. We need to do it soon. Otherwise, we will continue to suffer in \nour capability. We will continue to suffer in our readiness. We will \ncontinue to suffer in our modernization. But most of all, these brave \nyoung men and women who serve our country will be shortchanged because \nwe will not have adequate funds.\n  I know a lot of these young people do not vote. I know a lot of them \ndon't even get absentee ballots. Many of them are stationed far away. \nBut I think perhaps we ought to have concern about them in how these \nfunds can improve their lives and keep many of them in the military and \nkeep our Nation ready to defend itself.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment that would \nauthorize a single round of base closures during the year 2001. I \ncommend both the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Michigan for \npresenting this amendment to the Senate today.\n  I am well aware that we all recognize this is a very sensitive issue, \nbecause it potentially impacts the constituents of each and every one \nof the Members of the Senator.\n  My home State of Rhode Island is no exception to this. We are the \nproud home to a significant presence of the U.S. Navy, both at the \nNaval War College and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport.\n  We have a tradition of Naval service in Rhode Island. As in every \nother State, we are sensitive to the potential vulnerabilities of \nanother round of base closures. But I, for one, recognize the \nimperative nature of doing this, for many of the reasons that were so \nwell outlined by the Senator from Arizona.\n  We have already in the past in Rhode Island--and I suspect in other \nplaces around the country--suffered from cutbacks. In fact, before the \nbase closing process was established back in the early 1970s, one of \nour major bases, Quonset Point Air Station, was closed and, indeed, we \nlost effectively all of the surface ships that used to regularly \nbe stationed in Newport. The result was traumatic to my home State.\n\n  Rhode Island is the smallest State in the country. Every family in \nRhode Island either had some connection to Quonset Point Air Station or \nknew someone who worked there. Whole families had to leave the State. \nMany moved down to Wilmington, NC, where there was another naval \naviation center. It caused great trauma and it set our economy back \ntremendously. In fact, we are still trying to reestablish and \nregenerate that site.\n  But despite all of that--despite the real costs to individuals, the \nreal costs to families--we have to do this in order to maintain a \nnational defense that will truly be efficient and effective.\n  It is difficult to talk about this issue and to tell constituents \nthat there might be another round of base closings, but it is \nabsolutely necessary. We are maintaining a cold war military structure \nin terms of bases. Yet, we know we need to reform and to reorganize. We \nwill face new threats in the century beyond with a cold war military \nstructure.\n  As the Senator from Arizona said, we organized so much of our \nmilitary to support a huge landforce that was designed to counterattack \na threat from the former Soviet Union. That has mercifully evaporated \nwith the demise of the Soviet Union. The new threats to our national \nsecurity are different. Yet, we still have the same cold war base \ninfrastructure which we must reform, and the only practical way to do \nthat is to organize another round of base closings.\n  It is a difficult decision, but it is a decision that we must make.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. This is almost a mathematical \nequation in terms of what we must do. We are maintaining approximately \n23 percent extra capacity in the Department of Defense in terms of our \nbases. If you look at our force structure, the troops in the field, the \nmen and women who are actually the war-fighters who defend the Nation \nevery day, we have reduced those numbers by 36 percent since 1989. Yet, \nwe have only been able to reduce our infrastructure by 21 percent. \nThere is an imbalance. We have a smaller force structure. Yet we still \nhave much of the old real estate that we accumulated from World War II \nall the way through the cold war.\n  We already embarked on limited base reductions in previous base \nclosing rounds. We have saved approximately\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\n$3.9 billion to date. It is estimated that the base closing process \nthat has already taken place will yield $25 billion by the year 2003.\n  Those are the significant savings. Yet, we hear lots of folks \ndisputing the savings. I think everyone in America recognizes that when \nyou close unnecessary bases, you save money. That is what corporate \nAmerica has been doing now for the last 10 years. That is, in fact, one \nof the reasons why American productivity and American corporate profits \nare soaring and Wall Street is reflecting those results. It is because \nAmerican businesses have the flexibility to close unwanted facilities, \nmany times painfully so, to small communities.\n  But in the military establishment, we have denied our managers--the \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and his \ncolleagues--that same type of flexibility. We have done it in a way \nwhich has retarded our ability to save billions of dollars which we \nneed for other priorities in the Department of Defense.\n  Another charge was raised in this discussion about why base closings \nshouldn't be pursued at this moment. It said that there is no effective \naudit of these savings. In many respects, what we have saved, if you \nwill, are costs that would have been incurred. They are foregone. They \nwon't be incurred. It is difficult to audit some things you won't spend \nmoney on, but those savings are equally real.\n\n  We have a situation where we know we have saved money in previous \nbase closing rounds--billions of dollars. And we know through estimates \nthat we will save in this round additional money if we authorize an \nadditional round of base closings. This is an estimate that has been \nagreed to by both the Congressional Budget Office and the General \nAccounting Office. They estimated there is excess capacity, that we can \nsave money by another round of base closings.\n  There is another argument that has been raised to try to defeat the \nnotion of a new round of base closings: That the environmental cleanup \ncosts associated with closing bases eats up all the savings.\n  The reality, legally, is that the Department of Defense is \nresponsible for these cleanup costs regardless of whether they keep the \nbases open or they close them. The only difference is an accounting \ndifference. When you close a base, there is much more of an accelerated \ncleanup so the property can be turned over to civilian authority. In \nterms of the dollar responsibility, the contingent liabilities out \nthere for cleanup of military bases remain the same, regardless of \nwhether we have a base closing round or we just simply let these excess \nbases continue to operate. That, too, is not a reason to defeat the \nnotion of a base closing round today.\n  As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, this is the top priority of \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nthe Service Secretaries, the uniformed heads of our military services. \nThey all know that they need additional dollars for higher priority \nitems than some of these bases.\n  Last September, the Service Chiefs came to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and said they needed more resources to do the job. We were \nquite forthcoming. In fact, we authorized $8.3 billion over the \nPresident's budget request. Yet, when they say they equally need the \nclosing of excess bases, we ignore their plea--equally fervent, equally \nimportant, equally necessary for the success of the Department of \nDefense, yet we ignore this plea.\n  Some of this has been a result of claims that the last base closing \nround was politicized. This proposal is that the process be conducted \nin the year 2001, which is beyond the term of this administration. I \nthink the argument of politicization is false because whatever \nconfidence or lack of confidence you have in this current \nadministration, this proposal, this amendment, would carry it beyond \nthis administration into the next administration.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the problem that troubles the Senator from \nVirginia the most--the California and Texas experiences.\n  As I listened to my good friend from Arizona, he made rational \npositions and I agree with him; the Senator from New Jersey made \nrational positions.\n  However, the practical thing that will happen if the Congress of the \nUnited States were to enact a base closure bill--this bill--the day \nafter the signature is affixed by the President, the work begins in the \nDepartment of Defense down at the level of the services to work up the \nlist of communities which, in the judgment of the Army, the Navy, the \nAir Force and certain DOD facilities is to be boarded up, and \neventually it goes to the BRAC Commission.\n\n  True, the next President would appoint that BRAC Commission. But the \nstaff work would have been done.\n  The communities all across America, as my good friend from Arizona \npointed out in repeating my statement, become suddenly on full alert \nthat it could be their base. They have a long tradition in this country \nof embracing that base. It is not just because of economic reasons and \njobs. It is also, as the Senator well knows, because of the tradition \nin the community.\n  Does the Senator realize I was the Secretary of the Navy who closed \nthe largest naval base and destroyer base in your State? Your \npredecessor, Senator Pastore, brought this humble public servant, the \nSecretary of the Navy, down to the caucus room of the Senate of the \nRussell Building before more cameras than I have ever seen and grilled \nme for hour after hour after hour, together with the Chief of Naval \nOperations. That convinced me that we had to have a process called \nBRAC.\n  I say with humility I was the coauthor of the first BRAC statute, \ncoauthor of the second BRAC statute. Then I lost confidence in BRAC \nbecause of what the Senator just said--the politicization of the \nprocess as it related to decisions in California and Texas. If we were \nto pass this all over America, these communities would suddenly begin \nto wonder: Will politics play as the bureaucrats in the Department of \nDefense begin their assigned task to work up those lists that slowly go \nto the top and eventually to the BRAC Commission?\n  Mr. President, that is the problem. That is a problem shared by so \nmany of our colleagues. That was the problem that was shared by the \nmajority of our committee, the Armed Services Committee, on which we \nall serve with great pride. In two instances, that committee turned \ndown the proposal which the Senators bring before the Senate tonight. \nThat is the process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator doesn't like the fact that it upsets the \ncommunities but believes that we need to close bases, does the Senator \nhave another solution?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, the solution, regrettably, I say to my good friend, \nis that we have to wait until the next President determines whether or \nnot in his judgment we should have a BRAC Commission and he comes \nbefore the Congress and he requests it.\n  I will commit right now, no matter who wins the office of the \nPresidency, including, if I may say with great respect, yourself, I \nwould be the first to sponsor a BRAC Commission under the McCain \nadministration and I will work relentlessly to get it through the \nSenate.\n  But that would be the moment that the bureaucracy begins to work up \nthe list of the communities.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I just say with all due respect, if I may, the \namendment calls for a base closing commission to be appointed in May of \n2001. The election takes place in November of the year 2000, as I seem \nto recollect; some 5 or 6 months later is when the commission is \nappointed.\n  The logic of the Senator from Virginia, in all due respect to my \nchairman, escapes me. There will be a new President of the United \nStates, there will be a new Secretary of Defense. Obviously, the \nchairman doesn't trust or have confidence in the Secretary of Defense \nand the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both of whom sent over \ncompelling statements and letters. So if it is a new President that you \nwant, there will be a new President.\n  If I get this right, what the distinguished chairman is saying is \nthat we will just put everything on hold for a year or two until we get \na new President, then we can start a process?\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\n  This amendment says there will be a new President, there will be a \nnew Secretary of Defense, there will be a new Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, as a matter of fact, and that is what this amendment \ncontemplates.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I reply to both friends, this is a very \ninteresting colloquy.\n  First, I hope my good friend would amend it that the Secretary of \nDefense--perhaps he could stay on and I would join at that point; I \nhave the highest confidence in the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator has a strange way of displaying that \nconfidence if you don't agree with his primary and most important \nrecommendation.\n  Mr. WARNER. But, I say to my good friend, it is not the Secretary. \nThe work begins literally down in the bowels of that building, in which \nI was privileged to remain for 5\\1/2\\ years, down at the low level of \nthe staff beginning to work up those lists. And that political problem \nthat arose in California and Texas could begin to creep into those \nbasement and lower areas in the Pentagon, begin to influence those \ndecisions which would gravitate to the top.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield?\n  Mr. REED. If I can retain my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In all due respect to my friend from Virginia, he knows \nwhere that California and Texas thing came from. It didn't come from \nthe bowels of the Pentagon; it came from the White House. That is why, \nas he knows, we are saying this Commission should only convene after \nthere is a new President of the United States.\n  Mr. WARNER. I agree with that. That is precisely why I object, \nbecause that same White House could begin to communicate down with \nthose good, honest, hard-working GS-14 employees of the Department of \nDefense. That is where it could start.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from Virginia said \nhow much confidence he has in the Secretary of Defense. Is the Senator \nsuggesting that the Secretary of Defense is going to stand by while \nsome political person from somewhere reaches around him into the bowels \nof the Pentagon to give a signal that some base should not be \nconsidered?\n  It is because our good friend from Virginia did not want there to be \nany possibility of any political involvement by anybody that we delayed \nthe date for the Secretary of Defense to transmit the base closure \nrecommendations to September 1, 2002.\n  The new President and the new Secretary of Defense--or the current \none, if he is continued--will have until September 1 to transmit the \nbase closure recommendation. We delayed it 6 months because the \nSenator, in committee, said he was concerned that the preliminary work \ncould be done now and somehow or other, unbeknownst to an honest \nSecretary of Defense--who I think our good friend would concede is an \nhonest one----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This work would begin and somehow or other it would take \nhold.\n  So we delayed the transmittal to September 1 of the year after the \nnew President is elected, 6 months--more than that, 8 months after the \nnew President is in office.\n  It seems to me at this point that the argument about politicization \nis now being used as an excuse not to act. We have done everything we \npossibly can to eliminate any possibility of that. The new President is \nnot required to transmit names for a base closure commission. As the \ngood Senator from Virginia knows, if the new President does not want a \nbase closing round, he or she need not have it. That is the law. All \nthe new President has to do is not nominate anybody.\n  So you have total control in the new President. You have 9 months to \nsubmit the recommendations. At this point, the politicization argument, \nit seems to me--talking about reaching down? I think the good Senator, \nmy good friend, is reaching back.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my friend from Virginia, would he agree to an \namendment which had the base closing round begin in the year 2002?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the answer is very simple: No. Because the \nmoment the ink is dry and this becomes law--would the Senator not agree \nwith me that the staff work begins on this the day it becomes law? The \ndecisions begin to be made. The communities all across America go on \nfull alert. The communities begin to hire expensive consultants to help \nthem in the process, to prepare their case so that community is not \nstruck. Am I not correct? Does any one of the three wish to dispute \nthat the work begins at the bureaucratic level, by honest, \nconscientious individuals----\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Members of the Senate, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island controls the time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that we continue this colloquy \nand maybe, to make the sides even, the Senator from Maine would like to \nengage us as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would welcome the Senator from Maine. That resonant \nvoice will reverberate through this Chamber with a reasonable approach \nto this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I suggest, if the Senator will yield, that the Senator \nneeds the support and help of the Senator from Maine. But before that \nsuggestion resonates through this Chamber, I will say just one other \nthing. Would the Senator accept an amendment that says no staff work \ncan begin until January 21 of the year 2000? If we added that language \nin the bowels of the Pentagon, nobody----\n  Mr. WARNER. Or at any level.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There would be no movement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want the Record to be clear, that comment came from the \nprime sponsor of this legislation.\n  That there would not be a computer keyboard touched in the bowels or \nany level of the Pentagon prior to January 21 of next year--would the \nSenator accept that amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of the deliberation in the \nArmed Services Committee I came up with a phrase. I said there was no \nway to write into law the word ``trust.'' Therefore, my answer to my \ngood friend is: No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. REED. Briefly, because I know my colleagues are eager to continue \nin colloquy, but in response to the chairman, most of what I think was \nthe initiative, if you will, involved in the last base closing, came \nafter the particular bases were identified for closing by the \nCommission. It was not a question where political decisions were made \nto close bases. I think, rather, political decisions were made to try \nto avoid and go around the work of the Commission. So the Commission \nprocess is, I think we would all agree, as unpolitical as you can get. \nThe research in the bowels of the Pentagon is, I think, similarly \nnonpolitical. If it is not, then we have more worries than a base \nclosing commission, if we have GS-14s doing political deeds for anyone \nrather than looking rationally and logically at the needs of the \nservice and the infrastructure to support those needs.\n  If the administration was guilty of politicization, then shame on \nthem. But we are running the risk of, ourselves, politicizing this \nprocess. We are running the risk of rejecting the logic.\n  The overwhelming conclusion I think any rational person could draw is \nthat we have to start closing bases. The base closing mechanism is the \nbest way to do that, and we are in a situation where, if we resist \nthis, if we cannot find a formulation, we are going to politicize it \nworse than anything that is purported to have been done by the \nadministration.\n  I strongly support the measure offered by the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from Michigan. We have an opportunity to align our \nforce structure and our base structure to give resources to the \nDepartment of Defense, to support the really pressing needs of our \ntroops, to retain them, to train them, to provide them a quality of \nlife they deserve.\n  When you go out to visit troops--I know everyone here on this floor \ntoday does that frequently--what those young troops are worried about \nis: Do they have the best training, best equipment, and are their \nfamilies well taken care of? They do not worry about whether we have a \nbase in Oregon or a base in Texas or a base in Rhode Island. They worry \nabout their training,\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\ntheir readiness for the mission, their weapons, and whether their \nfamilies are taken care of. If we listen to them, we will support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nthe very strong and, I think, thoughtful statement. He is a much valued \nmember of the committee. I appreciate his efforts in this area.\n  I do not like to belabor my old and dear friend, the former Secretary \nof the Navy and chairman of the committee. Our respect and friendship \nis mutual. It has been there for many, many years.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may say, it will be there for an \neternity.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Virginia.\n  I do have to mention one other aspect of this issue that is \nimportant, and then I know the Senator from Maine has been patiently \nwaiting.\n  We do have a credibility problem here. We are asking these young \npeople to do without. Some of them right now are in harm's way. We ask \nthem to spend time in the middle of the desert and the middle of Bosnia \nunder very difficult, sometimes nearly intolerable conditions. We have \nan Air Force that is half the size of what it was at the time of Desert \nStorm, and it has four times the commitments. We simply do not have a \nmilitary that we can sustain under the present conditions.\n  If we are not willing to make a sacrifice of the possibility of a \nbase closure in our home State, how in the world can we ask these young \npeople to risk their lives? This is an issue of credibility. If we are \ngoing to make the kind of changes necessary to restructure the \nmilitary, there are going to have to be some very tough decisions made. \nBase closing is just one of them. But if we cannot even make a decision \nto have a base closing commission, on the recommendation of every \nexpert inside and outside the defense establishment of the United \nStates of America, then I do not think we have any credibility in other \ndecisions that the committee or the Senate will make.\n  I realize that bases are at risk. I realize there can be economic \ndislocation. I recommend and I recognize all those aspects of a base \nclosing commission. But for us to tell these young men and women, whom \nwe are asking to sacrifice and take risks, that we will not take the \npolitical risk of approving the base of the base closing commission \nthat would convene under the tenure of the next President of the United \nStates under the most fair and objective process that we know how to \nshape, then, Mr. President, we deserve neither our credibility with \nthem nor their trust.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nMaine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that \nhas been offered by Senator McCain and Senator Levin concerning the \nestablishment of another Base Closing Commission process in the year \n2001.\n  It is not a matter of when it is established. It is not a matter by \nwhom it is appointed. I think the question is whether or not the \nDepartment of Defense and this administration has answered the \nquestions that have been raised time and time again in the committee \nand on the floor of this Senate with respect to a number of issues that \njustify having another base closing round. Having been involved in the \nfour previous rounds, I can tell you it raises a number of issues with \nrespect to the efficiency and the effectiveness of base closings.\n  We are seeing already with our commitment in Kosovo the Defense \nDepartment cannot continue to decide which installations to downsize or \nclose by making arbitrary comparisons to personnel reductions. Just \nsince the hostilities began in March, we have seen the Pentagon divert \na carrier battle group to the Adriatic leaving the western Pacific \nwithout a carrier for the first time in decades.\n  It has contributed more than 400 aircraft to the NATO campaign \nagainst Yugoslavia.\n  It has nearly depleted the Nation's air-launched precision missile \nstocks, exhausted our tanker fleet, and called up 33,000 reservists.\n  Now we have a situation where we are conducting a campaign regarding \nKosovo and it has been revealed that the air and sea bridges required \nto ``swing'' forces into one major theater war to support a second \nconflict makes the risk of prevailing in the latter engagement too high \nbecause of the operational strains on personnel, weapons, and \nmaintenance schedules. Yet, the Pentagon persists with the position \nthat we must close more bases. But who is really making these \nassumptions about the volatile and complex nature of warfare as we \napproach the 21st century?\n  The standard the administration is putting forth is personnel \nreductions; that closing 36 percent of our bases is absolutely \nessential, if 36 percent of all our people have left the military since \nthe peak of the cold war. But the standard must remain if we are to be \ntruly honest about what kinds of assumptions and determinations we must \nmake. We should be making a decision of adapting our infrastructure to \nthe mix of security threats that we anticipate into the 21st century. I \ndo not think that we have to project that far out to recognize what we \ncan expect for the types of conflicts that we will be facing in the \nfuture.\n  As it did last year and in 1997, the administration rests its \nargument for more base closings primarily on the claim that facility \ncuts have lagged behind personnel reductions by more than 15 percent. I \ndo not happen to think that a simple percentage can answer the types of \nquestions that we need to determine the future of our military bases.\n  What systems, what airfields, and what ports do we need to sustain in \nlight of our engagement in the Balkans and considering the fact that \nthe Pentagon planners thought that the Nation's two simultaneous \nconflicts would likely occur in Asia and the Persian Gulf?\n  What depots can provide competition for the private sector?\n  What shipyards can provide the Navy with a diversified industrial \nbase to sustain the next generation of submarines that will maneuver in \nour waters?\n\n  What airbases must stay active to support long-range power projection \ncapabilities we now have with the diminished forward presence overseas?\n  What configuration of domestic bases does the country require to \nproject a smaller force over long distances that we now lack because we \nhave a diminished presence in Asia and Europe?\n  This fact means at a minimum the country has to stabilize a number of \ndomestic facilities to prepare forces once deployed abroad for long-\nrange projections from this country. How has DOD calculated the \nvulnerability of political uncertainties of gaining access to our \nMiddle Eastern military assets in the event of another regional crisis?\n  These are the unanswered questions. These are the questions that need \nanswers, not some isolated percentages that should determine the size \nand the shape of our basing network. These are the answers that we do \nnot have.\n  We have discrepancies in the numbers that have been provided to us by \nthe Department of Defense. We do not have the assessments. We do not \nhave the matching infrastructure to the security threat. We have not \nmade a determination with respect to the assets, and even the national \ndefense plan indicated in its own report that it was necessary to make \nthat determination based on a report. In fact, the panel said it \nstrongly urges Congress and the Department to look at these issues.\n  They talked about if there is going to be a next round, it might be \npreceded by an independent, comprehensive inventory of all facilities \nand installations located in the United States. This review would \nprovide the basis for a long-term installation master plan that aligns \ninfrastructure assets with future military requirements and provides a \nframework for investment and reuse strategies.\n  We raised this issue time and time again in the committee and in the \nSenate over the last 2 years to those individuals who are propounding \nthis amendment and raising the fact that we should have another base \nclosing round. Yet, how can we make those decisions and on what basis \nare we making those decisions? Are they going to be arbitrary \ndeterminations? Are they going to be politicized?\n  I know people argue: Oh, this is a depoliticized process in the Base \nClosing\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\nCommission procedure. I argue to the contrary. Having been through this \nprocedure on four different occasions since 1988, I can tell you we \njust moved politics from one venue to another.\n  I think we have to very carefully consider whether or not we want to \ninitiate another base closing round for the future, absent the kinds of \ndecisions and determinations that need to be made in order to make a \nreasonable decision.\n  Even in the Department's own report in April of 1998, it exposed the \napparent base closure savings as a frustrating mystery rather than a \nconfirmed fact. To its credit, the Department actually admitted in its \nown study that there was no audit trail for tracking the end use of \neach dollar saved through the BRAC process. They admitted in their own \nreport that they did not have a procedure for determining the actual \nsavings that they projected from the base closing rounds and how they \nwere used, so that we could not correlate the savings and whether or \nnot they were used for any purpose or, in fact, were there any savings.\n  So now the Department of Defense has said: Yes, there are savings \nfrom the four previous base closing rounds; and, yes, we are using them \nfor readiness and modernization; and that is what we will do in the \nfuture. But they never established a process that we could document \nthose savings that ostensibly occurred in the four previous rounds, and \nthat they were invested in modernization and in the readiness accounts. \nThe fact is, it never happened.\n  The General Accounting Office, in fact, recommended, in their 1997 \nreport, and, in fact, documented what the DOD report said, that there \nis no process by which to track the savings which the Department of \nDefense claims occurred as a result of the base closings over the last \n10 years. So we have no way of knowing if, in fact, we have realized \nreal savings.\n  The Department claims that over the last four rounds there were \nsavings of $21 billion, $22 billion. Yet, in their 1999 report, they \nadmitted that the cost of closing bases was $22.5 billion. Their \nsavings, in their 1999 report, from the four previous rounds is $21 \nbillion. So they have $1.5 billion more than the estimated savings \nthrough 2015. So that is what we are talking about here. The Department \nof Defense is spending more to close these bases than they are actually \nsaving. They have had more costs as a result of environmental \nremediation. In fact, they project to spend $3 billion more.\n  They said they would realize $3 billion from the first base closing \nround, to give you an example, from the sale of the property to the \nprivate sector, when in fact they only realized $65 million. That gives \nyou an idea of the discrepancy that has occurred from their projected \nsavings to the actual revenue that was realized through their sale \nprocess.\n  So that is the problem we have. We have been given promises by the \nDepartment of Defense that we will have the savings, and yet these \nsavings have not really materialized. So we do not have a picture of \nwhat we need for the future in terms of domestic bases because we have \nclosed so many abroad as well as at home.\n  Because we do not have the presence in other countries, it is all the \nmore important that we have the necessary domestic bases to do the \nkinds of things we have to do, as we have seen in Kosovo.\n  It is interesting that back in 1991, when we went through a base \nclosing round, we had Loring Air Force Base up in northern Maine. It \nwas a B-52 base. We were told at the time B-52s were going to go out. \nThey were old. They were aging. They were going to be rapidly removed \nfrom the defense program.\n  What are we seeing? B-52s are being used in Kosovo. No, we do not \nhave the base in northern Maine that is closest to Europe, to the \nMiddle East, to the former Soviet Union, to Africa. We are having to \nlaunch those B-52s from other bases that are not as close to Europe. So \nthat is the problem we are seeing, because of the miscalculations and \nthe underestimation of what we might need for the future. It has not \nbeen the kind of documentation that I happen to think is necessary.\n  In fact, it was interesting to hear--when talking about B-52s--what a \nformer Air Force Secretary said a few weeks ago, that the current \ncrises are proving the enormous value of the Nation's long-range bomber \nforce of B-52s. That is what it is all about.\n  So what we were told in 1991: No; they are going to be out of \ncommission because they are simply too old, we find is not the case.\n\n  So I think we have to be very circumspect about how we want to \nproceed. That is why I think we have to be reticent about initiating \nany base closing process for the future until we get the kinds of \nanswers that are necessary to justify proceeding with any additional \nbase closing rounds.\n  We have had the miscalculations of the costs in the Balkans. In fact, \nthat is why there is such great pressure within the Pentagon to try to \nfind additional savings, because we have spent so much money in Bosnia. \nWhen we were only supposed to spend $2 billion, we are now beyond $10 \nbillion. We will probably spend $10 billion in Kosovo by the end of \nthis fiscal year. That has placed granted, inordinate pressures on the \ndefense budget.\n  But as QDR said, and even the Pentagon has admitted, there are many \nways, in which to achieve their savings. They could follow up on the \nmanagement reforms that have been proposed by the Department of Defense \nthrough technology upgrades. They could obviously require the services \nto determine their budget priorities. We can obviously look even at the \ndeployment in Bosnia, which has far exceeded the original estimates, as \nI said earlier.\n  So those are the kinds of challenges we face in the future. I think \nwe have to be very, very cautious about suggesting that somehow we \nshould close more bases--subject to another arbitrary process, subject \nto more arbitrary percentages--without the kind of analysis that I \nthink is necessary to make those kinds of decisions.\n  We have to be very selective. We have to make decisions for the \nfuture in terms of what interests are at stake, what we can anticipate \nfor the future, because it seems that we are going to have more \ncontingency operations like the ones we are confronting now in the \nBalkans. Therefore, we will have to look at what we have currently \nwithin the continental United States. It is important to be able to \nlaunch these missions, simply because we cannot depend on a presence in \nforeign countries.\n  So I hope Members of the Senate will vote against the amendment which \nhas been offered by the Senator from Arizona about initiating another \nbase closing round, because we have raised these questions before. We \nhave asked the Department: Please document what bases you are talking \nabout. What bases do you need? What bases don't you need? Why don't you \nneed them? How does that comport with the anticipated security threats \nfor the future?\n  Of course, finally, the Department claims that they have made \nenormous savings from the previous base closing rounds, but now we find \nthat the cost of closing those bases--of which more than 152 were \neither realigned or closed--was greater than the savings that have been \nrealized to date and into the future.\n  So I think we have an obligation and, indeed, a responsibility to \nevaluate what has happened. I think it is also interesting that the \nDepartment of Defense has not responded to the General Accounting \nOffice or to the National Defense Plan in terms of coming up with an \nanalysis of what is actually necessary for our domestic military \ninfrastructure, and then, secondly, setting up a mechanism by which we \ncan evaluate whether or not savings have, indeed, been realized as a \nresult of the four previous base closing rounds, because on the basis \nof what we have currently from the Pentagon, they cannot suggest in any \nway that they have made any savings. If anything, it has cost them more \nmoney.\n  Then when you look at what we are facing in Kosovo, what we can \nproject in the future for additional asymmetric threats, we may want to \nbe very careful about closing down any more bases in this country \nwithout knowing whether or not they are going to be necessary for the \nfuture, because once you lose that infrastructure, it is very difficult \nto recoup.\n  So I hope the Senate will reject this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n             position on landrieu-specter amendment no. 384\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, had I been present for the vote on the\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\nLandrieu-Specter amendment No. 384 to the FY 2000 Defense \nAuthorization, S. 1059, bill regarding the need for vigorous \nprosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the former \nYugoslavia, I would have voted in favor of the amendment. My vote would \nnot have changed the outcome of the vote on the amendment which passed \nby a vote of 90-0.\n  I was unable to reach the Capitol in time for the vote because of air \ntravel delays due to weather conditions. I am disappointed that, though \nI and other Members notified the Senate leadership about our travel \ndifficulties hours before the vote began, they were unwilling to \nreschedule the time of the vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/25/senate-section/article/S5948-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AVAILABILITY OF CLASSIFIED ANNEX\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity today to \nsalute a distinguished servant of the legislative branch of the U.S. \nCongress in the field of foreign affairs. In June 1999, Dr. Robert \nSutter will leave the Congressional Research Service after 22 highly \nproductive years as a source of expertise on China and the Asia-Pacific \nregion. Dr. Sutter is resigning from his current position as a Senior \nSpecialist in Asia and International Politics in the Foreign Affairs, \nDefense, and Trade Division of CRS to become the National Intelligence \nOfficer for East Asia, a critical intelligence community assignment.\n  Since 1977, when he first came to work at CRS as a China specialist, \nDr. Sutter has provided Members of Congress and their staffs with \nauthoritative, in-depth analysis and policy options covering a broad \nrange of foreign policy issues involving China, East Asia, and the \nPacific. It should be a matter of pride to this body to know that Dr. \nSutter is well known both here and in the Asia-Pacific region as one of \nthe most authoritative and productive American Asia hands.\n  In his government career to date of over 30 years, Dr. Sutter has \nheld a variety of analytical and supervisory positions including \nservice with the Foreign Broadcast Information Service and temporary \ndetails with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Central \nIntelligence Agency, and the Department of State. It is in service to \nCongress, however, specifically with the Congressional Research \nService, that Dr. Sutter has spent most of his distinguished career. I \nwant to make a few comments that illustrate the strengths and great \ncontributions of both the institution and the man himself.\n  The first point to make concerns one of the great institutional \nstrengths that CRS offers to the congressional clients it serves, and \nwhich Dr. Sutter's tenure and contributions here epitomize perfectly: \ninstitutional memory. Dr. Sutter's first published report at CRS was \nentitled U.S.-PRC Normalization Arguments and Alternatives. Published \nfirst as a CRS Report for general congressional use, on August 3, 1977, \nit soon became a Committee Print of the House International Relations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. The report and \nsubsequent Committee Print addressed a number of highly controversial \nissues arising out of President Carter's decision to normalize \nrelations with China. Congressional concern about the consequences of \nderecognition of the Republic of China, and dissatisfaction with the \nterms of the agreement negotiated with the People's Republic of China, \ndirectly led to the landmark Taiwan Relations Act, which still governs \nour policy decisions today, and which continues in 1999 to be a factor \nin debates in this very chamber.\n  Besides Bob Sutter, only 48 Members of Congress serving today, in the \n106th Congress, were here in 1977 and 1978 to witness these initial \nsteps of U.S.-China relations. In the more than 20 years since then, \nboth U.S.-China relations and the U.S. Congress itself have undergone \ntremendous change, both for the better and for worse. Bob Sutter has \nbeen an active participant in congressional deliberations on China \npolicy, and in the U.S. national debate over these issues, from \nnormalization of relations, to the Tiananmen Square crackdown, to the \nrecent tragic bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Dr. Sutter's \ntwo decades of service spanned the tenures for four U.S. presidents and \nsome ten Congresses. Despite several shifts of party control in the \nSenate, and one  in the House, Dr. Sutter continued to deliver timely, \naccurate, objective, and non-partisan analysis. The institutional \nmemory represented by CRS analysts, which Dr. Sutter so perfectly \nexemplifies, is of incalculable value to the work of the Congress.\n\n  The second point I want to make concerns Dr. Sutter himself. He has, \nfor one thing, consistently demonstrated an astonishing capacity for \nwork. In 1974 Dr. Sutter received his Ph.D. in History and East Asian \nLanguages from Harvard University, writing his Ph.D. thesis while \nmaintaining a full-time job. Routinely, he has been one of--perhaps the \nmost in terms of sheer output of written work--productive analysts in \nCRS. In the last 5 years alone, Dr. Sutter has been called on for \nadvice from Members of Congress and their staffs nearly 6,000 times--an \naverage of 1,140 times each year. He has regularly maintained six or \nmore ongoing, continually updated products, and his output of CRS \nwritten reports for Congress totals at least 90 since late 1987 alone. \nAs is evident in these products, he excels at providing accurate, \nsuccinct, and well-organized analysis of congressional policy choices \nand their likely consequences. His work always reflects up to date \nknowledge of issues, usually based on personal research in East Asia \nand/or close contact with the U.S. private and official community of \nAsian analysts and scholars.\n  Even more to the point, Dr. Sutter has always understood the powers \nand special needs of Congress, including its legislative and oversight \nresponsibilities, and our obligation to represent\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\nthe interests of our constituents. In his research and writing, Dr. \nSutter never forgets the unique role of Congress and the importance of \nreflecting the full range of competing viewpoints.\n  Reflecting his commitment to service and cheerful willingness to \nassume responsibility, Dr. Sutter has fulfilled a number of roles in \nthe CRS. He has served as Chief of the Foreign Affairs Division in CRS, \nas well as Chief of the Government Division in CRS, in both cases \nmaintaining a full research work load for Congress in the midst of \nsignificant management duties. He has frequently conceived, \ncoordinated, and moderated Asia policy seminars and workshops for \nMembers of Congress and their staffs. He routinely serves on special \nadvisory groups in CRS and the Library of Congress. As a well-known and \nrespected analyst, he has been a sought-after speaker at dozens of \nforeign policy seminars, panels, and conferences in Washington and \naround the world.\n  In recent years, he has maintained this outstanding record of \nproductivity for the Congress while managing in his spare time to teach \nseveral college courses per year at Washington area universities. He \nhas also found time to write more than a dozen books on foreign policy \nissues during his tenure at CRS.\n  Finally, Dr. Sutter's simple decency, modesty, engaging manner, and \nprofessionalism set a high standard for others and make it a great \npleasure to work with him. He cheerfully volunteers for onerous tasks. \nHe is pleasant and good-humored. Moreover, in the midst of the \npressured environment of Washington and Capitol Hill, he has always \nfound time to serve as a mentor, counselor, and friend to others, \nwhether they be his own students, younger colleagues, or new \ncongressional staff. And, a fact known only to close friends, he has a \nrecord of community service, including Church work and teaching of \nEnglish to native Spanish speakers, that is nearly as impressive as his \nprofessional contribution.\n  Dr. Sutter will be greatly missed, but the loss of his service to the \nCongress will be partly compensated for by bringing to the Executive \nbranch his knowledge of the Congress and its special role in the making \nand oversight of U.S. foreign policy. When he comes back to Capitol \nHill for one-on-one meetings, briefings, and testimony, he will bring \nwith him a high degree of credibility and a special awareness of \ncongressional needs for information and analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/25/senate-section/article/S5949-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE ADMINISTRATION'S VISION FOR EDUCATION IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, over the weekend Vice President Gore \noutlined his vision for American education if he becomes President. The \nspeech was billed by the Washington Post as the Vice President's \n``vision for American education in the 21st Century''. Unfortunately \nfor our children, the Vice President's vision for American education in \nthe 21st century looks a lot like the failed policies of the last 35 \nyears.\n  The VP's speech laid out seven new proposals for American education--\nseven proposals that all say Al Gore knows more about educating \nchildren than do parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and \nschool board members all across America. Seven proposals to add to the \nhundreds upon hundreds of education programs run by the federal \ngovernment, so many in fact that no one, not the Department of \nEducation, the General Accounting Office or even the Vice President, is \nsure how many there are. Seven proposals that will add to a system of \ntop down control of education that puts a higher priority on adults \nfilling out forms correctly than on children passing a math or a \nspelling test.\n  Today, President Clinton unveiled his proposal to reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. Unfortunately, the President's \nproposal is filled with more of the ``D.C. knows best'' programs he has \ntouted for the past 6\\1/2\\ years. For example, the President's proposal \nfor reducing class size is filled with requirements for states and \ndistricts to comply with, but does not address the issue of children \nlearning.\n  For most of this half century Washington, D.C., has been dominated by \npeople who believe that centralized decisions and centralized control \nexercised by Washington, D.C., is the best way to solve problems, \nincluding those in the classroom. This approach has not worked. As \nWashington, D.C., has taken power and authority from local school \ndistricts, our schools have not improved. But, old habits die hard. The \nbelief in centralized power is still very much alive, and embodied by \nthe President's and Vice President's proposals.\n  I don't believe Al Gore or Bill Clinton know more about what \nAmerica's schools and communities need than they do. In fact, I don't \nbelieve that I or any other member of Congress or the Administration \nknows more about educating children than do parents or local educators. \nUnfortunately, Al Gore and Bill Clinton have indicated that they will \ncontinue on the path they've trod throughout their administration--a \npath that begins and ends in Washington, D.C.\n  In 1997 I first proposed an amendment to the fiscal year Education \nfunding bill. It was stated clearly in that amendment that I believe \nthat those closest to our children--their parents, teachers, \nsuperintendents and school board members--are best able to make \ndecisions about their children's education. Last year, I refined that \nlegislation to include a ``triple option'' that would allow a state to \ndecide where the federal education dollars should go. Both proposals \npassed this body by slim margins and were immediately met with a veto \nthreat by the Administration.\n  This year, I have worked with a bipartisan coalition of members and \ngroups to devise legislation that will allow states maximum flexibility \nin return for increased accountability for the academic achievement of \ntheir students. My bill, the Academic Achievement for All Act, or \nStraight A's, will be introduced after the Memorial Day recess. I am \nhopeful that this time my colleagues in the Senate will join me in \ngiving back to states and local communities the ability to make \ncritical decisions about the education of their children.\n  This issue boils down to each Senator asking if he or she believes \nschools will be improved through more control from Washington, D.C., or \nby giving more control to parents, teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents and school board members? I believe our best hope for \nimproving the education of our children is to put the American people \nin charge of their local schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/25/senate-section/article/S5949-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VOTE ON AMENDMENT 384\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona relative to Medicare reimbursement \n     rates; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1001\n\n       Whereas, access to affordable health care services has been \n     greatly reduced for Medicare health maintenance organization \n     recipients in thirty states due to cutbacks in Medicare \n     reimbursement by the federal government; and\n       Whereas, because of recent changes by the federal \n     government, the Medicare reimbursement rates in rural areas \n     are lower than those in urban areas. This results in HMOs \n     reimbursing physicians at the lower rates, which in turn \n     causes the physician networks to disintegrate and many HMOs \n     to stop offering service in those areas; and\n       Whereas, although health insurance will remain available to \n     seniors in rural areas through traditional Medicare coverage, \n     the cutbacks will significantly restrict their options for \n     health care coverage, the number of services covered and the \n     affordability of those services in general; and\n       Whereas, two major HMOs have withdrawn service altogether \n     in six rural Arizona counties, leaving nearly ten thousand \n     elderly individuals with only one or two HMOs from which to \n     choose; and\n       Whereas, individuals who previously were covered under HMOs \n     received greater benefits not covered by Medicare, including \n     additional services and lower copayments that offered seniors \n     thorough and comprehensive services at more affordable rates. \n     Now that many will be left with the more expensive Medicare \n     system as their primary health insurance option, low-income \n     and disabled seniors may be forced to pay more out-of-pocket \n     costs for their health care services or may forego receiving \n     these services because they are unable to afford the higher \n     payments; and\n       Whereas, the financial and health problems that many rural \n     seniors around the country are likely to face as a result of \n     the Medicare reimbursement cuts are directly attributable to \n     the Medicare reimbursement rates differential between rural \n     and urban areas.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States take steps to \n     address the problem of the Medicare reimbursement rates \n     differential between urban and rural areas and attempt to \n     establish a reimbursement system that will result in more \n     equitable health care coverage for seniors in rural areas of \n     the country.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives and to each Member of Congress from the \n     State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-135. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona relative to the 2000 census; to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2003\n\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States requires an \n     enumeration of the population every ten years and entrusts \n     the Congress with overseeing all aspects of each decennial \n     census, and\n       Whereas, the sole constitutional purpose of the decennial \n     census is to apportion the seats in Congress among the \n     several states; and\n       Whereas, an accurate and legal decennial census is \n     necessary to properly apportion the United States House seats \n     among the fifty states and to create legislative districts \n     within the states; and\n       Whereas, an accurate and legal decennial census is \n     necessary to enable states to comply with the constitutional \n     mandate of drawing state legislative districts within the \n     states; and\n       Whereas, to ensure an accurate count and to minimize the \n     potential for political manipulation, article I, section 2 of \n     the United States Constitution mandates an ``actual \n     enumeration'' of the population, which requires a physical \n     head count of the population and prohibits statistical \n     guessing or estimates of the population; and\n       Whereas, consistent with this constitutional mandate, title \n     13, section 195 of the United States Code expressly prohibits \n     the use of statistical sampling to enumerate the United \n     States population for the purpose of reapportioning the \n     United States House; and\n       Whereas, legislative redistricting that is conducted by the \n     states is a critical subfunction of the constitutional \n     requirement to apportion representatives among the states; \n     and\n       Whereas, in Department of Commerce, et al. v. United States \n     Representatives, et al., No. 98-404, and in Clinton, \n     President of the United States, et al. v. Glavin, et al., No. \n     98-564, the United States Supreme Court ruled on January 25, \n     1999 that the Census Act prohibits the Census Bureau's \n     proposed uses of statistical sampling in calculating the \n     population for purposes of apportionment; and\n       Whereas, in reaching its findings, the United States \n     Supreme Court found that the use of statistical procedures to \n     adjust census numbers would create a dilution of voting \n     rights for citizens in legislative redistricting, thus \n     violating the legal guarantees of ``one person, one vote''; \n     and\n       Whereas, consistent with this ruling and the constitutional \n     and legal relationship between legislative redistricting by \n     the states and the apportionment of the United States House, \n     the use of adjusted census data woud raise serious questions \n     of vote dilution and would violate ``one person, one vote''; \n     legal protections, and would expose the State of Arizona to \n     protracted litigation over legislative redistricting plans at \n     great cost to the taxpayers of this state and would likely \n     result in a court ruling that invalidates any legislative \n     redistricting plan that uses census numbers that have been \n     determined in whole or in part by the use of random sampling \n     techniques or other statistical methodologies that add or \n     subtract persons to or from the census counts based solely on \n     statistical inference; and\n       Whereas, consistent with these principles, no person \n     enumerated in the census should ever be deleted from the \n     census enumeration; and\n       Whereas, consistent with this ruling, every reasonable and \n     practicable effort should be\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n     made to obtain the fullest and most accurate possible count \n     of the population, including appropriate funding for state \n     and local census outreach and education programs as well as \n     provisions for post-census local review; and\n       Whereas, the members of the Forty-fourth Legislative oppose \n     census numbers for state legislative redistricting that have \n     been determined in whole or in part by the use of random \n     sampling techniques of other statistical methodologies that \n     and or subtract persons to the census counts based solely on \n     statistical inference.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Bureau of the Census conduct the \n     2000 census consistent with the United States Supreme Court's \n     ruling and establish constitutional and legal mandates, which \n     require a physical head count of the population and bar the \n     use of statistical sampling to create or in any way adjust \n     the count.\n       2. That Public Law 94-171 data not be used for state \n     legislative redistricting if it is based on census numbers \n     that have been determined in whole or in part by the use of \n     statistical inferences derived by means of random sampling \n     techniques or other statistical methodologies that add or \n     subtract persons to or from the census counts.\n       3. That it receive Public Law 94-171 data for legislative \n     redistricting that is identifical to the census tabulation \n     data used to apportion the seats in the United States House \n     consistent with the United States Supreme Court ruling and \n     constitutional mandates that require a physical head count of \n     the population and bar the use of statistical sampling to \n     create or in any way adjust the count.\n       4. That the Congress of the United States, as the branch of \n     government assigned with the responsibility of overseeing the \n     decennial census, take any steps necessary to ensure that the \n     2000 census is conducted fairly and legally.\n       5. That the Secretary of the State of Arizona transmit a \n     copy of this Memorial to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Director of the United States Bureau of the \n     Census and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-136. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona relative to the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution 2001\n\n       Whereas, the endangered species act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205; \n     87 Stat. 884; 16 United States Code sections 1531 et seq.), \n     as amended, was enacted for the purpose of the conservation \n     and recovery of endangered and threatened species by \n     protecting and conserving habitat and related ecosystems; and\n       Whereas, in pursuing that policy, the endangered species \n     act provides for no consideration or accommodation of human \n     activities, requirements or interests; and\n       Whereas, the United States fish and wildlife service of the \n     department of the interior has shown little regard or \n     willingness to make administrative adjustments to accommodate \n     human activities, requirements or interests in administering \n     and enforcing the endangered species act; and\n       Whereas, much of the enforcement pursuant to the endangered \n     species act is based on dubious scientific research and \n     outcome-oriented analysis; and\n       Whereas, the Arizona game and fish department is charged \n     with managing the fish and wildlife resources of this state \n     in the best interests of the present and future generations \n     of Arizonans; and\n       Whereas, the Arizona game and fish department has \n     recommended against the listing of several species of animals \n     as threatened or endangered based on sound biological \n     information, only to have their recommendation ignored by the \n     United States fish and wildlife service and the secretary of \n     the interior; and\n       Whereas, the endangered species act allows the courts no \n     discretion in imposing the requirements of the act over all \n     human activity that may remotely affect the species; and\n       Whereas, the result of the implementation and enforcement \n     of the endangered species act is to threaten and endanger the \n     economy and way of life throughout the west; and\n       Whereas, the industries that depend on harvesting, \n     extracting or otherwise using natural resources are \n     particularly endangered; and\n       Whereas, harvesting trees for timber and pulp wood is \n     threatened throughout the western states and has been all but \n     eliminated in Arizona, except on Indian reservations, thereby \n     eliminating much needed rural employment and causing a \n     dangerous buildup of wildfire fuel; and\n       Whereas, livestock ranching is endangered by massive \n     reductions in federal grazing allotments leaving ranches and \n     ranch families near bankruptcy with no option but that of \n     selling their private land for development thereby losing the \n     traditional responsible stewardship for the land and other \n     resources; and\n       Whereas, the mining industry is endangered to the brink of \n     extinction and the loss of quality employment for thousands \n     of mine workers and the collapse of an important component of \n     the economy of the state of Arizona and other western states; \n     and\n       Whereas, certain single issue special interest groups are \n     able to abuse the endangered species act to achieve their \n     narrow personal agenda by litigating against productive \n     economic activities, as well as hunting, fishing and other \n     recreational activities, all to the detriment of our \n     heritage, our culture and our society; therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:\n       1. That the policy of the State of Arizona, its governor \n     and the legislature is to preserve and protect our way of \n     life, our heritage and our culture, including the economic \n     base of the rural areas of this state.\n       2. That the endangered species act must be modified to: (a) \n     Recognize, protect and conserve human interests at the same \n     time and on the same priority level as environmental \n     interests. (b) Provide for a more flexible and accommodating \n     administration and enforcement system, based on sound \n     scientific analysis and research, so that the United States \n     fish and wildlife service and other federal agencies work \n     with, rather than impose on, the people of this state. (c) \n     Allow the courts flexibility to issue rulings that protect \n     human interests as well as environmental interests.\n       3. That the Secretary of State transmit copies of this \n     Resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior, \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives and to each member of \n     the Arizona Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-137. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of West Virginia relative to the Appalachian \n     Development Highway System; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, The construction of the Coalfields Expressway in \n     Southern West Virginia is due to begin in 1999; and\n       Whereas, The Coalfields Expressway needs approximately 1.5 \n     billion dollars for completion; and\n       Whereas, Motorists in West Virginia pay into the Highway \n     Trust Fund at the rate of 18.4 cents tax for each gallon of \n     gasoline purchased and 24.4 cents tax on each gallon of \n     diesel fuel purchased; and\n       Whereas, The Appalachian Development Highway system was \n     conceived by the United States Congress with the intention of \n     aiding the economy of the entire Appalachian Region and is \n     now funded directly though the Highway Trust Fund; and\n       Whereas, A recent study on the Appalachian Development \n     Highway System has concluded that upon completion, this \n     system would provide 42,000 new jobs, 84,000 new residents, \n     2.9 billion dollars in new wages and 6.9 billion dollars in \n     value-added business in the region served by the system; and\n       Whereas, The Coalfields Expressway, when completed, would \n     traverse the counties of Raleigh, Wyoming and McDowell, and \n     would greatly benefit these counties in the form of increased \n     employment opportunities and economic growth; and\n       Whereas, Two of these three counties, Wyoming and McDowell, \n     consistently place near the top of state and national \n     unemployment lists; and\n       Whereas, The Coalfields Expressway is not a part of the \n     Appalachian Development Highway System, instead receiving \n     funding through special appropriations from the United States \n     Congress at irregular intervals; and\n       Whereas, The funding received by the Coalfields Expressway \n     has thus far consisted of a single appropriation of 50 \n     million dollars in 1991 and a single appropriation of 22.7 \n     million dollars in 1998; and\n       Whereas, Incorporation of the Coalfields Expressway into \n     the Appalachian Development Highway System would allow for \n     additional funding to complete the Coalfields Expressway from \n     the Highway Trust Fund; therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:\n       That the members of the West Virginia delegation to the \n     United States Congress are hereby requested to make all \n     possible efforts to support and assist the incorporation of \n     the Coalfields Expressway into the Appalachian Development \n     Highway System; and, be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to \n     all members of the West Virignia delegation to the United \n     States Congress, to the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to the Clerk of the United States Senate and \n     to the Executive Director of the Coalfields Expressway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/25/senate-section/article/S5952-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5952-S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee on Appropriations: \n     Special Report entitled ``Revised Allocation to Subcommittees \n     of Budget Totals for Fiscal Year 2000'' (Rept.

A bill to amend title XXIV of the Revised Statutes, relating \nto civil rights, to prohibit discrimination against nongovernmental \norganizations and certain individuals on the basis of religion in the \ndistribution of government funds to provide government assistance and \nthe distribution of the assistance, to allow the organizations to \naccept the funds to provide the assistance to the individuals without \nimpairing the religious character of the organizations or the religious \nfreedom of the individuals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                charitable choice expansion act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, America's best ideas for helping the \npoor have come from grassroots communities and private organizations of \npeople who know and care about their neighbors. These groups see people \nand their life experiences, not theories or statistics. We have known \nfor years that government solutions have failed miserably in moving \npeople from dependency and despair to responsibility and independence. \nFor years America's churches and charities have been leading the way in \nhelping the poor achieve dignity and self-sufficiency. This is why I \nhave been advocating that government should find ways to help these \norganizations unleash the cultural remedy our society so desperately \nneeds.\n\n  Therefore, it was with great interest that I heard about Vice \nPresident Gore's statements Monday in Atlanta expressing his support \nfor Charitable Choice. The Vice President's interest in Charitable \nChoice is welcome news. Governor Bush is in the forefront of Charitable \nChoice solutions. Truly, where once there was contention and debate, \nthere now is swelling bipartisan agreement on the promise of Charitable \nChoice.\n  Congress has been in the forefront of encouraging the type of faith-\nbased solutions that the Vice President was promoting yesterday in \nAtlanta. The 1996 welfare reform law contains the Charitable Choice \nprovision I authored, which encourages states to partner with faith-\nbased organizations to serve welfare recipients with federal dollars.\n  Last fall, we expanded Charitable Choice to cover services provided \nunder the Community Services Block Grant program, which provides funds \nto local agencies to alleviate poverty in their communities. And just \nlast week, the Senate approved a juvenile justice bill containing \nCharitable Choice for services provided to at-risk juveniles, such as \ncounseling for troubled youth.\n  The Charitable Choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform law was \none way to achieve the goal of inviting the greater participation of \ncharitable and faith-based organizations in providing services to the \npoor. The provision allows charitable and faith-based organizations to \ncompete for contracts and voucher programs on an equal basis with all \nother non-governmental providers when the state or local government \nchooses to use private sector providers for delivering welfare services \nto the poor under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \nprogram.\n  In the past three years, we have begun to hear about how Charitable \nChoice is opening doors for the government and communities of faith to \nwork together to help our nation's poor and needy gain hope and self-\nsufficiency. For example, shortly after passage of the federal welfare \nlaw, Governor George Bush of Texas signed an executive order directing \n``all pertinent executive branch agencies to take all necessary steps \nto implement the `charitable choice' provision of the federal welfare \nlaw.'' Cookman United Methodist Church, a 100 member parish in \nPhiladelphia, received a state contract to run its ``Transitional \nJourney Ministry,'' which provides life and job skills to welfare \nmothers and places them into jobs with benefits. In less than a year, \nthe church placed 22 welfare recipients into jobs. Payne Memorial \nOutreach Center, an affiliate of a Baltimore church, has helped over \n450 welfare recipients find jobs under a state contract.\n  In light of these success stories around the nation, more and more \nstates and counties are beginning to see what a critical role the \nfaith-based community can play in helping people move off of welfare. \nThey are eager to put the Charitable Choice concept into action in \ntheir communities.\n  We have always known that Charitable Choice is truly bipartisan in \nnature, and has the support of over 35 organizations that span a wide \npolitical and social spectrum. Members from both sides of the aisle \nhere in the Senate have voted in support of this provision. And now, \nwith the Vice President's support for Charitable Choice, I am \nreintroducing legislation that I introduced in the 105th Congress, the \n``Charitable Choice Expansion Act,'' which would expand the Charitable \nChoice concept across all federally funded social service programs.\n  The substance of the Charitable Choice Expansion Act is virtually \nidentical to that of the original Charitable Choice provision of the \nwelfare reform law. The only real difference between the two provisions \nis that the new bill covers many more federal programs than the \noriginal provision.\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\n  While the original Charitable Choice provision applies mainly to the \nnew welfare reform block grant program, the Charitable Choice Expansion \nAct applies to all federal government programs in which the government \nis authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide federally \nfunded services to beneficiaries. Some of the programs that would be \ncovered under this legislation include housing, substance abuse \nprevention and treatment, seniors services, the Social Services Block \nGrant, abstinence education and child welfare services.\n  With this recent expression of bipartisan support for Charitable \nChoice from the Vice President, now is the time for Congress to move \nquickly to pass the Charitable Choice Expansion Act, so that we can \nempower the organizations that are best equipped to instill hope and \ntransform lives to expand their good work across the nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROVISION OF ASSISTANCE UNDER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS \n                   BY RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Title XXIV of the Revised Statutes is amended by inserting \n     after section 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1994) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1994A.

A bill to amend the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of \n1977 to establish a more cooperative and effective method for \nrulemaking that takes into account the special needs and concerns of \nsmaller miners; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\n                the small mine advocacy review panel act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Small Mine Advocacy \nReview Panel Act, or ``Small Mine,'' Act of 1999.\n  Achieving mine safety starts with cooperation. Cooperation is at the \nheart of the safest workplaces, where employers and employees strive to \nestablish open lines of communication on safety, to provide and wear \nthe right protective equipment, and to give and follow effective \ntraining. But cooperation can't stop there. To have safe work sites, \nthere must also be an understanding of what safety rules mean, how they \nare to be implemented, and what results should be expected. This is the \ncooperation that should exist between operators and the Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration, or MSHA, and it cannot be ignored or \nundervalued.\n  The bill I am introducing today inserts a new level of cooperation \ninto MSHA's rulemaking. Called the Small Mine Advocacy Review Panel \nAct, or ``Small Mine'' Act, this bill would mandate that MSHA and \npanels of small operators discuss newly proposed rules and their \npotential impact early in the regulatory process. This practice is \ncurrently employed by OSHA and EPA and has been of great benefit both \nfor the smaller employers and the agency because it forces both parties \nto comment and respond in an open forum. I have always believed that \nthe simple act of talking about safety actually leads to safety, and I \nembrace any approach that forces those who write the rules and those \nwho must comply with them to sit down together and find solutions.\n  The Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and Training has a strong \ninterest in MSHA's rulemaking procedure as it relates to small \noperators. In addition, I am well aware that the Senate Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs shares this interest as it relates to the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In \nlight of this, as this bill is centered on MSHA's responsiveness to \nsmaller operators on matters of safety and health, Chairman Thompson \nhas agreed to allow this bill to be referred to the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee.\n  MSHA has had great success when its rulemakings have been cooperative \nwith operators and miners. MSHA's draft Part 46 Training rule was \ndeveloped in collaboration with over fifteen industry representatives, \nthe Teamsters, the Boilermakers, and the Laborers Health & Safety Fund \nof North America. By working together, the coalition came up with a \ndraft that everyone agreed on and that was completed by MSHA's internal \ndeadline. A true rulemaking success story.\n  But other MSHA rules, such as MSHA's proposed Noise Rule, have \nabandoned cooperative partnerships with smaller operators and instead \nembraced the old ``big brother'' style of regulation. It is in such \nrulemakings that the Small Miner bill would make a world of difference. \nThe Noise Rule would have so severe an impact on smaller mine operators \nthat it is seriously questionable whether those who wrote this rule \nhave ever actually been to a small mine. The bottom line is that this \nrule prohibits small operators from supplying miners with personal \nprotective equipment, such as ear plugs, until after they have tried to \nlower the noise level by buying new and ``quieter'' machines at \nincredible cost, tinkering with old machines, rotating employees around \nto different stations, and implementing all other ``feasible'' \nengineering and administrative controls. All this despite the fact that \nmany routinely-used machines can never be made to run as quietly as \nMSHA mandates no matter how much money is spent, and that miners will \nhave to be rotated outside their areas of training and expertise.\n  This proposed rule is in strict opposition to both MSHA's and OSHA's \ncurrent rules which allow miners to wear ear plugs in the first \ninstance. It also totally abandons logic. It's like proposing a rule \noutlawing employees from using steel-toed shoes and instead regulating \nthat nothing may ever fall on a worker's foot. It just doesn't make any \nsense.\n  By discussing this rule with small operators early in the rulemaking \nprocess, cooperative approaches could have been flushed out and \nsolutions achieved which satisfy both MSHA's regulatory objectives and \nminimize the burden on small operators. As evidenced by this proposed \nrule, it is clearly insufficient to have a one time ``comment period'' \nor even hold public hearings, because the small operator's perspective \nis so noticeably absent from the rulemaking process. It is not enough \nto claim that safety is paramount while simultaneously operating in a \nvacuum to pump out regulations that no one can understand or implement. \nCompliance must be based on an effective working relationship where the \ngoals set by the regulators are understood and achievable by the \nindustry being regulated. If operators are responsible for complying \nwith MSHA's regulations, then there is no excuse for failing to include \nthem in the process from Day One. By passing the ``Small Mine'' bill, \noperators and MSHA would be responsible for working together to craft \nrules that will actually improve safety.\n  Mr. President.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania, area; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n               national cemetery in western pennsylvania\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which will \ndirect the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a national \ncemetery in the Pittsburgh area of Western Pennsylvania.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Veterans' affairs, I make it my \nresponsibility to see that our nation's veterans are cared for after \nserving honorably in the Armed Forces. Part of this care involves \nhonoring the memory of their service upon death. Our nation's veterans \nare an aging population. At present, 46% of the area's veterans \npopulation is over age 65. The General Accounting Office (GAO) has \nestimated that by the year 2008, the number of veterans' deaths will \npeak and remain at a high level for years afterward. To anticipate the \nincreased demand for burial space and to accommodate family and friends \nwanting nearby cemeteries at which to honor and remember their loved \nones, the Congress and VA must act now.\n  The legislation that I introduce today will alleviate the long \noverdue wait for a national cemetery which the veterans in the western \nPennsylvania area have had to endure. Such a cemetery is necessary due \nto the over 750,000 veterans who reside in the area, including veterans \nin parts of the neighboring states of Ohio, Maryland, and West \nVirginia. I should also point out that Pennsylvania, a state with the \nfifth highest veteran population in the country, has only one national \ncemetery within its borders open for new burials. This cemetery, at \nIndiantown Gap, serves veterans in the eastern portion of the \nCommonwealth and is more than 225 miles from Pittsburgh.\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\n  In 1987, VA ranked the Pittsburgh-area among the top ten population \ncenters most in need of a national cemetery. In 1991, VA began the \nprocess of cemetery site-selection and Congress appropriated $250,000 \nfor an Environmental Impact Statement. Four potential sites were \nidentified in the Pittsburgh area. Despite this headway, construction \non a national cemetery never commenced.\n  The high veteran population of this region has waited far too long to \nsee the creation of this national cemetery. Our nation's veterans, \nhaving given so much for us, deserve a proper burial site in the \nproximity of their homes. Veterans elsewhere around this country take \nfor granted the availability of a nearby national cemetery. If passed, \nthis legislation will ensure that what began over a decade ago will now \nbecome reality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania, area to serve the needs of veterans and their \n     families.\n       (b) Consultation in Selection of Site.--Before selecting \n     the site for the national cemetery established under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with appropriate \n     officials of the State of Pennsylvania and local officials of \n     the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area.\n       (c) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the establishment of the national cemetery under \n     subsection (a). The report shall set forth a schedule for the \n     establishment of the cemetery and an estimate of the costs \n     associated with the establishment of the cemetery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 1116. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nincome from the transportation of oil and gas by pipeline from subpart \nF income; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the foreign pipeline transportation income act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will right a wrong that has been in the tax code for too long. \nThis legislation will clarify the U.S. tax treatment of foreign \npipeline transportation income. This legislation is needed because \ncurrent tax law causes active foreign pipeline transportation income to \nbe unintentionally trapped within the anti-abuse tax rules of Subpart \nF. These anti-abuse rules were originally established to prevent \ncompanies from avoiding payment of U.S. tax on easily movable and \npassive income. Pipeline transportation income, however, is neither \npassive nor easily movable. Pipes are located where the natural \nresources and energy needs are--they cannot be placed just anywhere. \nFurther, one a pipe is in the ground, it is tough to move.\n  Referring to the legislative history, we find that Congress did not \nintend these anti-abuse rules to target foreign pipeline transportation \nincome. Rather, these rules were intended to reach the significant \nrevenues derived by highly profitable oil related activities that were \nsourced to a low-tax country as opposed to the country in which the oil \nor gas was extracted or ultimately consumed. Furthermore, it is \nimportant to note that when these anti-abuse rules were being \nconsidered and then put into place, pipeline companies were not engaged \nin international development activities, rather they were focused \nsolely on domestic infrastructure development.\n  Today, pipeline companies are continuing to actively pursue all \ndevelopment opportunities domestically, yet they are somewhat limited. \nThe real growth for U.S. pipeline companies, however, is in the \ninternational arena. These new opportunities have arisen from fairly \nrecent efforts by foreign countries to privatize their energy sectors.\n  Enabling U.S. pipeline companies to engage in energy infrastructure \nprojects abroad will result in tremendous benefits back home. For \nexample, more U.S. employees will be needed to craft and close deals, \nto build the plants and pipelines, and to operate the facilities. New \ninvestment overseas also will bring new demands for U.S. equipment. Yet \nbefore any of these benefits can be realized, U.S. companies must be \nable to defeat their foreign competitors and win projects. \nUnfortunately, current U.S. tax laws significantly hinder the ability \nof U.S. companies to win such projects.\n  We must act now if we are to ensure that U.S. companies remain \ncompetitive players in the international marketplace. There are \nincremental, low cost, reforms that we can and must make. My \nlegislation--to clarify that U.S. tax treatment of foreign pipeline \ntransportation income--is one such low-cost reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to bring current U.S. \ntax law in line with good tax policy. It is up to us to do all we can \nto keep America competitive in the global economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Robb, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 1117. A bill to establish the Corinth Unit of Shiloh National \nMilitary Park, in the vicinity of the city of Corinth, Mississippi, and \nin the State of Tennessee, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              corinth battlefield preservation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, 137 years ago today, Major General Henry W. \nHalleck and his 120,000 man strong Union Army commenced the siege of \nCorinth, Mississippi. The ensuing six month battle between General \nHalleck's federal troops and General P. G. T. Beauregard's 53,000 \nConfederate defenders marked a turning point in the war between the \nstates. It was a fierce engagement over a mere 16 square feet parcel. \nThis small piece of real estate was of critical strategic importance to \nboth the North and the South.\n\n  It was in Corinth, Mississippi that the Memphis and Charleston and \nMobile and Ohio Railroads crossed paths. This vital east-west and \nnorth-south railroad junction served as a passageway for troops and \nsupplies moving from Illinois to Alabama and from Tennessee to points \nfurther east such as South Carolina and Virginia.\n  Ed Bearss, Chief Historian Emeritus of the National Park Service, \nstated that ``during the Spring of 1862, Corinth was the most important \ncity in the Confederacy and almost the length of the War . . . because \nof the railroads.'' In fact, because of its status as a vital rail hub, \nthe town was occupied by either Confederate or Union forces from 1861 \nto 1865. It also served as a springboard for the careers of over 200 \nleading Confederate and Federal generals who were stationed in Corinth \nat one time or another. A figure matched by few other locations.\n  Corinth is a city that exemplifies the trials and tribulations \nexperienced by soldiers and civilians throughout the Civil War. A town \nwhose railways lied at the center of a grand military chess match. An \narea, like many others north and south of the Mason-Dixon line, racked \nby the ravages of war.\n  Even with its new status as a National Historic Landmark, Corinth is \nstill considered a ``Civil War Landmark At Risk.'' The Civil War Sites \nAdvisory Commission, chartered by Congress to assess threats to \nAmerica's premier historic sites, identified Corinth as a priority one \nbattlefield in critical need of coordinated nationwide action by the \nyear 2000. Local, state, and national preservation groups agree. And, \nso do I.\n  Mr. President, today, I am proud and honored to introduce the Corinth \nBattlefield Preservation Act of 1999. This much needed legislation \nwould provide further protection for one of America's most important \nCivil War sites by establishing Corinth as a unit of the Shiloh \nNational Military Park.\n  The 106th Congress needs to add the Corinth Battlefield and its \nsurrounding sites to the National Park System given the area's pivotal \nrole in American history. It is also appropriate for Congress to \nestablish Corinth as a unit of the Shiloh National Military Park as \nthese two sites were indelibly linked during the Civil War. The 1862 \nbattle of\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\nShiloh was actually the first strike in the Union force's overall \nCorinth Campaign. It was in April 1862, that federal and southern \nforces competing for control over Corinth first struggled in the Battle \nof Shiloh/Pittsburg Landing. The battle for Corinth also had \ninternational implications. As a result of the Union's victory, the \nBritish government chose not to officially recognize the Confederacy.\n  The conflict in and around Corinth eventually included the Battles of \nIuka, Tupelo, and Brices' Crossroads, as well as engagements in \nBooneville, Rienzi, Ripley, and numerous skirmishes in southwest \nTennessee and northeast Alabama.\n  In 1862, Union General Halleck said ``Richmond and Corinth . . . are \nthe greatest strategic points of the war, and our success at these \npoints should be insured at all hazards.'' Halleck's subordinate, \nGeneral Ulysses S. Grant, regarded Corinth as ``the great strategic \nposition in the west between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers and \nbetween Nashville and Vicksburg.'' In arguing for the defense of \nCorinth, Confederate General Beauregard stated to General Samual \nCooper, Adjutant and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army \nthat, ``if defeated here [in Corinth,] we lose the Mississippi Valley \nand probably our cause, whereas we could even afford to lose for a \nwhile Charleston and Savannah for the purpose of defeating Buell's \narmy, which would not only insure us the valley of the Mississippi, but \nour independence.'' Corinth's strategic importance to both armies led \nto some of the bloodiest battles in the Western Theater. Tens of \nthousands of soldiers were killed or wounded in this bitter offensive.\n  It was also here that thousands of war refugees, mostly African-\nAmericans from Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama, sought shelter with \nthe Union Army in Corinth. After President Lincoln's Emancipation \nProclamation, the federal army created a model ``Contraband Camp.'' By \nthe Spring of 1863, the camp housed around 4,000 freedmen. Almost half \nof these freedmen joined the ``First Alabama Infantry of African \nDescent'' which later became the ``55th Colored Infantry.''\n  Corinth is also one of the few existing Civil War sites that boasts \nextraordinary earthworks and fortifications--many of which remain in \npristine condition. A National Park Service studying authority stated \nthat, ``today the surviving [Corinth] earthworks are one of the largest \nand best preserved groups of field fortifications, dating to 1862 in \nthe United States.'' Unfortunately, many of these historic resources, \nundisturbed for over 130 years, are now threatened. For example, a 500-\nyard section of earthworks was specifically sold for development. These \nearthworks are important to our national heritage because they helped \nshape the face of war from the 1860's to today. In fact, trench warfare \nevolved from the battle for Corinth. These earthworks and \nfortifications are symbolic reminders of the epic struggle that ensued \nbetween friends and neighbors and the Civil War's lasting impact on \nmodern warfare.\n  Although, the Battle of Shiloh has been etched into American history \nas part of the Shiloh National Military Park, a number of important \nhistoric sites and resources relating to the pre-battle and the rest of \nthe Corinth Campaign have not been adequately protected or interpreted. \nEstablishing the Shiloh Nationally Military Park as the nation's second \nMilitary Park back in 1894 was a good start. Now it is time for the \n106th Congress to complete the preservation effort. Congress needs to \ngive a lasting presence to the Corinth Battlefield, a key component of \nthe historic Shiloh-Corinth Corridor.\n  Corinth remains a central transportation gateway. It serves as a \njunction intersecting Highways 72, running east and west, and Highway \n45, which runs north and south. It is also a mecca for dedicated \nhistory buffs given the town's close proximity to Shiloh and other \nCivil War sites and its connection to the Corinth Campaign.\n  I am sure that my colleagues will agree that the sixteen Corinth \nCivil War sites designated as National Historic Landmarks are far too \nimportant to be relegated solely to review in history books or by \nprofessional historians. Americans need to see it.\n  The 106th Congress can and must highlight the importance of the Siege \nand Battle of Corinth for the millions of adults and children, both \nAmerican and foreign, interested in learning about an essential facet \nof Americana.\n  For over one hundred years, the United States Congress has advanced \nthe notion that our national interest is best served by preserving \nAmerica's historic treasures. Not only by ensuring the proper \ninterpretation of important historic events, but also the places--the \nproperties where pivotal military milestones occurred.\n  As Ed Bearss proclaimed, ``the Battle of Corinth was the bloodiest \nbattle in the State of Mississippi. Troops were brought from New \nOrleans, Mobile, Texas and Arkansas because Corinth was such an \nimportant place. With the fall of Corinth, Perryville, Kentucky, and \nAntietam, Maryland the Confederacy was lost.'' We owe it to our \nancestors and to future generations to protect Corinth and the wealth \nof Civil War history that exudes from this small town.\n  Mr. President, the measure offered today is vital to the successful \ninterpretation and preservation of Corinth. It builds upon previous \nefforts and gives Corinth its proper status as one of America's most \nsignificant Civil War sites.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in support of the \nCorinth Battlefield Preservation Act of 1999. A bipartisan measure \nwhich is widely supported by local, state, regional, national, and \ninternational preservation organizations.\n  Along with the strong local support shown by the residents and local \nofficials of Corinth and Alcorn County as well as assistance from \nseveral Civil War preservation groups, I would also like to take a \nmoment to thank Rosemary Williams of Corinth, Woody Harrel, \nSuperintendent of the Shiloh Military Park, and Anne Thompson, Manager \nof the Interim Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center. They were \ninstrumental in assisting with the preparation of this important \nhistoric preservation legislation.\n  Mr. President, I also want to thank my colleagues, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Robb, and Senator Jeffords, for their formal support of this \npro-parks, pro-history measure.\n  I hope that the rest of my colleagues will join with us in taking \nthis necessary step to protect our heritage so that our children and \ngrandchildren can gain an understanding of the struggles of this great \nnation. Struggles that have help shaped our American democracy and \ntransformed our diverse states and peoples into a cohesive and \nprosperous union better prepared to meet the challenges and \nopportunities of the next millennium. Corinth has a story to tell \nAmericans today and in the future. Corinth merits inclusion in the \nShiloh National Military Park.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nconvert the price support program for sugarcane and sugar beets into a \nsystem of solely recourse loans to provide for the gradual elimination \nof the program; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                  sugar program phase out legislation\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues Senators \nFeinstein, Chafee, Gregg, and Santorum to introduce legislation that \nphases out the federal sugar program. Remember that old story, if you \nbelieve this, I've got some swampland to sell you in Florida? Boy, I \nwish I bought some of that swampland and became a sugar grower.\n\n  It is a can't miss, can't lose proposition where all of the risk is \nabsorbed by the federal government and all of the reward goes to the \nsugar barons. It is one of the last vestiges of a centralized, \nsubsidized U.S. farm sector which has mostly gone by the wayside.\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\n  Ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Odessa on the \nOkeechobee with its generous price supports somehow still survives. \nThis is a special interest program that benefits a handful of sugar \nbarons at the expense of every man, woman and child in America.\n  Several years ago, the GAO estimated that consumers paid $1.4 billion \nmore at the cash register because of the sugar price support. Today, \nbecause the world price for sugar is lower and the price paid in the \nU.S. is higher, the cost to consumers could be twice as high.\n  And let's not forget. It has already cost America thousands of \nrefinery jobs. And it has already cost the Everglades hundreds of acres \nof pristine wilderness. In Brooklyn and in Yonkers, we have lost one-\nthird of our refinery jobs in the last decade. Why? Because the sugar \nprogram is such a bitter deal, refiners cannot get enough raw cane \nsugar to remain open.\n  Four years ago, when we came within five votes in the House of \nterminating the sugar program, the world market price for sugar was \nabout ten cents and the U.S. price about 20 cents. Today the world \nprice is less than a nickel and the U.S. price is almost a quarter. In \nother words, the gulf between the free market and the sugar program is \ngetting wider.\n  Under any reasonable and rational measure the sugar program should be \nrepealed. If the issue is jobs, the environment or the consumer--then \nwe have no choice but to repeal. At all ends of the political spectrum \nthe answer is the same--it's time to repeal the sugar program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

or\n       ``(2) the raw cane sugar loan rate in effect under section \n     156 of the Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. \n     7272), plus interest.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation \nsponsored by Senator Schumer to phase out the antiquated sugar subsidy. \nThe sugar program is nothing than a system of import restrictions, \nsubsidized loans, and price supports that benefit a limited number of \nsugar growers.\n  I find it incredible that the federal government continues to support \na subsidy program that is driving the domestic refinery industry out of \nexistence and costing thousands of good jobs. The US Department of \nAgriculture restricts the amount of sugar available to domestic \nrefineries. Without sugar, a sugar refinery cannot operate and that is \nthe result of this misguided program.\n  It is clear that the U.S. sugar policy has served to strangle this \ncountry's sugar refining industry. By limiting the amount of raw cane \nsugar available for production, there has been a 40 percent decline in \njobs in the sugar-cane refining industry. Since 1982, nine out of \ntwenty one cane sugar refineries in the U.S. have been forced out of \nbusiness. Those that have remained open are struggling to survive under \nonerous import restrictions.\n  I first became involved with this issue in 1994 when David Koncelik, \nthe President and CEO of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company, \ninformed me that his refinery was forced to temporarily cease \noperations because it had no sugar.\n  This 93 year old refinery is the Nation's largest refinery and the \nonly such facility on the West Coast. C refines about 15 percent of \nthe total cane sugar consumed in the U.S.\n  C is capable of producing and selling 700,000 tons of refined sugar \nannually. Therefore, the company requires in excess of 700,000 tons of \nraw cane sugar to meet its sales demand.\n  Hawaii is C's sole source for its domestic raw cane sugar needs, \nbut Hawaii's cane sugar industry has been in decline for over 10 years. \nThis has meant that C is forced to cover over half its annual \nconsumption through imports from other countries.\n  The highly restrictive sugar import system forces C to pay an \ninflated price for raw sugar from both domestic and foreign suppliers. \nEven more devastating, however, the quota system limits the amount of \nsugar available to the refinery. Simply put, C has been unable to get \nenough sugar to refine and it has been forced to close it doors on \nseveral occasions.\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\n  The reduced production capacity has resulted in a severe downsizing \nof the workforce. As recently as 1987, C employed over 1,400 people. \nThese are not minimum wage jobs we are talking about: the average \nemployee in the cane refining industry earns nearly $43,000 a year. In \n1995, C had to eliminate 30 percent of its workforce just to remain \nviable under the quota system mandated by the sugar program.\n  C now employees just over 500 people. These jobs and many others \naround the nation are at risk if reforms are not made to the sugar \nprogram.\n  The overly restrictive manner that the USDA administers the sugar \nprogram has a number of other flaws. The sugar program's existing quota \nsystem was put in place in 1982, using trading patterns dating as far \nback as 1975. The system has remained largely unchanged over the past \n17 years despite major alterations in the international sugar market. \nAs a result, the current import quota system assigns export rights to \ncountries that don't grow enough sugar to export or, in some cases, are \nnet importers themselves.\n  For example, the Philippines are granted one of the largest export \nprivileges under the sugar import quota system. It, however, does not \neven grow enough sugar to meet it own domestics needs. What this means \nis that the Philippines sell their homegrown sugar crop to the United \nStates at about 22 cents a pound. It then buys raw sugar on the world \nmarket at around 5 cents a pound. This is ridiculous. We are in effect \ngiving money to foreign countries and forcing domestic consumers to pay \nthe price.\n  Beginning in September of 1994, I have asked the Administration on \neight separate occasions to reform the sugar program. Simply increasing \nthe amount of sugar available through the import program would provide \nimmediate relief to C and the other domestic refineries. To date, no \nsuch permanent reform of the program has been made.\n  In addition to choking off the refineries' access to sugar, the US \nsugar policy also has an adverse impact on US consumers. The General \nAccounting Office has found that the program costs sugar users an \naverage of $1.4 billion annually. That equates to $3.8 million a day in \nhidden sugar taxes.\n  The report found that ``Although the sugar program is considered a \nno-net-cost program because the government does not make payments \ndirectly to producers, it places the cost of the price supports on \nsweetener users--consumers and manufacturers of sweetener-containing \nproducts--who pay higher sugar and sweetener prices.''\n  What this means is that unlike traditional subsidy programs, the \nfunds do not come directly from the Treasury. Instead, the sugar \nprogram places the cost consumers by restricting the supply of \navailable sugar which causes higher domestic market prices.\n  The legislation we are introducing will eliminate the sugar subsidy \nprogram by 2002. This is a simple, straight-forward, and fair way to \nend a program that has not worked for U.S. consumers or workers.\n  Congress has had opportunities in the past to kill this program and \nwe have not taken them. As a result, workers have lost jobs and \nconsumers have lost money. I am pleased to join my colleagues in saying \nthat enough is enough. It is time to end the sugar subsidy program once \nand for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Bryan, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Rockefeller, \n        Mr. Biden, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 1120. A bill to ensure that children enrolled in medicaid and \nother Federal means-tested programs at highest risk for lead poisoning \nare identified and treated, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                        children's lead safe act\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator Reed \nto introduce legislation that will ensure that children enrolled in \nfederal health care programs receive screening and appropriate care for \nlead poisoning. Our bill, the ``Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999'' \nwould go a long way to eliminate childhood lead poisoning.\n  We know lead exposure is one of the most dangerous health hazards for \nyoung children because their nervous systems are still developing. Lead \npoisoning in children causes damage to the brain and nervous systems, \nwhich leads to IQ loss, impaired physical development and behavioral \nproblems. High levels of exposure can cause comas, convulsions, and \neven death.\n  Despite our success over the past twenty years to reduce lead \npoisoning in the U.S., it continues to be the number one environmental \nhealth threat to children, with nearly one million preschoolers \naffected. Poor and minority children are most at-risk because of diet \nand exposure to environmental hazards such as old housing. These \nchildren frequently live in older housing which contains cracked or \nchipped lead paint, where children primarily contract lead poisoning by \ningesting paint chips or lead dust.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of At-Risk children are enrolled in federal \nhealth care programs. Kids in these programs are five times more likely \nto have high blood levels. In 1992, Congress instructed Health Care \nFinancing Adm. (HCFA) to require States to lead screen Medicaid \nchildren under the age of two. Despite this, the GAO report shows that \nmandatory screening isn't happening. Two-thirds of Medicaid children \nhave never been screened (as required). And only 20 percent of all \nchildren in federal programs have been screened.\n  In fact, only half the States have screening policies consistent with \nfederal law. In my own state of New Jersey, the GAO report showed that \nonly 39 percent of Medicaid children have been screened. Despite \nfederal requirements, for whatever reason--insufficient outreach, lax \ngovernment oversight or parental ignorance, too many kids are not \ngetting screened.\n  The Children's Lead SAFE Act would address this problem by \nestablishing clear and consistent standards for screening and treatment \nand by involving all relevant federal health programs in this battle. \nOur legislation is modeled on the recommendations made by the GAO.\n  It requires all federal programs serving at-risk kids to be involved \nin screening. It requires State Medicaid contracts to explicitly \nrequire providers (HMO's) to follow federal rules for screening and \ntreatment. It expands Medicaid coverage to include treatment services \nand environmental investigations to determine the source of the \npoisoning. WIC centers (with 12 percent of the at-risk population) will \nbe required to assess whether a child has been screened and if they \nhave not to provide the necessary referral and follow-up to ensure that \nscreening occurs. Head Start facilities would similarly have the \nresponsibility for ensuring that their children are screened.\n  In addition, our legislation would improve data so we can identify \nproblems and use that information to educate providers about the extent \nof the problem. CDC would develop information-sharing guidelines for \nState and local health departments, the labs that perform the test and \nfederal programs. It would also require each State to report on the \npercent of the Medicaid population they are screening.\n  Finally, our legislation would make sure agencies have sufficient \nresources to do screening by reimbursing WIC and Head Start for costs \nthey incur in screening. The legislation would also create a bonus \nprogram whereby a state will receive a per child bonus for every child \nit screens above 65 percent of its Medicaid population.\n  Mr. President, the health and safety of our children would be greatly \nenhanced with the passage of this important legislation. Childhood lead \npoisoning is easily preventable, and there is no excuse for not \nproperly screening and providing care to our kids. Our bill would \naccomplish this and ensure adequate care. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing this problem and supporting its solution.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Torricelli that would ensure that children enrolled in federal \nhealth care programs receive screening and appropriate follow-up care \nfor lead poisoning. Our bill, the ``Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999'' \nis an effort to eliminate a disease that continues to wreak \nirreversible damage upon our nation's children.\n  Despite our success over the past twenty years to reduce lead \npoisoning\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nin the U.S., it continues to be the number one environmental health \nthreat to children, with nearly one million preschoolers affected. This \nproblem is particularly severe among African American children who are \nat five times higher risk than white children and low-income children \nare at eight times higher risk than children from well-to-do families.\n  Minorities and low-income children are disproportionately affected by \nlead poisoning because they frequently live in older housing which \ncontains cracked or chipped lead paint, where children primarily \ncontract lead poisoning by ingesting paint chips or lead dust.\n  If undetected, lead poisoning can cause brain and nervous system \ndamage, behavior and learning problems and possibly death.\n  Research shows that children with elevated blood-lead levels are \nseven times more likely to drop out of high school and six times more \nlikely to have reading disabilities. It costs an average of $10,000 \nmore a year to educate a lead-poisoned child. We will continue to pay \nfor our failure to eradicate this preventable tragedy through costs to \nour education and health care system, and losses in lifetime earnings, \nunless we act now to protect our children.\n  As I mentioned, this disease is entirely preventable, making its \nprevalence among children all the more frustrating. We do have \nsolutions--parents who are aware, housing that is safe, and effective \nscreening and treatment for children who are at risk--to name a few.\n  Unfortunately, our current system is not adequately protecting our \nchildren. In January 1999, the General Accounting Office reported that \nchildren in federally funded health care programs such as Medicaid, \nWomen Infant and Child (WIC) and the Health Centers program, are five \ntimes more likely to have elevated blood lead levels. The report also \nfound that despite longstanding federal requirements, two-thirds of the \nchildren in these programs--more than 400,000--have never been screen \nand, consequently, remain untreated.\n  Early detection of lead poisoning is critical to ensure that a child \nis removed from the source of exposure and to determine whether other \nchildren, such as siblings or friends, have also been exposed. \nScreening is also important to determine whether a child's lead \npoisoning is so severe as to require medical management to mitigate the \nlong-term health and developmental effects of lead.\n  Mr. President, our comprehensive legislation is designed to make sure \nno child falls through the cracks, by establishing clear and consistent \nstandards for screening and treatment and by holding accountable those \nwho are responsible for carrying out the requirements. The legislation \nsupports improved management information systems to provide state- and \ncommunity-level information about the extent to which children have \nelevated blood lead levels. It also expands and coordinates lead \nscreening and treatment activities through other federal programs \nserving at-risk children such as WIC, Early Head Start, and the \nMaternal and Child Health Block Grant programs. Finally, the bill ties \nincentives for screening to additional federal funding for cleaning up \nlead-contaminated houses.\n  Mr. President, we propose this legislation in an effort to rid \nchildren of the detrimental effects of lead poisoning. Every child has \na right to screening and follow-up care.

A bill to amend the Clayton Act to enhance the authority of \nthe Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions that \nwould unreasonably limit competition; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                   ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are living in a time of mega-mergers, \nand they are coming from all directions. Chrysler and Daimler-Benz \nautomobile companies finalized their merger last year. In the computer \nworld, AOL completed its purchase of Netscape just a few months ago. \nAnd in the largest corporate merger ever, Exxon Corporation announced \nits plan to acquire Mobil at a price tag of over $75 billion, thus \ncreating the world's biggest private oil company, Exxon Mobil \nCorporation.\n  While these mega-mergers have cut a swath across a number of \nindustries, the consolidations that continue to raise the most \nquestions in my mind are those that involve incumbent monopolies. For \nexample, the mergers among Regional Bell Operating Companies, which \ncontinue to have a virtual stranglehold on the local telephone loop, \npose a great threat to healthy competition in the telecommunications \nindustry.\n  Indeed, incumbent telephone companies still control more than 99% of \nthe local residential telephone markets.\n  As I said last Congress, and it is still the case today, at my farm \nin Middlesex and at my home here in Virginia, I have only one choice \nfor dial-tone and local telephone service. That ``choice'' is the Bell \noperating company or no service at all.\n  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed with the promise of \nbringing competition to benefit American consumers. However, this \npromise has yet to materialize.\n  Since passage of the Telecommunications Act, Southwestern Bell has \nmerged with PacTel into SBC Corporation, Bell Atlantic has merged into \nNYNEX, and AT has acquired IBM's Global Network, just to name a few. \nJust last week it was reported that U.S. West reached an agreement to \nmerge with the telecommunications company Global Crossing.\n  The U.S. Justice Department didn't spend years dividing up Ma Bell \njust to see it grow back together again under the guise of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act.\n  I am very concerned that the concentration of ownership in the \ntelecommunications industry is proceeding faster than the growth of \ncompetition. Old monopolies are simply regrouping and getting bigger \nand bigger.\n  Before all the pieces of Ma Bell are put together again, Congress \nshould revisit the Telecommunications Act. To ensure competition \nbetween Bell Operating Companies and long distance and other companies, \nas contemplated by passage of this law, we need clearer guidelines and \nbetter incentives. Specifically, we should ensure that Bell Operating \nCompanies do not gain more concentrated control over huge percentages \nof the telephone access lines of this country through mergers, but only \nthrough robust competition.\n  Today I am reintroducing antitrust legislation that will bar future \nmergers between Bell Operating Companies or GTE, unless the federal \nrequirements for opening the local loop to competition have been \nsatisfied in at least half of the access lines in each State.\n  The bill provides that a ``large local telephone company'' may not \nmerge with another large local telephone company unless the Attorney \nGeneral finds that the merger will promote competition for telephone \nexchange services and exchange access services. Also, before a merger \ncan take place, the Federal Communications Commission must find that \neach large local telephone company has for at least one-half of the \naccess lines in each State served by such carrier, of which as least \none-half are residential access lines, fully implemented the \nrequirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934.\n  The bill requires that each large local telephone company that wishes \nto merge with another must file an application with the Attorney \nGeneral and the FCC. A review of these applications will be subject to \nthe same time limits set under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust \nImprovements Act of 1976.\n  The bill also provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to \nmodify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws of \nthe United States, or any authority of the Federal Communications \nCommission, or any\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\nauthority of the States with respect to mergers and acquisitions of \nlarge local telephone companies.\n  The bill is effective on enactment and has no retroactive effect. It \nis enforceable by the Attorney General in federal district courts.\n  This bill has the potential to make the 1996 Telecommunications Act \nfinally live up to some of its promises.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Antitrust Improvements Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to enhance the authority of the \n     Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions \n     that would unreasonably limit competition in the \n     telecommunications industry in any case in which certain \n     Federal requirements that would enhance competition are not \n     met.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESTRAINT OF TRADE.\n\n       The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating section 27 (as designated by section 2 \n     of Public Law 96-493) as section 29; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 27 (as added by the Curt \n     Flood Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-297)) the following new \n     section:\n       ``Sec. 28.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nimprove the safety of imported food, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  Imported Food Safety Improvement Act\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, food safety is a serious and \ngrowing public health concern. According to the General Accounting \nOffice (GAO), as many as 81 million cases of foodborne illness and \n9,000 related deaths occur in the U.S. every year. Most at risk are the \nvery old, the very young, and the very ill. While these statistics \nrefer to all cases of foodborne illness, recent outbreaks demonstrate \nthat tainted imported foods have increased the incidence of illness and \nhave exposed American consumers to new pathogens.\n  The volume of imported foods continues to grow, yet our current food \nimport system is riddled with holes which allow unsafe food to \npenetrate our borders. Contaminated food imports have caused illnesses \nrarely seen in the United States and can be extremely difficult, if not \nimpossible, for consumers to detect.\n  I first became interested in this issue when I learned that fruit \nfrom Mexico and Guatemala was associated with three multi-state \noutbreaks of foodborne illesses--one of hepatitis A and two of \nCyclospora infection--that sickened thousands of Americans. These \noutbreaks included victims in my home State of Maine.\n  In my State's grocery stores, as in any typical American grocery \nstore, the fresh fruit and vegetables that are available during the \nwinter months come from many other countries. In many ways, imported \nfood is a blessing for American consumers. Fruit and vegetables that \nwould normally be unavailable in our local grocery stores during the \nwinter months are now available all year long, making it easier and \nmore enjoyable to eat the five servings of fruit and vegetables a day \nthe National Cancer Institute recommends. But, it's only a blessing if \nthe food is safe. Even one serving of tainted food can cause sickness \nand even death.\n  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports that the increasing \nimportation of produce is a trend that is expected to continue. In \n1996, the U.S. imported $7.2 billion worth of fruit and vegetables from \nat least 90 different countries, a dramatic increase from the 1990 \nlevel of $4.8 billion. Total food imports have increased from 1.1 \nmillion shipments in 1992 to 2.7 million in 1997. And, of all the fish \nand shellfish consumed in the U.S., more than half is imported.\n  Yet, the FDA annually inspects less than 2 percent of the 2.7 million \nshipments of food that arrive in the U.S. And of the small number of \nshipments that are inspected, only about a third are tested for some of \nthe most significant pathogens. What's more, even when the FDA does \ncatch contaminated food, the system often fails to dispose of it \nadequately. Indeed, according to one survey conducted by the Customs \nService in 1997, as many as 70 percent of the imported food shipments \nthe FDA ordered re-exported or destroyed may have ended up in U.S. \ncommerce any way. Unscrupulous food importers can easily circumvent the \ninspection system.\n  Mr. President, to respond to these problems, I am introducing the \nImported Food Safety Improvement Act, with Senator Frist, Senator \nAbraham, Senator Coverdell, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Snowe as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  Our legislation is an effort designed to strengthen the existing food \nimport system to help ensure that unsafe food does not enter the United \nStates. Our goal is to reduce the incidence of foodborne illnesses and \nto ensure that American families can enjoy a variety of foods year-\nround without the risk of illness when they sit down to the dinner \ntable.\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\n  This legislation is the product of an extensive investigation by the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. During the \n105th Congress, the Subcommittee undertook a 16-month, in-depth \ninvestigation into the safety of food imports. During five days of \nSubcommittee hearings, we heard testimony from 29 witnesses, including \nscientists, industry and consumer representatives, government \nofficials, the General Accounting Office, and two persons with first-\nhand knowledge of the seamier side of the imported food industry, a \nconvicted Customs broker and a convicted former FDA inspector. As a \nresult of the compelling testimony that we heard, I have worked with my \ncolleagues in drafting the legislation we introduce today--the Imported \nFood Safety Improvement Act--to address a broad array of problems \nuncovered during the Subcommittee's investigation.\n  My Subcommittee's investigation has revealed much about the food we \nimport into this country and the government's flawed food safety net. \nLet me briefly recount some of our findings which make it clear why \nthis legislation is so urgently needed:\n  In the worlds of the GAO, ``federal efforts to ensure the safety of \nimported food are inconsistent and unreliable.'' Federal agencies have \nnot effectively targeted their resources on imported foods posing the \ngreatest risks;\n  Weaknesses in FDA import controls, specifically the ability of \nimporters to control the food shipments from the port to the point of \ndistribution, makes the system vulnerable to fraud and deception;\n  The bonds required to be posted by importers who violate food safety \nlaws are so low that they are considered by some unscrupulous importers \nat the cost of doing business;\n  Maintaining the food safety net for imported food is an increasingly \ncomplex task, made more complicated by previously unknown foodborne \npathogens, like Cyclospora, that are difficult to detect;\n  Because some imported food can be contaminated by organisms that \ncannot be detected by visual inspection or laboratory tests, placing \nadditional federal inspectors at ports-of-entry alone will not protect \nAmericans from unsafe food imports; and\n  Since contamination of imported food can occur at many different \nplaces from the farm to the table, the ability to trace-back outbreaks \nof foodborne illnesses to the source of contamination is a complex \nprocess that requires a more coordinated effort among the federal, \nstate, and local agencies as well as improved education for health care \nproviders so that they can better recognize and treat foodborne \nillnesses.\n  The testimony that I heard during my Subcommittee's hearings was \ntroubling. The United States Customs Service told us of one \nparticularly egregious situation that I would like to share. It \ninvolves contaminated fish and illustrates the challenges facing \nfederal regulators who are charged with ensuring the safety of our \nnation's food supply.\n  In 1996, federal inspectors along our border with Mexico opened a \nshipment of seafood destined for sales to restaurants in Los Angeles. \nThe shipment was dangerously tainted with life-threatening \ncontaminants, including botulism, Salmonella, and just plain filth. \nMuch to the surprise of the inspectors, this shipment of frozen fish \nhad been inspected before by federal authorities. Alarmingly, in fact, \nit had arrived at our border two years before, and had been rejected by \nthe FDA as unfit for consumption. Its importers then held this rotten \nshipment for two years before attempting to bring it into the country \nagain, by a different route.\n  The inspectors only narrowly prevented this poisoned fish from \nreaching American plates. And what happened to the importer who tried \nto sell this deadly food to American consumers? In effect, nothing. He \nwas placed on probation and asked to perform 50 hours of community \nservice.\n  I suppose we should be thankful that the perpetrators were caught and \nheld responsible. After all, the unsafe food might have escaped \ndetection and reached our tables. But it worries me that the importer \nessentially received a slap on the wrist. I believe that forfeiting the \nsmall amount of money currently required for the Custom's bond, which \nimporters now consider no more than a ``cost of doing business,'' does \nlittle to deter unscrupulous importers from trying to slip tainted fish \nthat is two years old past overworked Customs agents.\n  All too often, unscrupulous importers are never discovered. The \nGeneral Accounting Office testified about a special operation known as \nOperation Bad Apple, conducted by Customs at the Port of San Francisco \nin 1997, identified 23 weaknesses in the controls over FDA-regulated \nimported food. For example, under current law, importers retain custody \nof their shipments from the time they arrive at the border. The \nimporters must also put up a bond and agree to ``redeliver'' the \nshipment to Customs, for reexport or destruction, if ordered to do so \nor forfeit the bond. However, Operation Bad Apple revealed a very \ndisturbing fact. Of the shipments found to violate U.S. standards, \nthereby requiring redelivery to Customs for destruction or re-export, a \nfull 40 percent were never returned. The Customs Service believes an \nadditional 30 percent of shipments that the FDA required to be returned \ncontained good products that the importers had substituted for the \noriginal bad products. Customs further believes that the violative \nproducts were on their way to the marketplace. This means that a total \nof 70  percent of products ordered returned, because they were unsafe, \npresumably entered into U.S. commerce.\n\n  Weak import controls make our system all too easy to circumvent. \nAfter all, FDA only physically inspects about 17 of every 1,000 food \nshipments and, of the food inspected, only about a third is actually \ntested. That is why we have worked with the FDA, the Customs Service, \nand the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure that our \nlegislation addresses many of the issues explored over the course of \nthe Subcommittee's investigation and hearings. Let me describe what \nthis bill is designed to accomplish.\n  Our legislation will fill the existing gaps in the food import system \nand provide the FDA with certain stronger authority to protect American \nconsumers against tainted food imports. First and foremost, this bill \ngives the FDA the authority to stop such food from entering our \ncountry. This authority allows the FDA to deny the entry of imported \nfood that has caused repeated outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, \npresents a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health \nconsequences, and is likely without systemic changes to cause disease \nagain.\n  Second, this legislation includes the authority for the FDA to \nrequire secure storage of shipments offered by repeat offenders prior \nto their release into commerce, to prohibit the practice of ``port-\nshopping,'' and to mark boxes containing violative foods as ``U.S.--\nRefused Entry.'' This latter authority, which would allow the FDA to \nclearly mark boxes containing contaminated foods, is currently used \nwith success by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and has been \nrequested specifically by the FDA. Our bill also will require the \ndestruction of certain imported foods that cannot be adequately \nreconditioned to ensure safety. Third, the legislation directs the FDA \nto develop criteria for use by private laboratories used to collect and \nanalyze samples of food offered for import. This will ensure the \nintegrity of the testing process.\n  Fourth, the bill will give ``teeth'' to the current food import \nsystem by establishing two strong deterrents--the threats of high bonds \nand of debarment--for unscrupulous importers who repeatedly violate \nU.S. law. No longer will the industry's ``bad actors'' be able to \nprofit from endangering the health of American consumers.\n  Finally, our bill will authorize the CDC to award grants to state and \nlocal public health agencies to strengthen the public health \ninfrastructure by updating essential items such as laboratory and \nelectronic-reporting equipment. Grants will also be available for \nuniversities to develop new and improved tests to detect pathogens and \nfor professional schools and professional societies to develop programs \nto increase the awareness of foodborne illness among healthcare \nproviders and the public.\n  We believe the measures provided for in this legislation will help to \ncurtail\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nthe risks that unsafe food imports currently pose to our citizens, \nparticularly our elderly, our children and our sick. I appreciate the \nadvice and input we have received from scientists, industry and \nconsumer groups, and the FDA, the CDC and the U.S. Customs Service in \ndrafting this legislation.\n  We are truly fortunate that the American food supply is one of the \nsafest in the world. But, our system for safeguarding our people from \ntainted food imports is flawed and poses needless risks of serious \nfoodborne illnesses. I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to \nprovide our federal agencies with the direction, authority, and \nresources necessary to keep unsafe food out of the United States and \noff American dinner tables.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Bond, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Robb, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Torricelli, \n        Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Edwards).\n  S.J. Res. S. 25. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress \nwith respect to the court-marital conviction of the late Rear Admiral \nCharles Butler McVay III, and calling upon the President to award a \nPresidential Unit Citation to the final crew of the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to share with \nmy colleagues a brief story from the closing days of World War II, the \nwar in the Pacific.\n  It is a harrowing story, with many elements. Bad timing, bad weather. \nHeroism and fortitude. Negligence and shame. Bad luck. Above all, it is \nthe story of some very special men whose will to survive shines like a \nbeacon decades later.\n  I should point out that it is because of the efforts of a 13 year old \nboy in Florida that I introduce this bill today. Hunter Scott, working \nfor nearly two years on what started as a history project, compiled a \nmountain of clippings, letters, and interviews that ultimately led \nCongressman Joe Scarborough to introduce this bill in the House, and \nfor me to do so in the Senate. Hunter, on behalf of the survivors of \nthe U.S.S. Indianapolis, the family of Captain McVay, and your country, \nI thank you for your courageous efforts.\n  Mr. President, we have the opportunity to redeem the reputation of a \nwronged man, and salute the indomitable will of a courageous crew. I \nhad the distinct honor and priviledge of hosting two distinguished \nmembers of that courageous crew just this morning; Richard Paroubek, of \nWilliamsburg, VA, who was a Yeoman 1st Class, and Woodie James of Salt \nLake City, UT, who was a Coxswain. The bill I introduce today will \nhonor these two men, and their fellow shipmates of the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis, and redeem their Captain, Charles McVay.\n  A 1920 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Charles Butler McVay III \nwas a career naval officer with an exemplary record, including \nparticipation in the landings in North Africa and award of the Silver \nStar for courage under fire earned during the Soloman Islands campaign. \nBefore taking command of the Indianapolis in November 1944, Captain \nMcVay was chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Combined \nChiefs of Staff in Washington, the Allies' highest intelligence unit.\n  Captain McVay led the ship through the invasion of Iwo Jima, then the \nbombardment of Okinawa in the spring of 1945 during which Indianapolis' \nantiaircraft guns shot down seven enemy planes before the ship was \nseverely damaged. McVay returned the ship safely to Mare Island in \nCalifornia for repairs.\n  In 1945, the Indianapolis delivered the world's first operational \natomic bomb to the island of Tinian, which would later be dropped on \nHiroshima by the Enola Gay on August 6. After delivering its fateful \ncargo, the Indianapolis then reported to the naval station at Guam for \nfurther orders. She was ordered to join the battleship U.S.S. Idaho in \nthe Philippines to prepare for the invasion of Japan.\n  It was at Guam that the series of events ultimately leading to the \nsinking of the Indianapolis began to unfold. Hostilities in this part \nof the Pacific had long since ceased. The Japanese surface fleet was no \nlonger considered a likely threat, and attention instead had turned \n1,000 miles to the north where preparations were underway for the \ninvasion of the Japanese mainland. These conditions led to a relaxed \nstate of alert on the part of those who decided to send the \nIndianapolis across the Philippine Sea unescorted, and consequently, \nCaptain McVay's orders to ``zigzag at his discretion.'' Zigzagging is a \nnaval maneuver used to avoid torpedo attack, generally considered most \neffective once the torpedoes have been launched.\n\n  The Indianapolis, unescorted, departed Guam for the Philippines on \nJuly 28. Just after midnight on 30 July 1945, midway between Guam and \nthe Leyte Gulf, she was hit by two torpedoes fired by the ``I-58,'' a \nJapanese submarine. The first blew away the bow, the second struck near \nmid-ship on the starboard side adjacent to a fuel tank and a powder \nmagazine. The resulting explosion split the ship in two.\n  Of the 1,196 men aboard, about 900 escaped the sinking ship and made \nit into the water in the twelve minutes before she sank. Few life rafts \nwere released. Shark attacks began at sunrise on the first day, and \ncontinued until the men were physically removed from the water, almost \nfive days later.\n  Shortly after 11:00 A.M. of the fourth day, the survivors were \naccidentally discovered by an American bomber on routine antisubmarine \npatrol. A patrolling seaplane was dispatched to lend assistance and \nreport. En route to the scene the pilot overflew the destroyer U.S.S. \nCecil Doyle ( DD-368), and alerted her captain to the emergency. The \ncaptain of the Doyle, on his own authority, decided to divert to the \nscene.\n  Arriving hours ahead of the Doyle, the seaplane's crew began dropping \nrubber rafts and supplies. While doing so, they observed men being \nattacked by sharks. Disregarding standing orders not to land at sea, \nthe plane landed and began taxiing to pick up the stragglers and lone \nswimmers who were at greatest risk of shark attack.\n  As darkness fell, the crew of the seaplane waited for help to arrive, \nall the while continuing to seek out and pull nearly dead men from the \nwater. When the plane's fuselage was full, survivors were tied to the \nwing with parachute cord. The plane's crew rescued 56 men that day.\n  The Cecil Doyle was the first vessel on the scene, and began taking \nsurvivors aboard. Disregarding the safety of his own vessel, the \nDoyle's captain pointed his largest searchlight into the night sky to \nserve as a beacon for other rescue vessels. This beacon was the first \nindication to the survivors that their prayers had been answered. Help \nhad at last arrived.\n  Of the 900 who made it into the water only 317 remained alive. After \nalmost five days of constant shark attacks, starvation, terrible \nthirst, and suffering from exposure and their wounds, the men of the \nIndianapolis were at last rescued from the sea.\n  Curiously, the Navy withheld the news of the sunken ship from the \nAmerican people for two weeks, until the day the Japanese surrendered \non August 15, 1945, thus insuring minimum press coverage for the story \nof the Indianapolis' loss.\n  Also suspicious, conceding that they were ``starting the proceedings \nwithout having available all the necessary data,'' less than two weeks \nafter the sinking of the Indianapolis, before the sinking of the ship \nhad even been announced to the public, the Navy opened an official \nboard of inquiry to investigate Captain McVay and his actions. The \nboard recommended a general court-martial for McVay.\n  Admiral Nimitz, Commander in Chief of Pacific Command, did not \nagree--he wrote the Navy's Judge Advocate General that at worst McVay \nwas guilty of an error in judgment, but not gross negligence worthy of \ncourt-martial. Nimitz recommended a letter of reprimand.\n  Overriding both Nimitz and Admiral Raymond Spruance who commanded the \nFifth Fleet, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal and Admiral Ernest \nKing, Chief of Naval Operations, directed that court-martial \nproceedings against Captain McVay proceed.\n  Captain McVay was notified of the pending court-martial, but not told \nwhat specific charges would be brought against him. The reason was \nsimple. The Navy had not yet decided what to\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\ncharge him with. Four days before the trial began they did decide on \ntwo charges: the first, failing to issue orders to abandon ship in a \ntimely fashion; and the second, hazarding his vessel by failing to \nzigzag during good visibility.\n  It's difficult to understand why the Navy brought the first charge \nagainst McVay. Explosions from the torpedo attacks had knocked out the \nship's communications system, making it impossible to give an abandon \nship order to the crew except by word of mouth, which McVay had done. \nHe was ultimately found not guilty on this count.\n  That left the second charge of failing to zigzag. Perhaps the most \negregious aspect however, was in the phrasing of the charge itself. The \nphrase was ``during good visibility.'' According to all accounts of the \nsurvivors, including written accounts only recently declassified and \nnot made available to McVay's defense at the trial, the visibility that \nnight was severely limited with heavy cloud cover. This is pertinent \nfor two reasons. First, no Navy directives in force at that time or \nsince recommended, much less ordered, zigzagging at night in poor \nvisibility. Secondly, as Admiral Nimitz pointed out, the rule requiring \nzigzagging would not have applied in any event, since McVay's orders \ngave him discretion on that matter and thus took precedence over all \nother orders. Thus, when he stopped zigzagging, he was simply \nexercising his command authority in accordance with Navy directives. \nUnbelievably, this point was never made by McVay's defense counsel \nduring the subsequent court-martial.\n  Captain McVay was ultimately found guilty on the charge of failing to \nzigzag, and was discharged from the Navy with a ruined career. In 1946, \nat the specific request of Admiral Nimitz who had become Chief of Naval \nOperations, Secretary Forrestal, in a partial admission of injustice, \nremitted McVay's sentence and restored him to duty. But, Captain \nMcVay's court-martial, and personal culpability for the sinking of \nthe Indianapolis continued to stain his Navy records. The stigma of his \nconviction remained with him always, and he ultimately took his own \nlife in 1968. To this day Captain McVay is recorded in history as \nnegligent in the deaths of 870 sailors.\n\n  We need to restore the reputation of this honorable officer. In the \ndecades since World War II, the crew of the Indianapolis has worked \ntirelessly in defending their Captain, and trying to ensure that his \nmemory is properly honored. It is at the specific request of the \nsurvivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis that I introduce this resolution.\n  Since McVay's court-martial, a number of factors, including once \nclassified documents not made available to McVay's defense, have \nsurfaced raising significant questions about the justice of the \nconviction.\n  Although naval authorities at Guam knew that on July 24, four days \nbefore the Indianapolis departed for Leyte, the destroyer escort U.S.S. \nUnderhill had been sunk by a Japanese submarine within range of the \nIndianapolis' path, McVay was not told.\n  Although a code-breaking system called ULTRA had alerted naval \nintelligence that a Japanese submarine (the I-58, which ultimately sank \nthe Indianapolis) was operating in his path, McVay was not told. \nClassified as top secret until the early 1990s, this intelligence--and \nthe fact it was withheld from McVay before he sailed from Guam--was \nsuppressed during his court-martial.\n  Although the routing officer at Guam was aware of the ULTRA \nintelligence report, he said a destroyer escort for the Indianapolis \nwas ``not necessary'' and, unbelievably, testified at McVay's court-\nmartial that the risk of submarine attack along the Indianapolis' route \n``was very slight''.\n  Although McVay was told of ``submarine sightings'' along his path, he \nwas told none had been confirmed. Such sightings were commonplace \nthroughout the war and were generally ignored by Navy commanders unless \nconfirmed. Thus, the Indianapolis set sail for Leyte on July 26, 1945, \nsent into harm's way with its captain unaware of dangers which shore-\nbased naval personnel know were in his path.\n  The U.S.S. Indianapolis was not equipped with submarine detection \nequipment, and therefore Captain McVay requested a destroyer escort. \nAlthough no capital ship without submarine detection devices had sailed \nbetween Guam and the Philippines without a destroyer escort throughout \nall of World War II, McVay's request for such an escort was denied.\n  The Navy failed to notice when the ship did not show up in port in \nthe Philippines. U.S. authorities intercepted a message from the I-58 \nto its headquarters in Japan informing them that it had sunk the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis. This message was ignored and the Navy did not initiate a \nsearch. The Indianapolis transmitted three distress calls before it \nsank, and one was received at the naval base in the Philippines. Again, \nno search was initiated and no effort was made to locate any survivors. \nIt was not until four days after the ship had sunk, when a bomber \ninadvertently spotted sailors being eaten by sharks in the water below, \nthat a search party was dispatched.\n\n  Although 700 navy ships were lost in combat in World War II, McVay \nwas the only captain to be court-martialed as the result of a sunken \nship.\n  Captain McVay was denied both his first choice of defense counsel and \na delay to develop his defense. His counsel, a line officer with no \ntrial experience, had only four days to prepare his case.\n  Incredibly, the Navy brought Mochitura Hashimoto, the commander of \nthe Japanese I-58 submarine that sunk the Indianapolis to testify at \nthe court-martial. Hashimoto testified that just after midnight the \nclouds cleared long enough to see and fire upon the Indianapolis. He \nalso implied in pretrial statements that zigzagging would not have \nsaved the Indianapolis because of his clear view, but this point was \nnot raised by McVay's defense during the trial itself.\n  Another witness in the trial, veteran Navy submariner Glynn Donaho, a \nfour-time Navy Cross winner was asked by McVay's defense counsel \nwhether ``it would have been more or less difficult for you to attain \nthe proper firing position'' if the Indianapolis had been zigzagging \nunder the conditions which existed that night. His answer was, ``No, \nnot as long as I could see the target.'' This testimony was either \ndeliberately ignored by, or passed over the heads of, the court-martial \nboard, and it was not pursued further by McVay's defense.\n  Many of the survivors of the Indianapolis believe that a decision to \nconvict McVay was made before his court-martial began. They are \nconvinced McVay was made a scapegoat to hide the mistakes of others. \nMcVay was court-martialed and convicted of ``hazarding his ship by \nfailing to zigzag'' despite overwhelming evidence that the Navy itself \nhad placed the ship in harm's way, despite testimony from the Japanese \nsubmarine commander that zigzagging would have made no difference, \ndespite the fact that although 700 Navy ships were lost in combat in \nWorld War II McVay was the only captain to be court-martialed, and \ndespite the fact the Navy did not notice when the Indianapolis failed \nto arrive on schedule, thus costing hundreds of lives unnecessarily and \ncreating the greatest sea disaster in the history of the United States \nNavy.\n  The resolution I am introducing corrects a 54 year old injustice, \nrestores the honorable name of a decorated Navy combat veteran, and \nhonors the wishes of his loyal and faithful crew. It will also honor \nthe crew of the Indianapolis for their courage in surviving this awful \ntragedy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and I am proud to \noffer it on behalf of Captain McVay and the wonderful and honorable men \nof the U.S.S. Indianapolis, two of whom are sitting with us in the \ngallery today, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will certainly yield to the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to first commend the Senator from New \nHampshire. I was visited in my office by a gentleman named Michael \nKuryla, Jr., of Poplar Grove, IL, one of the survivors of the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis. He recounted to me in detail what happened when that ship \nwent down. As he talked about being in the ocean for days, not knowing \nwhether they would be rescued, watching his shipmates who were \nliterally dying around him\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\nand being devoured by sharks, wondering if they would ever be rescued, \ntears came to his eyes. More than 50 years after, tears came to his \neyes. He said it wasn't fair, what they did to Captain McVay; to court-\nmartial him was wrong. He asked me for my help, if I would join the \nSenator from New Hampshire on this resolution, and I am happy to do so.\n  I think justice cries out that we agree to this resolution; that \nCaptain McVay, who was singled out, out of all the captains of the \nfleet, to be court-martialed under these circumstances is just unfair. \nThe men who served under him, those whose lives were under his care and \nthose who survived this worst sea disaster in U.S. naval history--they \nhave come forward. They have asked us to make sure that history \nproperly records the contribution Captain McVay made to his country.\n  I am happy to join in this resolution. I hope other Members of the \nSenate, hearing this debate and reading this resolution, will cosponsor \nit as well and that we can close the right way this chapter in American \nnaval history.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the roster of the final crew of the \nU.S.S. Indianapolis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         The Final Crew of the U.S.S. ``Indianapolis'' (CA-35)\n\n\n                           Crew and Officers\n\n       ABBOTT, George S., S1.

Mr. SPECTER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 34\n\n       Whereas many of the individuals who served in the Armed \n     Forces and in civilian roles in Vietnam during the Vietnam \n     War have since died, in part as the result of illnesses and \n     conditions associated with service in Vietnam during that \n     war;\n       Whereas these men and women, whose ultimate health \n     conditions had a basis in their service in Vietnam during the \n     Vietnam War, sacrificed their lives for their country in a \n     very real sense;\n       Whereas under criteria established by the Department of \n     Defense, the deaths of these men and women do not qualify as \n     Vietnam War deaths;\n       Whereas under Department guidelines, these men and women \n     also do not meet the criteria for eligibility to have their \n     names inscribed on the Memorial Wall of the Vietnam Veterans \n     Memorial in the District of Columbia;\n       Whereas ``In Memory'' Day was established several years ago \n     in order to honor the Americans who gave their lives in \n     service to their country as a result of service in Vietnam \n     but had not otherwise been honored for doing so;\n       Whereas ``In Memory'' Day is now a project of the Vietnam \n     Veterans Memorial Fund;\n       Whereas to date 633 Americans have met the criteria for \n     eligibility to be honored by the ``In Memory'' Program; and\n       Whereas the Americans who have been named by the ``In \n     Memory'' Program are honored each year during a ceremony at \n     the Vietnam Veterans Memorial: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that ``In \n     Memory'' Day should be observed on the third Monday in April \n     each year, the day on which Patriots Day is also observed, in \n     honor of the men and women of the United States whose deaths \n     had a basis in their service in Vietnam during the Vietnam \n     War and who are thereby true examples to the Nation of \n     patriotism and sacrifice.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I submit a concurrent resolution \nwhich would express the Sense of the Congress that the third Monday in \nApril be designated ``In Memory Day.'' In Memory Day will be a time for \nfamily and friends to gather and commemorate the supreme sacrifice made \nby their loved ones as their names are read from the In Memory Honor \nRoll at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, as was done most recently on \nApril 19, 1999. I feel this to be a small yet fitting tribute to those \nwhose lives were ultimately claimed by the war in Vietnam.\n  The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a solemn reminder that the defense \nof liberty is not without loss. The 58,214 servicemembers who gave \ntheir lives in Vietnam will forever be memorialized in a most fitting \nmanner. Their names, inscribed in granite walls, symbolize the reality \nthat our nation's military personnel protects America behind walls \nbuilt with the blood of patriots. We must keep them in our memory \nalways.\n  Not all of those who died, however, are commemorated on the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial. Unaccounted for are those succumbed to the ravages \nof psychological wounds upon their return home. Unaccounted for are all \nthose who died after war's end, yet whose deaths were intrinsically \nlinked to wartime service.

Mr. President, I rise today to promote awareness of \nmissing children and honor those who selflessly work to search and \nrescue the thousands of children who disappear each year. As my \ncolleagues may know, today is recognized as ``National Missing \nChildren's Day.''\n  According to a recent U.S. Department of Justice study, annually \nthere\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\nare over 114,000 attempted abductions of children by nonfamily members, \n4,500 child abductions reported to police, and 438,200 children who are \nlost, injured, or otherwise missing. These numbers are truly cause for \nconcern by all Americans.\n  As a parent, I believe local communities, schools, faith-based \norganizations and law enforcement should be encouraged to work together \nto protect the most vulnerable members of our society--children. From a \nfederal perspective, I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation to \nreauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \nthe Runaway and Homeless Youth Program through the next five years. The \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children operates under a \nCongressional mandate and works in conjunction with the U.S. Department \nof Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice on Delinquency Prevention. I \nknow my colleagues would agree that the Center has an outstanding \nrecord of safely recovering missing children across the country, and \nmost recently achieved a 91 percent recovery rate.\n  Mr. President, as we remember the many missing children across the \nnation today, I want to especially recognize the relentless work and \neffort to protect our nation's children by Minnesota's Jacob Wetterling \nFoundation. The Foundation was established by Jerry and Patty \nWetterling after their son, Jacob, was abducted by a masked man at \ngunpoint near the Wetterling home in St. Joseph, Minnesota. Today, the \nJacob Wetterling Foundation is a national, non-profit foundation \ncommitted to preventing the exploitation of children through educating, \nraising awareness and responding to families who are victims of \nabduction.\n  Mr. President, our children represent our future and we must continue \nour work to keep them safe. Again, I commend the numerous volunteers, \norganizations, and government agencies who all work on a daily basis to \nfind missing children and prevent others from disappearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/25/senate-section/article/S5975-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RUTH A.

As a mentor and teacher, Ruth has trained a \ngeneration of mental health professionals with the same devotion she \nhas brought to her clinical work.

Since then, WMR has sent food, medical equipment, and \nsupplies throughout the United States and to over 120 countries. In \n1966, WMR began a monthly prescription program that still exists today, \nproviding medicine to elderly poor in the Detroit area.\n  Mrs. Auberlin received over 60 awards and commendations, including \nThe President's Volunteer Action Award and Silver Medal, presented to \nher by President Reagan.\n  On behalf of the residents of Michigan, the United States, and \nelsewhere, I want to thank Irene for all that she did to help those in \nneed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/25/senate-section/article/S5975-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5975-S5976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS IN MARYLAND\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that ten \nelementary schools throughout Maryland have been named Blue Ribbon \nSchool Award winners by the United States Department of Education. \nThese schools are among only 266 elementary schools nationwide to be \nhonored with this award, the most prestigious national school \nrecognition for public and private schools.\n  The designation as a Blue Ribbon School is a ringing endorsement of \nthe successful techniques which enable the students of these schools to \nsucceed and achieve. Over the past few years, I have made a commitment \nto visit the Blue Ribbon Schools and have always been delighted to see \nfirst hand the interaction between parents, teachers, and the \ncommunity, which strongly contributed to the success of the school. I \nlook forward to visiting each of these ten schools and congratulating \nthe students, teachers and staff personally for this exceptional \naccomplishment.\n  According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbon Schools have \nbeen judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, state and \nnational goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence \nthat are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of \nthe next century. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools which have \nstrong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared \nby all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging, \nup-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe \nenvironment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to family \ninvolvement; evidence that the school helps all students achieve high \nstandards; and a commitment to share the best practices with other \nschools.\n  After a screening process by each State Department of Education, the \nDepartment of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nand the Council for American Private Education, the Blue Ribbon School \nnominations were forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. A panel \nof outstanding educators from around the country then reviewed the \nnominations, selected schools for site visits, and made recommendations \nto Secretary of Education Richard Riley.\n  The ten winning Maryland elementary schools are as follows:\n  Ashburton Elementary School, located in Bethesda, is home to 515 \nstudents and 64 staff members which provide for a richly diverse school \ncommunity with an exemplary record of student achievement and an \noutstanding academic program. This award also credits the SHINE \nProgram--Successful, Helpful, Imaginative, Neighborly, and \nEnthusiastic--with recognizing students who participate positively in \nthe school community.\n  Brook Grove Elementary School, located in Olney, not only has a \ncommendable academic strategy, but also is recognized as a school that \nencourages excellence in the arts and in athletics, and values \nindividuality and diversity as critical to the well-being of the \nstudent body.\n  Our Lady of Mercy School is a co-educational Catholic school in \nPotomac that combines traditions of academic excellence, intellectual \ncuriosity and fundamental moral and religious values in a successful \nprogram that has almost half of its 283 students meeting the criteria \nof giftedness set by the Institute for the Academic Advancement of \nYouth.\n  Oak Hill Elementary School, the most culturally and economically \ndiverse school in the Severna Park area, prioritizes parental \ninvolvement in the successful pursuit of quality education for its \nstudents. The concept of the ``Oak Hill School Family'' aims to provide \na safe and nurturing school environment, a strong academic program and \na philosophy that encourages community involvement.\n  Salem Avenue Elementary School, located in Hagerstown, has made great \nstrides in the last decade and, as a leader in Washington County, is a \nschool of many ``firsts,'' including being the first Title 1 school to \nreceive a satisfactory or excellent rating in all areas of the Maryland \nSchool Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP);\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\nthe first elementary school to be named a Blue Ribbon School; the first \nto create and appoint the position of Curriculum Coordinator; and the \nfirst to be named a National Distinguished School.\n  Templeton Elementary School, located in Riverdale, is an award \nwinning Prince George's County school which has made dramatic gains on \nthe Maryland School Performance Assessment Program (MSPAP). Templeton's \nmission is to provide its diverse student body with the knowledge and \nskills to be productive members of society.\n  Vienna Elementary School, located in Vienna, is a small, rural school \nwhich draws from a large geographical area and is an integral part of \nthe community. With virtually no staff turnover and a strong School \nImprovement Team, students, staff and parents form a close-knit \ncommunity and serve as a model in the district for student achievement, \nstaff commitment and participatory leadership, including development of \ncharacter and ethical judgment.\n  West Annapolis Elementary School, situated in downtown Annapolis, was \nused as an example by the Maryland State Department of Education for \ntwo videotapes highlighting outstanding teachers. This award also \ncredits West Annapolis' belief in the importance of a united school \ncommunity as evident in its concept of TEAM/excellence which works to \nimprove the teaching and learning environment in which students can \nexcel.\n  The Summit School is a non-profit school that was created 10 years \nago to promote literacy and school success among children with unique \neducational needs, namely bright students that are disabled readers. \nSummit, located in Edgewater, enables students to come to understand \ntheir own unique learning styles by identifying their strengths and \nweaknesses through a variety of individualized strategies.\n  The Trinity School, located in Ellicott City is an independent, co-ed \nCatholic school that was designated as an Exemplary School by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education in 1990.

Mr. President, Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman and Chief \nExecutive Officer of Capital One Financial Corporation, delivered \nremarks at the Virginia Chamber of Commerce Congressional Dinner last \nmonth. Capital One, headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, is one of \nthe fastest growing private employers in my state. Mr. Fairbank's \nremarks offered invaluable insight into the challenges and \nopportunities the technology revolution is producing in both the \nprivate and public sectors, and I ask that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n     Remarks by Richard D. Fairbank, Virginia Chamber of Commerce \n                  Congressional Dinner, April 29, 1999\n\n       Members of Congress, distinguished guests, ladies and \n     gentlemen. Let me first take the opportunity to thank the \n     Virginia Chamber for supporting Virginia's business \n     community. It is an honor to join you this evening to share a \n     bit of the Capital One story and give you my thoughts about \n     the challenges facing the Virginia business community as we \n     move into the 21st Century.\n       First, a comment about Virginia. What a wonderful state we \n     live in! I am reminded of that everyday. The irony is, \n     Virginia was not where I was supposed to live. I grew up in \n     California, and thought I would always live in California. \n     When I graduated from business school, I applied only to \n     California firms, except for one company in D.C., and only \n     because they were just about to start a San Francisco office. \n     When my wife and I came out here, we fell in love with \n     Virginia, and never went to that San Francisco office. So now \n     we've been Virginians for 18 years, and we're here to stay. \n     My wife and I and our four children live right here in \n     Fairfax County.\n       And our larger family--our COF family--now numbers 8,000 \n     associates in Virginia--in Richmond, Chesterfield, \n     Fredericksburg and Northern Virginia. Virginians have a \n     wonderful blend of Southern charm and tradition mixed with a \n     very positive spirit that believes in possibility. It's a \n     magical combination. It's made Virginia a great home for COF. \n     Capital One's growth has at times surpassed our capacity to \n     hire here in Virginia, so we have expanded into Florida, \n     Texas, Washington State, Massachusetts and the UK. But our \n     first choice is always to grow as much as we can right here \n     at home. Just last year, we added 3,500 new jobs here in \n     Virginia. This year we've announced we're adding another \n     3,000 new jobs in Virginia, but truth be told, we'll probably \n     exceed that number significantly.\n       Tonight I've been asked to talk about how the business \n     world is changing, using Capital One as an example. I think \n     the story of Capital One is a story of what happens when a \n     band of believers fixates on a vision of how the world is \n     changing, and pours everything they have into getting there. \n     Today, Capital One is one of the fastest growing companies in \n     the country. But it wasn't always that way. In fact if you \n     had asked anyone 12 years ago to bet even one dime on Nigel \n     Morris and myself and the dream we had, you wouldn't have \n     found many takers. I know that for a fact. Because we were \n     out there asking. And they weren't taking.\n       Our dream was this. We believed information technology \n     could revolutionize the way marketing is done. The most basic \n     truth of marketing is that every person has unique needs and \n     wants. Yet from the beginning, companies have tended to \n     respond to those needs with a one-size fits-all approach, \n     because they can't accommodate the unique needs of thousands \n     or millions of customers. But we saw the possibility to \n     change all that. To use technology and scientific testing to \n     deliver the right product to the right customer at the right \n     time and at the right price--a strategy we call mass \n     customization. And we saw the credit card as a perfect \n     candidate for this strategy. Ten years ago, virtually every \n     credit card in the U.S. was priced at 19.8 percent interest \n     rate with a $20 fee. Yet people varied widely in their \n     default risk, their financial circumstances and their needs.\n       Our dream was to build a high-tech information-based \n     marketing company to change all that. The problem was we had \n     no money and no experience in the credit card business. We \n     needed a sponsor. So, Nigel and I embarked on a national \n     journey to every financial institution that would talk to us. \n     The good news is that we got audiences with the top \n     management of 20 of the top 25 banks in America. The bad news \n     is that every one of them rejected it. But finally, a year \n     into our journey, we found a sponsor right here in our \n     backyard. Signet Bank in Richmond.\n       And so Capital One was born. For years we worked to build \n     the business, to build the technology and operations to \n     customize decision-making at the individual account level. \n     Four years into it, we still had no success. Yet Signet never \n     lost faith, despite nearly going under themselves with real \n     estate loan problems. Finally, we cracked the code of mass \n     customizing credit cards. And in 1992 we launched credit \n     cards at dramatically lower prices for consumers with good \n     credit. And we've never looked back.\n       Today we have thousands of product variations for our \n     customers. Including products like our Miles One card that \n     gives mileage credit on any airline, with no blackout period, \n     and with a 9.9 percent fixed interest rate. We can price this \n     low because we use technology and information to make sure \n     that our low-risk customers don't have to subsidize high-risk \n     customers. By 1994, we had grown to 6 million customers. \n     Signet Bank spun off Capital One, and we became a fully \n     independent company.\n       But our dream was just beginning. Because we never defined \n     ourselves as a credit card company. We're a technology-based \n     marketing company. So, we have taken this very same strategy \n     and expanded into other financial products like deposits, \n     installment loans and auto loans. We've also taken our \n     strategy internationally to the UK and Canada so far. And, we \n     even entered the telecommunications industry, creating a \n     company called America One, where we are marketing wireless \n     phones. While everyone else markets wireless phones through \n     stores, we are selling direct, tailoring each offer to our \n     customers' needs. The strategy appears to be working. We are \n     now in 41 states. And America One is now the largest direct \n     marketer of wireless phones in the U.S. Our next frontier at \n     Capital One is the Internet, which is a perfect medium for \n     our strategy of information-based mass customization. We are \n     mobilizing a major effort to be a big player in the Internet. \n     So from credit cards to wireless phones, from the U.S. to the \n     UK, and from the mailbox to the Internet, we've been able to \n     keep the growth going at Capital One. We now have 18 million \n     customers, and are growing by 15,000 customers a day.\n       Capital One's success in many ways has come simply from \n     understanding and embracing the inexorable implications of \n     the technology revolution. First, that marketing will be \n     revolutionized. And second, that technology is changing the \n     leverage of the human mind. This insight has massive \n     implications for human resources. One hundred years ago, in \n     factories and farms, the smartest or most educated workers \n     were not necessarily the most productive. But the computer \n     and the Internet can take the human\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\n     mind to a quantum new level. In the technology age, the key \n     asset in a company is its knowledge capital.\n       And to us, this meant that our greatest imperative is \n     recruiting and developing incredibly talented workers. If \n     there's one thing that is talked about the most and delivered \n     upon the least, it is this--recruiting the best people. At \n     Capital One, we have made it the number one corporate \n     imperative. In fact, I believe that the single biggest reason \n     for Capital One's success is a totally fanatical commitment \n     to recruiting. It is the most important job for every \n     executive and manager in the company. The average executive \n     at Capital One spends about one full day a week recruiting. \n     It's an incredible commitment. Our future depends on it.\n       So that's the Capital One story. I believe that many of the \n     things I've said about Capital One have direct relevance to \n     Virginia and its challenges. Like Capital One, Virginia is \n     enjoying exceptional growth, fueled significantly by being a \n     leader in technology. The good news is that the entire \n     Commonwealth is benefiting from the booming economy. It seems \n     that economic expansions are announced every week in \n     Virginia. But Virginia cannot rest on its laurels. While \n     Virginia has done a good job at attracting high quality, high \n     salaried jobs providing unprecedented opportunities for all \n     Virginians, we continue to face many challenges that need \n     attention from both our political and business leaders. Let \n     me mention just a few . . .\n       The greatest challenge for Virginia's rapidly growing \n     companies is to attract and retain the most talented \n     employees who have the technical skills to lead our \n     businesses into the 21st century. There are nearly 25,000 \n     unfilled technology related jobs in Northern Virginia alone \n     and the Department of Commerce predicts that nearly every new \n     job created from now on will require some level of technology \n     expertise. This poses the greatest threat to Virginia's \n     economic growth.\n       We must start with quality education. Virginia already has \n     world-class institutions of higher learning, and I am pleased \n     that Capital One is tapped into this talent. Many companies, \n     such as ours, are partnering with our university system to \n     help design curriculum and training for a multitude of jobs. \n     We also offer a full tuition reimbursement plan to every one \n     of our 11,000 associates to encourage them to seek continuing \n     education. Also, to help address our acute shortage of \n     technology workers, we offer our non-technical associates the \n     opportunity to be retrained and shifted into one of our many \n     unfilled technology jobs. I am pleased that many of our \n     associates have taken us up on these opportunities.\n       But Capital One can't get there from here simply by \n     training and developing our associates. It certainly will not \n     meet our long-term needs. We need to recruit on a massive \n     scale. Simply put, Virginia's universities are not producing \n     enough technology graduates to meet the demands of companies \n     like Capital One. This forces companies to look elsewhere to \n     meet their needs for technology workers. And elsewhere \n     includes overseas. Nations like India and China are producing \n     many more engineering and technology degrees than the United \n     States. Many of the leading technology companies are building \n     massive programming shops in those countries, sending the \n     programming specifications from the US. We need to reverse \n     that trend and work with our universities to produce more \n     technology graduates here at home.\n       However, this will not happen overnight. In the interim, in \n     order to meet our current needs, our immigration policies \n     must be flexible. Congress provided a small measure of help \n     last year by raising the cap on H1-B visas thereby allowing \n     more high tech workers from outside the United States to come \n     into the country. Clearly, this is a step in the right \n     direction. But, much more must be done if we are going to \n     meet the needs of Virginia's growing high-tech industry.\n       Growing up in the San Francisco mid-peninsula, I witnessed \n     firsthand the development of Silicon Valley--now the \n     technology capital of the world. The same thing can happen \n     here. We are well underway. In fact, the Internet revolution \n     has its roots in Virginia. Virginia is already the home to \n     more than 2,500 technology businesses that employ more than \n     250,000 people. It includes AOL, UUNET, and P-S-I Net. With \n     more than half the Internet traffic flowing through Virginia, \n     we must continue to expand on our reputation as a technology \n     center and the Internet hub of the United States. Let's build \n     upon our fast start.\n       While Virginia owns the infrastructure of the Internet, \n     with the exception of AOL and a few others, we do not have a \n     major presence in marketing e-commerce. That means more dot/\n     com companies. YAHOO!, Amazon.com, EBAY, Charles Schwab and \n     most other leading e-commerce firms are not located here in \n     Virginia. These businesses are redefining retail channels--\n     and we must make certain that Virginia cultivates and \n     attracts these types of companies. We need to be more than \n     the infrastructure backbone of the Internet. The growth of e-\n     commerce is just beginning. And already, it is affecting \n     everyone, everywhere, everyday. Business will never be the \n     same again.\n       And new economic realities lead to new political realities. \n     Our public policies must give this new technology and way of \n     doing business time to develop. For example, as the Internet \n     revolution is exploding, some have suggested that we create \n     taxes on Internet transactions. I believe that would be a big \n     mistake. I know that Governor Gilmore is currently leading a \n     Commission studying Internet taxation issues on the national \n     level. Their decisions can have a lot of impact on a rapidly \n     growing industry still in its infancy. With sound \n     legislation, such as the Internet Tax Freedom Act, companies \n     are better positioned to grow and attract consumers into this \n     new business channel.\n       All these new technologies also bring a need to act \n     responsibly with our customers' information. Information is \n     the lifeblood of companies like Capital One, who use it to \n     tailor products for the individual consumer at the best \n     possible price. It's why we have been able to help bring down \n     the cost of credit cards and other products--and simplify the \n     process of obtaining them. The same is true for the Richmond-\n     based grocery store UKROPS, Geico, EBAY and thousands of \n     other companies. We must find a balance between the clear \n     economic benefits that derive from access to information and \n     the responsibility we all owe to our customers to safeguard \n     their personal information. Companies need to lead the way. \n     Like many companies, Capital One has developed a \n     comprehensive privacy policy to ensure that our customers' \n     personal information is used appropriately with very clear \n     limitations. While we must be vigilant about consumers' \n     privacy, I believe that restrictive legislation in this area \n     would turn back the clock and actually hurt consumers.\n       We also must be prepared to meet the basic day-to-day \n     demands that a fast-growing economy will place on Virginia \n     and its communities. While technology and e-commerce are \n     making the world a smaller place, the reality is that people \n     will still need to get to work. With a booming national \n     economy and low unemployment, our workers have choices. If \n     they cannot get to and from their places of employment, these \n     highly skilled individuals will relocate. You can read the \n     survey results or simply talk to your employees: \n     transportation is most often cited as the number one quality-\n     of-life issue by most working people, especially here in \n     Northern Virginia. Thanks to the hard work of the Virginia \n     Delegation more Federal dollars are flowing to Virginia than \n     ever before for transportation. We must continue to work \n     together to address this issue.\n       So those are a few of my thoughts of the biggest challenges \n     and opportunities we face as we move into the 21st century. \n     The world is changing so fast, it's hard to make sense of it \n     all, and to know where we all fit in. We can't predict the \n     future. But, I believe that one can identify a few trends \n     that are absolutely inexorable. The story of Capital One is \n     an example of doing that. The key for Capital One has been to \n     see a few of those inexorable trends and try to get there \n     first. No matter what it took. Whether or not we had the \n     skills or market portion to make it happen. Because we had \n     destiny on our side.\n       Many people and many companies and many politicians don't \n     think this way. They tend to think incrementally. That's a \n     risky cause of action in a world that's changing so fast. \n     Virginia is in a great position to the lead the way into the \n     21st century. Let's make sure we think big and do what it \n     takes to get there. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/25/senate-section/article/S5978-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n               MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S.J.
