Mr. President, I urge the Senate to reject the motion to \ninvoke cloture on this flawed legislation. For three years, proponents \nand opponents of this so-called Bankruptcy Reform Act have disagreed \nabout the merits of the bill. The credit card industry argues that the \nbill will eliminate fraud and abuse without denying bankruptcy relief \nto Americans who truly need it.\n  But scores of bankruptcy scholars, advocates for women and children, \nlabor unions, consumer advocates, and civil rights organizations \nbelieve that the current bill is so flawed that it will do far more \nharm than good.\n  Every Member of the Senate must analyze these arguments closely and \nseparate the myths from the facts. I believe a fair analysis leads to \nthe conclusion that this bankruptcy bill is the credit industry's wish \nlist to increase its profits at the expense of working families.\n  Proponents of the bankruptcy legislation argue that the current bill \nis an appropriate response to the bankruptcy crisis. But the facts \nindicate the opposite. The crisis is overstated, if it exists at all, \nand is no justification for this sweetheart deal for the credit card \nindustry.\n  For several years, bankruptcy filings were on the rise. But current \ndata reflect a decrease in filings. The so-called bankruptcy crisis has \nreversed itself--without congressional assistance. According to a \nreport last month, the personal bankruptcy rate dropped by more than 9 \npercent in 1999, and continued to decline at a greater than 6 percent \nannual rate in the first nine months of this year. Bankruptcies are now \nat substantially lower levels than in 1997, 1998, or 1999. There have \nbeen 138,000 fewer personal bankruptcies in the current year than \nduring the corresponding period of 1998, a cumulative two-year decline \nof over 15 percent.\n  This decline in personal bankruptcies is consistent with the view \nheld by leading economists--the bankruptcy crisis is correcting itself. \nA harsh bankruptcy bill is unnecessary.\n  Supporters of the bill also argue that we need tough new legislation \nto eliminate fraud and abuse in the bankruptcy system and to instill \nresponsibility in debtors. The argument sounds good, but it masks the \ntruth about this excessively harsh and punitive bill.\n  The current bill is based on biased studies that have been bought and \npaid for by industry dollars and an industry public relations campaign \nthat unfairly characterizes the plight of honest Americans. Supporters \nof a bankruptcy overhaul initially relied on a Credit Research Center \nreport in 1997, which estimated that 30 percent of Chapter 7 debtors in \nthe sample could pay at least 21 percent of their debts. But, as the \nCongressional General Accounting Office responded, ``the methods used \nin the Center's analysis do not provide a sound basis for generalizing \nthe Center report's findings to the . . . national population of \npersonal bankruptcy filings.''\n  VISA U.S.A. and MasterCard International funded several additional \nstudies. One study determined that losses due to personal bankruptcies \nin 1997 totaled more than $44 billion. This study appears to be the \nsource of the creditor rhetoric that bankruptcy imposes a hidden tax on \neach American family of $400 every year. But once again, the GAO \nconcluded that the study's findings are shaky--at best. As the GAO \nstated, ``we believe the report's estimates of creditor losses and \nbankruptcy system costs should be interpreted with caution.''\n  The most recent and unbiased study--completed by the Executive Office \nfor the U.S. Trustees--concluded that ``only a small percentage of \ncurrent Chapter 7 debtors have the ability to pay any portion of their \nunsecured debts.'' That's consistent with the conclusion reached by \nothers, including Time magazine, which reported that by the time \nindividuals and families file for bankruptcy protection, more than 20 \npercent of their income before taxes is being used to pay interest and \nfees on their debts. The article goes on to say that ``The notion that \ndebtors in bankruptcy court are sitting on many billions of dollars \nthat they could turn over to their creditors is a figment of the \nimagination of lenders and lawmakers.''\n  We know the specific circumstances and market forces that so often \npush middle class Americans into bankruptcy.\n  We know that in recent years, the rising economic tide has not lifted \nall boats. Despite low unemployment, a soaring stock market, and large \nbudget surpluses, Wall Street cheers when companies--eager to improve \nprofits by down-sizing--lay off workers in large numbers. In 1998, \nlayoffs were reported around the country in almost every industry--\n9,000 jobs were lost after the Exxon-Mobil merger--5,500 jobs were lost \nafter Deutsche Bank acquired Bankers Trust--Boeing laid off 9,000 \nworkers--Johnson & Johnson laid off 4,100. Kodak has cut 30,000 jobs \nsince the 1980s and 6,300 just since 1997.\n  Often, when workers lose a good job, they are unable to recover. In a \nstudy of displaced workers in the early 1990s, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics reported that only about one-quarter of these laid-off \nworkers were working at full-time jobs paying as much as or more than \nthey had earned at the job they lost. Too often, laid-off workers are \nforced to accept part-time jobs, temporary jobs, or jobs with fewer \nbenefits or no benefits at all.\n  Divorce rates have soared over the past 40 years. For better or \nworse, more couples are separating, and the financial consequences are \nparticularly devastating for women. Divorced women are four times more \nlikely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. In \n1999, 540,000 women who head their own households filed for bankruptcy \nto try to stabilize their economic lives. 200,000 of them were also \ncreditors trying to collect child support or alimony. The rest were \ndebtors struggling to make ends meet. This bankruptcy bill is anti-\nwoman, and this Republican Congress should be ashamed of its attempt to \nenact it into law.\n  Another major factor in bankruptcy is the high cost of health care. \n43 million Americans have no health insurance, and many millions more \nare under-insured. Each year, millions of families spend more than 20 \npercent of their income on medical care, and older Americans are hit \nparticularly hard. A 1998 CRS Report states that even though Medicare \nprovides near-universal health coverage for older Americans, half of \nthis age group spend 14 percent or more of their after-tax income on \nhealth costs, including insurance premiums, co-payments and \nprescription drugs.\n\n  These are the individuals and families from whom the credit card \nindustry believes it can squeeze another dime. The industry claims that \nthese individuals and families are cheating and abusing the bankruptcy \nsystem, and that are irresponsibly using their charge cards to live in \nluxury they can't afford.\n  These working Americans are not cheats and frauds--but they do \ncomprise the vast number of Americans in bankruptcy. Two out of every \nthree bankruptcy filers have an employment problem. One out of every \nfive bankruptcy filers has a health care problem. Divorced or separated \npeople are three times more likely than married couples to file for \nbankruptcy. Working men and women in economic free fall often have no \nchoice except bankruptcy. Yet this Republican Congress is bent on \ndenying them that safety net.\n  This legislation unfairly targets middle class and poor families--and \nit\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\nleaves flagrant abuses in place. Time and time again, President Clinton \nhas told the Republican leadership that the final bill must included \ntwo important provisions--a homestead provision without loopholes for \nthe wealthy, and a provision that requires accountability and \nresponsibility from those who unlawfully--and often violently--bar \naccess to legal health services. The current bill includes neither of \nthese provisions.\n  The conference report does include a half-hearted, loop-hole filled \nhomestead provision. It will do little to eliminate fraud. With a \nlittle planning--or in some cases, no planning at all--wealthy debtors \nwill be able to hide millions in assets from their creditors. For \nexample, Allen Smith of Delaware--a state with no homestead exemption--\nand James Villa of Florida--a state with an unlimited homestead \nexemption--were treated differently by the bankruptcy system. One man \neventually lost his home. The other was able to hide $1.4 million from \nhis creditors by purchasing a luxury mansion in Florida.\n  The Senate passed a worthwhile amendment to eliminate this inequity, \nbut that provision was stripped from the conference report. Surely, a \nbill designed to end fraud and abuse should include a loop-hole free \nhomestead provision. The President thinks so. As an October 12, 2000 \nletter from White House Chief of Staff John Podesta says, ``The \ninclusion of a provision limiting to some degree a wealthy debtor's \ncapacity to shift assets before bankruptcy into a home in a state with \nan unlimited homestead exemption does not ameliorate the glaring \nomission of a real homestead cap.''\n  Yet there is no outcry from our Republican colleagues about the \ninjustice, fraud, and abuse in these cases. In fact, Governor Bush led \nthe fight in Texas to see that rich cheats trying to escape their \ncreditors can hide their assets under Texas' unlimited homestead law.\n  In 1999, the Texas legislature adopted a measure to opt-out of any \nhomestead restrictions passed by Congress. The legislature also \nexpanded the urban homestead protection to 10 acres. It allowed the \nhomestead to be rented out and still qualify as a homestead. It even \nsaid that a homestead could be a place of business. This provision \ngives the phrase ``home, sweet home'' new and unfair meaning.\n  The homestead loop-hole should be closed permanently. It should not \nbe left open just for the wealthy. I wish this misguided bill's \nsupporters would fight for such a responsible provision with the same \nintensity they are fighting for the credit card industry's wish list, \nand fighting against women, against the sick, against laid-off workers, \nand against other average individuals and families who will have no \nsafety net if this unjust bill passes.\n  This legislation flunks the test of fairness. It is a bill designed \nto meet the needs of one of the most profitable industries in America--\nthe credit card industry. Credit card companies are vigorously engaged \nin massive and unseemly nation-wide campaigns, to hook unsuspecting \ncitizens on credit card debt. They sent out 2.87 billion--2.87 \nbillion--credit card solicitations in 1999. And, in recent years, they \nhave begun to offer new lines of credit targeted at people with low \nincomes--people they know cannot afford to pile up credit card debt.\n  Supporters of the bill argue that the bankruptcy bill isn't a credit \ncard industry bill. They argue that we had votes on credit card \nlegislation and some amendments passed and others did not. But, to deal \neffectively and comprehensively with the problem of bankruptcy, we have \nto address the problem of debt. We must ensure that the credit card \nindustry doesn't abandon fair lending policies to fatten its bottom \nline and ask Congress to become its federal debt collector.\n  Two years ago, the Senate passed good credit card disclosure \nprovisions that added some balance to the bankruptcy bill. It's \ndisturbing that the provisions in the bill passed by the Senate this \nyear were watered down to pacify the credit card industry. Even worse, \nsome of the provisions passed by the Senate were stripped from the \nconference report.\n  The hypocrisy of this bill is transparent. We hear a lot of pious \nRepublican talk about the need for responsibility when average families \nare in financial trouble, but we hear no such talk of responsibility \nwhen the wealthy credit card companies and their lobbyists are the \nfocus of attention.\n  The credit card industry and congressional supporters of the bill \nattempt to argue that the bankruptcy bill will help--not harm--women \nand children. That argument is laughable.\n  Proponents of the bill say that it ensures that alimony and child \nsupport will be the number one priority in bankruptcy. That rhetoric \nmasks the complexity of the bankruptcy system--but it doesn't hide the \nfact that women and children will be the losers if this bill becomes \nlaw.\n  Under current law, an ex-wife trying to collect support enjoys \nspecial protection. But under the pending bills, credit card companies \nare given a new right to compete with women and children for the \nhusband's limited income after bankruptcy.\n  It is true that the bill moves support payments to the first priority \nposition in the bankruptcy code. But that only matters in the limited \nnumber of cases in which the debtor has assets to distribute to a \ncreditor. In most cases--over 95 percent--there are no assets, and the \nlist of priorities has no effect.\n\n  The claim of ``first priority'' is a sham to conceal the real \nproblem--the competition for resources after bankruptcy. This \nlegislation creates a new category of debt that cannot be discharged \nafter bankruptcy--credit card debt. It will, therefore, create intense \ncompetition for the former husband's limited income. Under current law, \nhe can devote his post-bankruptcy income to meeting his basic \nresponsibilities, including his student loans, his tax liability, and \nhis support payments for his former wife and their children. But if \nthis bill becomes law, one of his so-called ``basic'' responsibilities \nwill be a new one--to Visa and MasterCard. We all know what happens \nwhen women and children are forced to compete with these sophisticated \nlenders-- they always lose.\n  As thirty-one organizations that support women and children have \nsaid, ``Some improvements were made in the domestic support provisions \nin the Judiciary Committee . . . however, even the revised provisions \nfail to solve the problems created by the rest of the bill, which gives \nmany other creditors greater claims--both during and after bankruptcy--\nthan they have under current law.''\n  In addition, as 91--91--bankruptcy and commercial law professors \nwrote, ``Granting `first priority' to alimony and support claims is not \nthe magic solution the consumer credit industry claims because \n`priority' is relevant only for distributions made to creditors in the \nbankruptcy case itself. Such distributions are made in only a \nnegligible percentage of cases. More than 95% of bankruptcy cases make \nno distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to \ndistribute. Granting women and children first priority for bankruptcy \ndistributions permits them to stand first in line to collect nothing.''\n  Based on the discredited bankruptcy studies, creditors also argue \nthat ``no one will be denied bankruptcy protection. The ten percent of \nfilers with the highest incomes and the lowest relative debt would be \nrequired to repay a portion of what they owed and the balance would be \ndischarged, just as it is under current law.'' That's another credit \ncard industry myth.\n  There is no doubt that this legislation will be harmful to working \nfamilies who have fallen on hard times--families like those described \nin a Time magazine article earlier this year.\n  That article discussed the financial difficulties of the Trapp \nfamily, whom I had the privilege of meeting several months ago. They \nare not wealthy cheats trying to escape from their financial \nresponsibilities. They are a middle class family engulfed in debt, \nbecause of circumstances beyond their control. Like half of all \nAmericans who file for bankruptcy, the Trapp family had massive medical \nexpenses--over $124,000 in doctors' bills that their insurance didn't \ncover.\n  The plight of the Trapp family is similar to that of many other \nAmerican families with serious illness and injury. The combination of a \nmajor medical problem and a job loss pushed Maxean Bowen--a single \nmother--into bankruptcy. She was a social worker in\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\nthe foster-care system in New York City when she developed a painful \ncondition in both feet that made her job, which required house calls, \nimpossible. As a result, she had to give up her work and go on the \nunemployment rolls. Her income fell by 50 percent. She had to borrow \nfrom relatives, and she used her credit cards to make ends meet. Like \nso many others in similar situations, she believed that she would soon \nrecover and be able to pay her debts. But, like thousands who file for \nbankruptcy, even when Maxean was able to work again, she owed far more \nthan she could repay.\n  Maxean tried paying her creditors a few hundred dollars when \npossible, but it wasn't enough to keep her bills from piling up because \nof interest charges and late-payment fees. She said she was ``going \ncrazy.''\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that Maxean Bowen, Charles and Lisa \nTrapp, and others featured in the Time magazine article wouldn't be \nsubject to the harsh provisions in the bankruptcy bill before us today. \nBut, although the conference report now includes a ``means test safe \nharbor'' for the poorest families, a careful, objective analysis \ndemonstrates that all Americans would be affected by the provisions in \nthe bill.\n  For example, proponents of the bill argue that the Trapp family would \nnot be affected by the means test because their current income is below \nthe state median income. That's not true. Before Mrs. Trapp left her \njob, the family's annual income was $83,000 a year or $6,900 a month. \nUnder the bill, the Trapp family's previous six months' income would be \naveraged, so that they would have an assumed monthly income of about \n$6,200--above the state median--even though their actual monthly gross \nincome at the time of filing was $4,800.\n  Based on the fictitious income assumed by the bankruptcy legislation, \nthe Trapp family would be subject to the means test. And the means test \nformula--using the IRS standards--would assume that the Trapps have the \nability to repay more than their actual income would allow.\n  Similarly, although the safe harbor provision would protect Maxean \nBowen from the means test, other substantive and procedural provisions \nin the bill would apply to her. Maxean didn't have the money to pay her \nbankruptcy attorney and had to obtain financial assistance from \nrelatives. If this legislation becomes law, the new requirements may \nmake bankruptcy relief prohibitive.\n  The individuals and families featured in the article are well aware \nof the distortions and misrepresentations of their cases by defenders \nof this harsh Republican bill and by apologists for the credit card \nindustry. The outraged response by these debtors is eloquent and \npowerful. As they have emphatically replied,\n\n       During the last year, each of us declared bankruptcy. It \n     was one of the most difficult decisions any of us had to \n     make, coming at the darkest hours in our lives. We saw \n     no other way to stabilize our economic situations. Each of \n     our families is now on the long path of trying to right \n     ourselves financially . . . We have read the statements \n     you have made about our cases on the floor of the Senate \n     and in Mr. Gekas' letter to Time. We deeply resent the \n     fact that you have misrepresented our cases to the \n     American public. Contrary to what you have stated, each of \n     us would have been severely affected by your bankruptcy \n     bill.\n\n  Finally, proponents of the bill argue that it will help small \nbusinesses. Again, this is another credit card industry myth.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, business \nbankruptcies represented 2.9 percent of all filings in 1999. Since June \n1996, those filings have declined by over 30 percent--30 percent. The \nrelatively low number of business bankruptcy filings and the fact that \nfilings are decreasing indicate that drastic changes in the law are \nunnecessary.\n  This bankruptcy reform bill isn't based on any serious business need. \nIn fact, its overhaul of Chapter 11 will hurt--rather than help--small \nbusinesses. Chapter 11 was enacted to serve the interests of business \ndebtors, creditors, and the other constituencies affected by business \nfailures--particularly the employees. A principal goal of Chapter 11 is \nto encourage business reorganization in order to preserve jobs. \nSupporters of the bill ride roughshod over this important goal. They \ncreate more hurdles, additional costs, and a rigid, inflexible \nstructure for small businesses in bankruptcy. As a result, fewer small \nbusiness creditors will be paid, and more jobs will be lost.\n  This fundamental defect led AFL-CIO President John Sweeney to write, \n``The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000 is an attack on working families. \nIt will undermine a critical safety net for both families and \nfinancially vulnerable businesses and their workers. Businesses filing \nbankruptcy cases would be required to follow stringent new rules which \ncreate significant substantive and procedural barriers to \nreorganization and therefore place jobs at risk. Costly, unnecessary, \nand inflexible procedures will increase the risk that small businesses \nwill be unable to reorganize. The bill also threatens jobs in \nsignificant real estate enterprises and retailers.''\n  As I mentioned earlier, a large number of professors of bankruptcy \nand commercial law across the country have written to us to condemn \nthis bill and to urge the Senate not to approve it. As their letter \neloquently states in its conclusion:\n\n       These facts are unassailable: H.R. 2415 forces women to \n     compete with sophisticated creditors to collect alimony and \n     child support after bankruptcy. H.R. 2415 makes it harder for \n     women to declare bankruptcy when they are in financial \n     trouble. H.R. 2415 fails to close the glaring homestead \n     loophole and permits wealthy debtors to hide assets from \n     their creditors. We implore you to look beyond the distorted \n     ``facts'' peddled by the credit industry. Please do not pass \n     a bill that will hurt vulnerable Americans, including women \n     and children.\n\n  It is clear that the bill before us is designed to increase the \nprofits of the credit card industry at the expense of working families. \nIf it becomes law, the effects will be devastating. The Senate should \nreject this defective bankruptcy bill and the cynical attempt by the \nRepublican leadership to pass it on the last day of this Congress. This \nbill is bad legislation. It eminently deserves the veto it will receive \nif it passes.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this cloture motion, and to reject this \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the 91 law \nprofessors I mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 30, 2000.\n\n      Re: The Bankruptcy Reform Act Conference Report (H.R. 2415)\n\n       Dear Senators: We are professors of bankruptcy and \n     commercial law. We have been following the bankruptcy reform \n     process with keen interest. The 91 undersigned professors \n     come from every region of the country and from all major \n     political parties. We are not a partisan, organized group, \n     and we have no agenda. Our exclusive interest is to seek the \n     enactment of a fair and just bankruptcy law, with appropriate \n     regard given to the interests of debtors and creditors alike. \n     Many of us have written before to express our concerns about \n     the bankruptcy legislation, and we write again as yet another \n     version of the bill comes before you. This bill is deeply \n     flawed, and we hope the Senate will not act on it in the \n     closing minutes of this session.\n       In a letter to you dated September 7, 1999, 82 professors \n     of bankruptcy law from across the country expressed their \n     grave concerns about some of the provisions of S. 625, \n     particularly the effects of the bill on women and children. \n     We wrote again on November 2, 1999, to reiterate our \n     concerns. We write yet again to bring the same message; the \n     problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been resolved, \n     particularly those provisions that adversely affect women and \n     children.\n       Notwithstanding the unsupported claims of the bill's \n     proponents, H.R. 2415 does not help women and children. \n     Thirty-one organizations devoted exclusively to promoting the \n     best interests of women and children continue to oppose the \n     pending bankruptcy bill. The concerns expressed in our \n     earlier letters showing how S. 625 would hurt women and \n     children have not been resolved. Indeed, they have not even \n     been addressed.\n       First, one of the biggest problems the bill presents for \n     women and children was stated in the September 7, 1999, \n     letter: ``Women and children as creditors will have to \n     compete with powerful creditors to collect their claims after \n     bankruptcy.''\n       This increased competition for women and children will come \n     from many quarters: from powerful credit card issuers, whose \n     credit card claims increasingly will be excepted from \n     discharge and remain legal obligations of the debtor after \n     bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have an easier \n     time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally could be \n     discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold security, \n     even when the alleged collateral is virtually worthless. None \n     of the changes made to S. 625 and none being proposed in H.R. \n     2415 addresses these\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\n     problems. The truth remains: if H.R. 2415 is enacted in its \n     current form, women and children will face increased \n     competition in collecting their alimony and support claims \n     after the bankruptcy case is over. We have pointed out this \n     difficulty repeatedly, but no change has been made in the \n     bill to address it.\n       Second, it is a distraction to argue--as do advocates of \n     the bill--that the bill will ``help'' women and children and \n     that it will ``make child support and alimony payments the \n     top priority--no exceptions.'' As the law professors pointed \n     out in the September 7, 1999, letter: ``Giving `first \n     priority' to domestic support obligations does not address \n     the problem.''\n       Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims \n     is not the magic solution the consumer credit industry claims \n     because ``priority'' is relevant only for distributions made \n     to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. Such \n     distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of \n     cases. More than 95% of bankruptcy cases make NO \n     distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to \n     distribute. Granting women and children a first priority for \n     bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand first in line \n     to collect nothing.\n       Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-\n     husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child \n     support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy \n     position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--\n     taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit \n     card debt and other consumer credit share that position, \n     thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their \n     own behalf. The credit industry carefully avoids discussing \n     the increased post-bankruptcy competition facing women if \n     H.R. 2415 becomes law. As a matter of public policy, the \n     country should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred \n     position of taxes and child support. Once again, we have \n     pointed out this problem repeatedly, and nothing has been \n     changed in the pending legislation to address it.\n       If addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the \n     thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony \n     and child support after their ex-husband's bankrupticies, we \n     also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a \n     million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy \n     this year alone. As the heads of the economically most \n     vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending \n     legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest \n     demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit \n     industry's own data, they are the poorest. The provisions in \n     this bill, particularly the many provisions that apply \n     without regard to income, will fall hardest on them. Under \n     this bill, a single mother with dependent children who is \n     hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far below the \n     national median income would have her bankruptcy case \n     dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax \n     returns for the past three years--even if those returns are \n     in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who \n     hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be \n     forced to pay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost \n     worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or \n     children's clothes, even if it meant that successful \n     completion of a repayment plan was impossible.\n       Finally, when the Senate passed S. 625, we were hopeful \n     that the final bankruptcy legislation would include a \n     meaningful homestead provision to address flagrant abuse in \n     the bankruptcy system. Instead, the conference report \n     retreats from the concept underlying the Senate-passed \n     homestead amendment.\n       The Homestead provision in the conference report will allow \n     wealthy debtors to hide assets from their creditors.\n       Current bankruptcy law yields to state law to determine \n     what property shall remain exempt from creditor attachment \n     and levy. Homestead exemptions are highly variable by state, \n     and six states (Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Texas, \n     Oklahoma) have literally unlimited exemptions while twenty-\n     two states have exemptions of $10,000 or less. The variation \n     among states leads to two problems--basic inequality and \n     strategic bankruptcy planning. The only solution is a dollar \n     cap on the homestead exemption. Although variation among \n     states would remain, the most outrageous abuses--those in the \n     multi-million dollar category--would be eliminated.\n       The homestead provision in the conference report does \n     little to address the problem. The legislation only requires \n     a debtor to wait two years after the purchase of the \n     homestead before filing a bankruptcy case. Well-counseled \n     debtors will have no problem timing their bankruptcies or \n     tying-up the courts in litigation to skirt the intent of this \n     provision. The proposed change will remind debtors to buy \n     their property early, but it will not deny anyone with \n     substantial assets a chance to protect property from their \n     creditors. Furthermore, debtors who are long-time residents \n     of states like Texas and Florida will continue to enjoy a \n     homestead exemption that can shield literally millions of \n     dollars in value.\n       These facts are unassailable: H.R. 2415 forces women to \n     compete with sophisticated creditors to collect alimony and \n     child support after bankruptcy. H.R. 2415 makes it harder for \n     women to declare bankruptcy when they are in financial \n     trouble. H.R. 2415 fails to close the glaring homestead \n     loophole and permits wealthy debtors to hide assets from \n     their creditors. We implore you to look beyond the distorted \n     ``facts'' peddled by the credit industry. Please do not pass \n     a bill that will hurt vulnerable Americans, including women \n     and children.\n           Thank you for your consideration.\n         Peter A.

Mr. President, we are about to vote on cloture on the \nbankruptcy bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  The conference committee that produced this Bankruptcy Conference \nReport had an even 3-3 ratio. Obviously with this ratio, Democrats on \nthe conference held an absolute veto over the bankruptcy bill. But here \nwe are voting on a conference report that has the support of conferees \non both sides of the aisle.\n  What's at stake with this vote?\n  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against bankruptcy \nprotections for family farmers.\n  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against targeted capital \ngains tax relief for family farmers in bankruptcy.\n  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against a ``Patients' \nBill of Rights'' for residents of bankrupt nursing homes.\n  If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against provisions that \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Larry \nSummers say are crucial for protecting our financial markets.\n  There's a lot at stake with this vote. Let's vote for farmers. Let's \nvote for a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' for residents of bankrupt \nnursing homes. Let's vote to protect our financial markets. Let's vote \nto protect our prosperity.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are ready to proceed to the vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11450-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--Resumed\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I oppose H.R. 4986, the FSC Repeal \nand Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. Unfortunately, this \nlegislation is an example of corporate welfare. Further, it does not \nadequately change the old Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) program to \nprevent disputes with the European Union.\n  I am concerned that this legislation is an example of the costly \ncorporate welfare that cripples our ability to respond to truly urgent \nsocial needs such as health care, education, and national security. The \nFSC benefits many major U.S. corporations, including General Electric, \nBoeing, Motorola, Caterpillar, Allied Signal, and Cisco Systems. In \naddition, the FSC also helps foreign firms, like Rolls Royce, that have \nplants located in America. However, few of these benefits actually \ntrickle down to help the American worker. Instead, as the Congressional \nBudget Office points out, ``many FSCs are largely paper corporations \nwith very few employees.'' On February 24, 2000, the Appellate Body of \nthe World Trade Organization upheld a decision that this provision is \nan export subsidy and violates our WTO obligations.\n  This pending legislation is the third version of an export subsidy \nthat was first introduced as the Domestic International Sales \nCorporation provision in the Revenue Act of 1971. However, this version \nof the bill does little to change the effects of the FSC, and actually \nmakes it a bigger corporate giveaway. This legislation technically \neliminates the FSC, but then replaces it with a new extraterritorial \ntax system that essentially maintains the current subsidy. In addition, \nthis new scheme expands the subsidy to include full benefits for \ndefense contractors and extends benefits to agricultural cooperatives. \nIn order to meet WTO concerns, this legislation also allows foreign \nfirms greater ability to utilize the FSC. The total cost of rewriting \nand expanding the FSC subsidy will cost the American taxpayers $42 \nbillion between 2001 and 2010--all of which will come out of the \nsurplus.\n  There is also extensive evidence that this export subsidy does not \nwork very well. In a recent report, the Congressional Research Service \nstates that the FSC increased the quantity of U.S. exports by a range \nof two-tenths of one percent to four-tenths of one percent. This report \nalso states that ``traditional economic analysis indicates that FSC \nreduces overall U.S. economic welfare.'' The CBO agrees that ``export \nsubsidies, such as FSCs, reduce global economic welfare and typically \neven reduce the welfare of the country granting the subsidy, even \nthough domestic export-producing industries benefit.'' CBO also points \nout that FSCs increase both imports and exports, due to the effects of \nexport subsidies on foreign exchange rates. This ``beggar-thy-\nneighbor'' effect will actually cause U.S. domestic companies in \nimport-competing industries to reduce domestic investment and \nemployment.\n  Finally, there is no assurance that this system actually fixes the \nproblem. The European Union has agreed to wait until November, before \nannouncing a $4 billion list of retaliatory tariffs against the FSC \nsubsidy. However, they have not agreed to the actual changes in this \nlegislation. The EU still has concerns about provisions in this \nlegislation that grandfather the FSC, and they intend to have it \nreviewed by the WTO. It is fair to expect that we will end up debating \nthis issue again within the next two years. It makes more sense for the \nSenate to eliminate the FSC completely in line with our obligations to \nthe WTO.\n  Mr. President, our country is now in a position where we can begin \npaying down the national debt. Every American shoulders somewhere in \nthe range of $19,000 in federal debt, because of the fiscal \nirresponsibility of their elected officials. I would like to make it \nclear that I remain a staunch supporter of free trade and open markets. \nHowever, if we intend to support a free trade regime that helps \nAmerican consumers and taxpayers, we must not continue our policy of \ngiving large corporations and special interests giant export subsidies.\n  This FSC legislation is simply an unnecessary federal subsidy that \ndoes not provide a fair return to the taxpayers who bear the heavy \nburden of its cost. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, \nand instead examine the prospect of completely eliminating the FSC \nsubsidy.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the legislation before \nus today on Foreign Sales Corporations, FSC. However, I really object \nto the fact that we even have to address the issue of the FSC during \nthis session of Congress.\n  The European Union, despite rhetoric in support for the WTO, is \ntaking action after action that raises real doubt about their \ncommitment. Let's quickly review the history that brought us to this \nplace today.\n  The United States created the DISC in the early 1970s. Given the \ndifferent nature of the U.S. and the European tax systems, the purpose \nwas to put American exporters on an equal footing with their European \ncompetitors. In the 1980s, in response to a negative finding at the \nGATT, we replaced it with the FSC to make it GATT-compatible. The \nEuropeans accepted this alteration.\n  Fast forward to the 1990s. The EU lost cases to the United States on \nbeef hormones and on bananas. These were difficult issues for Europe. \nYet, the EU did not seek a negotiated solution. Nor did they try to \ntake corrective action. Instead, the EU used every legal and procedural \ntrick in the GATT and WTO book to weasel out. They lost at every turn. \nThis behavior of the EU, honoring the letter of the WTO while ignoring \nits spirit, is inappropriate and irresponsible. The EU should be a \nleader in ensuring that the credibility and integrity of the WTO \nprocess is maintained. They shouldn't be taking cheap legal dodges. Why \nshould other WTO members comply promptly with WTO decisions if the EU \nthumbs its nose at the system?\n  Finally, the EU could no longer delay and circumvent implementation \nof these WTO decisions. The U.S. retaliates. Then, all of a sudden, we \nfind ourselves challenged at the WTO on FSC. As far as I know, European \ncompanies did not beat a path to EU headquarters in Brussels insisting \nthat they take us on over the FSC. Trade ministers in European capitals \ndid not rush to Brussels with demands to file this case against us. \nRather, the EU bureaucrats, angry at having lost two important cases to \nthe United States, were going to fight back. So, we end up with the FSC \ncase, and another example of the EU undermining the global trade \nsystem.\n  Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Stu Eizenstadt has done yeoman's \nwork in trying to resolve this problem. The legislation before us is \nthe fruit of\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\nhis labor. And we should all thank him for working so hard, with so \nmany diverse interests, to craft a solution. Yet, from Europe, all we \nhave heard is a series of denunciations. An insistence that this \nlegislation violates the WTO. An apparent eagerness to move ahead with \na massive multi-billion dollar retaliation list against the United \nStates. What a travesty!\n  I support this change in our law. And I express my appreciation to \nthe other Senators who have allowed this legislation to move forward \nunder unanimous consent, despite their interest in offering amendments \nto the bill. But I also call on the political leadership in Europe to \nstep back and look at what their representatives in Brussels are doing. \nPlease reflect on the danger to the integrity of the WTO of the actions \nthat your EU bureaucrats have taken.\n  The committee amendments were withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 4356) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 4986), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this bill passed by the Senate satisfies the \nUnited States' WTO obligations and ensures that U.S. companies will \ncompete on a level playing field in the global marketplace.\n  By enacting this legislation, we will avoid a needless trade dispute, \nprotect the American economy, and satisfy our international obligations \nto our trading partners. This bill also represents a continuation of \nthis Senate's outstanding record of accomplishment in promoting free \ntrade. This legislation is the third significant piece of trade \nlegislation passed by the Senate this year. I believe you would have to \nsearch long and hard to find a better record of trade legislation.\n  I don't believe it is necessary to go through the extended history of \nthe dispute between the United States and the European Union that gave \nrise to the need for the bill before us. The bill represents a good \nfaith attempt to comply with the WTO's ruling that the current FSC \nprovisions constitute an illegal export subsidy. This bill withdraws \nthe current FSC provisions and, in their place, makes fundamental \nadjustments to the Internal Revenue Code that incorporate territorial \nfeatures akin to those of several European tax systems. The bill not \nonly addresses the specific concerns raised by the WTO, it also takes \ninto account the comments received from the EU in the course of \nconsultations over the last eight months.\n  I want to stress the need to pass this bill. Failure to do so could \nresult in the imposition of retaliatory duties against American exports \nto the European Union. Under the WTO rules, the EU will have the right \nto retaliate against U.S. exports as of today unless this legislation \nis passed. A failure to enact this legislation would prove costly for \nthe American worker, the American farmer, and for American business.\n  So it is with a great sense of satisfaction that we pass this bill \ntoday. I compliment the Senate on its farsighted vote for passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to address the comprehensive \ntax and Medicare conference report that is pending before the Senate. \nWe have worked long and hard on this package, but the result is \ncertainly worth the effort. If our objective is to provide legislation \nthat promotes an environment conducive to jobs, opportunity and \ngrowth--security for our families and retirees--and greater access to \nquality health care, then this is a package worthy of praise.\n  The numerous provisions in this legislation are too many to address \nin a single floor statement, and they certainly cover a lot of \nimportant initiatives. But they have a central theme: strengthening \nindividuals and famiies--increasing prosperity, building security in \nretirement, promoting access to health care, improving quality of life, \nand assisting small businesses and farmers.\n  This legislation offers over 50 provisions to strengthen IRAs and \npension plans. With broad bipartisan support, it increases IRA \ncontributions from $2,000 to $5,000, and allows a $1,500 IRA catch-up \ncontribution for those age 50 and above. The increase in the amount an \nindividual is allowed to put away will enable IRA participants to earn \na full $1 million more for retirement, if they save the maximum amount \neach year and begin their program at age 25.\n  This is tremendous empowerment, Mr. President, but it is only the \nbeginning of what this legislation will do. It also allows individuals \nto increase contribution limits in 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans from \n$10,500 to $15,000 a year. And it allows employees over the age of 50 \nto make additional $5,000 contributions to these plans.\n  This is especially important for women, many of whom take time off \nfrom work to raise children. Now, when they return, they can make \ncritical catch-up payments to strengthen their retirement savings. And \nfor those individuals who change jobs, this legislation provides easier \ntransfers to be made between IRAs and employer plans, and it reduces \nthe complexity of plan administration.\n  One of the most innovative new tools provided in this legislation is \nthe creation of the Roth 401(k). Like the Roth IRA, the Roth 401(k) \nwill allow employees to make after-tax contributions to accounts where \ndistributions will be tax free at retirement. This allows investment \nincome to grow faster, as it is taxed only once--when it is earned. \nInterest build-up and withdrawal--like the Roth IRA--remain free from \ntaxation.\n  To increase access to quality health care, this legislation includes \nmajor refinements to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. These are in \naddition to $27 billion worth of refinements enacted last year, as part \nof the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. This legislation offers \nimproved benefits for Medicare seniors, expanding preventative \nbenefits, lowering out-of-pocket outpatient costs, and covering several \nnew exams, screening and therapies.\n  Going even further, this legislation provides improved access to \nMedigap coverage and protects access to important drugs. It lowers out-\nof-pocket hospital costs, strengthens rural, teaching, and critical \naccess hospitals, and protects funding for home health services. It \nalso increases access to care for nursing home patients. In the area of \nhealth care, alone, this legislation provides more than $30 billion in \nadditional funding over the next five years.\n  Retired Americans will also be happy to note that this legislation \nfixes a math mistake made in computing the Social Security cost-of-\nliving adjustment for last year. The increase should have been 2.5% \ninstead of the 2.4% that was actually awarded. The correction we've \nincluded in this bill means seniors will be receiving more than $5 \nbillion in additional payments over the next ten years.\n  For children, we take an important step to strengthen the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program by establishing policies for the \nretention and redistribution of unspent SCHIP funds. We also include \nmeasures to begin to protect the financial integrity of the Medicaid \nprogram. For individuals and families, we provide an above-the-line \ndeduction for payment of medical insurance premiums for those who do \nnot participate in an employer-sponsored medical plan.\n  We also provide an above-the-line deduction for long-term care \ninsurance, and we allow individuals who incur long-term care expenses \nproviding for relatives an extra tax deduction.\n  To help our family farmers and small businesses, this legislation \noffers a 100% deduction for payment of medical insurance for self-\nemployed individuals. It creates FFARM accounts--tax-deferred savings \naccounts for farmers and fishermen, allowing a deduction of up to 20% \nof the income deposited into a custodial account.\n  Going even further to provide tax relief for small businesses, this \nlegislation extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. It allows small \nbusinesses to use cash accounting methods without limitation, and \nclarifies and extends a number of expansion provisions and business \ndeductions, including the business meal deduction. And these are only a \nfew of many other provisions to support America's small businesses, the \nengine behind the historic economic expansion our nation enjoys.\n  Again, increasing opportunity and improving the quality of life is \nwhat this legislation is all about. For this reason, we have also \nincluded an important provision to help AMTRAK\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\nbuild important infrastructure, to improve services, and help answer \ncritical transportation needs throughout the country. There are some \nareas, Mr. President, where congestion from auto and air traffic are \nrunning at maximum levels. The answer is a modernized and efficient \nrail service--one that includes high-speed trains, not only to move \npassengers along the Eastern corridor, but all across America.\n  As a New York Times editorial correctly observed: ``Eighteen of the \n20 most congested airports nationwide are in cities on designated high-\nspeed rail corridors. The time has come for Congress and transportation \nofficials to promote high-speed rail service as a means alleviating air \ntraffic congestion.''\n  Strengthening AMTRAK will not only help ease car and air congestion, \nbut it will also help revitalize inner cities, encouraging downtown \nredevelopment. It will also promote jobs in construction, engineering, \nmanufacturing, and service industries.\n  Finally, Mr. President, to strengthen our urban areas and promote \ngreater opportunity for individuals and families in our cities, this \nlegislation creates 40 new ``renewal communities'' and gives those poor \nareas a number of tax incentives to assist them in building up their \neconomic base. Among other things, these communities--located in urban \nand rural areas--would get a zero percent capital gains rate to attract \nmuch needed investments. This bill also provides incentives to invest \nin low income areas around the country and to clean up brownfields \nanywhere in the U.S. This community renewal package also contains long \nawaited increases in the low income housing tax credit and the private \nactivity bond volume cap. Both of these caps have not been adjusted \nsince 1986 and have lost over 40 percent of their original value. This \npackage also contains a number of measures to help school renovation \nand construction.\n  Each of the provisions in this legislation will go far toward \npromoting an environment of opportunity and growth--security for our \nfamilies and retirees--greater access to quality health care, and an \nimproved quality of life.\n  Mr. President, as we consider this conference report on legislation \nto provide tax relief and to protect and strengthen Medicare and \nMedicaid, there is a lot of talk about the irregular process by which \nthe legislation was created. No one is more unhappy than I that regular \norder was not adhered to. I have long labored in trying to reach a \nbipartisan consensus on the many important matters that comes before \nthe Finance Committee.\n  However, I do not believe it useful for me to dwell on the causes of \nirregular order. Suffice it to say that cooperation must come from both \nsides. When it doesn't, when Senators instead invoke their rights at \nevery turn, bipartisanship suffers.\n  As to the President's veto threat, it should be remembered that our \nearly Presidents believed that the veto was available only to check the \nCongress from going beyond its constitutional authority. Later \nPresidents judged legislation on the whole of its merits: does the bill \ndo more harm than good? I find it hard to find in his letter any \nmention of the harm he sees in this legislation. Rather, he says that \nthis legislation is different from what he proposed, and therefore, he \nhas ``no choice but to veto it.'' I find this assertion somewhat \nremarkable.\n  The Congress and the Presidency are comprised of 536 individuals. In \nfashioning legislation as far-reaching as this, no one can expect \nperfection from his own point of view. When I read the President's list \nof disappointments, I did not find it any longer than mine. And my \nreaction is generally shared by my colleagues. We are all pleased by \nsome items. We are all disappointed by some other items, or by their \nomission.\n  That is because, Mr. President, this legislation is bipartisan in its \ncontent. Republican Members may be displeased that we included school \nconstruction bonds or dropped the FUTA tax reduction. Democrats may be \ndispleased that we included a tax break for employees to buy their own \nhealth insurance or that we dropped the low-income savers tax credit. \nBut where there are over a hundred provisions, it is not possible to \nwrite a bill the way each of us might wish.\n  It was clearly our intention to put together a package that would be \nsigned into law. It was my desire that Senator Moynihan be present \nduring House-Senate negotiations, but the House majority objected. So, \ninstead, I kept Senator Moynihan informed, sought his counsel, and \nadvocated his cause.\n  I think he did fairly well. He was successful in garnering increased \nfunding for graduate medical education, increased funding for \nhospitals, increased DSH payments in both Medicare and Medicaid, and--\nthis is very important--a special transition rule for New York with \nrespect to the Medicaid upper payment level issue. On the tax side, he \nsuccessfully obtained the AMTRAK provision to build a train station in \nNew York City. And, as I recall, he was also an advocate of section 809 \nand 815 insurance provisions that have been included in the conference \nreport.\n  Senator Moynihan also asked, as did others, for the inclusion of \nlong-term health care provisions and inclusion of a school-construction \nbond proposal. These were incorporated in a modified form. Perhaps not \na total victory, but a substantial one nevertheless.\n  This progress was not accomplished easily. The chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee has been steadfastly opposed to the creation and \nexpansion of tax credits. Thus he fought the inclusion of several tax \ncredit proposals, including those for AMTRAK and for school \nconstruction.\n  He was able to block several of them but not these two supported by \nthe Senator from New York. And because these provisions were included, \nthe chairman of the Ways and Means opposes this conference report.\n  Some Members have taken to the floor to try to create a picture that \na few of us got in a room and wrote a bill entirely our way. But the \nfact is that some in the room lost and some outside the room won. And \nthat is because, as a group, we had a paramount objective of \nconstructing a balanced bill that would be signed into law.\n  I recall my own effort to remove the application of the \nnondiscrimination clause from the catch-up provision of the retirement \nsecurity title. Everyone in the room agreed with my position. But the \nbill is not written that way. My amendment was dropped out of deference \nto the wishes of a Democrat, Congressman Ben Cardin, who had worked on \nthis legislation in the House.\n  We tried to write a balanced bill that would be signed into law.\n  In each of the past four weeks, there was some reason to believe that \nCongress was about to finish its work for the year. So in drafting this \nbill, we had to act quickly. I have given a great deal of thought to \nthe process employed. I do not believe that if we had had bipartisan \nmeetings with votes on the particular items, the text of the bill would \nbe any different. What was lost in the process followed was any \nbipartisan appreciation of why the text is what it is. That is \nunfortunate.\n  At this stage, all I can ask is that you look at the text and decide \nif this is a good bill. You owe it to your constituents to do that. Do \nyou want to provide Social Security recipients with the increased COLA \nthey deserve? Do you want to protect American businesses from European \nUnion retaliation against our exports? Do you want to update our tax \nlaws to provide for greater retirement security? Do you want to provide \ntax incentives for impoverished communities? Do you want to provide \nmore money for hospitals, hospices, home health, and nursing homes? Do \nyou want to increase the minimum wage?\n  Or do you want to deny all the benefits of this legislation to your \nconstituents because of the procedure by which the text was born?\n  This bill does not contain everything I'd like to see. It's not \nperfect. But it's a good bill, one that will help a great many \nAmericans. It will help individuals and families prepare for greater \nsecurity in retirement. It will help seniors receive improved Medicare \ncoverage and a higher cost-of-living adjustment in their Social \nSecurity checks.\n  It will help small businesses and family farmers. It will improve \neducation and ease traffic congestion. It will improve inner cities and \nhelp our hospitals. These are good objectives. They are objectives \nshared on both sides of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\n  And I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11457-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

And I ask consent, in order to get some fair debate, \nthat the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee be \nrecognized for the first 10 minutes, Senator Wellstone for the second \n10 minutes, Senator Gramm for the third 10 minutes, and Senator Durbin \nfor the fourth 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just do \nso to inquire of the majority leader about the schedule for the \nremainder of the day. It appears that the only remaining legislative \nitem to be taken up today may be the continuing resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I understand it, we do not have an objection to \ntaking up the continuing resolution under a voice vote.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We do have an objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, as we had \ndiscussed, we hope when the House does act within the next, hopefully, \n20 or 30 minutes, we would talk further and make some decisions about \nwhether or not we would want to modify that continuing resolution in \nany way.\n  If we couldn't, of course, then we would see if we could clear it by \na voice vote. We don't have it done yet, but we haven't gotten to that \npoint yet. Within 30 minutes, we hope to get a clarification of when a \nvote would occur or if any modification might be forthcoming.\n  I don't want to go too far beyond just saying that right now. Senator \nDaschle and I are exchanging ideas. I do think we have reached a point \nwhere we need to make some decisions. Senators as well as House Members \nand the administration need to know what to expect. I think, to be \nperfectly honest, nobody wants to step up and say we have to look at an \nalternative. I am prepared to do that. I believe Senator Daschle is \nprepared to join me in that. We ask your indulgence for at east 30 \nminutes, and then we will see what we can do at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the majority leader has, on several \noccasions, noted that this Congress, particularly this session of this \nCongress, has been singular in the number of major trade measures that \nhave been enacted.\n  With the cooperation of the minority leader, with the full support of \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth--who was here just \na moment ago but whose schedule required that he leave as soon as the \nunanimous consent measure was adopted--we have agreed to major trade \nlegislation with sub-Saharan Africa --that entire part of the \ncontinent; to expand the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which is hugely \nimportant in the aftermath of the North American Free Trade Agreement--\nwhich suddenly put island nations and nations on the isthmus below \nMexico at a disadvantage, which no one intended and which we have now \nbeen able to redress in some considerable measure. The permanent normal \ntrade relations with China was one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we have dealt with in a half century in the Congress. And \nwe passed the Tariff Suspension and Trade Act of 2000, granting, among \nother things, permanent normal trade relations to Georgia, just last \nweek.\n  Now as the closing days are at hand, or may be at hand--in any event, \nit is the first of November--we have taken this action by unanimous \nconsent to adopt an amended version of the FSC Repeal and \nExtraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000. That is a long title for \na simple proposition. The World Trade Organization ruled that a measure \nin our Tax Code which has been in place for many years now, the Foreign \nSales Corporation, which gave a tax benefit for income earned \noverseas--it was to encourage overseas sales--was contrary to the World \nTrade Organization rules.\n  I think we do not disagree; when we look at the rules, look at the \nlaw, the ruling was correct. But we had to then change our laws in \norder to give equivalent treatment to American corporations working \noverseas so that they would remain competitive in those markets, but \nwould not be in violation of the WTO rules. If we were not to do that, \nsir, and do it today, we would be subject to $4 billion a year in \ntariff retaliation from the European Union. It had the potential of a \nruinous trade war. We have seen the animosity that arises over bananas. \nHow the United States ever got into the business of exporting bananas, \nI do not know. I think I understand some of the politics involved, but \nthat was unfortunate. But look at how quickly reactions occurred in \nEurope. Just wait, if $4 billion in retaliatory tariffs were to close \noff American access to European markets selectively--the more sensitive \nitems chosen, the greatest damage doable--if that were the disposition \nof the ministers in Brussels, and it might well be.\n  Well, it is not going to happen. We have done this properly. It is no \ncoincidence that the Finance Committee, under the chairmanship of my \nrevered friend from Delaware, Senator Roth, adopted this measure--it is \na House measure, of course--on the same day we passed out the bill to \ngrant China permanent normal trade relations. These are trade matters \nof great importance.\n  We did it. The House and Senate subsequently agreed to a slightly \ndifferent version, which we have adopted today. It will have to go back \nto the House. There will be no problem. The House conferees have \nalready agreed, in the comprehensive tax bill and the Balanced Budget \nRefinement bill, to the exchanges.\n  So it is a good day and a good morning's work. Not every morning do \nwe avoid a trade war. This morning we did. We did not have an hour to \nlose. The deadline was November 1. We often do things at the last \nminute around here. But we often do things well also.\n  I see my friend from Texas is on the floor. I know he would agree \nthat avoiding a trade war over the Foreign Sales Corporation is a very \ngood thing indeed. We have done it this morning with not a moment to \nlose. My friend from Texas will recall the deadline of November 1. And \nit is now November 1. We have done well.\n  I thank Senator Durbin and others who had amendments they wanted to \noffer--Senator Wellstone, Senator Bryan. They had every right to do so, \nand they could have done so. They chose not in the larger interest of \nthe United States. I think we should express our particular gratitude \nto them for their forbearance.\n  I have said my piece. I thank all on behalf of Senator Roth and the \nFinance Committee, which acted unanimously in this regard. We have \ndodged a big bullet. We did it usefully and quickly in the spirit of \ncooperation about trade matters, which will mark this Congress. Perhaps \nwe might even get that fact reported in the press somewhere. If not, we \ncan maybe start a web site of our own. It would be worth it.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesy. I see the assistant \nmajority leader on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \nhis leadership, as well as Senator Roth.\n  This is an area where we have worked in a bipartisan way with the \nadministration. It is important on international trade work. It is \nimportant that we avoid countertariffs that could possibly be enacted. \nI think it is good\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\nnews. I am glad we were able to get it passed. I am glad we could have \nsome bipartisan cooperation. I think in many respects that is due to \nthe leadership of the Senator from New York and the Senator from \nDelaware. I compliment both for their leadership, and I am pleased we \nare able to pass this legislation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am actually going to take about 2 \nminutes. I know Senator Durbin wants to speak.\n  I say to Senator Moynihan from New York that it is an important bill. \nThere were a number of us, however, who objected. I know how strongly \nSenator Moynihan feels about this legislation. I know that this is an \nimportant issue in our trade policy. I want him to know, given the \ntremendous respect I have for him--I think the tremendous respect that \nevery Senator has for him--that for my own part my standing objection \nwas focused not so much on the substance of this legislation. It was \nwhat some of us have been talking about over and over again, which is \nthat the Senate cannot function as a great institution when Senators \nare not allowed to bring amendments to the floor.\n  There are some aspects of this bill that bother me. One of them has \nto do with hundreds of millions of dollars of subsidy for the tobacco \nindustry to peddle tobacco in poor countries and in developing \ncountries, which I think has the consequence of killing children. We \ndon't need to be subsidizing this. Senator Durbin is far more the \nexpert. He can speak more about the substance of it.\n  I wanted to offer an amendment. I wanted to join Senator Durbin with \nan amendment to knock this corporate welfare subsidy to tobacco \ncompanies out.\n  I am also concerned about additional subsidies that go to the \npharmaceutical industry, and, frankly, the doubling of the subsidy that \ngoes to arms exports.\n  The point is that it is hard to be a good Senator and it is hard for \nthe Senate to be a good Senate when we don't have the opportunity to \ncome to the floor with amendments and try to improve a piece of \nlegislation. Senators can vote up or down. I know that Senator Moynihan \nis in favor of this process.\n  I take exception with the majority leader over the way we are doing \nthis. Now we are at the very end of the process, and we certainly don't \nwant to see harsh consequences as a result of this not going through. \nThat is why I won't object.\n  I will listen to the counsel of the Senator from New York. I find his \ncounsel usually to be wise counsel.\n  I hope the Senate will operate differently and that there will be an \nopportunity for Senators to come to the floor with amendments and to be \nlegislators to try to improve policy.\n  I find it outrageous, unconscionable, and egregious that we still \nhave corporate welfare for the tobacco industry to peddle its death \nproducts to other nations and ultimately end up killing young people \nand children. That to me is outrageous.\n  I yield the floor. I yield my time to Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. He \nfeels strongly. And he is right. But there are moments when we just \nhave to get something done and go on to the next measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nWellstone yielded to me the remainder of his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He did, but the order was for the Senator from \nTexas to proceed.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if the Senator from Illinois is going to \ntalk about the issue before us, I would like to grant him the courtesy \nof letting him go ahead and speak. I am going to thank the Senator from \nNew York, as I always do. But I want to speak about another subject. If \nhe wants to talk about this subject, let me yield to him, and if the \nChair will come back to me when he finishes his 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the State of \nTexas. We disagree on substance but we have a cordial relationship on \nthe Senate floor. I thank him for his courtesy.\n  I also congratulate Senator Moynihan for his leadership in the \nclosing months of this session. Senator Moynihan, as he is facing \nretirement, has really been a leader on issues that will have a lasting \nimpact on this world. It has been the hallmark of his congressional and \npublic career. I note in personal conversations with him that he takes \ngreat pride in these accomplishments. I believe they will inure to the \nbenefit of this country for generations to come. I thank him for his \ngreat service to the State of New York and to our Nation throughout his \npublic life.\n  This morning I had an opportunity to object and could have been one, \nI guess, to stop this effort to enact at the last minute this Foreign \nSales Corporation provision. I did not. The decision not to object was \nmade after a lot of deliberation and consideration.\n  I would like to describe the reason why I was prepared to object and \noffer an amendment, and to assure my colleague that they have not heard \nthe end of this debate.\n  This Foreign Sales Corporation provision is a $4 billion annual \nsubsidy to over 7,000 companies in America which export overseas. \nBetween 15 and 30 percent of their income from sales overseas will not \nbe subject to taxes in the United States.\n  That is a windfall to these companies. It is a windfall which gives \nthem an opportunity for more profits and, I argue as well, to create \nmore jobs.\n  In many instances, in my State this Foreign Sales Corporation \nprovision means that some of the major exporters from Illinois and \nacross the United States have a chance to thrive and grow.\n  I am one who is a Democrat and proud of it and proud of my labor \nsupport. But I also believe very passionately that globalization and \nfree trade are the future.\n  If they in fact are the future, we should do everything legally \npossible to encourage export that creates good paying jobs in the \nUnited States. And for that reason, I don't stand in general objection \nto the Foreign Sales Corporation. I believe that what we are talking \nabout in this provision can be good for our economy and our workers, \nand in that respect I can support it. But I do have an objection to one \nelement of it. When you look at the over 7,000 corporations that are \ngoing to benefit from this tax subsidy, you will find on that list \nnames of three corporations which I would like to call to your \nattention: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Brown & Williamson.\n\n  To make it clear, we are saying that the companies that make tobacco \nproducts can now continue to sell them overseas with a subsidy from the \nFederal Treasury to the tune of over $100 million a year. We are saying \nto these purveyors of these deadly tobacco products that we, in fact, \nare going to help you in selling your product overseas.\n  Allow me to put this in perspective. The tobacco companies I have \nnamed will have domestic profits in the U.S. of $7.2 billion, and we \nare giving them $100 million to subsidize the sale of tobacco products \noverseas. Some would stand up and say, well, Senator, why would you \npick out the tobacco companies? If you are going to go after companies \nand the products they make, why wouldn't you go after a lot of other \ncompanies, too?\n  Perhaps some arguments can be made along those lines. But let me tell \nyou why I think we should deal with tobacco exports in a different \nmanner than other products being exported. I will use for my evidence \non this the statements of Philip Morris, self-published on their \nwebsite as of 10 days ago. You see all these soft, little gauzy \ncommercials about Philip Morris feeding poor people, helping the \nelderly, providing scholarships. My friends and those who are \nwitnessing this debate, this is just eyewash. This is an effort by the \ntobacco companies to tell you they are warm and loving people.\n  Well, these warm and loving people sell a product that kills 400,000 \nAmericans a year. The No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today \ncontinues to be tobacco. We have just enacted legislation giving a \nFederal tax\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\nsubsidy to these same tobacco companies to sell this deadly product \noverseas. Is there any doubt that it is deadly? Well, for decades, the \ntobacco companies said: You can't prove it; there is no science behind \nit. We can prove that tobacco may not be harmful.\n  Well, they finally gave up on that sad and disgraceful claim. This is \nwhat their web site started publishing 10 days ago. This is Philip \nMorris. I will read it into the Record:\n\n       Cigarette smoking and disease in smokers: We agree with the \n     overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette \n     smoke causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and other \n     serious diseases in smokers. Smokers are far more likely to \n     develop serious diseases like lung cancer than nonsmokers. \n     There is no safe cigarette. These are and have been the \n     messages of public health authorities world-wide. Smokers and \n     potential smokers should rely on these messages in making all \n     smoking-related decisions.\n\n  Having said that, we have just awarded to the companies that make \nthis deadly product, and want to sell it overseas, a $100 million-a-\nyear tax subsidy. Do you know what that means? It means that the United \nStates of America, which for over a century has been a leader in public \nhealth causes around the world, is now going to be a leader in \npurveying this deadly cigarette and tobacco product in Third World \ncountries.\n  Visit any country that you choose overseas and look at what you see. \nWith the exception of countries such as Poland which, surprisingly, has \nenacted good legislation to stop tobacco advertising that appeals to \nchildren, in country after country, you find the most outrageous, \ndisgraceful activity by American tobacco companies subsidized by \nAmerican taxpayers selling their deadly product overseas.\n  In the Philippines, a very Catholic country, they give away these \ncalendars showing religious images with American tobacco products. \nThese are the things which American tobacco companies will now be doing \nwith the help of this tax subsidy from Federal taxpayers.\n  Allow me to tell you what we face here. Since 1990, Philip Morris \nsales have grown by 80 percent overseas. Smoking currently causes more \nthan 3\\1/2\\ million deaths each year throughout the world. Within 20 \nyears, the number is expected to rise to 10 million, with 70 percent of \nall deaths from smoking in developing countries. Listen to this \nstatistic. This ought to tell you how important this issue is to the \nworld. Tobacco will soon be the leading cause of disease and premature \ndeath worldwide, surpassing AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n  Do you take any pride as an American citizen that it is our tobacco \ncompanies selling these products to children and to unsuspecting people \naround the world, which will soon be the public health scourge of our \nglobe? Do you take any comfort or satisfaction in the decision we have \njust made within a few minutes to give a $100 million subsidy each year \nto these tobacco companies so they can peddle this deadly product to \nkids and unsuspecting people in countries around the world? Can you \nhold your head up high as an American, proud that we are now \nsubsidizing this deadly product? Can you visit these countries and see \nthe Marlboro Man and all of the logos we have seen disappearing in \nAmerica re-emerging in these Third World countries as more and more \npeople are lured into tobacco addiction? Can you be proud as an \nAmerican of that fact?\n  I am not. I am saddened by it. I am saddened that this leadership \nrefused to allow this bill to even be considered on the floor for an \namendment. But that has been the story of the Senate for month after \nmonth. We have been afraid to face the reality of debate, afraid to \nface the tough votes. And for some members from those States that \nproduce tobacco or happen to be friendly to tobacco companies, it would \nhave been a tough vote. But these Senators have been protected from \neven facing this issue. It is a tax subsidy to tobacco companies that \nwill literally kill people around the world.\n  This country, of which I am so proud to be part, and the State I \nrepresent--I am so proud to be their Senator here--will become known to \npeople around the world as the source of death and disease. People now \nare worried about death from malaria and tuberculosis and AIDS. Sit \ntight because in a few years you will see other deadly diseases coming \nacross your land--emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease--from America's \ntobacco products. Marlboros, Camels, all of these products will be \noverseas.\n  After they put on these sweet little commercials about how much they \njust love these children and they love these elderly people--they put \non these sweet little commercials and spend a lot of money to tell you \nhow lovable Philip Morris is--go to the Philip Morris web site and see \nwhat this lovable company sells to make the profits to take Meals on \nWheels to an elderly lady.\n  They sell a product which they now readily concede causes death and \ndisease. After 40 years of denial, they finally admitted it. We have \ndecided that we want to subsidize their efforts. It is a sad day in the \nSenate. I can certainly support this tax effort for the many \ncorporations that will use it responsibly to sell good products \noverseas, but to think that this Senate will be party to this decision, \nit is a sad day.\n  It is no surprise. A few years ago when we wanted to hold the tobacco \ncompanies accountable for their solicitation of children, it was \nstopped by the Republican leadership in the Senate. When the Clinton-\nGore administration said these tobacco companies owe Federal taxpayers \nfor what they have done to them over the years as they settled, and pay \nthe States for what they had done to their citizens as well, the \nRepublican leadership said, no, stop the lawsuit; don't sue the tobacco \ncompanies; leave them alone. These poor tobacco companies, leave them \nalone. They only have $7.2 billion annually in profits.\n  Well, I believe the Clinton-Gore administration is right. I believe \nthe American people deserve this lawsuit. They deserve the tobacco \ncompanies being held accountable and they deserve that these companies \nfinally stop soliciting our children, addicting our children, \naggressively stop selling their products to our children. I have been \nin Congress for 18 years. For the last 12 years, I guess I have fought \non this issue more than any other. I can assure my friends in the \nSenate it is not the end of the debate. To those who want to give this \ngift to the tobacco companies, they can expect this fight to continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11459-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11459-S11460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING SENATOR MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I congratulate our dear colleague from New \nYork. I thank him for his leadership in defense of trade. We had these \nrunning debates, most of them related to the Presidential campaign. \nMost have nothing to do with the business of the Senate in these waning \nhours of the session. Instead they are about who deserves or what \ndeserves credit for the golden economic era in which we live. I think \nthe plain answer is, more than anything else, the creation of a wealth-\ngenerating machine through world trade is responsible for this economic \ngolden age in which we live.\n  Our colleague is what I think of as an ``old-timey'' Democrat. There \nused to be a lot more of them here than there are now. Unfortunately, \nthere is going to be one fewer. Some might think the number would be \nzero after Senator Moynihan. But there was a time when there was a \nbipartisan consensus in favor of world trade. Unfortunately, now it is \nso easy to demagog against trade because you can identify a potential \nloser. If a company shuts down, whether it was inefficient or ``moved \noff to Mexico,'' the claim is, ``They moved off to Mexico.'' Everybody \nwho loses a job there knows it. But the 10 or 100 jobs we create for \nevery 1 we lose, people do not know why they were created. So it is \nhard, politically, to stand up for economic freedom. But what is a more \nbasic economic freedom than the right to produce things and sell them \nall around the world?\n  I would also like to say, in an era where a lot of people are running \naway and hiding on the issue of Social Security or pretending the \nproblem is somehow going to go away, I again congratulate our colleague \nfrom New York for being willing to stand up on that issue. He has made \nit clear that unless we do something about Social Security, unless we \ncreate a wealth source\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\nto pay benefits, we are perpetuating a cruel hoax where we are going to \nend up, in 12 or 15 years, having to make excruciatingly painful \nchoices. These are not just choices about spending cuts versus taxes, \nbut really they are choices we will have to make between our parents \nand our children, between the security of our parents and the economic \nopportunity of our children. We will have to make those choices because \nof failed leadership right now to deal with this issue.\n  I did not want to pass up this chance to say to my colleague from New \nYork I am glad he came our way. I am proud to call him my friend and \ncolleague.\n  I remember the first dealing I ever had with the Senator from New \nYork. It was on a TV talk show. I don't know if he remembers it. We \nsort of had a sharp exchange. I would like to say I am not as ignorant \nas I used to be. I thank our colleague from New York for being an \ninstructor for me and for America. I am proud of his academic \nbackground. I am proud to share it with him.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my learned and ever \naccommodating--almost always accommodating friend. I have learned so \nmuch from him. If he knew how little economics I brought to this body, \nhe would appreciate how much he has added to it. I am grateful, as a \nscholar ought to be. Across the aisle, I admire him so much and only \nwish he were on this side. But he has helped both sides on the issues \nthat matter. That is what is important. I thank my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11460-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DECISIONS FOR THE NEW CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to comment on where we are. I am \nsure the American people are confused. They hear the President saying \none thing, they hear Congress saying another. They see chaos, they see \ngridlock, they see politics as usual. I am sure they are wondering what \nis this all about. Let me try, in the remaining moments I have, to \nexplain.\n  We are at the end of an 8-year Presidency. Americans are going to the \npolls next Tuesday to make a fundamental decision. But we have a \nPresident in the White House now who would like to make the decision \nfor the future while he is still President, by forcing Congress to \nspend far beyond the budget we wrote and far beyond the budget he \nwrote. The President has, in essence, said that if we will spend 30 \npercent more on social programs in Health and Human Services than we \nspent last year, if we will then make some permanent changes in law in \naddition to that spending, such as giving amnesty to people who have \nbroken the Nation's laws and come to the country illegally, he will \nsign this bill and let us go home.\n  Let me tell you why we are not going to do that and why we are going \nto resist. First, I do not believe the American people want Bill \nClinton, or this Congress for that matter, making decisions for the new \nPresident and the new Congress. It is time to have an election. It is \ntime to move on. What we have is a President who almost is unhappy \nbecause the focus of attention is on the two men who are now running \nfor President. And so, he believes that by vetoing bills he has agreed \nto sign and by demanding more and more spending, he gets his name back \nin the paper and gets on television.\n  Let me tell you why we should say no. We should say no because the \nAmerican people ought to decide. If we did what Bill Clinton is calling \non us to do, before the new President ever took his hand off the Bible \nwe would have spent between a third and a half of the budget surplus.\n  I think the American people think they are deciding in this election. \nIf people want to spend this money, they can vote for Al Gore. If they \nwant to use the money to let working people have a tax cut and to \ninvest it in rebuilding Social Security and Medicare, they can vote for \nGeorge Bush. But however they are going to vote, Bill Clinton should \nnot be making the decision to spend it before the American people can \nvote.\n  Let me convert it down to a simple number. For every day that we \nsimply fund at this year's level the remaining parts of Government that \nare not yet appropriated for, we save between $88 and $133 million a \nyear. By just continuing to fund at this year's level and waiting for \nthe next President to arrive, over a 12-month period we would spend $32 \nbillion less by not creating all these new programs, by not hiring all \nthese new Government employees, by not making the President the \npresident of every school board in America.\n  Nobody knows what $132 billion is so let me convert it into something \nyou know. As you know, you can buy a very nice pickup truck for \n$20,000. You can buy basically a loaded Chevrolet or Ford pickup, full-\nsize pickup, for $20,000. By simply saying no to Bill Clinton for 6 \nmore days and simply leaving spending at its current level, we could \nbuy 1.6 million pickup trucks. I think the American people understand \nwhat 1.6 million pickup trucks are.\n  I know there are some people who hope, even at this last minute, to \ncut a deal with Bill Clinton and bring to the floor of the Senate a \nbill that will spend $32 billion more on social programs. Let me tell \nyou, today is Wednesday. We are going to have an election on Tuesday. \nThey have never put an election off in American history. I just want to \nsay to people, a deal is not going to happen. If a deal is cut today, \nspending $32 billion, basically taking 1.6 million pickup trucks right \noff people's driveways and out of their garages, I am going to object. \nWe are not going to vote to spend that money before the people of \nAmerica can vote in this election.\n\n  They are going to decide, depending on how they vote. They may tell \nus to spend it and a lot more, or they may say give some of it back. We \nmay create a wealth base for Social Security but that is going to be \ndecided by voters. But what is not going to be decided by this \nPresident and what is not going to be decided by this Congress before \nthe election is that we are going to go on a massive spending spree. \nThat is not going to happen.\n  How do I know it is not going to happen? Because today is Wednesday. \nUnder the rules of the Senate, if a few people say no, it can't be \ndone, it will not be done.\n  I think what we ought to do on a bipartisan basis is to pass a \nresolution funding the Government through the election, let the \nAmerican people speak, and let them say what they want to happen with \nthis money. Not Bill Clinton because he is on the way out. Let them say \nthrough this election and whom they elect what they want done.\n  It is not the time to be listening to the voices of the past. It is \ntime to be looking to the future. Let's pass this CR through the \nelection, keep spending where it is right now, and let the American \npeople speak on Tuesday. Then we can come back here, we will have heard \nthe message from back home, and we can respond to it.\n  I think that is the rational thing to do, and that is what I am going \nto support. I also believe that is what is going to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very sad \ntime. It has been a sad time for America. I want to focus on the \nsadness in Texas.\n  Mr. President, last week Texas laid to rest three of her sons, killed \nin the terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole. Seaman Timothy Gauna of \nRice, Petty Officer Ronchester Santiago of Kingsville, and Fireman Gary \nSwenchonis of Rockport, were killed in the October 12 disaster.\n  Since then, I have visited with the families of these three sailors. \nI met with some of them at the Cole memorial service in Norfolk, VA. \nFine, loving individuals, they are trying, as we all are, to make sense \nof the senseless.\n  These young men had their lives ahead of them. They wanted to go to \ncollege, to travel, to raise their own families. They volunteered for \nthe Navy because they loved their country and wanted to give something \nback, and now they are gone.\n  It may not be possible for us to understand the magnitude of this \nloss to the families involved.\n  Can we know the anguish of Mr. Swenchonis, whose son Gary was laid\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\nto rest in the same cemetery as Gary's grandfather? A son with just 2 \nmonths left on his enlistment?\n  Will we ever understand the loss of Rogelio Santiago, a Navy veteran \nhimself, who was planning a trip with his son Ron to his native \nPhilippines in December?\n  Have we ever experienced the bewilderment of Sarah Gauna, who said \nshe would never hang up the phone with her boy until she had made him \nlaugh, as she waited days to learn the awful truth about Timothy?\n  We cannot feel the depth of sorrow of these families, but we are all \ndiminished by their loss because U.S.S. Cole was a small patch of \nAmerican soil and on that patch we lost our own.\n  Today, as we come and go in our ordinary routine, life is anything \nbut routine for those they left behind.\n  Today, the U.S.S. Cole, crippled but proud, has begun the long \njourney home. She is under tow for a rendezvous with another larger \nvessel that will literally carry her home to America.\n  The ship is cold. It is dark and quiet. But the spirit of the fallen \nTexans and the 14 others who lost their lives carries on in the valiant \nefforts of their 300 shipmates. They saved the ship and they mean to \nrebuild it to fight another day.\n  In the words of her Commanding Officer, ``We're going to get this \nship back home [and] put back together so that she can again sail and \ndefend American freedom throughout the world.''\n  That is exactly what is going on today in so many other distant \nplaces across the globe. Today we remember the Cole, but she was just \none representative of a proud service that is still on watch.\n  Today as most Americans get up for work, have breakfast with their \nfamilies, perhaps attend a son or daughter's school play or athletic \nevent, we may not think much about the tens of thousands who left their \nfamilies alone on a pier months ago to sail into harm's way, expecting, \nbut not really knowing for sure, if they would come home.\n  Just today--November 1--on, over, or under the seven seas, more than \n41,000 sailors and marines are standing watch on the bridge of a \nwarship, landing aircraft onto the deck of a carrier, manning nuclear \npower plants leagues beneath the surface, training to land ashore from \nthe sea.\n  These thousands do not count a much greater number ashore who repair \nthe ships, maintain the aircraft, and perform a host of other \nactivities that mark an ordinary day in the life of a superpower.\n  Those young men and women are out there serving under our flag in \nplaces where they are not always welcome but whose presence is \nreassuring.\n  Every once in a while, we hear from them. Not when they are landing \ntheir fighter onto the rolling deck in pitch blackness, scared but \nexhilarated all the same. We do not read about it when they bring their \nship alongside an oiler, two 10,000-ton machines just 90 feet apart at \n15 knots for 3 hours replenishing their stores at sea to extend the \nreach of freedom.\n  There are no cameras there for the 19 year-old Marine guard at the \ngate of the overseas naval installation at 3 o'clock in the morning who \nmust decide in an instant whether the vehicle approaching him is loaded \nwith explosives or is just a shipmate coming back from liberty.\n  They do not seek our recognition, but at times, that is demanded of \nus. Unfortunately, now is one of those times. At a time such as this, \nwe cannot believe what we see but we marvel at the courage and \ndedication of these young people.\n  I received an e-mail message that has been circulated around the \nworld, shared with me by Knox and Kay Nunnally, whose son attends the \nNaval Academy. A helicopter pilot from the U.S.S. Hawes recorded what \nhe saw when he was assigned the task of taking airborne photos of the \nstricken Cole pierside in Yemen, just days after the tragedy. His words \nbring home to us just what it is we ask of our sailors and marines:\n\n       I will tell you that right now there are 250-plus sailors \n     just a few miles away living in hell on earth. You can't even \n     imagine the conditions they're living in, and yet they are \n     still fighting 24 hours a day to save their ship and free the \n     bodies of those still trapped and send them home.\n       As bad as it is, they're doing an incredible job. The very \n     fact that these people are still functioning is beyond my \n     comprehension. Whatever you imagine as the worst, multiply it \n     by ten and you might get there.\n       I wish I had the power to relay to you what I have seen, \n     but words just won't do it. I do want to tell you the first \n     thing that jumped out at me--the Stars and Strips flying. I \n     can't tell you how that made me feel . . . even in this God \n     forsaken hell-hole our flag was more beautiful than words can \n     describe.\n       The U.S.S. Cole and her crew is sending a message: even \n     acts of cowardice and hate can do nothing to the spirit and \n     pride of the United States. I have never been so proud of \n     what I do, or of the men and women that I serve with as I was \n     today.\n\n  Mr. President, it has been said that young fighting men and women \ndon't endure the risks they do for such lofty goals as patriotism, \nfreedom, democracy, or all the other reasons why older generations send \nyoung generations into war.\n  Rather, these young men and women fight for the buddy next to them in \nthe foxhole; in the next bunk over; in the back of the cockpit.\n  If that is so, then there can be no greater honor for Timothy Gauna, \nRon Santiago, and Gary Swenchonis than that their sad and painful \ndeaths force us to remember, through them, their shipmates and all the \nother thousands of American fighting men and women who are out there \ndoing the extraordinary everyday, just so that we can live our everyday \nlives.\n  As we remember the words of the Navy Hymn, we honor the memory of \nthese three Texans by calling to mind those they left behind:\n\n     O hear us when we cry to thee, for those in peril on the sea.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we just had a vote on a cloture motion on \nthe bankruptcy bill, which did not prevail; that is, cloture was not \ninvoked. I just want to make a short statement now because we will be \nback at this again.\n  This has been a prolonged and complicated process that brought us to \nthis point today. I personally believe it need not have been so long \nnor have been so complicated. We should not have had to wait for this \nlegislation as long as we have. We should have just stepped up to this \nearlier. But here we are.\n  I heard a number of things stated in the well of the Senate as we \nwere voting on cloture relative to this legislation about which I think \npeople were misinformed. A lot of statements were being made that did \nnot reflect what is actually in this bankruptcy bill.\n  I know many of my colleagues are not happy with the bill. But on \nbalance the bankruptcy reform bill still deserves the strong support of \nthe Senate. We will return to this issue later this month, and I would \nlike to put to rest some of the assertions made.\n  We have what we call a very strong safe harbor provision in this \nbill, to protect families that are below the median income, along with \nallowing them adjustments for additional expenses, that will assure \nthat only those with the real ability to pay in bankruptcy are steered \nfrom chapter 7 to chapter 13.\n  The Senate language, giving judges the discretion to determine \nwhether or not there are special circumstances that justify those \nexpenses, prevailed over the very strict House language. The bottom \nline is, if you are someone who is listed by the national statistics as \nbeing poor--many folks keep saying poor folks will be hurt by this--you \nare not even in the deal here. You are not even in the deal. You are \nprotected. That is what we mean by the safe harbor.\n  This provision has been strengthened with an additional protection \nfor those between 100 and 150 percent of the national median income. So \nif you have\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\nan income that is 150 percent above the median income, you will get \nonly a very cursory means test.\n  I heard on the floor today people saying how poor folks and lower \nmiddle income folks were really going to be hurt by this. That is \nsimply not true.\n  Compared to current law, this provision provides increased protection \nagainst creditors who try to abuse the so-called reaffirmation process.\n  This bill imposes new requirements on credit card companies to \nexplain to their customers the implications of making minimum payments \non their bills every month.\n  A feature of this legislation that I think deserves much more \nemphasis is historic improvement in the treatment for family support \npayments, child support, and alimony. I heard my colleagues on my side \nof the aisle down there saying this hurts women and children.\n  Compared to current law, there are numerous new, specific protections \nfor those who depend on support payments and alimony payments. The \nimprovements are so important that they have the endorsement--I want \neverybody to hear this--they have the endorsement of the National Child \nSupport Enforcement Association. This is the outfit that comes to us \nand says: Look, you have to provide additional help in seeing to it \nthat child support payments are paid by deadbeat dads. The National \nChild Support Enforcement Association, the National Association of \nDistrict Attorneys, the National Association of Attorneys General, they \nall support this bill because of these protections. These are the \npeople who actually are in the business of making sure family support \npayments are made.\n\n  One passage from the letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee \ndeserves repeating. Referring to critics of the legislation, those men \nand women who are on the front lines of the struggle to enforce family \nsupport agreements say:\n\n       For the critics appear content to sacrifice the palpable \n     advantages which this legislation would provide to support \n     creditors--\n\n  That is, the women and children who depend on support payments.\n\n     to defeat of this legislation, based on the vague and \n     unarticulated fears that women will be unfairly disadvantaged \n     as bankruptcy creditors--in more ways than one, the critics \n     would favor throwing out the baby with the bath water.\n\n  This is a letter from the people who go out on behalf of women, \ncollecting child support payments for their children.\n  They say this bankruptcy bill is a good bill.\n  I think the last line from the letter deserves special stress. I \nquote:\n\n       No one who has a genuine interest in the collection of \n     support should permit such inexplicit and speculative fears \n     to supplant the specific and considerable advantages which \n     this reform legislation provides to those who need support.\n\n  I can think of no stronger rebuttal to the arguments we have seen and \nheard recently about the supposed effects of this legislation on women \nand children who depend on alimony and child support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          District Attorney Family\n\n\n                                               Support Bureau,\n\n                            San Francisco, CA, September 14, 1999.\n     Re S. 625 [Bankruptcy Reform Act].\n\n       Dear Senators: I am writing this letter in response to the \n     July 14, 1999 letter prepared by the National Women's Law \n     Center. That letter asserts in conclusory terms that the \n     Bankruptcy Reform Act would put women and children support \n     creditors at greater risk than they are under current \n     bankruptcy law. The letter ends with the endorsement of \n     numerous women's organizations.\n       I have been engaged in the profession of collecting child \n     support for the past 27 years in the Office of the District \n     Attorney of San Francisco, Family Support Bureau. I have \n     practiced and taught bankruptcy law for the past ten years. I \n     participated in the drafting of the child support provisions \n     in the House version of bankruptcy reform and testified on \n     those provisions before the House Subcommittee on Commercial \n     and Administrative Law this year.\n       I believe it is important to point out that none of the \n     organizations opposing this legislation which are listed in \n     the July 14th letter actually engages in the collection of \n     support. On the other hand, the largest professional \n     organizations which perform this function have endorsed the \n     child support provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act as \n     crucially needed modifications of the Bankruptcy Code which \n     will significantly improve the collection of support during \n     bankruptcy. These organizations include:\n       1. The National Child Support Enforcement Association.\n       2. The National District Attorneys Association.\n       3. The National Association of Attorneys General.\n       4. The Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement \n     Council.\n       The thrust of the criticism made by the National Women's \n     Law Center is that by not discharging certain debts owed to \n     credit and finance companies, the institutions would be in \n     competition with women and children for scarce resources of \n     the debtor and that the bill fails ``to insure that support \n     payments will come first.'' They say that the ``bill does not \n     ensure that, in this intensified competition for the debtor's \n     limited resources, parents and children owed support will \n     prevail over the sophisticated collection departments of \n     these powerful interests.''\n       With all due respect, nothing could be further from the \n     truth. While the argument is superficially plausible, it \n     ignores the reality of the mechanisms actually available for \n     collection of domestic support obligations in contrast with \n     those available for non-support debts.\n       Absent the filing of the bankruptcy case, no professional \n     support collector considers the existence of a debt to a \n     financial institution as posing a significant obstacle to the \n     collection of the support debt. The reason is simple: the \n     tools available to collect support debts outside of the \n     bankruptcy process are vastly superior to those available to \n     financial institutions and, in the majority of cases, take \n     priority over the collection of non-support debts.\n       More than half of all child support is collected by \n     earnings withholding. Under federal law such procedures have \n     priority over any other garnishments of the debtor's salary \n     or wages and can take as much as 65% of such salary or wages. \n     By contrast the Consumer Credit Act prevents non-support \n     creditors from enforcing their debts by garnishing more that \n     twenty-five percent of the debtor's salary.\n       In addition, there are many other techniques that are only \n     made available to support creditors and not to those \n     ``sophisticated collection departments of . . . [those] \n     powerful interests:'' These include:\n       1. Interception of state and federal tax refunds to pay \n     child support arrears.\n       2. Garnishment or interception of Workers' Compensation or \n     Unemployment Insurance Benefits.\n       3. Free or low cost collection services provided by the \n     government.\n       4. Use of interstate processes to collect support \n     arrearage, including interstate earnings withholding orders \n     and interstate real estate support liens.\n       5. License revocation for support delinquents.\n       6. Criminal prosecution and contempt procedures for failing \n     to pay support debts.\n       7. Federal prosecution for nonpayment of support and \n     federal collection of support debts.\n       8. Denial of passports to support debtors.\n       9. Automatic treatment of support debts as judgments which \n     are collectible under state judgment laws, including \n     garnishment, execution, and real and personal property liens.\n       10. Collection of support debts from exempt assets.\n       11. The right of support creditors or their representatives \n     to appear in any bankruptcy court without the payment of \n     filing fees or the requirements of formal admission.\n       While the above list is not exhaustive, it is illustrative \n     of the numerous advantages given to support creditors over \n     other creditors. And while all of these advantages may not \n     ultimately guarantee that support will be collected, they \n     profoundly undermine the assumption of the National Women's \n     Law Center that the mere existence of financial institution \n     debt will somehow put support creditors at a disadvantage. To \n     put it otherwise, support may sometimes be difficult to \n     collect, but collection of support debt does not become more \n     difficult simply because financial institutions also seek to \n     collect their debts.\n       The National Women's Law Center analysis includes without \n     specification that the support ``provisions fail to insure \n     that support payments will come first, ahead of the increased \n     claims of the commercial creditors.'' Professional support \n     collectors, on the other hand, have no trouble in \n     understanding how this bill will enhance the collection of \n     support ahead of the increased claims of commercial \n     creditors. To them, such creditors are irrelevant outside the \n     bankruptcy process. And in light of the treatment of domestic \n     support obligations as priority claims under current law and \n     the enhanced priority treatment of such claims in the \n     proposed legislation, this objection seems particularly \n     unfounded.\n       Where support creditors are indeed at a disadvantage under \n     current law is during the bankruptcy of a support debtor. \n     Under existing bankruptcy law support creditors frequently \n     have to hire attorneys to enforce support obligations during \n     bankruptcy or attempt the treacherous task of maneuvering \n     through the complexities of bankruptcy process themselves. \n     Attorneys working in the federal child support program--\n     indeed, even experienced family law attorneys--may find \n     bankruptcy courts and procedures so unfamiliar that they are \n     ineffective in ensuring that the debtor pays all support when \n     due.\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\n     Ideally, procedures for the enforcement of support during \n     bankruptcy should be self-executing and uninterrupted by the \n     bankruptcy process. The pending bankruptcy reform legislation \n     goes far in this direction. To suggest that women and \n     children support creditors are not vastly aided by this bill \n     is to ignore the specifics of the legislation.\n       In the first place support claims are given the highest \n     priority. Commercial debts do not have any statutory \n     priority. Thus when there is competition between commercial \n     and support creditors, support creditors will be paid first. \n     And, unlike commercial creditors, support creditors must be \n     paid in full when the debtor files a case under chapter 12 or \n     13. Unlike payments to commercial creditors, the trustee \n     cannot recover as preferential transfers support payments \n     made during the ninety days preceding the filing of the \n     bankruptcy petition, and liens securing support may not be \n     avoided as they may be with commercial judgment liens. Unlike \n     commercial creditors, support creditors may collect their \n     debts through interception of income tax refunds, license \n     revocations, and adverse credit reporting, all--under this \n     bill--without the need to seek relief from the automatic \n     bankruptcy stay.\n       In addition, support creditors will benefit--again, unlike \n     commercial creditors--from chapter 12 and 13 plans which must \n     provide for full payment of on-going support and unassigned \n     support arrears. Further benefits to support creditors which \n     are not available to commercial creditors is the security in \n     knowing that chapter 12 and 13 debtors will not be able to \n     discharge other debts unless all postpetion support and \n     prepetition unassigned arrears have been paid in full.\n       Finally, and most importantly, support creditors will \n     receive--even during bankruptcy--current support and \n     unassigned arrearage payments through the federally mandated \n     earnings withholding procedures without the usual \n     interruption caused by the filing of a bankruptcy case. Like \n     many other provisions of the bill, this provision is self-\n     executing, the bankruptcy proceeding will not affect this \n     collection process. Frankly, and contrary to the assertions \n     of the National Women's Law Center, it is difficult to \n     conceive how this bill could better insure that ``support \n     payments will come first, ahead of the increased claims of \n     the commercial creditors.''\n       The National Women's Law Center states that some \n     improvements were made in the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     This organization may wish to think twice about that \n     conclusion. What the Senate amendments did was to distinguish \n     in some cases between support arrears that are assigned (to \n     the government) and those that are unassigned (owned directly \n     to the parent). The NWLC might have a point if assigned \n     arrears were strictly government property and provided no \n     benefit to women and children creditors. However, upon a \n     closer look, arrears assigned to the government may greatly \n     inure to the benefit of such creditors.\n       In the first place the entire federal child support program \n     was created to recover support which should have been paid by \n     absent parents, but was not. Such recovered funds became and \n     remain a source of funding to pay public assistance benefits, \n     especially by the states which contribute about one half of \n     the costs of such benefits.\n       More directly significant, however, is the fact that under \n     the welfare legislation of 1996 (the Personal Responsibility \n     and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) support arrearage \n     assigned to the government and not collected during the \n     period aid is paid reverts to the custodial parent when aid \n     ceases. This scenario will become increasingly common in the \n     very near future as the five year lifetime right to public \n     assistance ends for individual custodial parents. In such \n     cases this parent will face the double whammy of being \n     disqualified from receiving the caretaker share of public \n     assistance and--because of the Senate amendments--not \n     receiving arrears or intercepted tax refunds because they \n     were assigned at the time the debtor filed for bankruptcy \n     protection.\n       In addition, prior to the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     amendments a debtor could not obtain confirmation of a plan \n     if he were not current in making all postpetition support \n     payments. The advantage of this scheme was that it was self-\n     executing. Under the Senate amendments a debtor may obtain \n     confirmation even when he is not paying his on-going support \n     obligation. He is only required to provide for such payments \n     in his plan. In such cases it will then be the burden of the \n     support creditor to bring a bankruptcy proceeding to dismiss \n     the case if the debtor stops paying. While this procedure is \n     a welcome addition to the arsenal of remedies available to \n     support creditors, it should not have supplanted the self-\n     executing remedy which required the debtor to certify he was \n     current in postpetition support payments before the court \n     could confirm the plan.\n       While the Senate version of bankruptcy reform should \n     certainly be amended to restore the advantages of the earlier \n     draft, it does, even in its present form, provide crucial \n     improvements in the protections and advantages afforded \n     spousal and child support creditors over other creditors \n     during the bankruptcy process. These improvements will ease \n     the plight of all support creditors--men, women, and \n     children--whose well-being and prosperity may be wholly or \n     partially dependent on the full and timely payment of \n     support. Congress has created the federal child support \n     program within title IV-D of the Social Security Act. It is \n     the opinion of those whose job it is to carry out this \n     program that the Bankruptcy Reform Act provides the long \n     overdue assistance needed for success in collecting money \n     during bankruptcy for child and spousal support creditors.\n       Most of the concerns raised by the groups opposing the bill \n     do not, in fact, center on the language of the domestic \n     support provisions themselves. Instead they are based on \n     vague generalized statements that the bill hurts debtors, or \n     the women and children living with debtors, or the ex-wives \n     and children who depend on the debtor for support. It is \n     difficult to respond point by point to such claims when they \n     provide no specifics, but they appear to fall into two \n     categories.\n       The first suggests that the reform legislation will result \n     in leaving debtors with greater debt after bankruptcy which \n     will ``compete'' with the claims of former spouses and \n     children. As discussed above there is little likelihood that \n     such competition would adversely affect the collection of \n     support debts. In any event the bill does little to change \n     the number or types of nondischargeable debt held by \n     commercial lenders. it will slightly expand the presumption \n     of nondischargeability for luxury goods charged during the \n     immediate pre-bankruptcy period and will make debt incurred \n     to pay a nondischargeable debt also nondischargeable. It is \n     doubtful that either provision will, in reality, have much \n     effect on the vast majority of ``poor but honest'' debtors \n     who do not use bankruptcy as a financial planning mechanism \n     or run up debts immediately before filing for bankruptcy in \n     anticipation of discharging those obligations.\n       The second contention is presumably directed at a number of \n     provisions in the bill that are designed to eliminate \n     perceived abuses by debtors in the current system. The \n     primary brunt of this attack is borne by the so-called \n     ``means testing'' or ``needs based bankruptcy'' provisions \n     which would amend the current language of Section 707(b). \n     Most of the opposition appears to stem from the notion that \n     means testing would be a wholly novel proposition. Such a \n     conclusion is plainly incorrect. Virtually every court that \n     has ever considered the issue holds that Section 707(b) \n     already includes a means test or, more accurately, a hundred \n     or a thousand means tests, one for each judge who considers \n     the issue. The current Code language sets no standards or \n     guidelines for applying this test, thus leaving the outcome \n     of a motion subject to the unstructured discretion of each \n     bankruptcy judge. The proposed bankruptcy reform legislation \n     attempts to prescribe one test that all courts must apply.\n       The precise terms of that standard have been under constant \n     revision since the bankruptcy reform bills were introduced \n     last year, and undoubtedly they will continue to be fine-\n     tuned to ensure that they strike a balance between preventing \n     abuse and becoming unduly expensive and burdensome. But mere \n     opposition to any change in the present law, and vague claims \n     that any and all attempts to address such existing abuses as \n     serial filings are oppressive and will harm women and \n     children, does nothing to advance the dialogue. And worse, \n     the critics appear content to sacrifice the palpable \n     advantages which this legislation would provide to support \n     creditors during the bankruptcy process for defeat of this \n     legislation based on vague and unarticulated fears that women \n     will be unfairly disadvantaged as bankruptcy debtors. In more \n     ways than one the critics would favor throwing out the baby \n     with the bath water. No one who has a genuine interest in the \n     collection of support should permit such inexplicit and \n     speculative fears to supplant the specific and considerable \n     advantages which this reform legislation provides to those in \n     need of support.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                Philip L. Strauss,\n                                      Assistant District Attorney.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to briefly address two issues that \nhave been raised by the President and by the opponents of this \nlegislation. I honestly believe, compared to the many substantial \nvictories for the Senate position in this legislation, these two issues \nfall short of justifying a change in the overwhelming support \nbankruptcy reform has received in the last two sessions of Congress.\n  First, there is the issue of this homestead cap. I heard people on \nthe floor voting, saying: There is no protection in here, no protection \nat all. You just let people get away. You allow the Burt Reynolds of \nthe world to go out there and buy multimillion-dollar homes and then \ndeclare bankruptcy. This is unfair.\n  First of all, do you think any of the creditors want that to happen? \nThe companies are concerned about this, along with interest groups that \nare concerned about this. And on the consumer side, do you think they \nwant people being able to escape having to pay what they owe because \nthey are able to bury assets in a multimillion-dollar home?\n  So where is this coming from? First, the homestead cap. One of the \nmost egregious examples of abuse under the current law is the ability \nof wealthy individuals, on the eve of filing for\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\nbankruptcy, having the ability to shelter their income from legitimate \ncreditors by buying an expensive home in one of a handful of States \nthat have an unlimited homestead exemption in bankruptcy. This is one \nof the most egregious abuses, but it is actually pretty rare, involving \nonly a few of the millions of bankruptcies that have been filed in \nrecent years. Nevertheless, it is an abuse that should be eliminated.\n  There are reasons that the Senate included a strong provision. That \nwas a hard cap of $100,000 in the value of a home; that is, if your \nhome was worth more than $100,000, your creditors could go after the \nremainder of that money, but if it was $100,000 or less, your creditors \ncould not get it because we have a principle in this country of not \ntaking away your home based on bankruptcy.\n  This provision, though, was struck by the House. They did not like \nthe hard cap of $100,000. So what we did was we reached a compromise to \navoid the worst abuses as a last-minute move to shelter assets from \ncreditors. That last-minute move to avoid legitimate debts has been \neliminated.\n  To be eligible under any State's homestead exemption, a bankruptcy \nfiler must have lived in that State for the last 2 years before filing. \nIf you buy a home within 2 years of filing, your exemption is capped at \n$100,000. Put another way, you have to have a pretty good estate plan \nin order to escape bankruptcy by buying a multimillion-dollar home.\n  You have to know, under the law, if we had passed it today--and 2 \nyears from now you go bankrupt--so you go out 2 years ahead of time and \nmove into a State that allows you to buy a multimillion-dollar home to \nescape bankruptcy. So you move into that State 2 years ahead of time, \nand 2 years ahead of time you buy the home. You take all your assets \nthat you are worried it is going to cost you, and you put them into a \nhome.\n  Let me tell the Senate, that is a pretty good plan. I don't know how \nmany people know over 2 years ahead of time that they are going to go \nbankrupt and take all their money out and put it into a home. Granted, \nI would prefer a hard cap, but the truth is, if you don't buy the home \n2 years prior to declaring bankruptcy, the cap is $100,000. So there \nare a lot of canards that have been used to defeat this cloture motion. \nI might say to my colleagues, if they want to eliminate the worst abuse \nof the homestead exemption, then they should have voted for the \nconference report.\n  That brings me to the last major issue, the one that has, \nunfortunately, generated a lot more heat than light. That is what we \nhave come to call--and I saw my colleague a moment ago--the Schumer \namendment, because of the energy and dedication of my friend and worthy \nopponent, in this case--hardly ever in any other case--Senator Schumer. \nWe all know of the confrontations, sometimes peaceful, sometimes \ntragically violent, that have occurred in recent years between pro-life \nand pro-choice groups over access to family planning clinics. Because \nof the threat to the constitutional right of the people who run those \nclinics and their patrons, Congress, with my support and President \nClinton's signature, passed a bill, the strongest proponent of which \nwas the Senator from New York, the Free Access to Clinic Entrances Act \nof 1993. The law makes it a crime punishable by fines as well as \nimprisonment to block access to family planning clinics.\n  Some of those who have been arrested and prosecuted under the law \nhave brazenly announced that they plan to declare bankruptcy to escape \nthe consequences of their crimes, specifically to avoid paying damages. \nSome of those individuals have, in fact, filed bankruptcy. But in no \ncase--in no case that I am aware of or anyone else can show me or no \ncase that the Congressional Research Service was able to find--has any \nindividual escaped paying a single dollar of liability by filing \nbankruptcy. Not a dollar, not a dime, not a penny, it hasn't happened. \nI don't believe it will happen.\n  The reason is simple: Current bankruptcy law already states that such \nsettlements for ``willful and malicious conduct'' are not dischargeable \nin bankruptcy. If that were not enough, current case law supports a \nvery strong reading of the provisions of the current law. When one \nclinic demonstrator who violated a restraining order attempted to have \na settlement against her be wiped out in bankruptcy, her claim was \nrejected out of hand by the court. The violation of the restraining \norder setting physical limits around the clinic has been ruled to be \nwillful and malicious under the current code. The penalties assessed \nagainst the violator were not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the \nCongressional Research Service confirming, as of October 26, that an \nexhaustive authoritative search did not reveal any reported decisions \nwhere such liability was discharged under U.S. bankruptcy code.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Hon. Charles Grassley, Attention: John McMickle\n     From: Robin Jeweler, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n       Division\n     Subject: Westlaw/LEXIS survey of bankruptcy cases under 11 \n       U.S.C. Sec. 523.\n\n       This confirms our phone conversation of October 25, 2000. \n     You requested a comprehensive online survey of reported \n     decisions considering the dischargeability of liability \n     incurred in connection with violence at reproductive health \n     clinics by abortion protesters. Our search did not reveal any \n     reported decisions where such liability was discharged under \n     the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n       The only reported decision identified by the search is \n     Buffalo Gyn Womenservices, Inc. v. Behn (In re Behn), 242 \n     B.R. 229 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1999). In this case, the bankruptcy \n     court held that a debtor's previously incurred civil \n     sanctions for violation of a temporary restraining order \n     (TRO) creating a buffer zone outside the premises of an \n     abortion service provider was nondischargeable under 11 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(6), which excepts claims for ``willful and \n     malicious'' injury. The court surveyed the extant and \n     somewhat discrepant standards for finding ``willful and \n     malicious'' conduct articulated by three federal circuit \n     courts of appeals. It granted the plaintiff's motion for \n     summary judgment and denied the debtor/defendant's motion to \n     retry the matter before the bankruptcy court. Specifically, \n     the court held:\n       ``[W]hen a court of the United States issues an injunction \n     or other protective order telling a specific individual what \n     actions will cross the line into injury to others, then \n     damages resulting from an intentional violation of that order \n     (as is proven either in the bankruptcy court or (so long as \n     there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the \n     question of volition and violation) in the issuing court) are \n     ipso facto the result of a `willful and malicious injury.' \n     ''--242 B.R. at 238.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Again, Mr. President, the only case I could find, in fact, \nheld, as I had predicted, that willful and malicious conduct denies you \nfrom being discharged in bankruptcy, in a case where a woman was \narrested for violating a restraining order or getting too close to the \nclinic, tried to discharge the fines against her in bankruptcy, and \ncould not.\n  I repeat: No one has escaped liability under the Fair Access to \nClinic Entrances Act through the abuse of the bankruptcy code, not one. \nAs strongly as feelings are on both sides of this issue, the Schumer \namendment is, I must say, a solution in search of a problem. I would \nsupport it just to make sure we have the extra protection, but in the \nabsence of the Schumer amendment, there is no reason for the Senate to \nreverse its opinion on the legislation that had received such strong \nsupport.\n  We voted today on trying to get to a conference report that had a \nstrong Senate stamp on it. I think we made a mistake. I think part of \nthe reason why we made a mistake in not invoking cloture was we had a \nnumber of absences. There are 16 or 17 or 18 absences, as I count it; \n15 or thereabouts were for cloture. But we will come back to it again, \nas the majority leader has said.\n  This does not in any way do anything to allow people to violate the \nfree access to clinics law. And it actually helps women and children \nwho depend on support payments and alimony payments. I will speak to it \nmore later.\n  I see the majority leader is on the floor for important business. I \nthank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Biden for his comments and \nfor yielding the floor at this time.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11465-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n               UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.J.

Mr. President, I announce then to the Senate that the \ncontinuing resolution to be passed at 2:15 today provides for a \ncontinuing of the Government for 1 day. The resolution just passed \nprovides for Government funding through November 14, 2000.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his cooperation on this. I know he \nhas been involved in this process, trying to find a date that is fair \nand reasonable to all interested parties. I know it is not easy, but I \nthink this is the right thing to do. I hope the House will accept this \nresolution and then we would proceed to wrap things up after that.\n  In light of this agreement, there will be no further votes today. All \nSenators will be notified when the next vote will occur in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the majority leader leaves, we understand his role. \nHe is the leader here, and it is not easy. I can't speak for everyone \non this side, but I can speak for a few. We hope when we come back that \nwe will come back with a fresh view as to what needs to be done and \nhopefully we can get things done.\n  I ask the leader, is there some assurance--I guess that is the word--\nis there some certainty that the House will accept this? What has the \nleader learned?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Speaker of the House. \nThere have been staff contacts with the leadership on both sides of the \naisle. It is my impression that the leadership on both sides will work \nfor this to be accepted. We had some discussion about a different date, \nbut the House felt very strongly that this date was preferred to the \nlater one, and that is basically one of the reasons why we settled on \nthis date. Hopefully, they will move quickly to accept this and then we \nwill be able to go do our responsibilities in other areas.\n\n  I say also that while we will be home and will not be here for \nawhile, there has been further progress made on the Labor-HHS and \nEducation appropriations bill. I understand there are only a few issues \nremaining. The staff will not be on vacation. Work will continue. It \nwould be my hope that the areas of disagreement can be worked out and \nwhen we come back on November 14, we will have a vote or two and that \nis all, that we would be done with it. But hope springs eternal, and it \ndoesn't always come true. That is what we are thinking about right now.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the leader, the President is excited about this. \nIt is my understanding that he will do what is necessary in this \ninstance. I repeat that when we come back here, I hope we can move this \nforward. With minor exceptions, the work done by Senator Stevens and \nSenator Byrd and others on the Labor-HHS bill is really good work. I \nhope we can wrap it up very quickly.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have seen here today persistence does pay off. Yesterday \nvery little was said about it, but a lot of credit goes to the members \nof the committee that produced the Water Resources Development Act \nunder the chairmanship of Bob Smith. There was some disagreements with \nthe House, but they put their shoulder to the wheel and we passed that \nvery important legislation last night. Today, thanks to a lot of good \neffort by Senator Daschle and Senator Reid, and working with Senators \non our side, we were able to move the FSC legislation, which we had not \nbeen able to get done earlier. So at this very moment, we are \ncontinuing to work to get agreement on the bankruptcy vote. I agree \nthat this is an indication of why we probably should take a time-out. \nWe didn't pass that cloture today because of absentees. I believe when \nwe get everybody here, cloture will be invoked, and we will go forward \nwith that important legislation.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his good work as always.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11465-3", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11465-S11466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 13\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Further, I ask \nthat the bill remain at the desk, and that when the Senate receives \nfrom the House H.R. 254, the Senate proceed to its consideration, all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 13, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof. I further ask that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and all previous action on S. 13 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, a member of the minority has \nrequested that on his behalf I object to this action, and based upon \nthat request, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Graham of Florida and I have \nbeen working on this bill. This legislation, in sum, provides that \nfamilies that are saving for college tuition under prepaid college \ntuition plans, which are growing in popularity in America, the money \nthey save and the interest that accrues on those plans not be taxable \nby the Federal Government. That is what this law would do if passed.\n  What we are doing in America today is we have a public policy to \nencourage families, through loan subsidies and other forms of \nincentives and delays in payments of interest, to borrow money to pay \nfor college. But people who are saving money, even under State prepaid \ncollege tuition plans, are taxed on the money they save. This is a \ndisincentive for the best way to pay for college tuition; that is, \nsaving for college. Well over 40 States have these prepaid plans and \nthe few States that don't are moving to develop them. It is working \nvery well. The Federal tax policy ought to affirm what these States are \ndoing and make this tax-free.\n  I just note that this is a middle class program. For example, 71 \npercent of the participating families in the Florida prepaid college \nprogram have annual incomes under $50,000, and 25 percent have incomes \nof less than $30,000; 81 percent of the contracts in Wyoming's savings \nplan have been purchased by families with annual incomes of less than \n$34,000; 62 percent of the contracts in Pennsylvania have been \npurchased by families with annual incomes of less than $35,000. The \naverage monthly contribution to a family's college savings account in \n1995 in Kentucky was $43.\n  So what we are saying is let's have a good public policy. Let's \nencourage\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\npeople to save and make sure it is a wise thing for them to do \nfinancially. If we can achieve that, I think it would be good. As far \nas I understand, there is only one person in this who has an objection. \nI would be delighted to know who that was. Senator Graham and I would \nlike to talk to them to see if the problem they have can be worked out. \nI think it is good public policy. Both Vice President Gore and Governor \nBush have made statements that clearly indicate their support for this \nkind of public policy. I am working with Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, and I thank him for his assistance on this \nlegislation, dealing with an issue he thought important to his State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know my friend from Illinois wishes to \nspeak at some length. First, I have a couple of comments. On the \nrecently completed vote on cloture regarding bankruptcy, I think that \nis an example of why we need to follow Senate procedures the way we \nhave for 200-plus years. Here is the bankruptcy bill brought up on a \nbill under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Relations Committee. Some \nMembers who should have been weren't in that conference. I just think \nit is a very poor way to do business.\n  I think that we in the minority have been treated unfairly on a \nnumber of occasions this year. In an effort to show my displeasure--and \nthat is a real soft, cool word because I feel more strongly than that--\nI voted against invoking cloture.\n  There comes a time when we have to work as legislators, and as \nSenators. If things don't change here, there are going to be other \nunfortunate procedures such as this, even though there is support for \nthe substance of the legislation.\n  Also, Senator Schumer had a very strong point in this legislation. He \nand I cosponsored an amendment that is very simple. It said that these \npeople--these very, in my opinion, evil people, who go to clinics where \nwomen come to get advice--some people may not like the advice they get \nin these clinics because some of the advice results in obtaining an \nabortion. But we live in a free country; people have the right to go \nwhere they want to go and talk about what they want. What these women \nare doing is lawful, not illegal. People spray chemicals into those \nfacilities, and they can't get rid of the stench for up to 1 year, and \nmany times they have to simply tear the insides of the facility down so \nit can be reused. In this legislation, Senator Schumer and I said if \nyou do that, you cannot discharge that debt in bankruptcy as a result \nof the damages incurred, whether to the facilities or those women who \nuse those facilities.\n  That provision should be in this legislation. For it not to be is \nwrong, and I understand that the chief advocate of the legislation--I \ndon't know this to be a fact--Senator Grassley, was willing to accept \nthe provision. However, it was not in there. This is wrong and, as a \nmatter of procedure and as a result of the substantive issue that I \njust talked about, I am satisfied with my vote. I have no second \nthoughts. I did the right thing. Unless there is a different method of \napproaching this bankruptcy reform, which I agree is badly needed, \nthere are going to be roadblocks all along the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11466-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF MARLENE CALDWELL CARLS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marlene \nCarls, a very special person who worked in my Springfield office for \nnearly 20 years. Marlene passed away on October 24.\n  My wife Loretta first introduced me to Marlene almost 20 years ago \nwhen I was running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. \nLoretta told me Marlene was an excellent worker and she hoped that she \nwould join my campaign. So I sat down with Marlene and offered her a \ndeal she could not refuse. I offered her a beat-up old desk, a run-down \noffice, and not much pay, if she was willing to work for a candidate \nwho had lost three straight elections. In a moment of weakness, she \naccepted. Marlene was part of our family from that day forward.\n  Marlene was born to be a caseworker and she was the best. She had a \nheart of gold. She cared so much for the people she was helping. She \nwould take on immigration cases, foreign adoptions, and so many \ndifficult and complicated matters. She would help constituents get the \nanswers they needed. It wasn't just professional assistance to people \nin time of need; it was much more. Marlene Carls treated people asking \nfor help as members of the family. She did her job so well that I used \nto get fan mail from constituents who could not thank me enough for the \nwonderful work that Marlene did.\n  With the immigration cases, we would continue to see the fruit of her \nwork for many years. Marlene and I would go to naturalization \nceremonies in Springfield twice a year. And as they would call out the \nname of a new citizen she would nudge me and say, ``Boss''--she always \ncalled me ``Boss''--``Boss, that's one of ours.'' It was the same kind \nof pride a mother has when her son or daughter crosses the stage at a \ngraduation ceremony. She knew the people she had helped; she cared \nabout them; she rejoiced in their success and happiness.\n\n  She showed the same caring for our military cases: mothers and \nfathers desperate to reach their sons and daughters in uniform--to \nbring them home for an emergency--to get them out of a scrape--or just \nto learn if they were alive in a crisis.\n  Marlene learned the military lingo and reached the point where she \ncould charm the stripes off a sergeant or the stars off a general. Many \nfamilies in Illinois found peace of mind because of Marlene Carls' hard \nwork.\n  And she took such delight in knowing that someone's life had been \nmade a little better off because of her efforts.\n  Marlene, or ``Mo'' as we came to call her, was proud of her family. \nHer son Kelly Carls, her daughter Cathleen Stock, and her two \ngrandchildren, Kayla Lynn and Julia Anne Stock, were the apples of her \neye. I was pleased to watch their progress through her eyes.\n  Marlene also had so many friends. At her memorial service last Friday \nin Springfield, the chapel was packed with family, fellow staffers, and \nfriends from other governmental offices. The group from the National \nPark Service where we have our senatorial office came out in uniform to \nbe there for Marlene--clergy from many different religions and many \nordinary people who had the good luck of asking Marlene for a helping \nhand.\n  Mo was active as a volunteer for the Alzheimer's Association and the \nAmerican Cancer Society. In everything she did, people and a concern \nfor people took first place. In our office, her care for others and \nwise advice led people to call her ``Mama Mo.''\n  A lesser known fact is that Marlene was an amazing writer. I remember \nshe had written a piece in a contest and won a free trip to Hollywood. \nShe was just so proud of that.\n  She had a long-time dream to visit Ireland. Over her desk was a \npicture of herself and ``Tip'' O'Neill. She really valued that \nphotograph as a reminder of her Irish heritage. She and Kathy Anderson \nof my staff had the trip to Ireland planned. But they weren't able to \nmake the journey because of Marlene's illness. At her wake, I closed \nwith an Irish blessing from all of us to a wonderful person and great \npublic servant.\n\n     May the road rise up to meet you.\n     May the wind be always at your back.\n     May the sun shine warm upon your face,\n     The rain fall soft upon your fields.\n     And until we meet again,\n     May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.\n\n  We will dearly miss Marlene Carls.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 56 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11466-3", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11466-S11469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STELLER SEA LION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been criticized in the national \nmedia and many of the local media here about the Steller sea lion rider \nthat is on the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. \nRiders are really\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\nemergency items of legislation that are necessary because of the time \nof year. We are about ready to end our deliberations and this is the \nonly piece of legislation to which we could attach this provision.\n  I want to take time now to explain why this is necessary. The Labor, \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill still contains this \nprovision.\n  The difficulty is that the National Marine Fisheries Service has shut \ndown the Nation's largest fishery, and it does not even know why. In \nresponse to a lawsuit filed by extreme environmental groups, the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service has failed to show any relationship \nbetween fishing and the Steller sea lion, which it considers to be \nendangered.\n  These procedural failures have led a Federal judge to shut down all \nfishing in the 100,000 square miles which encompass the prime fishing \ngrounds for pollock off Alaska. This is an area larger than the State \nof Oregon and twice the size of New York. It is a coastline which would \nstretch from the District of Columbia to Florida.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service continues to blame fishermen \nfor the sea lion decline. Right now, Alaska fishermen and Alaska \ncoastal communities are losing $1 million a day. If fishing does not \nresume in January, Alaska coastal communities will be ghost towns by \nthe end of the year.\n  The Alaska groundfish fishery accounts for 40 percent of America's \ncommercial fish harvest. Alaskan cod, pollock, and other species are \nsold in grocery stores and restaurants throughout our Nation.\n  Besides fishermen, the injunction that is in place impacts airlines, \nshipping companies, regional ports, and transportation labor. Alaska \nseafood exports contribute almost $1 billion towards our annual trade \ndeficit. Most of that is exports to Asia. Incidentally, that is where \nwe get most of our imports.\n  Alaska's annual seafood processing payroll is about $240 million. \nThat is the processing of this product alone. Seafood exports offset \nthe transportation cost of consumer goods imported by at least 15 \npercent. Dutch Harbor and Kodiak, two large seaports in my State, are \nthe No. 1 and No. 4 fishing ports of the United States. Fishing in \nthose communities pays the cost of teachers, police, firemen, and other \npublic servants. The fishing industry is the only industry in those \nareas.\n  This was all brought about because of biological opinions that have \nbeen issued by the Fisheries Service. The National Marine Fisheries \nService found that fishing did not harm sea lions on five separate \noccasions in the last decade: Twice in 1991, twice in 1996, and again \nin March of 1998. In April of 1998, extreme environmental groups filed \nsuit to shut down these fisheries. The National Marine Fisheries \nService's next biological opinion reversed the position of that agency \n180 degrees. It reversed the prior five decisions and found that \nfishing had caused jeopardy to these sea lions.\n  There was no scientific breakthrough that led to that decision. In \nfact, what happened was they changed the person who wrote the decision. \nThe Federal judge rejected the scientific analysis in that biological \nopinion as inadequate.\n  Today, the agency has still not justified the sea lion mitigation \nmeasures it wants to impose. Because of the agency's repeated failure \nto justify its own proposals, the judge shut down all fishing for \npollock in this critical area. The new biological opinion is based upon \na concept called ``localized depletion.'' This is the hypothesis of the \nbiologist who put together the last biological opinion that the judge \nrefused to accept.\n  This is based on the idea that fishing vessels take food away from \nsea lions. There is no science to support that conclusion or that \ntheory. In fact, the trawling that takes place for pollock occurs at \ndepths below which the sea lions forage for food. Pollock schools are \nmuch larger than the entire fleet. They cover an area far beyond what a \nfleet could cover.\n  I have a chart that shows the concentrated fishing efforts of the \npollock fleet in a period of 4 weeks in 1995. The total efforts of this \nfleet failed to disperse the massive school of pollock. Beginning the \n26th of January, the pollock was concentrated. The next week it was \nstill concentrated. The third week it was concentrated. The fourth week \nit was concentrated. Despite the fact the fleet was there on top of \nthat pollock the whole time, the pollock did not move. In fact, the \nfishing effort did not disperse the pollock.\n  The concept the biologist used was the fishing effort in an area is \nlocalized, and it depletes the pollock locally and, therefore, there is \nno food for the sea lions after the trawling takes place. That is \nabsolutely not true. Pollock move around in natural migration patterns, \nnot as a result of fishing effort.\n  Few people realize this is the largest biological mass of fish in the \nworld. It is an enormous fishery, and it has grown because of our \nfishing practices--it has not been depleted because of fishing \npractices.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service has failed to study the impact \nof predators on the sea lion population. We now see in Alaska soaring \nnumbers of killer whales and falling numbers of sea lions and other \nspecies upon which the killer whale preys. Science shows that killer \nwhales feed on juvenile sea lions, the same age class of sea lions that \nis causing the overall decline in that species.\n  Recently, a killer whale washed up on a beach in Alaska. When it was \nexamined, there were 14 steller sea lion tags in its stomach. One \nkiller whale had eaten 14 sea lions.\n  In addition, I hope Members have seen video footage of killer whales \nin our State that take sea lions right off the beach. It is a monstrous \nvideo that shows how these enormous killer whales come right up on the \nbeach and take the sea lions off the beach. The National Marine \nFisheries Service admits the killer whale is a predator and is a major \ncause of the declining sea otter population in our State, but it is \nunwilling to accept the fact that killer whales are involved in the \ndecline of the sea lion.\n  This is hard for us to understand, very frankly. There has been a \nshift in this decision, as I said, 180 degrees. We fail to understand \nwhy this monstrous agency, which I normally support, could be swayed by \nthe decision of one man because of a lawsuit that was filed by extreme \nenvironmentalists.\n  Most scientists now believe that sea lions are declining as part of \ntheir natural population cycle. I have another chart that shows this \ncycle. As the temperature and other conditions in the North Pacific \nhave changed, the sea lions have declined and the pollock have \nincreased. One of the things that has happened in the North Pacific is \nthe abundance of high oil content fish, such as herring, has fallen \nwhile the low oil content species, such as pollock and cod, have \nincreased. Published research shows that sea lions need to eat high oil \ncontent fish to survive.\n  For instance, in southeastern Alaska where high oil content fish are \nstill plentiful, a different subpopulation of steller sea lions is \nincreasing in size while its western cousins are decreasing. We believe \nit is a problem of diet, as far as the sea lions' decline is concerned, \nand that those who assert that sea lions can survive on pollock alone \nare absolutely wrong.\n  Some scientists believe pollock fishing in critical habitats actually \nhelps sea lions. This is because the pollock off my State are highly \ncannibalistic. Adult pollock eat juveniles in very large numbers. \nTrawlers target adult pollock which are over 3 years of age, whereas \nsea lions eat the smaller juvenile fish that would otherwise be eaten \nby the cannibalistic adult pollock population.\n\n  The net result of these ocean changes is that as our pollock \npopulation has increased, the sea lion population has decreased. Yet \nthe decision of the biologist was that the reason for the sea lion \npopulation decline was the lack of availability of pollock. The \nNational Marine Fisheries Service should know better than to shut down \nthe largest private sector employer in Alaska without a good reason.\n  Right now they do not have a reason based upon science. Their \nconclusion is based entirely upon a lawsuit filed by an extreme \nenvironmental group, which also has no science behind it. This is \nabsolutely wrong. That is why I have insisted on keeping this rider in \nplace which will allow the fishery to continue on the basis of the \nprotections that were already in place to protect the sea lions.\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\n  We have agreed not to invade the sea lion rookeries. In fact, we have \nset up protection areas around them. Our industry has contributed $1 \nmillion toward sea lion research to help find out some of the reasons \nfor their decline.\n  We have appropriated a sizable amount of money to the National Marine \nFisheries Service and the Alaska SeaLife Center to continue the \nresearch to find out why sea lions are declining. For myself and most \nof us who have spent our adult lives on the oceans around our State, I \nbelieve it is the overabundance of orcas, the killer whale population, \nthat is causing the decline in the sea lions of the western population.\n  I repeat. Under the rider, fishing will continue until July 1, 2001 \nunder all the restrictions that were in effect. These protective \nmeasures include restrictions on trawl fishing near sea lion rookeries, \nhaul-outs, and foraging areas.\n  There are no-entry zones for fishing vessels near sea lion rookeries \nand haul-outs.\n  We have limitations on the harvest levels inside critical habitat.\n  We have split the pollock season into four different seasons to \nreduce the impact on the areas where the sea lions are.\n  We have reduced the daily catch rate through cooperative fishing. We \nhave a very conservative process for setting the total allowable catch \nlevel, which actually is 13 percent lower than what would have been \nprojected in 2001.\n  We require Federal observers to monitor harvest levels, including \nharvests inside any critical habitat area. And there are additional sea \nlion mitigation measures that are in effect.\n\n  We do not, however, believe there should be a complete cessation of \nthis enormous fishery. This is an enormous fishery. Two and a half \nbillion pounds of fish are brought ashore from this massive population \nevery year. Yet as we show, as we take mature pollock, the pollock \nbiomass continues to grow. If we do not take that mature pollock from \nthis biomass, it will once again go back to eating its own young and \ndecrease.\n  So this rider is absolutely necessary to preserve the most massive \nand valuable fishery off our shores. I do hope those who criticize it \nwill take time to read the opinions I am going to place in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsummaries of the opinions that were written, the conclusions and \nopinions written before the extreme environmentalists entered this \nissue, and the summary of the one that has been filed now by those who \ncame on the scene after that lawsuit was filed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n           Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, \n           Silver Spring, MD, March 2, 1998.\n     Memorandum for: Dr. Gary Matlock, Director, Office of \n         Sustainable Fisheries.\n     From: Hilda Diaz-Soltero, Director, Office of Protected \n         Resources.\n     Subject: Endangered Species Act Section 7 Biological Opinion \n         on the Fishery Management Plan for the Gulf of Alaska \n         Groundfish Fishery, the 1998 Total Allowable Catch \n         Specifications, and the effects on Steller Sea Lions \n         (Eumetopias jubatus).\n       Attached is the Biological Opinion on the effects of the \n     Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Gulf of Alaska \n     groundfish fishery, the 1998 Total Allowable Catch \n     specifications and its effects on the endangered western \n     population of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus).

The available results \n     will be used during the continuing 1991 TAC consultation and \n     during the 1992 specification process.\n       The Steller sea lion final rule (November 26, 1990, 55 FR \n     49204) established 3-nautical-mile buffer zones around major \n     sea lion rookeries in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. \n     As outlined in the final rule, NMFS intends to undertake \n     further rulemaking after considering additional protective \n     regulations and the need for critical habitat designation for \n     Steller sea lions. NMFS will solicit comments from the \n     Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team, other experts, and the \n     general public on the need to modify the existing buffer \n     zones or to create additional buffer zones.\n       An Incidental Take Statement is not included with this \n     Biological Opinion because a limited incidental take is \n     already authorized for Steller sea lions under Section 114 of \n     the Marine Mammal Protection Act (50 CFR 229.8).

NMFS also recognizes that it has a \n     continuing responsibility to make a reasonable effort to \n     develop additional data (51 FR 19952). To fulfill this \n     responsibility, NMFS has identified crucial information \n     necessary to address this question again in one year. That \n     information will result from analyses listed in the \n     Conservation Recommendations. NMFS will consider the results \n     of these studies as new information that reveals effects of \n     the agency action that may affect listed species or \n     designated critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not \n     considered in this opinion.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       After reviewing the current status of the Steller sea lion, \n     the environmental baseline for the action area, the effects \n     of the proposed 1999-2002 Atka mackerel fishery, the \n     cumulative effects, and the conservation measures that will \n     result from recommendations of the NPFMC, it is NMFS's \n     biological opinion that the action, as proposed, is not \n     likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the Steller \n     sea lion or adversely modify its critical habitat.

We have a massive effort to try to determine that. \nWe will cooperate in any way we can to save this population. But we do \nnot want to lose this massive biomass in the process.\n  If this trawl fishery does not continue, it will decline back to \nwhere it was before the trawl fishery was started. I think those who \ncriticize us would do well to study the science and talk to people who \nknow something about these steller sea lions and the fisheries, and \nquit listening to these extremist political people who are involved in \nthis process, as far as the environmental groups are concerned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11469-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND A \n        CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I am pleased this morning that the Senate \nthus far is functioning the way it should when it comes to new \ncontroversial matters such as my State's physician-assisted suicide \nlaw. I have been forced to filibuster the tax bill since late last week \nbecause at that time there was an effort to stuff the Nickles \nlegislation into that package in the dead of night. This legislation \ntroubles me greatly because I believe it will cause unnecessary \nsuffering for patients in every corner of the country. It involves law \nenforcement--specifically, the Drug Enforcement Administration--in a \nprocess that is so sensitive with respect to helping patients who are \nsuffering around our country.\n  This legislation has never been marked up by the committee of \njurisdiction in the Senate. It has never been open to amendment by the \nSenate. It has not cleared even one of the traditional hurdles to which \nimportant legislation is subjected when it is introduced in the Senate.\n  This is legislation that has over 50 leading health organizations, \nincluding the American Cancer Society, stating that it is going to hurt \npain care for the dying. It is also fair to say that the senior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, has a number of organizations that support \nhis efforts. When we have\n\n[[Page S11470]]\n\na number of organizations, respected organizations, that disagree about \na very sensitive, totally new issue before the Congress, the Senate \ncertainly should move carefully to evaluate the consequences of its \nactions.\n  I spoke with the President of the United States about this matter \ntwice on Monday. I was pleased to read the comments of the President \nexpressing concern about the bill's impact on pain care and on \nphysicians. I am absolutely convinced that if this legislation were to \nbecome law, there would be many health care providers in this country \nwho are opposed to physician-assisted suicide, as I am, who would be \nvery fearful about treating pain aggressively because the Nickles \nlegislation criminalizes decisions with respect to pain management.\n  The people of Oregon, who have a ballot in their hand such as this \none right now, want to know that this ballot really counts. The people \nof Oregon, in coffee shops and beauty parlors all over the State, when \nthey are considering how to vote right now, are asking themselves: Does \nthis ballot really count? When we vote on a matter that is critical to \nus, particularly on a measure that has historically been left to the \nStates, we want to make sure that people 3,000 miles away won't \nsubstitute their personal moral and religious beliefs for ours on a \nmatter that has historically been left to us to decide.\n  I can tell the people of Oregon now that their vote still counts. As \nof today, whether you vote for my party or the party of Senator \nNickles, it doesn't matter. This ballot, as of this morning in the \nState of Oregon, still counts, regardless of whether you are a Democrat \nor a Republican, a Liberal, a Conservative, Independent. Regardless of \nyour political persuasion, as of now in the State of Oregon, this \nballot still counts.\n  Your vote is important. I hope folks at home exercise that right. \nTheir vote still means something. I am going to do my best to see that \nit continues to count when Congress reconvenes after the election.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague yielding. I thank him for the \nextraordinary bipartisan approach he has taken throughout this session.\n  I think 18 months ago, when the session began and we were tackling \nthe county payments question, particularly rural schools and roads, \nnobody thought we could put together a bipartisan coalition. Two sides \nwere completely dug in. One side said we should totally divorce these \npayments from any connection to the land; others went the other way and \nsaid let's try to incentivize a higher cut. I believe the Senator from \nIdaho, in giving me the opportunity that he has as the ranking Democrat \non the forestry subcommittee, has shown that we can take a fresh \napproach on these natural resources issues--in particular, timber.\n  I appreciate my colleague yielding me the time. I am looking forward \nto working with him again next session because it was an exhilarating \nmoment to have the first major natural resources bill in decades come \nto the floor of the Senate, as our legislation did.\n  I thank my colleague for letting me intrude on his time. I have had a \nchance to be part of a historic effort with my friend from Idaho, and \nit has been a special part of my public service. I thank him for that.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Oregon. Both he and I have \nlearned that when you try to change a law that is actually 92 years \nold, or adjust it a little bit, it is difficult to do. We were able to \ndo that. Next year, there will be a good number of challenges on public \nlands and natural resource issues.

Mr. President, I very recently came to the floor and \nexpressed my grave concern about the reliability of affordable \nelectricity. I am not alone in my concerns about this issue. Indeed, \nsome of the loudest voices expressing similar concerns about energy \nprices are coming from not just Idaho but California, and specifically \nfrom my distinguished colleagues from California here in the Senate.\n  By my comments today, I do not diminish or in any way cast doubt \nabout the substantial hardships experienced by the ratepayers in \nCalifornia, particularly southern California. Indeed, I have great \nempathy for them, primarily because Pacific Northwest ratepayers are \nbracing for power shortages in the near future that will cause energy \nprices to soar and hurt large and small businesses alike and put some \nresidential customers in danger, especially during the cold and hot \nperiods of the year in our region of the Pacific Northwest. I share \nequal concerns with the citizens of California.\n  We must confront the obvious facts facing all energy consumers today.\n  There is an energy supply crisis in the United States. It is clear \nthat the administration didn't see it coming, or at least ignored it. \nWe in the Congress heard no alarms from the Department of Energy and \nwere given not enough warning during the last 8 years that an energy \nsupply crisis was about to threaten the electrical industry of our \ncountry.\n  One of the very few pieces of energy legislation that was sent to \nCongress for review and passage was the administration's Comprehensive \nElectrical Competition Act in April 1999. This legislation was \npurported to result in $20 billion in savings a year to America's \nenergy consumers. However, this legislation would not have precluded \nthe crisis in California, the kind that Californians experienced this \nsummer. Indeed, the legislation was full of mandates and rules that \ndidn't offer any economic incentives or investments in new supplies.\n  Moreover, the legislation included a renewable portfolio mandate that \ndid not include cheap hydropower as a renewable. I know the Presiding \nOfficer and I talked about it at that time--that all of a sudden we had \nan administration that was not going to include hydropower as a \nrenewable. This renewable portfolio requirement would have made \nelectricity more expensive and more scarce to the consumer. Part of the \nproblem in California appears to be that it is unwilling to accept the \ntradeoff of high prices required by environmental regulations. Either \nthe tough environmental standards that currently exist in California \nare an acceptable cost of energy consumption or California must make \nnecessary environmental adjustments for more abundant supplies at a \ncheaper price.\n  In addition, the administration must reexamine the use of the price \ncaps that apparently have caused the supply problems in California.\n  Mr. President, these are some of the reasons why the legislation \nfailed to get the desired support in Congress from a majority of the \nMembers which included many Democrats as well as Republicans. We \nrecognized you simply can't just go out and say here is the energy, \nwhat it is going to cost, cap it at prices, and put all these \nenvironmental restrictions on it. It is going to ultimately get to the \nconsumer and, boy, did it get to them in California this summer. Many \nof us were justifiably concerned about the impact such legislation \nwould have on the current electrical supply network that supports the \nmost reliable electric service found anywhere in the world.\n  The administration did not adequately explain how the legislation \nwould prevent energy supply problems from occurring if its legislation \nwas passed--perhaps because it simply didn't have an adequate \nexplanation or, if it knew the facts, it certainly wasn't willing to \nhave them known publicly.\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n  Rather than wait for Federal direction on this issue, many States \nembarked on their own experiment with electrical restructuring. Some of \nthose State programs appeared to be experiencing some success by giving \nto their electricity consumers choice of energy suppliers without \njeopardizing reliable service. However, other States are experiencing \ngreat difficulties ensuring reliable service at affordable prices. And \nCalifornia happens to be one of those States.\n  I am not interested in pointing blame for failures. I am interested \nin getting at the facts and understanding them as they relate to how \nthey contributed to the failures so that objective assessments of \nfuture legislative proposals can be made to avoid what happened in \nCalifornia again in the coming years. Moreover, I want to ensure that \nthe distinguished Members from California have all of the facts \nnecessary to fully understand and appreciate the role the Bonneville \nPower Administration plays in the California markets. There were a lot \nof accusations made this summer about how the Bonneville Power \nAdministration was handling its electrical supply. I think the facts \nare soon to be known and an entirely different story will emerge.\n\n  I fully expect the facts to prove that the Bonneville Power \nAdministration has not contributed to the energy cost crisis in \nCalifornia and that BPA can and will continue to play a positive role \nin bringing affordable surplus electricity from the Pacific Northwest \nto the California markets when that surplus is available.\n  For these reasons, it is imperative to get relevant information about \nthe California energy price crisis to Congress and the American people \nas soon as possible. It has come to my attention that the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission's investigative report on California's \nwholesale electricity markets is complete and ready for distribution. I \nwas told just this morning that they have finally decided to release \nit.\n  Indeed, in a news report yesterday, I read that a Democrat \nCommissioner from FERC stated that the FERC could not find evidence \nthat California power rates were unjust and unreasonable. The \nCommissioner also told the reporters that there was no evidence of \nabuse by energy companies operating within the State.\n  This is important information that must be shared and now will be \nshared with Congress and all electrical consumers. The news reports \nalso say the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report would address \nsweeping structural changes in California's independent supply \noperator, or ISO, which controls the high voltage transmission grid, \nand the State's power transmission grid, and the State's power \nexchange, where power is bought and sold.\n  It has come to my attention that the FERC report has been complete \nsince October 16. There was some effort to keep it quiet, but it \nappears now to be breaking on the scene. This important information has \nbeen available and is now, as I say, beginning to come out. I do not \nunderstand why Congress should resist this kind of information. It \nought to be made immediately available to Members of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and the committee of jurisdiction for \nFERC issues and shared with members of the House Commerce Committee, \nwhere all of these issues will have to be considered.\n  Indeed, one of the FERC Commissioners recognized its importance and \ntalked about the issuance of this report. Commissioner Hebert captured \nthese thoughts with some pretty eloquent words on October 19 when he \nsaid:\n\n       Rather than wait for November 1 to release the findings of \n     our staff's investigation--\n\n  Which they finally did. He felt it was important that they do it at \nthis time. He said--\n\n       I urge the Chairman to release the completed report now.\n\n  It seems that Commissioner is finally getting his way.\n\n       Open government requires it; fairness does as well.\n\n  And, most importantly, on this kind of information.\n\n       The people of California should have as much time \n     as possible to digest findings and consider the options \n     presented.\n       Justice Brandeis often remarked, ``Sunshine is the best \n     disinfectant.'' Let the sun shine on our staff's report.\n\n  The Commissioner is speaking of the FERC staff.\n\n       It can only help heal the raw emotions rampant in the State \n     of California.\n\n  It is time Californians look at themselves and decide what went wrong \nin California because it wasn't as a result of the Bonneville Power \nAdministration hoarding its power or choosing not to send power to \nCalifornia.

Mr. President, the tax relief bill we are about to pass \ncontains many very popular tax cut measures that will be good for \nAmericans and good for the country. One of the provisions included in \nthe package is The Farm, Fisherman, and Ranch Risk Management Act--\nFFARRM.\n  This is a proactive measure that would give farmers a five-year \nwindow to manage their money. It would allow them to contribute up to \n20% of the annual income to tax-deferred accounts, known as FFARRM \naccounts. The funds would be taxed as regular income upon withdrawal.\n  If the funds are not withdrawn five years after they were invested, \nthey are taxed as income and subject to an additional 10% penalty. So, \nfarmers will be able to put away savings in good years so they will \nhave a little bit of a cushion in bad years.\n  Agriculture remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. \nThe income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside \ntheir control. Weather can completely wipe out a farm family. At best, \nit can cause their income to fluctuate wildly. The uncertainty of \nInternational markets also threatens a farm family's income.\n  If European countries impose trade barriers on farm commodities, or \nif Asian countries devalue their currency, agricultural exports and the \nincome of farmers will fall.\n  Today, farmers face one of their most severe crises with record low \nprices for grain and livestock. The only help for these farmers has \nbeen a reactionary policy of government intervention. While this aid is \nnecessary to help farmers pull through the current crisis, it's merely \na partial short-term solution.\n  Farmer Savings Accounts will help the farmer help himself. It's not a \nnew government subsidy for agriculture and it will not create a new \nbureaucracy purporting to help farmers. It will simply provide farmers \nwith a fighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to \nsucceed when prices eventually increase.\n  Another important provision in this bill deals with farmers who want \nto income average but aren't able to because of the alternative minimum \ntax. A few years ago, Congress reinstated income averaging for farmers \nbecause we recognized that farmers' income fluctuated from year to \nyear.\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\n  Unfortunately, many farmers are not able to make use of this benefit \nbecause they're subject to the alternative minimum tax. Our tax relief \nbill will fix this problem for tens of thousands of farmers.\n  There are many other farmer-friendly measures that I and others \nadvocated in the Senate bill. Unfortunately, some of our House \ncounterparts didn't agree with us. I believe that will change next year \nand I will certainly be working hard to pass these in the next \nCongress.\n  In the meantime, we have some very good and necessary pro-farmer \nproposals before us that can be passed this year.\n  I only hope the Clinton-Gore administration doesn't veto the family \nfarmer by vetoing this bill.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11472-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11472-S11473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SMALL BUSINESS REAUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nsome of the health care provisions in the tax bill. It's not a perfect \nbill, but it contains a lot of items that will improve health care in \nthis country.\n  Let me touch on the issue of Medicare equity. We in Iowa have been \nfrustrated by the inequitable payment formulas that hurt cost-efficient \nstates like ours. These disparities exist in both traditional Medicare \nand in the Medicare+Choice program. Well, this bill takes a major step \ntoward correcting this injustice. I'd like to walk through some of the \nreasons why this bill is good for health care in Iowa.\n  This bill corrects the Medicare Disproportionate Share program, known \nas ``DISH,'' as proposed in a bill I sponsored with Senator Roberts and \nothers. This program helps hospitals that treat large numbers of \nuninsured patients. It's obvious that many rural Americans are \nuninsured, and that rural hospitals meet their duty to treat these \npeople. But from its inception, this program has discriminated against \nrural hospitals. They have had to meet a much higher threshold than \nlarge urban hospitals have. Well, this bill finally equalizes the \nthresholds for all hospitals. There's still more work to do on this \nprogram, but this is a major step forward for equity in Medicare.\n  The bill also reforms the Medicare Dependent Hospital program, as \nproposed in legislation I co-sponsored with Senator Conrad and many \nothers. Many rural areas have aged populations, and this is especially \ntrue in Iowa. So this designation benefits small rural facilities that \nhave more than 60% Medicare patients. But incredibly, hospitals only \nreceive this benefit if they met that level way back in 1988! \nUnfortunately, the Medicare program is full of this kind of outdated, \nunreasonable rules. That's why we need Medicare reform. But in the \nmeantime, I'm glad to report that this bill would correct this \nparticular problem: if a rural hospital has been over that 60% level in \nrecent years, it qualifies. That's great news for rural hospitals.\n  Other key provisions of the bill strengthen our Sole Community \nHospitals, knock down obstacles to the success of the Critical Access \nHospital program for rural areas, and enhance rural patients' access to \nemergency and ambulance services.\n  The bill also helps hospitals--including all Iowa hospitals, both \nurban and rural--by providing a full Medicare payment increase to \noffset inflation in 2001.\n  Low payment rates for Iowa and other efficient states have prevented \nthe Medicare+Choice program from taking root in Iowa and offering \nseniors the full range of health care options available elsewhere. I am \npleased that the bill provides a major boost to entice plans to enter \nsuch regions, raising the minimum monthly payments for plans in rural \nareas from $415 to $475 per month, and for urban areas from $415 to \n$525 per month. These increases were proposed in a bill I co-sponsored \nwith Senator Domenici and others, and I am hopeful that they will soon \nprovide Iowans with the same range of choices available to seniors in \nother areas.\n  The bill gives rural seniors access to the best medical care through \ntelemedicine, as I have worked with Senator Jeffords and many others to \ndo. In rural areas, medical specialists are not readily available. For \nmany seniors, traveling long distances is simply not feasible. But \ntechnology now makes it possible for patients to go to their local \nhospital or clinic and be seen by a specialist hundreds of miles away. \nWe in Iowa have tremendous capacity to take advantage of this. Yet for \ntoo long, the Medicare bureaucracy has put up every barrier it could \nthink of to telemedicine. But this bill changes that, greatly expanding \nthe availability of Medicare payment for services provided by \ntelemedicine, Medicare patients will now have access to the world's \nbest doctors and medical care regardless of where they live.\n  The bill protects funding for home health services by delaying a \nscheduled 15% cut in payments, as well as providing a full medical \ninflation update. It's not secret that I, like many of my colleagues, \nwould have preferred to see that 15% cut canceled permanently rather \nthan simply delayed for another year. I hope that we will accomplish \nthat next year.\n  The bill also protects the access of our neediest beneficiaries to \nhome health services when they use adult day care services. Patients \ncan only receive home care under Medicare if they are ``homebound,'' \nand the bureaucracy has said that patients who leave their home for \nhealth care at an adult day care facility--such as many Alzheimer's \npatients--are no longer homebound. This has forced patients who are \ncapable of living in their homes to move into institutions, just to get \nhealth care. I am very pleased that this bill includes the common-sense \nlegislation I co-sponsored with Senator Jeffords to correct this Catch-\n22.\n\n  I am also very pleased that the bill addresses the Medicare hospice \nbenefit, providing for a higher payment increase for inflation. The \nbill also deals with the ``six-month rule'' for hospice eligibility, \nclarifying that it is only a guideline, not an inflexible requirement. \nThese provisions respond to concerns aired at my Aging Committee \nhearing on hospice in September, and I look forward to continued work \nin the 107th Congress to strengthen hospice care.\n  The legislation extends the moratorium on therapy caps and provides \nMedicare beneficiaries in nursing homes with access to critical \nservices. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a $1,500 cap on \noccupational, physical and speech-language pathology therapy services \nreceived outside a hospital setting. Thirty-one days after the law was \nimplemented, an estimated one in four beneficiaries had exhausted half \nof their yearly benefit. Furthermore, it was those beneficiaries in \nneed of the most rehabilitative care that were penalized by being \nforced to pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital \nsetting. I fought successfully during last year's Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act for a two-year moratorium on the therapy caps while the \nHealth Care Financing Administration studies the issue; I am pleased to \nsee this effort recognized and the moratorium extended for an \nadditional year.\n  The bill protects the right of patients in Medicare+Choice plans to \nreturn to their Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility of origin if they \nhave to leave that facility for a brief hospitalization. Without this \nright, there have been instances in which patients in religiously \naffiliated nursing facilities have not been permitted to return to \nthose facilities after hospitalization. I am gratified that the bill \nincludes the legislation I co-sponsored with Senator Mack on this \nissue.\n  The bill discontinues a policy to phase out Medicaid cost-based \nreimbursement to our nation's 3,000 Rural Health Clinics and 900 \nCommunity Health Centers. In its place, it provides a reimbursement \nsolution to ensure that these essential primary care providers can \ncontinue to serve millions of uninsured and under-insured Americans. \nThe bill establishes a prospective payment system in Medicaid for \nfederally certified Rural Health Centers and Community Health Centers. \nThis provision creates an equitable payment system for these providers \nand ensures that the health care safety net remains strong and secure.\n  As one example, the legislation also provides Medicare beneficiaries \nwith greater access to the most thorough type of colon cancer \nscreening--colonoscopy. As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on \nAging, I held\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\na hearing earlier this year to raise awareness about the far-reaching \nand devastating effects of colon cancer. This year 129,400 Americans \nwill be diagnosed with this type of cancer and 56,000 Americans will \ndie from it. However, if detected and treated early, colorectal cancer \nis curable in up to 90 percent of diagnosed cases. I fully support an \nexpanded colon cancer screening benefit for Medicare beneficiaries and \nurge all older Americans to put the benefit to use.\n  For the first time, medical nutrition therapy may be reimbursed by \nMedicare for patients with diabetes or renal disease. As part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress instructed the Institute of \nMedicine (IOM) to conduct a study of the benefits of nutrition therapy. \nIOM reported that nutrition therapy would improve the quality of care \nand would be an efficient use of Medicare resources. I cosponsored \nlegislation to expand Medicare coverage to include nutrition therapy; \noffering coverage for beneficiaries with diabetes or renal disease is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  In another first, this bill eliminates the arbitrary time limitation \non Medicare coverage of immunosuppressive drugs following an organ \ntransplant. Medicare covers expensive transplant operations but fails \nto follow through with coverage of the drugs necessary to preserve the \ntransplanted organ; reimbursement is currently limited to the first \nthree years following the procedure. While last year's BBRA extended \ncoverage in some cases for an additional eight months, this legislation \ndrops any time limitation for coverage of drugs critical to the health \nof transplant patients. This is common sense policy I am glad to \nsupport.\n  I plan to come to the floor on other occasions to discuss other \nprovisions of this bill. While I'm not completely satisfied, I think \nthere is a lot that will help Americans get the health care they need \nand deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to speak, if I may, over the next \nfew minutes, on a couple of different, unrelated subject matters. The \nfirst I would like to spend a few minutes talking about is the \nsituation in Colombia, South America, and, as we have watched events \nunfold over the last several days, the great concern I have about a \ndeteriorating situation in that nation.\n  Then, second, I will spend a couple of minutes talking about two of \nour colleagues who decided to retire from the Senate this year, Senator \nConnie Mack of Florida, my good friend, and Senator Pat Moynihan of New \nYork. I will take a few minutes on these separate, distinct subject \nmatters. I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11473-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11473-S11475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EVENTS IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about events in \nColombia. It is a wonderful nation, one of the oldest continuous \ndemocracies in Latin America. It is a nation with a wonderful, rich \nheritage, delightful people, a nation that has made significant \ncontributions to the stability and well-being in Latin America \nhistorically. Over the last few decades, we have seen Colombia become a \nnation whose sovereignty, whose very nationhood, is placed in jeopardy \nbecause of the turmoil that is shredding this marvelous nation and \nwonderful people.\n  Earlier this year, Congress considered the administration's $1.3 \nbillion emergency request to support the program called Plan Colombia. \nI voted for that program, as did a majority of our colleagues in the \nSenate of the United States and the House of Representatives. I said at \nthe time of the debate, that while I believed a substantial assistance \npackage was absolutely necessary to help address the multiple \nchallenges confronting the Colombian people and the Andean region as a \nwhole, I would not have allocated the monies among the various programs \nin the exact same way as the administration had proposed, nor would I \nhave fashioned the assistance package exactly the same way that the \nCongressional package which was signed into law.\n  That is often times the case here. This is not unique. But there were \nthose who expressed deep concerns about how the package was put \ntogether. I happened to have been one of them. But I also thought it \nwas so vitally important the United States should take a stand and try \nto do what we could to make a difference in Colombia, not just because \nof the relationship we have with the democratic nation to our south but \nfor the very enlightened self-interest of trying to deal with the \ncrippling problem of drug addiction and drug abuse in this country. Let \nme explain why, as many of my colleagues and others are already \nfamiliar.\n  I believe we as Americans need to respond to Colombia's difficulties \nbecause, among other things, Colombia is currently the world's leading \nsupplier of cocaine and a major source of heroin. That means the \ndifficulties Colombia faces are not simply a Colombian problem; they \nare our problem as well, since these illicit substances end up in the \nUnited States, in our cities and small towns all across this country.\n  Today there are an estimated 14 million drug consumers in the United \nStates; 3.6 million of the 14 million are either cocaine or heroin \naddicts. Colombian heroin and cocaine are the substances of choice in \nnearly 80 percent of the total U.S. consumption of these drugs.\n  The impact on U.S. communities has been devastating. Every year, \n52,000 Americans lose their lives in drug-related deaths throughout \nthis Nation. The numbers are going up, and 80 percent of the product is \ncoming from Colombia. This is why we cannot sit idly by and do nothing.\n  The economic costs, we are told, of these deaths and drug-related \nillnesses and problems exceed $110 billion a year. That is a sizable \nfinancial impact.\n  The $1.3 billion that we appropriated to help Colombia respond to \nthis situation is what was decided would be helpful. That is why I \nsupported it, despite, as I mentioned earlier, the difficulties I had \nwith it.\n  A little history is important to give the American people some idea \nof what the nation of Colombia has been through over the last decade \nand a half or two decades.\n  Colombia's current crisis did not just happen overnight. Yet its \ncivil society has been ripped apart for decades by the violence and \ncorruption which rages in that nation. Colombia has long been \ncharacterized as having one of the most violent societies in the \nWestern Hemisphere. It means historically Colombian civil leaders, \njudges, and politicians have put their lives in jeopardy simply by \naspiring to positions of leadership and responsibility.\n  Over this past weekend, for example, there were press reports that 36 \ncandidates running for Colombia's municipal elections had been murdered \nby the time of the election. That is just in the last 2 weeks. An \nadditional 50 of these candidates for municipal office were kidnaped in \nthe nation of Colombia. On a daily basis, judges, prosecutors, human \nrights activists, journalists, and even church officials live in fear \nfor their lives.\n  That has been the state of Colombian life for far too long. Between \n1988 and 1995, more than 67,000 Colombians were victims of political \nviolence in the small nation to our south. Political violence continued \nin the last half of the 1990s. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people have \nlost their lives since 1995, losing between 2,000 and 3,000 people \nannually to this violence.\n  Life in Colombia has been made even more difficult as a result of \nadditional violence and intimidation by drug traffickers, and these are \none of the major causes of it. The right wing paramilitaries and left-\nwing revolutionary groups are also responsible. High-profile \nassassinations of prominent Colombian officials trying to put an end to \nthe drug cartels began more than 20 years ago with the 1984 murder of \nthe Minister of Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.\n  In 1985, a year later, terrorists stormed the Palace of Justice in \nColombia and murdered 11 supreme court justices, gunned down 11 supreme \ncourt justices who supported the extradition of drug traffickers.\n  A year later in 1986, another supreme court justice was murdered by \ndrug traffickers, as well as a well-known police captain and prominent \nColombian journalist who had spoken out against these cartels. These \nnarco-terrorists\n\n[[Page S11474]]\n\nthen commenced on a bombing campaign in that nation throughout the year \non shopping malls, hotels, neighborhood parks, killing scores and \nscores of innocent people and terrorizing the general population.\n  Before the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar was captured and killed by the \npolice in 1993, he had been directly responsible for the murder of more \nthan 4,000 Colombians. That was one individual.\n  It is rather heartening that despite the deaths that occurred just in \nthe last few days and the kidnappings of people who run for public \noffice, despite the fears that are pervasive in this society, some \n140,000 people allowed their names to appear on electoral ballots last \nSunday for various government offices including governors, mayors and \nother municipal posts. It is an act of real courage.\n  We are about to have an election in this country, and we think it is \na tough day if we face a negative ad run by one of our opponents or if \nwe get a screen door slammed in our face or someone calls us a name. In \nColombia, when you run for public office, even at very local levels \nyour life is in jeopardy for doing so.\n  I express my admiration for the Colombian people and the people of \ngreat courage who run for public office who try to maintain this \nstability which is critically important.\n\n  In the midst of all of this, there are over a million displaced \npeople in Colombia. An estimated 1.5 million Colombians have been \ndisplaced because of the narco-trafficking wars, and civil conflict \nthat has raged in their society. Thousands upon thousands leave \nColombia, their native country, every single year, many coming to the \nUnited States, many to Europe and elsewhere to flee the ravaging \nterrorism that is raging throughout their country.\n  This is the background for what has occurred over the four decades \nand why I wanted to take a few minutes this afternoon and make a couple \nof suggestions to the incoming new administration, whether it is an \nadministration under Vice President Gore and Joe Lieberman or one under \nGeorge Bush and Dick Cheney. It will be important as we look at Latin \nAmerica, that this be one of the dominant and first issues to be \nanalyzed and discussed and a new formulation put together to help us do \na better job in contributing to the solution of this problem.\n  In 1994, it became clear that drug money had penetrated even the \nhighest levels of Colombian society and called into question the \nlegitimacy of the Presidential election of Ernesto Samper. Even today \nfear of kidnaping and targeted killings by members of Colombia's drug \norganization has Colombia citizens living in fear for their lives.\n  Colombia's tragic situation was very much on my mind when I voted for \nthe emergency assistance requested this year. I said at that time that \nI believed it was critically important that we act expeditiously on the \nassistance package because our credibility was at stake with respect to \nresponding to a genuine crisis in our own hemisphere, one that was \ndirectly affecting the lives of our own citizens.\n  We also needed to make good on our pledge to come to the aid of \nPresident Pastrana and the people of Colombia in their hour of crisis, \na crisis that has profound implications for institutions of democracy \nin Colombia and throughout this hemisphere.\n  No one I know of asserts that things have dramatically turned around \nin Colombia since Congress passed the emergency supplemental package. \nColombians across the political spectrum struggle each and every day to \ncope with the escalating violence of warring right-wing and left-wing \nparamilitary organizations and the existence of narco-trafficking \nterrorists prepared to coopt all forms of civil society for its own \nfinancial gains.\n  The Colombian economy is in distress with the worst recession in \nmodern history causing significant unemployment, hardship among \nColombia's middle class and its poorest people.\n  The economic situation in the countryside is deeply troubling. A \nsignificant percentage of its rural population is barely able to eke \nout a living, as I mentioned earlier, with more than 1 million rural \nColombians already displaced from their villages from economic \nnecessity or continuing fear of the civil conflict.\n  Not surprisingly, these displaced persons have become the innocent \nfoot soldiers in the ever-expanding illicit coca production that gets \nprocessed into cocaine and ultimately finds its way into American \nschools and neighborhoods across this Nation.\n  As we have seen over the last several weeks and months, these \nproblems have not remained within Colombia's borders, another reason \nwhy I felt a certain urgency to talk about this subject matter this \nafternoon. The nation of Ecuador has felt the effects of conflict in \nsouthern Colombia as refugees from the drug war have fled across the \nborder into Ecuadorean territory.\n  Kidnaping for ransom, a weekly occurrence in Colombia, seems to have \naffected its neighbors. Several weeks ago, 10 foreign nationals working \nfor an oil company in Ecuador were abducted into southern Colombia. Two \nhostages were able to escape, but the fate of the remaining eight is \nunknown. Sporadic conflict has occurred in recent days with other \nneighbors.\n\n  A Panamanian village was attacked by members of a paramilitary unit \nand Colombian authorities have lodged complaints about alleged border \nincursions by Venezuelan forces seeking to eradicate illicit crops \nclose to the Colombian-Venezuelan border. The Brazilian Government has \ndeployed 22,000 troops to the Amazon region in order to strengthen its \ndefenses along its 1,000-mile border with Colombia. Sporadic fighting \nbetween Colombia forces and FARC units--that is the left-wing guerrilla \nforces--have led to unwelcome incursions into Brazilian territory by \nboth organizations.\n  Narco-traffickers have also begun to exploit the Amazon region of \nBrazil for their own purposes as well.\n  The Colombian problem is spreading. It is now reaching the borders of \nits neighbors--Ecuador, Brazil, Venezuela, and Panama. This situation \nmust be high on the agenda of this incoming administration and some new \nformulation of how to address this is in desperate need.\n  On the assistance front, at the moment the United States is carrying \nthe lion's share of responsibility for trying to help Colombia, I \nmentioned the $1.3 billion in emergency aid we adopted this year. That \nhas to change. It cannot just be the United States. Colombia's \nrequirements are significant and varied, and there are many areas where \nEuropean and regional assistance would be extremely beneficial to the \nColombian people who are on the front lines of this conflict.\n  Innocent men, women, and children are trapped in the middle of \nclashes among guerrilla organizations, drug cartels, and Colombia's \nsecurity and police forces. Government efforts to either protect them \nor create a climate where alternative gainful employment is available \nhave been insufficient, to put it mildly. U.S. financial assistance is \nheavily focused on the military component of Colombia's counter \nnarcotic efforts, with lesser amounts available for other programs, \nsuch as alternative development programs, the protection of human \nrights workers, resettlement of displaced persons, and judicial and \nmilitary reforms.\n  The United States should do more to assist Colombia on the economic \nfront by moving forward in the remaining days of this Congress--now \nthat we are going to have a lame duck session. This Congress should \nextend NAFTA parity to Colombia and other members of the Andean Trade \nPreference Agreement. This would tremendously help Colombia work its \nway out of its current economic recession, by giving a boost to an \nimportant domestic industry, in creating more jobs for average \nColombians other than in the coca fields producing cocaine.\n  I have enormous respect for the manner in which President Pastrana \nhas quickly and so aggressively taken steps to entice Colombia's \nlargest guerrilla organizations to come to the negotiating tabling \nfollowing on the heels of his election into office.\n  President Pastrana is a courageous leader, one who has personally \nbeen victimized by these kidnapings I mentioned earlier, someone who \nhas shown great courage, great leadership, in trying to bring an end to \nthe civil conflict in his country. So I admire him immensely and have \ngreat respect for the efforts he has made.\n  The agenda for these ongoing talks that President Pastrana has \npursued\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\nwas intended to cover the waterfront of economic and social issues that \nmust be addressed if four decades of civil conflict are to be brought \nto a close in Colombia.\n  Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, there has been little \ntangible progress to date in these peace efforts--not because of any \nlack of effort on the part of President Pastrana, I might add.\n  I believe Colombia needs more assistance from the international \ncommunity to help it find a formula for jump-starting this peace \nprocess and dealing with the social and economic problems in the \ncountry that have produced it.\n  I laud the interest and attention given to the peace efforts by the \nUnited Nations Secretary General, but others in a position to be \nconstructive should also become engaged before the process collapses \nentirely.\n  Moreover, in the final analysis, it is not going to be possible to \nrid Colombian society of the narco-trafficking cancer while the civil \nconflict is ongoing and a hindrance to building broad-based support for \nColombia's counter narcotics initiatives. U.S. domestic and \ninternational support would be more readily sustainable were that the \ncase as well.\n  The international community, by and large, has given only lip service \nto Colombia's problems and has resisted publicly endorsing Plan \nColombia or helping with the peace process. If regional or European \npolitical leaders have suggestions for better ways to go about \ncontaining illicit drug production in Colombia, and elsewhere, then let \nthem speak up.\n  I think it is critically important that the Organization of American \nStates take a far more active role in assisting with Colombia's current \ncrisis, particularly with respect to enhancing regional support. Among \nother things, I believe OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria should give \nserious consideration to convening an emergency summit meeting of the \nregion's leaders before this year's end. The purpose of this summit \nwould be to reach agreement on additional regional steps to ensure that \nthe operations in Colombia do not adversely impact others in \nthe region, either through increased refugee flows or relocated illicit \ndrug operations.\n\n  European governments, particularly those that have expressed concerns \nabout the social and political fallout of Plan Colombia and the ongoing \ncivil conflict, need to do far more than simply wring their hands. \nCivil society needs to be strengthened in Colombia in order to ensure \nthat every Colombian's rights are protected.\n  Additional judicial and military reforms must be implemented in order \nfor the rule of law to become the norm and military impunity to cease \nonce and for all. Economic investments, especially in alternative \ndevelopment programs, must be forthcoming if peasants who currently \ndepend on coca cultivation to feed their families are to have \nmeaningful alternative employment. All of these areas are well within \nthe financial resources and expertise of our European allies to \nundertake, if they are truly concerned about the future of Colombia.\n  For their part, Colombian authorities must undertake a sustained and \nserious dialog with local mayors, church officials, civic leaders, and \naffected communities throughout Colombia to hear from them their \nconcerns and fears about aspects of Plan Colombia that may result in \nthousands more displaced Colombians, particularly in the rural areas of \nthat nation.\n  While aerial eradication of cocoa crops seems the most effective \nmethod for attacking illicit production at the source, authorities \nshould also be open to at least considering the possibility of funding \nother methods of eradication, such as manual eradication utilizing \nlocal farmer organizations.\n  Mr. President, to sum up, what I am calling for is a major \ninternational commitment to tackle the Colombian crisis. President \nClinton has determined that Plan Colombia is worthy of U.S. support; \nthat is in our national interest to do so--and I believe it is--given \nthe impact we are feeling in our own society as a result of the narco-\ntrafficking that occurs here.\n  A bipartisan Congress signed up to that position when it voted to \nappropriate the $1.3 billion in emergency assistance. Having said that, \nI do not believe Plan Colombia can ultimately be successfully \nimplemented if only the U.S. and Colombian Governments are \nparticipants. Unless U.S.-Colombian authorities come to this view \nfairly soon and begin a serious effort to regionalize and \ninternationalize this effort, Plan Colombia is going to die on the vine \nfor lack of political support.\n  Time is running out for the people of Colombia. Frankly, time is \nrunning short for everyone committed to democracy and democratic values \nin that country. We must not let international reticence or inertia \nallow the drug kingpins to win the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11475-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11475-S11476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CONNIE MACK\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with particular and personal regret \nthat I deliver these remarks today about the Senator from Florida. In a \nnumber of areas and on a range of issues, I, like many of us, have come \nto rely on Connie Mack's knowledge and good judgment--and his good \nhumor. He has been an outstanding Senator. More importantly, I have \ncome to cherish his friendship and the friendship of his wonderful wife \nand partner for four decades, Priscilla.\n  Connie Mack is concluding his 12th year of service in the Senate. In \nthat period of time, he has accomplished a great deal for his State and \nfor our country. He has worked diligently and effectively to protect \nthe environment of his State. He stood against drilling off Florida's \nvast and majestic shoreline. He has promoted the restoration of the \nFlorida Everglades, one of our Nation's premier national treasures. \nTime and time again, in ways large and small, Connie Mack has acted to \nsafeguard his State's rare and fragile natural beauty. For this \ngeneration, and for generations to come, the name of Connie Mack will \nmean a great deal--to the citizens of Florida and people throughout the \ncountry--if for no other reason than for that contribution.\n  Perhaps the most profound contribution, however, of this very warm \nand gracious colleague of ours is the contribution he has made to our \nNation in the area of cancer awareness and medical research. In these \nareas, it can be said, I believe without any hesitation, that no one \nhas done a greater service to his fellow Americans in these last number \nof years than Connie and Priscilla Mack.\n  Connie and Priscilla know through hard personal experience the \nterrible toll that cancer and disease can take on individuals and \nfamilies. They know as well as anyone that early detection of cancer is \nthe first and best weapon in the battle to save lives. That is why they \nhave made early detection of cancer not just a concern, but a cause.\n  By educating others about the importance of early detection, by \nspreading awareness that it is an easy, fast, and safe way to save \nlives, they have played a very critical role in helping countless \nAmericans avoid the full devastation of this disease. I daresay, among \nthose tens of thousands of American men and women who every year \nconquer cancer because they detected it early, a great many of them owe \na debt of thanks to Connie and Priscilla Mack.\n  Together, they have received numerous honors and awards, including: \nthe National Coalition for Cancer Research Lifetime Achievement Award; \nthe National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship Ribbon of Hope Award; \nthe American Cancer Society's Courage Award; and Susan Komen Breast \nCancer Foundation's Betty Ford Award.\n  But Senator Mack has not been satisfied just with promoting early \ndetection. He has worked for a day when early detection of cancer and \nother diseases will no longer be necessary because they will no longer \nexist. He has worked diligently and successfully to increase our \nNation's investment in medical research. He understands that research \ncan provide answers and ultimately cures for many of the ailments that \ncontinue to plague humankind. Maybe not today, but one day.\n  And years from now, when--we hope--cures will be found, America and \nthe world will reflect with gratitude on those who dared to envision a \nbetter future by supporting the basic research from which those cures \nderived. And among those whom future generations will thank, I believe \nthat few will be thanked more than the Senator from Florida, Connie \nMack.\n\n[[Page S11476]]\n\n  In addition to witnessing his work on the environment and health, I \nhave had the pleasure to serve with Senator Mack on the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. There he brought his vast \nexperience as a community banker to bear on the critical financial \nservices issues of the day. And today our Nation's policies in the area \nof financial services bear the imprint of his experience and judgment.\n  Connie and I also served together for a time on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. There, too, he distinguished himself by his thoughtful, \ncourteous manner. And while we did not always agree--in fact, we used \nto have some good, healthy arguments on American-Cuban policies--I \nnever faced a more diligent or worthy opponent than Connie Mack. I \nalways respected his positions and the people he represented in those \ndebates. He is a worthy ally and opponent. I shall miss him.\n  For me, Connie Mack has been not only a colleague. He has been a \ngifted, accomplished leader. He has been a gentleman. And he has been a \nfriend. He has graced this institution with civility and reason. He and \nPriscilla will be sorely missed. I look forward to many years of \ncontinued friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11476-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the last colleague I want to spend a few \nminutes talking about is one we have all come to know and appreciate \nfor his valued service in the Senate and his valued service to this \ncountry over many, many years.\n  Pat Moynihan is a special Senator and a special individual. It is \nexceedingly difficult to summarize in words what this remarkable man \nhas meant to the Senate, what he has meant to our Nation, and, indeed--\nand this is no exaggeration--what he has meant to the world in which we \nlive.\n  As a soldier, a teacher, an author, an ambassador, and, over the past \nnumber of years, a Senator, very few have done so much so well. Few \nhave put so much learning and such deep understanding to the service of \nthe common good.\n  If America is the world's indispensable nation, it can be said that \nPatrick Moynihan is one of America's indispensable leaders. He is the \nonly American ever to serve in four successive Presidential \nadministrations.\n  Two of those administrations were headed by Republican presidents and \ntwo by Democrats--reflecting a bipartisan appreciation of this man's \nrare gifts of insight and effective action.\n  Pat Moynihan served as a leading domestic policy advisor under \nPresidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. Later he would be selected by \nPresident Nixon to serve as United States Ambassador to India, and by \nPresident Ford to serve as our Nation's representative to the United \nNations.\n  Pat Moynihan has written or edited some eighteen books. The subjects \nof those books reflect the extraordinary range of his intellect--from \npoverty, race, education and urban policy to welfare, arms control, \ngovernment secrecy, and international law. The list goes on.\n  He has received over sixty honorary degrees from institutions of \nhigher learning all across the globe.\n  He has received countless awards which, like his writings and his \nhonorary degrees, speak to his vast curiosity and accomplishment.\n  Among these awards are: the American Political Science Association's \nHubert Humphrey Award for ``notable public service by a political \nscientist''; the International League of Human Rights Award; the John \nLaFarge Award for Interracial Justice; the Agency Seal Medallion of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency for ``outstanding accomplishments . . . \nwith full knowledge that his achievements would never received public \nrecognition''; the Thomas Jefferson Award for Public Architecture from \nthe American Institute of Architects; the Thomas Jefferson Medal from \nthe American Philosophical Society for Distinguished Achievement in the \nArts or Humanities; and the Heinz Award in Public Policy for ``having \nbeen a distinct and unique voice in this century--independent in his \nconvictions, a scholar, teacher, statesman, and politician, skilled in \nthe art of the possible.''\n  Earlier this year, the United States Courthouse on Pearl Street in \nNew York City was named after the senior Senator from New York. It is a \nfitting and appropriate honor. No one has done more than he to make our \nNation's public buildings and public spaces reflect the high ideals and \ncommon purposes of America's citizenry.\n  For four decades he has labored to transform Pennsylvania Avenue in \nour Nation's capital. More than anyone else, he is responsible for \nreviving this majestic boulevard--in fulfillment of L'Enfant's noble \nvision of a ``grand axis . . . symbolizing at once the separation of \npowers and the fundamental unity in the American government.'' Today, \nhis guiding hand can be seen in even a cursory glance down that \navenue--in the Navy Memorial, Pershing Park, the Reagan Building, and \nAriel Rios--not to mention neighboring masterpieces such as Union \nStation and the Thurgood Marshall Building.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that ``Design activity and political \nthought are indivisible.'' The sentiments behind those words are not \njust shared by Pat Moynihan. They have functioned as a kind of code of \nconduct in his careful approach to developing America's public places. \nAnd perhaps no American since Jefferson himself has had a more profound \nimpact on the look and feel of those places than the man to whom I pay \ntribute today.\n  But he has not only worked to enshrine our ideals in our public \nplaces. He has ennobled our public discourse, and enhanced life for all \nAmericans. In so many areas he has made a deep and lasting \ncontribution. He has worked to protect our natural treasures, as well \nas our man-made ones. He has been a leader--and often a visionary--in \nsupporting cleaner, safer, faster modes of transportation. He has \nfought a long and sometimes lonely battle for humane and effective \nwelfare policy.\n  He has rung a warning bell to call upon our Nation to reform \nretirement programs for future generations. And always, always, he has \nworked to promote peace and freedom throughout the world.\n  I had the honor of serving with Senator Moynihan on the Special \nCommittee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. Senator Bennett and I \nchaired that Committee--and I think I can speak for both he and I in \nsaying that no one did more to focus the Senate and the nation's \nattention on the urgent need to address the Y2K problem than the senior \nSenator from New York. In fact, I distinctly recall a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter he sent to every Senator several years ago, in which \nhe warned about a looming technological crisis then known to only a \nhandful of people, most of them computer scientists. It was typical Pat \nMoynihan: erudite, prescient, compelling.\n  Pat Moynihan knows the good that government can accomplish when its \nleaders act with vision, courage, and cooperation.\n  But he also knows what government cannot, and should not, do or try \nto do. He told us years ago, for instance, that there is no substitute \nfor a strong family.\n  He understands only too well the sentiments expressed by the poet \nWilliam Butler Yeats:\n\n     Parnell came down the road, he said to a cheering man:\n     Ireland will get her freedom and you will break stone.\n\n  Like Yeats, Pat Moynihan knows that freedom achieved is a victory in \nand of itself. And while we may be cheering, we have to go back to the \ndrudgery of day-to-day life. But freedom and democracy are to be \ncheered.\n  The Senate will not see another like Pat Moynihan for some time \nbecause there has been no one like him. There has been no one like him \nwith whom I have had the privilege and pleasure of serving. He has done \na remarkable job for this Nation. He has made this Senate a better \ninstitution because of his presence here.\n\n  We will miss him and his good wife, Liz, who has done so much in her \nown right. We wish them the very best as they begin this new chapter of \ntheir extraordinary lives. The Good Lord is not done with Pat Moynihan \nyet. All of us expect great things coming from this very distinguished \nman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11477-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11477]]\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PAT MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened with great attention to my \nfriend, Senator Dodd, who I think expresses the feelings that we all \nhave for Senator Moynihan. I first met Senator Moynihan before I came \nto the Senate. He visited Alaska, my home. Nobody could suggest that he \nis anything but awe-inspiring, enthusiastic, and interested, the type \nwho leaves one after a short meeting with the feeling that here indeed \nis an extraordinary individual, a true statesman, a visionary. And the \ntype of individual who we have all had an opportunity to share and \nenjoy and love during his tenure here.\n  I extend my heartiest best wishes to Senator Moynihan and his family \nas he departs this body, and it is with fondness for the contributions \nhe has made. He has made this a much better body because of his \ncontributions.

Mr. President, let me remind those of you who have \nfollowed the issue of energy in this country and the contribution of \nthe nuclear industry of 20 percent of the electricity that is generated \nin this Nation, with an observation that I made some time ago, and that \nis this industry is strangling on its waste as a consequence of the \ninability of the Federal Government to honor the sanctity of a contract \nmade some years ago--that the Government would take that waste \nbeginning in 1998. The ratepayers, over the last decades, have extended \nabout $11 billion to the Federal Government to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment would be financially able to take the waste.\n  The bottom line is that 1998 has come and gone, and the Federal \nGovernment is in violation of its contractual commitment. As a \nconsequence, litigation is pending for this breach of contract, \nsubjecting the taxpayers to somewhere between $40 billion and $60 \nbillion in liability.\n  Now, I stated some time ago on this issue that if you throw the waste \nup in the air, it has to come down somewhere. Nobody wants it. I was \nwrong on that. It was thrown up in the air and now it is coming down. \nWhere is it coming down? Well, it is coming down in California, in a \nplace called San Onofre. That is near La Jolla, north of San Diego. It \nis on the California coast where there are decommissioned and operating \nnuclear plants.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Los Angeles Times of \ntoday, November 1, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 1, 2000]\n\n                Approval of Nuclear Waste Plan Advocated\n\n                            (By Seema Mehta)\n\n       Staff at the state's top coastal agency recommended \n     approval this week of Southern California Edison's plans to \n     store thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods at San Onofre \n     nuclear power plant, at least until 2050.\n       Environmentalists say the California Coastal Commission \n     will be approving the creation of a coastal nuclear waste \n     dump just south of the Orange County border, but the agency's \n     staff says it has no choice under federal law.\n       ``The state of California is preempted from imposing upon \n     nuclear power plant operators any regulatory requirements \n     concerning radiation hazards and nuclear safety,'' the staff \n     for the coastal commission emphasized in bold letters in its \n     report.\n       A federal official said that there was no risk from the \n     closely monitored nuclear waste, and that environmentalists \n     were needlessly sounding alarms.\n       ``There's a lot of fear among people who really don't \n     understand the nature of the material,'' said Breck \n     Henderson, a spokesman with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission. ``Everyone thinks nuclear waste is 55-gallon \n     drums full of green golb that we're going to throw in a hole \n     in the ground. They think the drums will rust away and, \n     pretty soon, the water in their tap glows green when it comes \n     out. That's just not the way it is.''\n       The plant's two remaining operating reactors, which provide \n     energy for 2.5 million homes from Santa Barbara to San Diego, \n     are due to shut down by 2022. A smaller reactor was shut down \n     in 1992. By law, the U.S. Department of Energy must safely \n     dispose of all the site's fuel rods, which contain spent \n     uranium and will be radioactive for thousands of years.\n       But no high-level radioactive dump exists yet, and \n     controversial plans for a possible site in the Yucca \n     Mountains in Nevada are moving at a snail's pace. Feasibility \n     studies and other technical evaluations of the remote Nevada \n     site, 237 miles northeast of Los Angeles and 90 miles \n     northwest of Las Vegas, have been so delayed that activists \n     worry that temporary storage facilities at San Onofre will \n     become a de facto permanent, West Coast repository for \n     nuclear waste.\n       ``Nothing about storing nuclear waste is temporary,'' said \n     Mark Massara, Sierra Club's coastal programs director. \n     ``Without any planning oversight or review, we're \n     establishing a nuclear waste dump on one of most heavily \n     visited beaches in all of Southern California.''\n       Henderson of the nuclear commission conceded that Yucca \n     Mountain is a ``political football, I don't know too many \n     people who expect to start shipping fuel there [soon].''\n       However, he insisted that the federal government has to \n     take responsibility for the fuel, and it will eventually. But \n     with a long line of utilities across the country waiting to \n     get rid of nuclear waste, all sides agree there will be \n     nuclear waste at San Onofre for a good half-century.\n       Spent nuclear fuel is stored in metal containers under \n     water in cooling pools at the plant. They will be wrapped in \n     two layers of steel and moved to reinforced concrete casks, \n     said Ray Golden, spokesman for San Onofre.\n       This method, known as dry casking, is considered safer than \n     the cooling pools because it requires less maintenance, \n     leaving less room for error, Henderson said.\n       But activists worry that the casks will be housed next to \n     working reactors, and could be vulnerable to terrorist \n     attack.\n       Henderson said antinuclear groups often use such scare \n     tactics. He said his agency would never allow on-site storage \n     if it were unsafe. The casks will weigh more than 100 tons, \n     and could withstand shots from antitank weapons.\n       ``You'd have to hug it for a year to get the same radiation \n     as an X-ray,'' he said.\n       State coastal commissioners can't debate any of these \n     issues.\n       ``The commission would have liked the ability to look at \n     it, to review whether this was appropriate,'' said commission \n     Chairwoman Sam Wan. ``But we didn't have the legal right to \n     do so.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this article explains that ``The \nCalifornia Coastal Commission will be approving the creation of a \ncoastal nuclear waste dump just south of the Orange County border.''\n  The repository will be at the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant, and \nthousands of spent nuclear fuel rods would be stored there by Southern \nCalifornia Edison until the year 2050. That is 50 years, Mr. President. \nIsn't it interesting that the State of California, which has refused to \nsite even a low-level nuclear waste storage facility in the Mojave \nDesert is now going to be home to a high-level nuclear waste dump near \nthe beaches of southern California?\n  Referring briefly to the proposed Ward Valley waste facility, which \nwould handle medical waste and other low-level waste--the Secretary of \nthe Interior, Bruce Babbitt, stopped this site from becoming a reality. \nAs a consequence, that waste is currently stored in hospitals and \nresearch facilities and universities--generally, anywhere near where \nthe waste is created. A lot of it is medical waste and other low-level \nwaste associated with diagnostic tests, cancer treatment and other \ntypes of medical and scientific research. But it is all over the place. \nIt is in places that weren't designed to store that waste long-term.\n  However, national environmental groups and Hollywood activists made \nWard Valley a rally cry, claiming water would be contaminated by the \nwaste and seep through the desert and ultimately into the Colorado \nRiver. This is low-level material that we are talking about. It \ninvolves clothing, like gloves and coveralls from utility workers, \nmaterial from medical research and any other items that have come into \ncontact with radioactive materials. This low-level waste is produced at \nhospitals, powerplants, and research facilities that store this waste \nand periodically transfer it to waste facilities in South Carolina or \nUtah.\n  However, these same groups apparently are powerless to stop the San \nOnofre storage. Why? Because the responsibility to regulate high-level \nwaste belongs to the Federal Government, not the State. And since the \nFederal Government has not done its job, the bottom line is that there \nis no Federal repository for high-level nuclear waste, as promised by \nthe U.S. Government. It is an obligation that has been unfulfilled by \nthe eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration,\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\nwho has chosen to ignore the contract, hoping they can get out of town \nand the election will be over before this issue comes up.\n  How ironic that this issue of the failure of the Federal Government \nto honor its contract should come up just a little less than a week \nbefore the election. As I have stated, that repository was supposed to \nopen in 1998. Failure to do so left the States to come up with their \nown solutions and subjects the taxpayers to billions of dollars in \nliability. High-level waste includes spent fuel rods removed from \nnuclear reactors. This Senator from Alaska introduced S. 1287 in this \nCongress to allow the high-level nuclear waste to go to the proposed \nYucca Mountain high-level storage facility in Nevada for temporary \nstorage as soon as the facility was licensed in 2006.\n  The California delegation voted against that bill and the Clinton \nadministration vetoed the bill. We are one vote short of a veto \noverride. One of the arguments made was that there was a possibility \nthat the nuclear waste could seep into the water table and move into \nCalifornia. Imagine that. Now I don't believe that is possible, nor do \na great number of respected scientist. However, isn't it ironic that \nCalifornians will now have to cope with those fears in their own \nbackyard because Yucca is still not opened? Rather than worry about \nwaste in Nevada, they get to worry about waste in California. The site \nat San Onofre has operational nuclear plants as well as a shut down \nresearch reactor. Unfortunately, once shut down begins, they have no \nplace to take the waste, so the waste stays there on the area adjacent \nto the Pacific Ocean, an area not designed for long-term storage of \nwaste. Nevertheless, there is no alternative because the Federal \nGovernment has failed to fulfill its obligation to take spent fuel \nbeginning in 1998.\n\n  Let me make it clear, I don't believe there is any danger from the \ndry casks that will be stored at San Onofre, any more than there was a \ndanger from the low-level waste that would have been effectively stored \nin the Mojave Desert that could not safely be stored at the Ward Valley \nsite. This California solution--if it is a solution--simply confirms \nwhat we have been saying all along: No one wants this waste, but it has \nto go somewhere. It has finally come down and landed in San Onofre. If \nthe waste isn't ultimately shipped to the temporary facility at Yucca \nMountain, it is going to be stored at 80 sites throughout the United \nStates. California now may have its own central repository, at least \nfor Southern California Edison.\n  Mr. President, this solution is not a solution. And what people need \nto realize is this situation is really just the tip of the iceberg. \nWhile it is applicable to California today, there are over 80 sites \nthroughout this country that will become de facto Yucca Mountains. That \nis the consequence of not opening up a permanent storage site. And many \nother states are in the same situation as California--waste to store \nand no place to store it. To give you some idea, in Florida, 16 percent \nof the electricity comes from nuclear plants, 5 nuclear power reactors, \nand almost 2,000 metric tons of waste is in storage. In Michigan, 24 \npercent of the electricity comes from 4 nuclear power reactors, with \n1,500 metric tons of waste on hand there.\n\n  In Ohio, 11 percent of electricity is generated from nuclear energy \nby two nuclear plants with 520 tons of waste.\n  In Washington State, 6 percent of the electricity comes from nuclear, \nand there is about 300 tons of research reactor fuel.\n  In Pennsylvania, 38 percent of its power comes from nine nuclear \nreactors with 3,000 metric tons of waste.\n  This situation in California just proves what I have been saying all \nalong. If we don't take responsible action now to solve our high-level \nwaste problems by siting a repository in the Nevada desert, we will end \nup with somewhere in the area of 80 to 100 sites throughout the Nation \nstoring this waste in environments that are not approved environments \nfor long-term storage. What is happening in California today will \nhappen all over the nation. They will now have, in California, their \nvery own mini-Yucca Mountain for the next 50 years.\n  The voters in California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, \nFlorida, and Illinois need to understand who bears the responsibility \nfor this lack, if you will, of a conscientious effort to take the waste \nat the time it was contracted for in 1998.\n  I can only assume that Vice President Gore wants to keep this waste \nin the States near schools, and hospitals--wherever it is temporarily \nstored. And the reality of what happened in California today at San \nOnofre is simply the tip of the iceberg.\n  This administration has been totally inept in meeting its \nresponsibilities to the nuclear industry; It has breached a contract, \nit has ignored the contribution of the nuclear industry and its \ncontribution to providing 20 percent of the clean, emissions-free power \ngenerated in this country; and, totally ignored the reality that with \nthat clean power comes the responsibility of determining how to handle \nthe waste.\n  They have handled it all right. They set it in concrete in California \nin the new site, as I have indicated, at San Onofre, north of San Diego \nnear La Jolla, CA.\n  Imagine creating a coastal nuclear waste just south of Orange County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11478-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11478-S11480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nSavannah River Site, located in my hometown of Aiken, South Carolina, \non it's fiftieth anniversary. On November 28, 1950, President Truman \nannounced the construction of the Savannah River Site. In celebration \nof this important milestone, I would like to insert the following essay \nrecounting the rich history of this American institution into the \nCongressional Record.\n  I would also like to extend my appreciation to Mr. James M. Gaver, \nthe Director of the Office of External Affairs at the Savannah River \nOperations Office and the unofficial ``Savannah River Site historian'' \nfor writing the following composition. I ask unanimous consent that his \nessay be inserted into the Record.\n  Without objection the essay was ordered printed in the Record.\n\n                      Essay by Mr. James M. Gaver\n\n       For the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA), the Cold War \n     created greater change than the Civil War, an unlikely \n     storyline in the deep South. Between 1950 and 1955 a \n     transformation occurred with breathtaking speed that \n     eradicated small railroad towns, farms, and mill villages \n     typical of mid twentieth-century Southern life on the \n     Savannah. These familiar agrarian settings were replaced with \n     a technological complex built and operated by men and women \n     who came from all parts of the country. International events \n     and science had come to South Carolina and Georgia in the \n     form of the Savannah River Plant. This industrial complex of \n     nine manufacturing and process areas integrated into one \n     plant was needed to produce plutonium and tritium for the \n     nation's defense.\n       The participants in the making of the Savannah River \n     Plant--scientists, engineers, construction workers, local \n     politicians, community members, and uprooted residents--were \n     a study in diversity. Yet each, driven by patriotism, \n     contributed to the success of the project. The production \n     line and laboratory were the chosen theaters of war for the \n     scores of scientists, industrial managers, engineers, and \n     support personnel of all descriptions. With families in tow, \n     they became atomic age homesteaders within the Savannah River \n     Valley. Environmental researchers joined their ranks, \n     charting physical change within the plant area and helping \n     give birth to the discipline of ecology. Construction workers \n     and craftsmen came in droves to participate in an industrial \n     and engineering ``event'' that ranked with the construction \n     of the Panama Canal. Industrial boosters and state and local \n     politicians crowed at the site selection that rooted atomic \n     energy development in the CSRA. For them, the country's need \n     marvelously coincided with the economic need of their \n     constituencies. The final profile belongs to the 6,000 \n     individuals or 1,500 families relocated from the 315 square \n     mile area selected for the plant in Aiken, Barnwell, and \n     Allendale counties, South Carolina. Their contribution was \n     remarkable, changing the course of their family's histories.\n       With Japan's surrender on August 14, 1945, Americans began \n     to celebrate the end of the war and make plans for the \n     future. Their euphoria was shortlived. It was swiftly \n     replaced by images of an Iron Curtain, Soviet domination \n     and terror, mushroom clouds, fears of radiation, and the \n     potential for mass destruction. The Cold War began in \n     Europe over the remains of Nazi Germany as the Allies \n     began planning for postwar Europe. Germany was divided \n     into two nations and the U.S. Congress appropriated \n     billions of dollars to our Allies in Western Europe for \n     defense and economic aid.\n       Between 1945 and 1947, mistrust between the United States \n     and Soviet Russia hardened into belief systems. The Truman \n     Doctrine presented to Congress on March 12,\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\n     1947, sketched out the political situation. Two worlds were \n     emerging, one in which people lived in freedom, while the \n     second was bent on coercion, terror, and oppression. Global \n     conflict resulted as opposing economic and social systems \n     were pitted against one another on a technological \n     battlefield. Furthermore, continued advancement within the \n     atomic bomb program that had just ended one war was \n     considered critical to wage the next.\n       After a job well done, some Manhattan Project scientists \n     and engineers returned to the private sector. Du Pont, the \n     main contractor for Hanford, also retired from the field of \n     atomic energy. The Manhattan Project continued with a core \n     group of atomic bomb project veterans under the direction of \n     the indomitable General Leslie Groves. The nation's third and \n     fourth plutonium bombs, Shot Able and Shot Baker, were tested \n     at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in July 1946. These tests gave \n     an invited audience of military officers, congressmen, \n     journalists, and scientists firsthand knowledge of the power \n     of the bombs. The high profile of the tests ensured that \n     atomic weapons research and development remained in the \n     forefront of the nation's defense strategy during this uneasy \n     peacetime.\n       Responsibility for America's atomic arsenal had been \n     transferred from the military to the civilian Atomic Energy \n     Commission (AEC) established by the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1946. The commission was composed of a five-member board that \n     served full-time, assisted by scientific and military \n     advisory committees. Headed by TVA veteran David Lilienthal, \n     the AEC was in the process of recasting the nation's atomic \n     energy program when the Soviets exploded their first atomic \n     weapon on August 27, 1949. On September 23, 1949, President \n     Truman announced the end of the U.S. monopoly in atomic \n     bombs. The Soviet test, named Joe I by the American press, \n     shocked the American public, its leaders, scientists, and \n     intelligence agencies. The Commission and its advisors began \n     a new evaluation of their proposed program energized by ``the \n     old spirit of emergency.''\n       The need for the thermonuclear bomb provoked serious debate \n     within a small circle of individuals that included the \n     members of the AEC's General Advisory Committee, the AEC \n     commissioners and staff, the Senate and House Joint Committee \n     on Atomic Energy, Defense Department officials, and a group \n     of concerned scientists. Would an H-bomb improve our \n     retaliatory strength enough to justify the diversion of \n     materials from the A-bomb program? Would large bombs such as \n     the ``Super'' merely give the illusion of security? No \n     consensus was reached. Truman then created a subcommittee of \n     the National Security Council. Secretary of State Dean \n     Acheson, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, and AEC Chairman \n     David Lilienthal were appointed to provide direction. \n     President Truman received the sub-committee's recommendation \n     that the United States should proceed with an all-out nuclear \n     effort. He signed this recommendation to develop all forms of \n     atomic weapons, including the ``Super,'' on January 31, 1950. \n     This recommendation would lead to the announcement of the \n     Savannah River Plant by the close of the year.\n       Preliminary designs for the new hydrogen bomb required \n     quantities of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, to \n     be fused with deuterium, another isotope of hydrogen, for \n     energy release. While Hanford's production reactors were \n     already producing tritium, weapon design in the early 1950s \n     suggested a dramatic increase in the need for tritium. To \n     provide tritium for design and testing purposes for the short \n     term, Hanford's reactors would be used. For long term \n     production, the AEC determined that two new production \n     reactors of significantly different design were to be built \n     at a new location. In May 1950, the cost of the new plant was \n     forecasted at $247,854,000 and a base of operations was \n     established in Washington in late June to shepherd the new \n     plant into reality. Curtis Nelson was selected as the AEC \n     manager for the new project. Nelson was a likely candidate. A \n     civil engineer by training with experience in managing large \n     construction projects, he was on assignment as U.S. liaison \n     to Canada's nuclear program at Chalk River, Ontario, when he \n     was posted as the manager for the new project. Highly \n     enriched uranium (HEU) fuel rods were needed to increase \n     tritium production, but the process for making tritium was \n     not yet fully tested. Data from Canada's NRX heavy-water \n     reactor that used HEU fuel rods could provide data for the \n     American effort and Nelson was already on hand. Cooperation \n     with the Canadian program could be helpful in America's bid \n     to win the arms race.\n       Du Pont was chosen as the prime contractor for the plant. \n     The chemical firm's work during the Manhattan Project at Oak \n     Ridge on the X-10 complex; the design, construction, and \n     wartime operation of the production facility at Hanford; and \n     Du Pont's postwar role as technical advisors on various \n     developing atomic energy projects positioned the Delaware-\n     based firm for the job. Du Pont was released from its Hanford \n     assignment in 1946 at its own request, turning over operation \n     of the plant to General Electric. Four years later, the firm, \n     then headed by atomic energy pioneer Crawford Greenewalt, was \n     asked by the White House and the Commission to reprise its \n     role. Du Pont's acceptance of the enormous job was announced \n     on August 2, 1950. The Du Pont firm established the Atomic \n     Energy Division (AED) within its Explosives Department and \n     began putting together a team for the new project and \n     division.\n       Planning began immediately with site selection and reactor \n     design uppermost in mind. Du Pont worked closely with the \n     AEC, helping to mold the plant it would operate. When the \n     North Korean Army drove across the 38th parallel into the \n     Republic of Korea in June 1950, the Atomic Energy Commission \n     decided to add three more reactors to the two already \n     planned, adding to the complexity of the proposed plant. With \n     legislation in place to provide a legal basis for the AEC's \n     intended acquisition, a tract in South Carolina's Barnwell \n     and Aiken counties was chosen out of 114 candidate sites for \n     the new plant. The search that began in June ended on \n     November 10th with the search committee's recommendation for \n     the South Carolina site. Water, abundant in supply and low in \n     mineral content, topography, the isolated character of the \n     site, an available labor pool, and military defense all \n     figured into the Site's selection.\n       Reaction to the public announcement of the site selection \n     on November 28, 1950 was jubilant in Georgia and South \n     Carolina. Senator Edgar A. Brown and Augusta's Chamber of \n     Commerce Secretary, Lester Moody, had been working for months \n     to secure the new plant for the CSRA. Clark Hill Dam, \n     Hartwell Dam, and the new H-bomb plant were evolutionary \n     steps in the shaping of the area's industrial future. \n     Atomic piles, known as reactors, would soon rub shoulders \n     and share the river water with Graniteville and Augusta's \n     textile mills. Newspaper headlines clamored that Augusta \n     would become a metropolis, Aiken a ``fast growing city,'' \n     and Barnwell and environs would quickly follow suit.\n       Slicing through the clamor were the voices of those \n     displaced by the plant. Residents of Ellenton (population \n     600), Dunbarton (population 231), Hawthorne, Meyers Mill, \n     Robbins, Leigh, and farmers and tenants within the outlying \n     areas listened sadly and carefully as AEC, U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers, Du Pont, and local officials outlined what was \n     ahead for them. Eighteen months were allotted for the staged \n     evacuation of 1500 families. Ellenton residents were to be \n     evacuated by March 1, 1952, Dunbarton residents by June 15. \n     Land appraisers would contact owners, beginning the \n     acquisition process. Those in construction priority areas had \n     six weeks notice. The many families who rented or \n     sharecropped for their livelihood were also deeply affected. \n     In a month usually filled with warm thoughts of home and the \n     upcoming holidays, ``the DPs,'' those displaced by the \n     federal taking, grappled with future plans under the scrutiny \n     of reporters who told their story to the nation. Some \n     displaced families chose to physically move their homes out \n     of the area, relocating in the new town of New Ellenton, \n     Jackson, or other environs. Others moved to existing \n     neighboring communities.\n       The original boundaries also included the communities of \n     Jackson and Snelling; when acquisition plans were finalized, \n     these communities were not affected. In 1952, a corridor was \n     added from the site to the Savannah River along Lower Three \n     Runs Creek in Barnwell and Allendale counties. The South \n     Atlantic Real Estate Division of the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers (COE) conducted the acquisition program, ultimately \n     acquiring 1,706 tracts of land, totaling 200,742 acres. \n     Seventy four percent of the acquired properties were farms \n     cultivated in corn, cotton, and peanuts. Small tenant farms \n     were in the majority; the agricultural labor pool was \n     predominantly African American. The plant area was closed to \n     the public on December 14.\n       Sign posted at Ellenton, South Carolina border. ``It is \n     hard to understand why our town must be destroyed to make a \n     bomb that will destroy someone else's town that they love as \n     much as we love ours, but we feel that they picked not just \n     the best spot in the U.S. but the best in the world. We love \n     these dear hearts and gentle people, who live in our home \n     town.''\n       Between January 1951 and 1955, the Atomic Energy Commission \n     constructed a self-sufficient industrial plant that was \n     considered the largest single construction job it had ever \n     undertaken. Its magnitude and scope were unequaled, in a half \n     century punctuated by immense engineering and construction \n     projects such as the Panama Canal, Tennessee Valley \n     Authority, and the AEC's own Manhattan Project-era plants at \n     Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington. At peak \n     construction in September 1952, 38,582 workers labored 54 \n     hours a week under the direction of Du Pont engineers. South \n     Carolina (25,019) and Georgia (13,776) contributed the \n     majority of the project's construction force; however, forty-\n     nine states and the Panama Canal Zone were also represented \n     in the ranks.\n       Design flowed from Du Pont and its subcontractors drawing \n     tables through the national laboratories and the Atomic \n     Energy Commission. Five reactors, two chemical separations \n     plants, a heavy water plant, a fuel and target \n     manufacturing area, and laboratories were joined by over \n     sixty miles of railroad, 230 miles of new roads, the \n     state's first cloverleaf intersection, power plants, and \n     other infrastructure. Three safety awards were earned by \n     the project, a coup for Du Pont's Construction Field \n     Manager Bob Mason. And an esprit de corps, shown in the \n     project newspaper ``SRP News and Views'' and in athletics \n     and other recreational events, was fostered by the \n     schedule, secrecy, purpose, and magnitude of the project.\n\n[[Page S11480]]\n\n       Between 1950 and 1960, the Savannah River communities grew \n     substantially as they absorbed the incoming work force. \n     Augusta grew by 25 percent, North Augusta tripled its \n     population, while Aiken, Williston, and Barnwell doubled in \n     size. Jackson, a rim community, achieved town status, as did \n     New Ellenton located to the north of the plant.\n       The trailer cities that had housed the construction workers \n     and their families were archaeological sites by 1960. More \n     lasting were an estimated 5,465 homes built to accommodate \n     operating staff and their families in the surrounding \n     counties. The Housing and Home Finance Administration \n     provided grants after AEC review to offset the expansion of \n     basic community services. The affected communities \n     experienced growing pains in all directions, as schools, \n     roads, water and sewage systems, parks, and basic community \n     needs were all impacted.\n       Inside the plant fence, the Community Chest Program was \n     chosen by the plant management as a way for workers to show \n     their community support. Each year money was energetically \n     collected in support of this program, and contributors would \n     indicate which community should receive their donation. In \n     1952, $50,908 were contributed; a year later contributions \n     soared to $74,015. The new atomic community already had \n     neighborhood pride.\n       In education, the AEC made great strides in the fields of \n     science and technology. Under an agreement with the Southern \n     Regional Education Board in 1956, a cooperative program began \n     in which college students could attend classes and work at \n     the plant alternating terms. Georgia Institute of Technology \n     and University of Florida students were the first to sign up. \n     Grants were also made to regional universities to fund the \n     development of programs in atomic energy and related fields. \n     At the high school level, science students were invited on \n     Thomas Alva Edison's birthday to come to the plant and tour \n     facilities to learn about the peaceful applications of atomic \n     energy. Civic talks were given and science fairs held. \n     Finally, membership in professional organizations abounded \n     and local chapters of heretofore national organizations were \n     established in the Central Savannah River Area.\n       Massive amounts of concrete, steel, rebar, lumber, and \n     macadam were used to create the Savannah River Plant. \n     Construction statistics are staggering, attesting to the epic \n     nature of the undertaking. However, the construction activity \n     was confined to an industrial core area, leaving a large \n     buffer zone of land untouched by industrial construction. In \n     this zone, an equally epic undertaking mostly orchestrated by \n     nature occurred. A ``garden'' grew up around the machine.\n       The U.S. Forest Service, under contract with the AEC, set \n     out about 10,000,000 pine seedlings along the plant perimeter \n     for screening and erosion control in 1952-53, and then \n     launched a forest management program for an additional 60,000 \n     acres. Their efforts, combined with the retirement of \n     thousands of acres of farmland from cultivation, the \n     impact of intensive grading from construction, and human \n     neglect factored into the making of a new landscape. A \n     green space with an incredible diversity of plant and \n     animal life grew up in its stead.\n       Scientific knowledge concerning the environmental impact of \n     industry, atomic or otherwise, was limited in 1950. Ecology \n     was a developing field. The AEC, with a strong sense of \n     stewardship, invited scientists from the Universities of \n     Georgia and South Carolina to collect baseline data on plant \n     and animal communities that would provide a ``before'' \n     picture with which to measure the impact of the Plant's \n     processes on the environment. Du Pont, already a leader in \n     the field of industrial ecology, was responsible for bringing \n     a team from the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia \n     under the leadership of Dr. Ruth Patrick to the plant to \n     perform a biological study of the Savannah River. The \n     University of Georgia developed a program that went beyond \n     inventory, that became the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. \n     Under the direction of Dr. Eugene Odum, a large-scale study \n     of ecological succession began. Ecologists studied the \n     dynamics of change within the environment as the impress of \n     centuries of agriculture disappeared and natural succession \n     occurred. Radiation ecology studies were also an early \n     research focus. While the Cold War mission was the prime \n     mover in the shaping of the Savannah River Plant, the \n     stewardship of the land acquired for that purpose was also \n     part of the compact made with the American people.\n       Since those earliest days, the employees of the Savannah \n     River Site have had sustained success in meeting their \n     commitments to the nation. They have safely fulfilled their \n     primary mission of producing plutonium and tritium for the \n     national defense--to this day the Site has maintained a 100 \n     percent on-time record of production and delivery of tritium \n     to the Department of Defense. In the realm of basic science, \n     they advanced the knowledge of particle physics with the \n     proof of the existence of the neutrino in 1956. Their \n     advances in nuclear materials production led to additional \n     missions of creating radioactive isotopes for medical \n     diagnosis and treatment; industrial and research programs; \n     and NASA space missions, from Voyager to Cassini, now on its \n     way to Saturn. They designed and built the largest \n     radioactive waste vitrification facility in the world, the \n     Defense Waste Processing Facility, where highly radioactive \n     liquid waste is transformed into a solid glass form for safe \n     storage and ultimate disposition. Their early concern for the \n     environment and study of the ecological consequences of their \n     operations led to the designation of SRS as the first \n     National Environmental Research Park in 1972. They discovered \n     the natural habitat of the bacterium that causes \n     Legionnaires' Disease.\n       The end of the Cold War brought significant change to the \n     Savannah River Site. The national defense mission continued \n     with the recycling and replenishment of tritium from \n     dismantled nuclear weapons, but increased attention was \n     brought to bear on waste management and environmental \n     restoration activities. This new focus included adapting \n     defense-specific technologies to peacetime applications, \n     which benefitted greatly from the Site infrastructure and the \n     historical expertise of the Site workforce. For example, Site \n     expertise in handling tritium (a form of hydrogen) has \n     yielded hydride technologies that have applications in the \n     transportation and energy industries. Advances in robotics \n     and environmental monitoring and cleanup technologies, such \n     as proving the existence of deep subsurface microbes and \n     employing them for in-situ remediation of wastes, have led to \n     applications not just at SRS, but across the country and \n     around the world. The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, \n     widely recognized as the birthplace of the modern science of \n     ecology, has a laboratory at Chernobyl, Ukraine, where \n     scientists share their expertise in helping the Ukrainians \n     recover from that disaster.\n       Today, the future of the Savannah River Site looks as \n     bright as it did 50 years ago. In the area of stockpile \n     stewardship, it will continue its key national defense \n     mission as the nation's sole source for tritium using a new \n     Tritium Extraction Facility now under construction. It will \n     also provide a backup source for plutonium weapon components, \n     called pits, should the nation require that increased \n     capacity. In the area of nuclear materials stewardship, it \n     will contribute to our nation's nonproliferation efforts to \n     reduce the global nuclear danger. It will receive surplus \n     weapons plutonium from other DOE sites for safe, secure \n     storage pending disposition; some of the plutonium will be \n     stored in one of the old reactors which previously created \n     the plutonium. It will prepare that surplus plutonium for \n     final disposition. One new facility will immobilize the \n     plutonium in ceramic disks that will be encased in canisters \n     of protective radioactive glass at the Defense Waste \n     Processing Facility. Other new facilities, the Pit \n     Disassembly and Conversion Facility and the Mixed-Oxide Fuel \n     Fabrication Facility, will convert the plutonium from \n     dismantled weapons into commercial reactor fuel which will \n     provide electrical power while it is slowly converted into \n     non-weapons-usable spent fuel.

Mr. President, before this session of the 106th Congress \ncomes to an end, I'd like to take the time to say farewell to Tom \nMcIlwain, who served on my staff this year as a fellow from the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Prior to coming to my staff \nin March, he served as Fishery Administrator for the NMFS Southeast \nFishery Center. Tom is a native of my hometown, Pascagoula, \nMississippi. He understands the importance of oceans and fisheries \nissues to the Gulf Coast, and the Mississippi coast in particular.\n  This is Tom's second stint as a fellow on my staff. Back when I was a \nmember of the other chamber, and Tom worked for the State of \nMississippi, he spent a year as a fellow on my staff advising me on \noceans and fisheries matters. Tom is a longtime expert in this area. \nHis advice and counsel was just as vital to me this year as it was back \nthen.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I have participated in development and passage of a \nnumber of oceans and fisheries authorization bills during this session, \nand Tom has advised me on every one of them. This year alone, he \nassisted in the enactment into public law of the National Marine \nSanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000, Fishermen's Protective Act \nAmendments of 1999, Yukon River Salmon Act of 1999, and the Fisheries \nSurvey Vessel Authorization Act of 1999, and the Senate passage of the \nPribilof Islands Transition Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act of \n2000, Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Act of 2000, Shark Finning Prohibition \nAct, Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, and Marine Mammal Rescue \nAssistance Act of\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\n1999. I expect several of the latter bills to be enacted this year.\n  Tom also identified key funding shortfalls in NMFS and State of \nMississippi programs for the Gulf of Mexico. His concern that Gulf of \nMexico needs were being overlooked as NMFS funding was increased to \naddress high-profile issues in other regions of the country led me to \nfight for additional funding for our region. The NMFS appropriation for \nFiscal year 2001 includes an additional $8.25 million for red snapper \nresearch and $1 million to expand the NMFS Mississippi Laboratory at \nPascagoula. I know he is pleased with that the State of Mississippi \nwill receive much needed additional funding for coastal impact \nassistance, almost $28 million in Fiscal Year 2001. This vital piece of \nthe Conservation and Reinvestment Act was authorized and funded this \nyear.\n  I wish Tom and his wife Janet all the best as they prepare for his \nnext assignment within NMFS. I know that whatever he does, he will \nbring to it the same keen insight, practical solutions, and good humor \nthat has served him so well in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11481-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A MEMORIAL TO ELIZABETH KNIGHT BUNCH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we were all saddened to learn of the death \nof a long-time Senate employee and good friend, Ms. Betty Bunch. Betty \ndied last week after a long struggle with a pulmonary infection.\n  Betty started working for the Senate on January 3, 1977, when she \nmoved to Washington, DC, to be the office manager for Senator Malcolm \nWallop, the Republican Senator from Wyoming. As a graduate of the \nUniversity of Wyoming, Ms. Bunch worked for some years at the \nUniversity before deciding to move East with the Senator.\n  After serving Senator Wallop for 10 years, Betty transferred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration and worked for ranking member \nSenator Ted Stevens of Alaska. In July 1991, Betty moved to the Senate \nSergeant at Arms office and worked on a number of projects for the \nEducation and Support Services team of the Computer Center.\n  One of Betty's major projects was to assist with the final \nconstruction planning for the Sergeant at Arms' operations move to the \nPostal Square building. She was very involved in the relocation of the \nSenate's computer and communications center and staff, as well as the \nfinancial and procurement staffs. This was a major initiative, and \nBetty accomplished it with the utmost professionalism.\n  Betty continued on a number of special projects for the Sergeant at \narms until her retirement in June 1999. In total, Betty served the \nSenate well for over 22 years.\n  We will all miss her loyalty, professionalism, integrity, and \nwonderful sense of humor. Her son Jamie and daughter-in-law Glennis are \nin our thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11481-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I am very concerned about how the Medicare \nprogram has chosen to pay the 10 freestanding cancer hospitals for \noutpatient services. It appears that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration has ignored the explicit intent of the provisions we \nenacted last year as part of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act--\nprovisions intended to help these critically important health care \ninstitutions.\n  Mr. ROTH. Senator, I share the Senator's concern. Last year, the \nCongress was concerned about how cancer hospitals would fare under the \nnew Medicare outpatient prospective payment system. Cancer hospitals \nface many unique costs and the advent of exciting new treatments caused \nmany to question the wisdom of applying the new outpatient prospective \npayment system to these facilities. To this end, the Finance Committee \nproposed and the Congress enacted provisions to protect these important \nfacilities.\n  In brief, this provision created a permanent ``hold harmless'' for \ncancer hospitals. We instructed the Medicare program to pay cancer \ncenters the same proportion of the facility's cost covered in 1996. In \naddition, we instructed the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to make interim payments to these facilities consistent \nwith this hold harmless.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Secretary has ignored our concerns and intent. The \nSecretary has allowed the Medicare program to withhold 15 to 20 percent \nof the interim payments owed to cancer facilities. The Medicare program \nwill not pay cancer hospitals these withheld funds for up to 4 years.\n  Mr. ROTH. I investigated this issue with the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, HCFA, to ensure that they are not proceeding in a way \nthat disadvantages these facilities and protects access to important \ncancer services. It is my understanding that the Medicare fiscal \nintermediaries are keeping the interim payments to these facilities \nartificially low in order to avoid the risk of overpayments.\n  While I think it is appropriate to make interim payments to \nfacilities as accurately as possible, paying these facilities as low as \n80-85 percent of what HCFA estimates final costs to be seems too low. \nIf in fact these reductions are lower than previous rates of reduction \nwhen a system transition has been implemented, then I strongly urge \nHCFA to immediately review their proposal to make upward adjustments in \nthe payment rates. Also, I urge the Administration to give special \nattention to the expeditious handling of the initial cost reports from \ncancer hospitals as they are submitted over the next few months in \norder to determine what appropriate payment levels need to be.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I agree with the Senator. I believe that the Secretary's \nactions are counter productive and I strongly urge including language \nin the Congressional Record that would make our intent clear.\n  Mr. ROTH. I, too, support restating within the Congressional Record \nour intent with regard to last year's Medicare bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11481-4", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11481-S11483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LABOR-HHS-EDUCATION FUNDING BILL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in every area of public policy, we have \nto make choices and set priorities.\n  How much do we spend on defense? And how much do we spend on domestic \npriorities?\n  How much do we protect our forests and natural resources? How much do \nwe allocate to health care, education, law enforcement, and other \nobvious priorities?\n  How heavy should the tax burden be? How much do we need to do to \nprotect Medicare and Social Security for the future generations?\n  Often, we have to make difficult choices.\n  But when it comes to protecting workers from injuries in the modern \nworkplace and increased investments in education, I say there is no \nchoice. It's not one or the other. We must do both.\n  But I'm convinced that our Republican friends want to do neither.\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\n  They don't want to protect workers from the dangers of the modern \nworkplace. They don't want to protect them from repetitive motion \ninjuries in their offices. Or from eyestrain at their computer screens.\n  But they also don't want to make the targeted investments in \neducation that we need for smaller class sizes, quality teachers, and \nmodern schools.\n  On Sunday night, Republican and Democratic House and Senate \nappropriators and the White House came to a bipartisan agreement on \nincreasing funding for the nation's schools and communities.\n  On Monday, the Republican leadership rejected that agreement, \njeopardizing critical support for the nation's public schools, college \nstudents, families, and workers.\n  Once again, the GOP Congress has earned the name the ``Anti-Education \nCongress.''\n  Once again, the GOP Congress is putting special interests ahead of \neducation.\n  They failed to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nfor the first time in 35 years. Last May, we considered only eight \namendments to the bill over six different days, when Senator Lott \nsuddenly abandoned the debate and moved to other legislation. The bill \nhas never seen the light of day again.\n  By contrast when the bankruptcy bill was debated, our Republican \ncolleagues did everything they could to satisfy the credit card \ncompanies. That bill was debated for 16 days, and 55 amendments were \nconsidered.\n  Now, while schools and parents wait to see whether Congress will \nincrease its investment in education, Republicans find time to bring up \nthe bankruptcy bill again.\n  Obviously, when the credit card companies want a bill, our Republican \nfriends put everything else aside to get it done. But when it comes to \neducation, the voices of parents and children and schools and \ncommunities always go unheard.\n  Every year since they have been in the majority, Republicans have \nleft education funding until the very end. As we've had to do every \nyear since the GOP took over the majority in Congress in 1995, we must \nbe especially vigilant on education funding. Over and over, we've heard \nthe Republican rhetoric of support, but the reality is just the \nopposite.\n  They say education is a priority. We thought the Republicans might \nfinally put aside their opposition to education. But it's all talk and \nno action.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, on January 6, 1999, Senator Lott \nsaid, ``Education is going to be a central issue this year . . . For \nstarters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. That is important.''\n  As recently as July 25, Senator Lott said, ``We will keep trying to \nfind a way to go back to this legislation this year and get it \ncompleted.''\n  They say they want to invest in education, but their record shows \nthey won't and don't. Year after year, it's the same sad story.\n  In 1995, they tried to abolish the Department of Education and slash \n$1.7 billion of education funds.\n  In FY96, they proposed to cut discretionary funds for education by \n$3.9 billion, and to cut for student loans by $14 billion.\n  In FY97, they proposed to cut education by $3.1 billion. In FY98, \nthey tried to cut education by $200 million below the President's \nrequest, and in FY99 they tried to cut education by $2.8 billion below \nthe President's request.\n  With the strong leadership of President Clinton, all of these \nreactionary GOP anti-education schemes were defeated, and federal \nfunding for education steadily increased.\n  Nevertheless, the anti-education Republicans in Congress continue to \ngive education the lowest priority. They say they want to make \neducation a high priority--but their rhetoric never matches the \nreality. It's four weeks after the fiscal year began, and the \nRepublicans have just rejected a strong bipartisan education funding \nagreement. And now, for the GOP, the education funding bill is MIA--\nmissing in action.\n\n  The House Republican majority did break their word when they rejected \nthe bipartisan education funding agreement. They broke their word to \nthe appropriators and the White House who negotiated the agreement. \nAnd, they broke their promise to the American people that they would do \nsomething for education across the country.\n  I want to be sure that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nunderstand what was at stake in the agreement.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting \n$1.75 billion to reduce class size. That's an increase of $450 million \nover last year, to help communities hire an additional qualified \nteachers to reduce class size in the early grades to 18.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting $1 \nbillion for after-school activities--an increase of $547 million over \nlast year.\n  Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are \nhome alone after school. Juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours \nbetween 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Children left unsupervised are more likely to \nbe involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of \nbehavior.\n  Under the successful 21st Century Community Learning program, \nstudents are able to have expanded learning opportunities in school \nfacilities, in cooperation with community organizations and other \neducational and youth development agencies.\n  Massachusetts has greatly benefitted from this successful program. \nWorcester Public Schools received a $1.2 million federal grant recently \nto expand after-school opportunities. Boston received $306,000, so that \nthree middle schools in high need areas can create high-quality \nlearning centers that meet the needs of their communities. Chelsea, \nHolyoke, and Springfield have also received grants under this vital \nprogram. We should help more communities increase after-school \nopportunities for children.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is also \nrejecting $585 million for teacher quality programs, an increase of \n$250 million over last year. That means denying millions of teachers \naccess to high quality professional development and mentoring. With \ntraining in proven effective teaching practices and the newest \ntechnologies, teachers can help all children meet high academic \nstandards and graduate from school prepared for the 21st century \nworkplace.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting \n$6.6 billion for IDEA, an increase of $1.7 billion over last year. That \nmeans undermining local efforts to help children with disabilities get \na good education.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting \n$250 million for states to help failing schools, an increase of $116 \nmillion over last year. That means denying help needed to turn around \nthousands of low-performing schools.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting a \nmaximum Pell grant of $3,800, an increase of $500 over last year. That \nmeans denying many needy college students a much-needed increase in \ntheir Pell grants.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting \n$325 million for GEAR UP, an increase of $125 million over last year. \nThat means denying low-income middle and high school students the extra \nmentoring and financial assistance they make college a reality for \ntheir future.\n  By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting a \nnew program to provide $1.333 billion for school repair and renovation. \nThat means denying schools the support they need to meet their most \nurgent repair and renovation needs.\n  Elementary and secondary schools are in urgent need of repair and \nrenovations, so that students can learn and teachers can teach in safe \nand up-to-date facilities. It's estimated that $112 billion is needed, \njust to repair existing schools across the nation in poor condition. \nNearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 \nmillion children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in \nsubstandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school \nbuildings aren't the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in \nalmost every community--urban, rural, or suburban.\n  Sending children to learn and teachers to teach in dilapidated, \novercrowded facilities sends a message to\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\nthese students and their teachers. It tells them they don't matter. No \nCEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher \nshould have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can \nto ensure that children are learning in safe, modern buildings.\n  Republicans have also rejected the Administration's proposal to \nprovide $25 billion in interest-free bonds to help communities build \nand modernize 6,000 new schools to alleviate overcrowding and repair \ncrumbling and dilapidated buildings.\n  The President's proposal is the right approach because it maintains \nDavis-Bacon protections for workers. The Davis-Bacon Act requires \ncontractors to pay construction workers locally prevailing wages, \nthereby ensuring that federally assisted construction projects are not \nused to undermine local wages. Paying prevailing wages ensures that \ntaxpayers have quality construction work performed by well trained, \nhighly skilled, efficient workers. It is short-sighted and unacceptable \nto build new schools for children to improve their learning, and then \nallow construction workers to be paid sub-standard wages.\n  Republicans opposed to Davis-Bacon continue to repeat the myth that \nthe Davis-Bacon Act increases the cost of school construction. Study \nafter study shows that it does not. Recent studies of prevailing wage \nlaws in Michigan, in Maryland and other Mid-Atlantic states, and in New \nMexico and other western states, show that prevailing wage laws do not \nincrease the cost of school construction.\n  Congress has given strong bipartisan support to the Davis-Bacon Act \never since it was first passed in 1931. Paying prevailing wages makes \ngood policy sense. It enhances productivity and quality. It strengthens \nskills training in the construction industry. It protects the wages and \nbenefits of local construction workers. Even Ronald Reagan promised to \nsupport Davis-Bacon.\n  Republican leaders should be ashamed of themselves for denying this \nurgently needed help for schools, communities, and families across the \ncountry.\n  The Republican Congress has put education last too many times, and it \nshould be held accountable in the voting booths on November 7.\n  Voters should also recognize that the Republican candidate for \nPresident, Governor Bush, has a track record that is no better on \neducation, and he should be held accountable, too.\n  If Governor Bush's record in Texas is any indication, average \nAmericans--who work day after day to make ends meet--will be an after-\nthought in a Bush Administration.\n  The Republican Congress says he has the answers on education. He \ncalls his record in Texas an ``education miracle.'' But if you look at \nthe record, it is more of an ``education mirage'' than an ``education \nmiracle.''\n  Under Governor Bush, in 1998, according to the National Center for \nEducation Statistics, Texas ranked 45th in the nation in high school \ncompletion rates. 71 percent of high school dropouts in Texas are \nminorities. Hispanic students in Texas drop out at more than twice the \nrate of white students in the state.\n  So if education is the biggest civil rights issue in America, as \nGovernor Bush claimed in the Presidential debates, he flunked the test \nin Texas.\n  Last August, the College Board reported that nationally, from 1997 to \nthe year 2000, SAT scores have increased--but in Texas, they have \ndecreased. In 1997, Texas was 21 points below the SAT national \naverage--and by 2000, the gap had widened to 26 points.\n  Then, last Thursday, Governor Bush heard more bad news. The RAND \nCorporation released an education bombshell that raises serious \nquestions about the validity of even the gains in student achievement \nin Texas claimed by the Governor.\n  The RAND bombshell was all the more embarrassing, because in August, \nGovernor Bush said, ``Our state . . . has done the best . . . not \nmeasured by us but measured by the RAND Corporation, who take an \nobjective look as to how states are doing when it comes to educating \nchildren.''\n  Clearly, at that time, Governor Bush trusted the conclusions made by \nthe RAND Corporation. He was referring to a RAND report that looked at \nscores in Texas from 1990 to 1996. In fact, Senator Hutchison cited \nthose findings on the floor of the Senate on Thursday.\n  But most of the years covered by the earlier RAND report were before \nBush became Governor. The new RAND report, released earlier this week, \nanalyzes scores from 1994 to 1998, when George W. Bush was the \nGovernor.\n  The achievement gap in Texas is not closing--it is widening. And what \nis the Governor's solution? Tests, tests, and more tests. In August, \nGovernor Bush said, ``Without comprehensive regular testing, without \nknowing if children are really learning, accountability is a myth, and \nstandards are just slogans.''\n  We all know that tests are an important indication of student \nachievement. But the RAND study questions the validity of the Texas \nstate test, because Governor Bush's education program was ``teaching to \nthe test,'' instead of genuinely helping children to learn.\n  If we want a true solution, we should look at the success of states \nsuch as North Carolina, which is improving education the right way--\ninvesting in schools, improving teacher quality, and expanding after-\nschool programs--all in order to produce better results for students. \nSAT scores went up in North Carolina by 10 points between 1997 and \n2000.\n  The Bush Plan mandates tests and more tests for children--but it does \nnothing to ensure that schools actually improve and children actually \nlearn.\n  We know that immediate help for low-performing schools is essential. \nWe know that we can turn around failing schools, when the federal \ngovernment and states and parents and local schools work together as \npartners to provide the needed investments.\n  In North Carolina, low-performing schools are given technical \nassistance from special state teams that provide targeted support to \nturn around low-performing schools. In the 1997-98 school year, 15 \nNorth Carolina schools received intensive help from these state \nassistance teams. In August 1998, the state reported that most of these \nschools achieved ``exemplary'' growth--and not one of the schools \nremained in the ``low-performing'' category. Last year, 11 North \nCarolina schools received similar help. Nine met or exceeded their \ntargets.\n  That's the kind of aid to education that works--not just tests, but \nrealistic action to bring about realistic change for students' \neducation.\n  Instead of taking steps that work, Governor Bush abandons low-\nperforming schools. He proposes a private school voucher plan that \ndrains needed resources from troubled schools and traps low-income \nchildren in them.\n  In the Vietnam War, it was said that we had to destroy some villages \nin order to save them. That's what Governor Bush has in store for \nfailing schools--a Vietnam War strategy that will destroy schools \ninstead of saving them.\n  Parents want smaller class sizes, where teachers can maintain order \nand give children the one-on-one attention they need to learn.\n  Parents want qualified teachers for their children--a qualified \nteacher in all of their classes.\n  Parents want schools that are safe and modern learning environments \nfor their children.\n  Parents and students alike want an increase in Pell Grants, to help \nstudents afford the college education they need in order to have \nsuccessful careers in the new economy.\n  The vast majority of Americans want us to address these challenges. \nAnd Al Gore and Democrats in Congress will do just that. They will \ncontinue to fight hard and well for the education priorities that \nparents and local schools are demanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11483-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11483-S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDUCATION PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today is November 1st, one month after \nthe beginning of the new fiscal year and less than one week before the \n2000 elections. Most of us in this body had anticipated that by now, we \nwould be home in our respective states instead of here in Washington. \nHowever, we are once again in the midst of gridlock with a President \nwho, despite his eight years in office, still does not understand how \nto delineate the proper role of government at the federal, state and \nlocal level.\n\n[[Page S11484]]\n\n  Our forefathers referred to this differentiation as federalism, and \noutlined this relationship in the 10th Amendment:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are \n     reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Just the other day, in response to his veto of the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill, the President made the claim that we in Congress \nwere taking care of ourselves first before we take care of education, \nand that he could not ``in good conscience'' sign a bill that would do \nso.\n  I would say to the Chair that I am as committed to the need to \nprovide our children with a quality education as any member of this \nbody--Democrat or Republican--and just as committed as the President.\n  But what the President and my friends on the other side want to do \nwith respect to education is all wrong and it smacks of election year \npolitics.\n  The reality is that the President has his priorities all mixed up. \nOver the last eight years, he has missed a fundamental opportunity to \nreform Social Security. Over the last eight years, he has missed the \nopportunity to reform Medicare. Over the last eight years, he has \nmissed the opportunity to revamp and upgrade our military.\n  As my colleagues know, both Governor Bush and Vice President Gore \nhave made education among their top priorities in their campaigns. As \nsuch, I believe in a few short months from now, Congress and the new \nPresident will work together to craft an ESEA reauthorization bill, \nwhich I am confident will pass quickly and be signed into law.\n  However, instead of waiting a few months to allow his successor the \nopportunity to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nESEA, this President seems consumed with constructing education policy \nthrough the appropriations process.\n  In this appropriation cycle, the President has demanded more than $4 \nbillion in new education spending primarily for additional teachers, \nafter school programs and school facilities, plus billions of \nadditional dollars for school construction bonds.\n  Let me state emphatically to my colleagues: these activities are not \nfederal responsibilities.\n  What is a federal responsibility is giving state and local leaders \nthe flexibility to spend funds the way that makes the most sense for \ntheir particular school districts.\n  On this side of the aisle, we are saying, ``we trust our teachers, \nand principals and school superintendents to make decisions on \neducation spending.'' We are saying we will give you education funds \nand if you want to spend them on hiring teachers or building schools \nyou can, but if your needs are new technology or books or training or \nspecial education, you ought to be able to spend the money on those \nprograms. This is the right approach.\n  Throughout American history, the federal government's role in \neducating America's youth has traditionally been relatively minor. The \nU.S. Constitution and the Federalist Papers affirm that the primary \nresponsibility for education lies with those closest to our students in \nour states and localities.\n  It is parents, teachers, local school districts and states who have \ndone the lion's share with respect to educating our children, not \nWashington. And the numbers back up this fact.\n  Right now in America, the Federal Government only provides 7 percent \nof the funds for education.\n  Let me repeat that because that fact is hardly ever discussed: the \nFederal Government only provides 7 percent of the funds for education \nin this nation.\n  That means 93 percent of each dollar that is spent on education comes \nfrom state taxes or local taxes or some other non-federal source.\n  Yet, this Administration would have the American people believe that \nall good things spring from Washington and that ``top down'' command-\nand-control policies from the White House work best.\n  To them, the local school districts in America--the parents and \nteachers and administrators across this nation--have no earthly idea \nhow to educate their own children, nor do they know what their needs \nare.\n  Believe it or not, most states are already investing in teachers and \nin school construction and in technology and after school programs.\n  Most States have the money to pay for education--for teachers, for \nclassroom materials, and for school construction.\n  The National Governors Association reports that 46 states have a \nbudget surplus and at least 36 states have a comfortable surplus. As a \nresult, many states have been able to increase spending on education \nwhile cutting taxes.\n  Does it make sense, then, for the White House to dangle a $4 billion \ncarrot in front of America's school districts when so many states are \nreporting budget surpluses and are cutting taxes?\n  The federal government has billions of dollars of unmet needs.\n  We have a national debt of $5.7 trillion--a debt that is costing us \n$224 billion in interest payments a year, and $600 million per day just \nto pay the interest.\n  Out of every federal dollar that is spent, 13 cents will go to pay \nthe interest on the national debt. In comparison, 16 cents will go for \nnational defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense discretionary \nspending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. Right now, we \nspend more federal tax dollars on debt interest than we do on the \nentire Medicare program.\n  Yet the President is willing to spend billions of dollars on what are \nstate and local government responsibilities instead of targeting those \nfunds on what are true federal needs.\n  Clearly, states are the ones with the resources for school \nconstruction, and they are, in fact, using them for that purpose.\n  When I was Governor, I felt so strongly about the importance of \nbuilding new schools that I started the Ohio School Facilities \nCommission. Because of what we were able to do in Ohio, the General \nAccounting Office reported earlier this year that Ohio's increase in \nschool construction spending from 1990-1997 was the ninth greatest in \nthe nation in percentage terms, and the eighth greatest in terms of \ndollar amount.\n  In addition, thanks to the settlement our states have negotiated with \nthe tobacco industry--something I fought hard to achieve--Ohio has more \nthan $10 billion in additional revenues.\n  Governor Taft has pledged to fully address the facility needs of \nevery Ohio school district within the next 12 years. His proposal for \nallocating $23 billion in state and local resources included a plan to \nfund the building needs of Ohio's 49 vocational school districts, \naccelerate the pace of work for our largest urban school districts, and \nin short give all districts an opportunity to address their immediate \nfacility needs.\n  And in New Jersey, Governor Christine Todd Whitman announced recently \nthat her state has begun spending money on a plan to build $12 billion \nworth of classrooms over the next 10 years.\n  States have invested in teachers as well. In Ohio, we realized that \nyoung teachers needed mentors to show the way. So we started a program \nthat pays teachers $1,500 to serve as mentors to younger teachers.\n  And because professional development is important, I initiated Ohio's \nparticipation in the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards.\n  I felt it was so important for us to prepare our teachers that we \nbegan encouraging teachers in Ohio to participate by paying their \napplication fees and the cost to take the test. Teachers who passed the \nNational Board of Professional Teaching Standards certification process \nwere rewarded with a bonus of $2,500 for 10 years.\n  As a result of these commitments, Ohio has ranked fourth in the \nnation in professional development by the National Commission on \nTeaching and America's Future. And Congress continues to recognize the \nvalue of this organization.\n  In short, like most states, Ohio is getting it done for education. \nBut what really upsets me is the fact that the President is calling on \nOhio taxpayers to send money to Washington so that the federal \ngovernment can turn around and send it to states that are not meeting \ntheir responsibilities--responsibilities that are totally and \nabsolutely state or local obligations.\n  Right now, the President is pushing to spend $1.75 billion on a \nschool class size reduction program, but, with\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\n120,000 teachers already in Ohio, this program at best yields only 1.5% \nincrease in the number of teachers in my state.\n  In fact, even if the President gets all the money he wants, 47% of \nOhio's public school districts and community schools will not even \nreceive enough money from the President's program to hire a single \nteacher. Not a single one.\n  The Clinton class size reduction proposal undermines local control \nand the ability of school districts to spend money where it is needed \nmost. But it goes to the point that the Clinton-Gore administration \nwants to be all things to all people.\n  I say to my colleagues, if we really want to do something for \neducation, then we should live up to the federal commitment to IDEA.\n  In 1975, Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct (IDEA), a program designed to help mainstream young men and women \nwith disabilities so they could obtain a quality education. Congress \nthought it was such a national priority, that it promised that the \nFederal Government would pay up to 40 percent of the cost of this \nprogram.\n  However, through fiscal year 2000, the most that Washington provided \nto our school districts under IDEA is 12.6 percent of the educational \ncosts for each handicapped child. The remainder of the cost for IDEA \nfalls on State and local governments.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed two amendments that I offered \nregarding IDEA. The first said that Washington should live up to its \ncommitment to fund IDEA at the 40% level before it allocates new \neducation money.\n  The second would allow school districts to use federal money for \nIDEA. Or, if the district wanted to spend the money on new teachers or \nnew facilities, they could do so.\n  If the Federal Government was fully funding IDEA, most of the \neducation initiatives the President and my colleagues are proposing--\nschool construction, after-school programs, and new teachers--could be \nand likely would be taken care of at the State and local level.\n  The Federal Government does have important responsibilities like \nnational defense, infrastructure, Medicare and Social Security and we \nmust also look at real federal priorities such as prescription drugs \nand responding to the cries of our health care system that has been \nshort changed by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. However, Washington must \nfigure out how to sustain paying for its responsibilities before making \nnew commitments.\n  Because of the President's spending programs, the Labor HHS \nappropriations bill is, at last count, already at $113 billion. Last \nyear, we spent $96 billion for the same bill. That's nearly an 18 \npercent increase.\n  This appropriations bill contains more than $43 billion for the \nDepartment of Education. In the President's own budget, he asked for \nonly $40 billion. Still, that is almost double the $21.1 billion in \ndiscretionary education spending allocated by the Federal Government \njust 10 years ago in fiscal year 1991, and nearly 5 times the $8.2 \nbillion spent on discretionary education spending 25 years ago in 1976.\n  The President and my colleagues across the aisle must stop acting as \nif they are the Nation's school board, trying to fund every education \nprogram possible.\n  I believe our State and local leaders should be given the flexibility \nthey need to spend their Federal education dollars to live up to our \nobligations with respect to IDEA, freeing them to address state and \nlocal education needs that have not yet been met.\n  It is my hope that in the waning days of this Congress, we will find \nthe strength to recognize what is a federal responsibility and what is \nnot and act accordingly. We can no longer count on the President to do \nso: it is up to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11485-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OBJECTION TO PROCEEDING TO H.R. 4020\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I strongly believe that reform of our \nbankruptcy laws is necessary. During the 105th and 106th Congress, I \nhave supported legislation to reform bankruptcy laws and end the abuse \nof the system. However, I am very disappointed that I am unable to \nsupport the conference report of the Bankruptcy Reform Bill because I \nbelieve it is unfair and unbalanced, was completed without appropriate \nconsideration by the Minority party, includes an inequitable homestead \nprovision and is unfair to many working families.\n  I am very concerned that the decision to file for bankruptcy is too \noften used as an economic tool to avoid responsibility for unsound \nbusiness decisions and reckless acts by both individuals and \nbusinesses. There has been a decline in the stigma of filing for \nbankruptcy and appropriate changes are necessary to ensure that \nbankruptcy is no longer considered a lifestyle choice.\n  This legislation includes a number of important reforms which I \nsupport. I am pleased that the small business provisions originally \nincluded in the Senate bill have been changed to give small businesses \nadequate time to develop a reorganization plan during bankruptcy \nproceedings. I had previously included an amendment to the Senate bill \nthat increased this time for small businesses. I am also pleased that \nthe conference report includes my amendment to expand the credit \ncommittee membership under Chapter 11 bankruptcies to include small \nbusinesses. I believe this will ensure better access and information \nfor small businesses creditors. Unfortunately, reasonable and necessary \nreforms were included in a bill that on the whole fails to take a \nbalanced approach to bankruptcy reform. I had hoped that through a \nlegitimate legislative process we would arrive at a compromise that \nwould have ended the abuses but still provided our most vulnerable \ncitizens with adequate protections. Instead, I believe that the \nconference report protects wealthy debtors by allowing them to use \noverly broad homestead exemptions to shield assets from their \ncreditors. The Senate passed, by a bipartisan vote of 76-22, an \namendment to create a $100,000 nationwide cap on any homestead \nexemption. However, this provision was not included in the Conference \nReport. Instead, the conferees included a meaningless cap with a two-\nyear residency requirement that wealthy debtors could easily avoid. \nMoreover, the bill's safe harbor is illusory and will not benefit \nindividuals in most need of help. Because the safe harbor is based on \nthe combined income of the debtor and the debtor's spouse, many single \nmothers who are separated from their husbands and who are not receiving \nchild support will not be able to take advantage of the safe harbor \nprovision.\n  I am also very disappointed that the conference report does not \ninclude an amendment offered by Senator Collins and myself, which was \nincluded in the Senate bill, that would make Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code, which now applies to family farmers, applicable\n\n[[Page S11486]]\n\nfor fishermen. I believe that this provision would have made bankruptcy \na more effective tool to help fishermen reorganize effectively and \nallow them to keep fishing while they do so.\n  In addition to its failure to protect many consumers, the bill fails \nto require that the credit industry share responsibility for reducing \nthe number of bankruptcy cases. It does not require specific \ndisclosures on monthly credit card statements that would show the time \nit would take to pay off a balance and the cost of credit if only \nminimum payments are made. It also does nothing to discourage lenders \nfrom further increasing the debt of consumers who are already \noverburdened with debt.\n  Finally, this bill is the result of a conference process that \nviolated and deprived the rights of Senators. In October, the House \nappointed conferees for the Bankruptcy Reform Act and without holding a \nconference meeting, the Majority filed a conference report striking \ninternational security legislation and replacing with a reference to a \nbankruptcy reform bill introduced earlier that same day. This makes a \nmockery of the legislative process and demeans the United States \nSenate.\n  I am hopeful that during the 107th Congress, we can develop \nbipartisan legislation that would encourage responsibility and reduce \nabuses of the bankruptcy system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11486-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BBA CUTS TO MEDICARE PROVIDERS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nimportant issue of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, its revision \nin 1999, and the importance of providing further relief to the many \npatients and providers who have been negatively affected by its \nimplementation.\n  The BBA included a series of cuts to Medicare providers, including \nhospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies. Though intended to \ncut about $112 billion from Medicare over the five-year period from \n1998 to 2001, recent estimates indicate that over twice that amount \nwill be cut by the BBA. And although Congress restored about $16 \nbillion in funding to Medicare in 1999, much work remains to be done. \nParticularly in rural America, Congress should restore funding to \nMedicare programs for telehealth, hospital and home health care, among \nothers.\n  Nationwide, 25 percent of seniors live in rural areas. And though the \nBBA has hit all hospitals hard, rural facilities have suffered \ndisproportionately from the 1997 legislation. According to a June \nreport by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, small rural \nhospitals have significantly lower operating margins than rural \nfacilities, on average 0.4 and 3.8 percent, respectively. Congress will \ndo America's rural hospitals a great disservice by not enacting further \nBBA relief this year.\n  With respect to telemedicine, a means of providing care for Medicare \nbeneficiaries with the use of advanced telecommunications equipment, \nCongress can act this year to further the use of this important tool. \nMr. President, in my state of Montana, where over 75 percent of seniors \nlive in rural areas, there is no psychiatrist east of Billings--an area \nthe size of the State of Florida. Telemedicine could work wonders \ntoward providing rural beneficiaries with access to specialty care, \nincluding psychiatric care. Although Congress mandated telehealth \nreimbursement as part of the BBA, the scope of that reimbursement is \nvery limited.\n  We should also provide relief for home health care, one of the areas \nhit hardest by the BBA. Originally scheduled for a $16 billion cut, \nhome health payments under Medicare were actually reduced by more than \n$68 billion, over four times the original amount intended. We need to \npreserve access to home care services by eliminating the scheduled 15 \npercent additional reduction in Medicare reimbursement. We should also \nprovide 10 percent bonus payments to rural home care agencies, a \nprovision that was included in both the Senate Finance and House Ways \nand Means BBA relief bills this year.\n  Mr. President, Congress should not let politics and partisan \npriorities to interfere with providing a basic human need to the people \nof our country. I urge my colleagues join me by acting on further BBA \nrelief this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11486-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11486-S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ERGONOMICS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, OSHA has been attempting to implement an \nergonomics standard for the past ten years. But each year, Congress has \ndelayed the standard. And now, even though a bipartisan group of \nappropriators agreed to a reasonable compromise on this issue late \nSunday night, the Republican leadership rejected it--because the \nbusiness lobbyists demanded it and insisted that millions of workers \nwait even longer for a safe and healthy workplace.\n  Each year, 1.7 million workers suffer from ergonomic injuries, and \nnearly 600,000 workers lose a day or more of work because of these \ninjuries suffered on the job. Ergonomic injuries account for over one-\nthird of all serious job-related injuries.\n  These injuries are painful and often crippling. They range from \ncarpal tunnel syndrome, to severe back injuries, to disorders of the \nmuscles and nerves. Carpal tunnel syndrome keeps workers off the job \nlonger than any other workplace injury. This injury alone causes \nworkers to lose an average of more than 25 days, compared to 17 days \nfor fractures and 20 days for amputations.\n  The ergonomics issue is also a women's issue, because women workers \nare disproportionately affected by these injuries. Women make up 46 \npercent of the overall workforce--but in 1998 they accounted for 64 \npercent of repetitive motion injuries and 71 percent of carpal tunnel \ncases.\n  The good news is that these injuries are preventable. The National \nAcademy of Sciences and the National Institute of Occupational Safety \nand Health have both found that obvious adjustments in the workplace \ncan prevent workers from suffering ergonomic injuries and illnesses.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the nation's worker \nprotection laws keep pace with changes in the workforce. Early in this \ncentury, the industrial age created deadly new conditions for large \nnumbers of the nation's workers. When miners were killed or maimed in \nexplosion after explosion, we enacted the Federal Coal Mine Safety and \nHealth Act. As workplace hazards became more subtle, but no less \ndangerous, we responded by passing the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct to address hazards such as asbestos and cotton dust.\n  Now, as the workplace moves from the industrial to the information \nage, our laws must evolve again to address the emerging dangers to \nAmerican workers. Ergonomic injuries are one of the principal hazards \nof the modern American workplace--and we owe it to the 600,000 workers \nwho suffer serious ergonomic injuries each year to address this problem \nnow.\n  Ergonomic injuries affect the lives of working men and women across \nthe country. They injure nurses who regularly lift and move patients. \nThey injure construction workers who lift heavy objects. They harm \nassembly-line workers whose tasks consist of constant repetitive \nmotions. They injure data entry workers who type on computer keyboards \nall day. Even if we are not doing these jobs ourselves, we all know \npeople who do. They are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons \nand daughters, friends and neighbors--and they deserve our help.\n  We need to help workers like Beth Piknick of Hyannis, Massachusetts, \nwho was an intensive care nurse for 21 years, before a preventable back \ninjury required her to have a spinal fusion operation and spend two \nyears in rehabilitation. Although she wants to work, she can no longer \ndo so. In her own words, ``The loss of my ability to take care of \npatients led to a clinical depression. . . . My ability to take care of \npatients--the reason I became a nurse--is gone. My injury--and all the \nlosses it has entailed--were preventable.''\n  We need to help workers like Elly Leary, an auto assembler at the \nnow-closed General Motors Assembly plant in Framingham, Massachusetts. \nLike many, many of her co-workers, she suffered a series of ergonomic \ninjuries--including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. Like others, \nshe tried switching hands to do her job. She tried varying the sequence \nof her routine. She even bid on other jobs. But nothing helped. Today, \nyears after her injuries, when she wakes up in the morning, her hands \nare in a claw-like shape. To get them to open, she has to run hot water \non them.\n\n[[Page S11487]]\n\n  We need to help workers like Charley Richardson, a shipfitter at \nGeneral Dynamics in Quincy, Massachusetts in the mid-1980's. He \nsuffered a career-ending back injury when he was told to lift a 75 \npound piece of steel to reinforce a deck. Although he continued to try \nto work, he found that on many days, he could not perform the lifting \nand the use of heavy tools. For years afterwards, his injury prevented \nhim from participating in basic activities. But the loss that hurt the \nmost was having to tell his children that they couldn't sit on his lap \nfor more than a few minutes, because it was too painful. To this day, \nhe cannot sit for long without pain.\n  We need to protect workers like Wendy Scheinfeld of Brighton, \nMassachusetts, a model employee in the insurance industry. Colleagues \nsay she often put in extra hours at work to ``get the job done.'' She \ndeveloped carpal tunnel syndrome, using a computer at work. As a \nresult, Wendy lost the use of her hands, and is now permanently unable \nto do her job, drive a car, play the cello, or shop for groceries.\n  Even though it may be too late to help Beth, Elly, Charley and Wendy, \nworkers just like them deserve an ergonomics standard to protect them \nfrom such debilitating injuries.\n  As long ago as 1990, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole in the Bush \nAdministration called ergonomic injuries ``one of the nation's most \ndebilitating across-the-board worker safety and health illnesses.'' \nSince that time, over 2,000 scientific studies have examined the issue, \nincluding a comprehensive review by the National Academy of Sciences. \nAll of these studies tell us the same thing--it's long past time to \nenact an ergonomics standard to protect the health of American workers \nand prevent these debilitating injuries in the workplace.\n  Last fall, when we considered the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, \nopponents of an ergonomics standard wanted us to wait for the National \nAcademy of Sciences to complete a further study before OSHA establishes \na standard. But it was just another delaying tactic. As we said then, \nover 2,000 studies on ergonomics have already been carried out.\n  In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health \nreviewed 600 of the most important of those studies. In 1998, the \nNational Academy of Sciences reviewed the studies again. Congress even \nasked the General Accounting Office to conduct its own study.\n  The National Academy of Sciences found that work clearly causes \nergonomic injuries. They concluded that ``the positive relationship \nbetween the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders and the conduct of \nwork is clear.'' The National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth agreed. They found ``strong evidence of an association between \nMSDs and certain work-related physical factors.''\n  The Academy also found that ergonomics programs are effective. As the \nAcademy found, ``Research clearly demonstrates that specific \ninterventions can reduce the reported rate of musculoskeltal disorders \nfor workers who perform high-risk tasks.'' The GAO has concluded that \ngood ergonomics practices are good business. Its report declared, \n``Officials at all the facilities we visited believed their ergonomics \nprograms yielded benefits, including reductions in workers' \ncompensation costs.''\n  The truth is that the Labor Department's ergonomics rule is based on \nsound science. In addition to the National Academy of Sciences and the \nNational Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, medical and \nscientific groups have expressed widespread support for moving forward \nwith an ergonomics rule. The American College of Occupational and \nEnvironmental Medicine, representing over 7,000 physicians, has stated \nthat ``there is . . . no reason for OSHA to delay the rule-making \nprocess while the NAS panel conducts its review.'' The American Academy \nof Orthopedic Surgeons, representing 16,000 surgeons, the American \nAssociation of Occupational Health Nurses, representing 13,000 nurses, \nand the American Public Health Association, representing 50,000 \nmembers, all agree that an ergonomics rule is necessary and based on \nsound science.\n  Many members of the business community support ergonomics \nprotections, because they agree that good ergonomics practices are good \nbusiness. Currently, businesses spend $15 to 20 billion each year in \nworkers' compensation costs related to these disorders. Ergonomic \ninjuries account for one dollar of every three dollars spent for \nworkers' compensation. If businesses reduce these injuries, they will \nreap the benefits of lower costs, greater productivity, and less \nabsenteeism.\n  That's certainly true for Tom Albin of Minnesota Mining and \nManufacturing, who said, ``Our experience has shown that incorporating \ngood ergonomics into our manufacturing and administrative processes can \nbe effective in reducing the number and severity of work-related \nmusculoskeletal disorders, which not only benefits our employees, but \nalso makes good business sense.''\n  Similarly, Peter Meyer of Sequins International Quality Braid has \nsaid, ``We have reduced our compensation claims for carpal tunnel \nsyndrome through an effective ergonomics program. Our productivity has \nincreased dramatically, and our absenteeism has decreased \ndrastically.''\n  This ergonomics rule is necessary, because only one-third of \nemployers currently have effective ergonomics programs. Further delay \nis unacceptable, because it leaves too many workers unprotected and \nopen to career-ending injuries. Ten years is long enough. Since OSHA \nbegan working on this standard in 1990, more than 6.1 million workers \nhave suffered serious injuries from workplace ergonomic hazards.\n  It is time to end these injuries--and end all the misinformation too. \nThe current attack on OSHA's ergonomics standard is just the latest in \na long series of mindless attacks by business against needed worker \nprotections for worker's health and safety. Whose side is this Congress \non? American employees deserve greater protection, not further delay. \nIt's time to stop breaking the promise made to workers, and start \nsupporting this long overdue ergonomics standard now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11487-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11487-S11488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

Indeed, it is imperative that these resources be kept \nenvironmentally and economically viable.\n  Along these lines, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to pursue \nenvironmentally responsible alternatives for addressing flooding along \nthe Passaic River. I originally introduced language to address this \nissue, which represents a new era in flood control, in 1998. S. 2796 \nauthorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to use up-to-date \ncriteria in developing a new environmentally and economically \nresponsible alternative. Such an alternative will take into account \nnon-structural options, such as land buyouts and wetlands preservation. \nThe bill also directs the Corps to study the possible acquisition of \nopen space in the Highlands region of New Jersey as a way of reducing \nlow-land flooding.\n  I also applaud the Senate's authorization of more than $1.7 billion \nto bring the channels of the New York and New Jersey Harbor to a depth \nof 50 feet. This authorization is based on the findings of the New \nYork-New Jersey Harbor Navigation Study which was designed to evaluate \nthe navigational needs of the Port of New York and New Jersey over the \nnext 50 years. The results of the study have made clear the need for \ndeepening the channels of Port Jersey, Kill Van Kull, Newark Bay, \nArthur Kill, and Bay Ridge Channels to a depth of 50 feet.\n  While the region has relied on the maritime industry for over two \nhundred years, the port lacks the capacity to accommodate new deep \ndraft shipping vessels. More than a decade ago, Congress authorized the \ndeepening of these channels to 45 feet which has begun and is on track \nto be completed in the next few years. But this is only the beginning. \nIn order to maintain the\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\n165,000 jobs and $22 billion in annual economic activity port commerce \ngenerates, these channels must go to 50 feet.\n  Once clean materials from these deepening projects, and other \nprojects from around the nation, have been dredged we should not \nneglect possible beneficial uses. Within WRDA, there is a $2 million \nannual authorization for the Corps to develop a program that will allow \nall eight of its regional offices to market eligible dredged material \nto public agencies and private entities for beneficial reuse.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Senators Smith, Baucus, \nand Voinovich for their assistance and cooperation in developing this \nlegislation. My colleagues have been remarkably helpful in this matter, \nhaving worked closely with me to ensure that the final bill \nincorporated language based on my legislation S. 2385, the Dredged \nMaterial Reuse Act, which I introduced earlier this year. They have \nunderstood the need, and I am grateful that they have agreed to include \nit in this legislation.\n  Beneficial reuse is a largely underutilized concept. As a result, \nunwanted dredged material is often dumped on the shorelines of local \ncommunities. Through a program of beneficial reuse the dredged material \nwould be sold to construction companies and other developers who would \nbe eager to have this material available.\n  Mr. President, the people of Southern New Jersey are all too familiar \nwith this situation. Current plans by the Corps calls for more than 20 \nmillion cubic yards of unwanted material dredged from the Delaware \nRiver to be placed on prime waterfront property along the Southern New \nJersey shoreline. However, with some effort and encouragement, the \nCorps has recently identified nearly 13 million cubic yards of that \nmaterial for beneficial reuse in transportation and construction \nprojects.\n  We should learn from beneficial reuse that contracting companies, \nland development companies, and major corporations want this material. \nThis means we need to encourage the Corps to market dredged material \nfor beneficial reuse up-front so that communities will not be \nconfronted with the same problems faced by the citizens of Southern New \nJersey.\n  The program created by this legislation will give the Army Corps the \nauthority and the funding they require to begin actively marketing \ndredged material from projects all across the United States. It \nrecognizes the need to keep our nation's rivers and channels efficient \nand available to maritime traffic while ensuring that communities are \ntreated fairly.\n  Of equal, if not greater importance, to the small businesses and \nshore communities of New Jersey is the protection of our beaches. \nRecreational activity at our beaches is extremely important to NJ, \nsupporting an annual tourist economy of $17 billion.\n  However, due to beach erosion, many of our shore communities have \nlost revenue on which they depend. This lost revenue affects the local \ntax base, property values, results in lost jobs and diminished quality \nof life in coastal regions.\n  Rebuilding and protecting our beaches is vital to the health of our \neconomy. With 127 miles of shoreline and a booming tourist industry, \nsimply watching the beaches erode is not an alternative. From \ncommercial and recreational fishermen, to bait and tackle shops and \nrestaurants, our shore communities depend on healthy coastlines.\n  With this in mind, I applaud the Senate for authorizing in WRDA \nseveral Corps projects to protect and re-nourish New Jersey beaches.\n  One project authorizes the Corps to re-nourish beaches along the \nentire stretch of Long Beach Island, from Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg \nInlet, in Ocean County, New Jersey. This $51.2 million project \nauthorizes the Corps to create dunes and beaches along the coastline \nmunicipalities of Long Beach Island, including: Harvey Cedars, Surf \nCity, Ship Bottom, Beach Haven and Long Beach Township.\n  Another project for shore protection authorizes the Corps, at a total \ncost of $30 million, to re-nourish beaches on the 1.8 mile stretch in \nPort Monmouth along the Raritan Bay and Sandy Hook Bay Shoreline, by \nconstructing floodwalls, levees, dunes, dune grass, dune fencing, dune \nwalk-overs, and suitable beachfill.\n  Finally, I commend the Senate for including language I supported that \nwould direct the Secretary of the Army to develop and implement \nprocedures to give recreational benefits the same budgetary priority as \nstorm damage reduction and environmental protection in cost-benefit \nanalysis for Corps beach replenishment projects. Currently, the Corps \nis not required to list recreation benefits in its cost-benefit \nanalysis of beach projects. This language is similar to legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year, and I am pleased that this initiative has \nbeen passed in the Senate's WRDA Conference Report.\n  Prior to the 1986 Water Resources Development Act, the Corps viewed \nrecreation as an equally important component of its cost-benefit \nanalysis. However, the 1986 bill omitted recreation as a benefit to be \nconsidered, and New Jersey coastal communities have suffered.\n  It is imperative that federal policy base beach nourishment \nassistance on the entirety of the economic benefits it provides. Beach \nreplenishment efforts ensure that our beaches are protected, property \nis not damaged, dunes are not washed away, and the resources that \ncoastal towns rely on for their lifeblood are preserved.\n  Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I support the passage of \nWRDA. New Jersey relies on its unique water resources and this \nlegislation will go a long way towards maintaining our economic and \nenvironmental health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11488-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11488-S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SPACE AND THE CHALLENGES AHEAD\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this past week Washington, DC was the site \nof a global meeting of space faring nations at the International Space \nSymposium. A question raised at this event was how the United States' \nposition, as a leader in both government sponsored and commercial space \nindustry and exploration, is to be maintained in the future in light of \nemerging competitors and markets around the world.\n  As a partner in the construction of the International Space Station, \nwe have entered into the greatest example of international cooperation \nto date. As NASA director Dan Goldin remarked at the Symposium, the \nSpace Station will be a partnership of 16 countries, including the \nU.S., Russia, Japan, the eleven members of the European Union, and \nBrazil. The Expedition 1 crew left for the Space Station at 1:53 AM, \nTuesday morning, marking October 31, 2000, as the date that humanity \nbegan its permanent residence in space. American astronaut Bill \nShepherd and Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev will \ndock with the Space Station on Thursday and begin assembly tasks as new \nelements are added to the orbiting outpost. At completion, the Space \nStation will have a pressurized volume larger than the cabin and cargo \nhold of a 747 airliner. Of the seven modules, six will house \nlaboratories. With these, the United States and the nations of the \nworld will have the opportunity to use the resources and capabilities \nof the Space Station for scientific and technological research. The \nU.S. laboratory module will have racks, or lab space, for individual \nexperiments, as well as sites where independent research payload can be \nattached. Some portion of each will be dedicated to commercial use.\n  As expected, a host of physical science experiments will use the \nresearch racks, payload sites, and Earth-viewing windows. Platforms \nwill also be available to test communications systems. Exciting \nexperiments are proposed in the life sciences and other fields only now \nrecognizing the opportunities that exist in space. Studies in porous-\nceramic bone replacement, gene transformation, and drug design will all \nbenefit from extended experiments in the weightless environment of the \nSpace Station. The ISS also provides an avenue for other countries to \nhave access to space, for experimentation and exploration, thereby \ndiminishing the need for their own space launch vehicle and potential \nmissile capabilities. We must seize this opportunity for international \ncooperation, fair access to space, and limitless scientific and \ntechnological advancement.\n  As the International Space Station demonstrates, the future poses \nmany opportunities for the Unites States in space. However, it likewise \npresents several risks. Also discussed at the International Space \nSymposium were\n\n[[Page S11489]]\n\nthe threats facing the U.S. space industry. One of the largest and most \nworrisome for our long-term health and viability is a lack of trained, \ncompetent, technically skilled workers. The space sector employs \nbetween 400,000 and 1,000,000 people. Assuming a 25 year career span, \nthis indicates a need for about 150,000 new employees a year. This does \nnot take into account the fact that the space industry workforce is \naging and that the skills used in the space sector, such as system \nlevel engineering, problem solving and trouble shooting, and general \ntechnical aptitude, are needed in other industries as well. A recent \nstudy found that the space sector dropped from being the third most \npopular field for young people to enter in 1990 to seventh in 1999. The \nspace industry is finding it harder to both recruit and retain \ntechnically skilled workers.\n  I bring this to our colleagues' attention, Mr. President, because the \nfederal government is facing a similar threat. Shortages in workers \nwith scientific and technical training are being faced by many \nExecutive agencies and government labs, as well as the federal space \ncommunity. As difficult as it is for the commercial space industry to \nrecruit and retain qualified employees, it is even harder for the \nfederal government. Now, and for the foreseeable future, the federal \ngovernment will continue to be the biggest client for the space \nindustry with its civil and military space ventures. The federal \ngovernment needs to be able to make decisions regarding selection of \nproducts, services and systems and have the personnel to use them. It \nmust also have the personnel to advise Congress and federal regulatory \nagencies in making intelligent, informed and prudent decisions that \nwill encourage competition and success in the commercial space \nindustry.\n  The Federal and commercial space industry recognize the risk the \nshortage of technically skilled workers present to the nation's long-\nterm prosperity and viability. As the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal \nServices, I am interested in how we can avert what most certainly poses \na threat to our national security and economic well-being. The Federal \nGovernment is attempting to address those factors in its work \nenvironment that make it less attractive to technically skilled \nworkers, while emphasizing the rewarding and fulfilling public service \ncareers available. A way for the Federal Government to increase the \nnumber of qualified workers could be a partnership with universities to \nencourage the skills and training needed to enter the field. The \nFederal Government should aggressively promote its student loan \nrepayment program to attract young college graduates who may turn away \nfrom Federal service because they are burdened with school debts. This \nprogram, which has been authorized since 1991, was never implemented \ndue to budget cuts, hiring freezes, and downsizing over the past \ndecade. Since last March, Senators Durbin, Voinovich, and I have urged \nthe Office of Personnel Management to implement the loan repayment \nprogram because we viewed it as an opportunity to encourage young \npeople to join the Federal Government. We were successful in expanding \nthe benefit beyond the scope of the initial authorization through an \namendment to the FY01 DoD Authorization Act, which was signed by the \nPresident on October 30, 2000.\n  The loan repayment program will be a critical component for the \nFederal Government in its effort to recruit and retain highly qualified \nprofessional, technical, or administrative personnel by allowing \nFederal agencies to repay up to $40,000 of an employee's student loans. \nIn addition to attracting recent college graduates, efforts to retain \nexperienced federal employees will include loan repayment programs for \nthose who pursue additional academic training. We stand at the \nthreshold of an age of opportunity and challenge. Our future as a \nglobal leader in space depends on having the people to meet this \nchallenge. I urge my colleagues to join me in fostering an interest in \npublic service among our nation's youth so that they will pursue \ncareers that further our nation's federal space programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11489-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE SMALL BUSINESS, HEALTH, TAX, AND MINIMUM WAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that important \nefforts to support small businesses are jeopardized by the many \nunrelated amendments that have been added to H.R. 2614 the Small \nBusiness, Health, Tax, and Minimum Wage Act. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in working to pass important legislation vital to preserve the \nCertified Development Company Program, the Small Business Innovation \nResearch Program, and the reauthorization of the Small Businesses \nAdministration. As Congress prepares to adjourn, it is irresponsible to \nprevent action on these important issues.\n  I am very concerned that innocent provisions that support small \nbusinesses and job creation are being held hostage in a debate over \nunrelated issues. H.R. 2614 was introduced as a bill to amend the Small \nBusiness Investment Act to make improvements to the certified \ndevelopment company program. This program provides gap financing which \nis vital to foster entrepreneurship and create economic opportunities. \nIn recent days, however, this bill has been loaded down with numerous \nprovisions that completely overshadow this program and threaten to \nshatter our chance to authorize these programs before Congress \nadjourns.\n  I am proud to speak out on behalf of the real intent of H.R. 2614 \nwhich would help small businesses succeed. There is an old proverb used \nin my state of South Dakota which advises; ``Don't put off until \ntomorrow what can be done today.'' Today, we should strip out the \npolitically charged amendments that have been tacked onto this bill and \npass legislation both parties agree is important to our economy, our \nlocal communities, and many businesses and families across the country.\n  It is careless not to reauthorize these important programs because of \nelection year politics which bogged down the legislation with unrelated \nissues. Congress should vote on the genuine issues with regard to small \nbusiness programs. We must not let certain partisan differences cause \nus to turn away from our opportunity to promote the entrepreneurial \nspirit of our country.\n  There are many issues before this body which evoke strong differences \nof opinion, however, authorizing these important small business \nprograms are not among them. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsecuring the passage of this important legislation and not allow these \nwidely supported initiatives to fall victim to nonrelated amendments \nthrown together in the closing days of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11489-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11489-S11490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND RISING PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, anyone who has lived or visited in the \nUnited States during the last few years has been exposed to a \nphenomenon which is uniquely American. I speak of the direct-to-\nconsumer advertising of prescription medicines.\n  U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers will spend an amount this year very \nclose to $2 billion on advertising to the general public. This can be \ncompared to about just $150 million in 1993--which explains why no one \ncan avoid these advertisements even if they wanted to. They are \nubiquitous--TV, radio, newspapers, and magazines are all replete with \nprescription drug ads.\n  Typically, the drugs that are most heavily advertised are among those \nthat ultimately are the most heavily prescribed. According to a \nrecently released National Institute for Health Care Management study, \nfor example, the seven drugs in 1999 which had more than $1 billion in \nsales were advertised an average of $58.5 million each. Together, they \ncontributed an estimated 24.3 percent toward the increases in total \nexpenditures of prescription drugs during 1999.\n  Clearly, advertising works, just as it always has.\n  Advocates of this relatively new technique to increase name brand \nprescription sales will say that consumers become more aware of \ntreatment possibilities and may have a better starting point for \ndiscussion with their physicians. Other observers believe this practice \nartificially increases demand from consumers who are still not fully\n\n[[Page S11490]]\n\neducated enough to know about less expensive, or maybe even safer, \nalternatives. Certainly, the advertising costs are passed along to the \nconsumer.\n  Is the information value worth the yearly increases in drug costs \nthat advertising inevitably causes? Are patients getting the best \nindividualized choices of medicines or the just best advertised ones? \nAre generic drugs, often an excellent cost-effective alternative, \ngetting equal consideration?\n  Frankly, I have my concerns about this practice. Many professional \norganizations have gone on record as opposing the kinds of direct-to-\nconsumer advertising that goes on today. I believe it bears very close \nwatching and we all need to closely scrutinize its value and its place \nwithin the health care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11490-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NEW JERSEY STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PROJECT\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today regarding a matter of \ngreat importance to the entire State of New Jersey. My home state is \nconfronted with an array of complex challenges related to the \nenvironment and economic development. However, one issue in particular, \nthe over development of land and stormwater management, has become \nespecially concerning because of the impact it is having on our \nwatersheds and floodplains.\n  As you may know, this past August vast parts of northern New Jersey \nwere devastated by flooding caused by severe rainfall. The resulting \nnatural disaster threatened countless homes, bridges and roads, not to \nmention the health, safety and welfare of area residents. The total \nfigure for damages in Sussex and Morris Counties alone has been \nestimated at over $50 million, and area residents are still fighting to \nrestore some degree of normalcy to their lives. According to the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, in just those two counties, 34 \ndams were damaged, 6 bridges were damaged and 4 were destroyed, and 10 \nmunicipal buildings were damaged.\n  While the threat of future floods continues to plague the region, one \nNew Jersey institution is taking concrete steps to prevent another \nflooding catastrophe. The New Jersey Institute of Technology, NJIT, has \nbeen studying the challenges posed by flooding and stormwater flows for \nsome time, and is ready to create a multi-agency federal partnership to \ncontinue this important research.\n  NJIT is one of New Jersey's premier research institutions and is \nuniquely equipped to carry out this critical stormwater research. The \nuniversity has a long and distinguished tradition of responding to \ndifficult public-policy challenges such as environmental emissions \nstandards, aircraft noise, traffic congestion and alternative energy. \nMore broadly, NJIT has demonstrated an institutional ability to direct \nits intellectual resources to the examination of problems beyond \nacademia, and its commitment to research allows it to serve as a \nresource for unbiased technological information and analysis. Indeed, I \noriginally requested that NJIT be given the funds to take on this \nStormwater flood control and management project.\n  Despite that, the 2000 Water Resources Development Act, WRDA, still \npresents an excellent opportunity for NJIT to partner with the federal \ngovernment and solve the difficult problem of flood control. At my \nrequest, and in close coordination with my House colleagues from the \nstate delegation, the final version of this important legislation \nincludes a provision directing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \ndevelop and implement a stormwater flood control project in New Jersey \nand report back to Congress within three years on its progress. While \nthe Corps of Engineers is familiar with this problem at the national \nlevel, it does not have the firsthand knowledge and experience in New \nJersey that NJIT has accrued in its 119 years of service to New Jersey. \nIncluding NJIT's expertise and experience in this research effort is a \nlogical step and would greatly benefit the Army Corps, as well as \nsignificantly improve the project's chances of success.\n  Therefore, I urge the New York District of the Corps of Engineers to \nwork closely with my office and NJIT to ensure the universities full \nparticipation in this study. By working together, we can create a nexus \nbetween the considerable flood control expertise of the Army Corps and \nNJIT, and finally solve this difficult problem for the people of New \nJersey. I hope my colleagues will support my efforts in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11490-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11490-S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE'S FAILURE ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS IN 106TH CONGRESS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, of the 105 judicial vacancies that \nhave occurred so far this year, the Senate has acted to fill only 39. \nThe last year of the Bush Administration, a presidential year in which \nwe had the reverse situation with a Republican President and a \nDemocratic Senate, the Senate confirmed 66 judges--70 percent more than \nthe number confirmed this year. Over the 2-year span of this Congress, \nthe Senate will have confirmed only 73 judges. By contrast, the \nDemocratic Senate in the last two years of President Bush's \nAdministration confirmed 124 judges--70 percent more judges than the \nnumber confirmed by this Congress. Indeed, in the last eleven weeks of \nCongress in 1992, a Democratic Senate held four judicial nominations \nhearings and confirmed 29 judges. In the last eleven weeks of this \nCongress, Republicans will have managed to hold no hearings and confirm \nno judges.\n  President Clinton has tried to make progress on bringing greater \ndiversity to our federal courts. He has been successful to some extent. \nWith our help, he could have done so much more. We will end this \nCongress without having acted on any of the African American nominees \nsent to us to fill vacancies on the Fourth Circuit and finally \nintegrate the Circuit with the highest percentage of African American \npopulation in the country, but the one Circuit that has never had an \nAfrican American judge. We could have acted on the nomination of \nKathleen McCree Lewis and confirmed her to the Sixth Circuit to be the \nfirst African American woman to sit on that Court. Instead, we will end \nthe year without having acted on any of the outstanding nominees to the \nSixth Circuit pending before us.\n  This Judiciary Committee reported only three nominees to the Courts \nof Appeals all year. We held hearings without even including a nominee \nto the Courts of Appeals and denied a Committee vote to two outstanding \nnominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I certainly understand the \nfrustration of those Senators who know that Roger Gregory, Judge James \nWynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, as well as Judge Helene White, Bonnie \nCampbell and others should have been considered by this Committee and \nvoted on by the Senate this year.\n  There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Third, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 24 current \nvacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial \nemergency vacancies in the federal court system. I note that the \nvacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 12 percent \nnationwide. If we were to take into account the additional appellate \njudgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, \nS. 3071, a bill that was requested by the Judicial Conference to handle \ncurrent workloads, the vacancy rate on our federal courts of appeals \nwould be more than 17 percent.\n  The Chairman declares that ``there is and has been no judicial \nvacancy crisis'' and that he calculates vacancies at ``less than \nzero.'' The extraordinary service that has been provided by our corps \nof senior judges does not mean there are no vacancies. In the federal \ncourts around the country there remain 66 current vacancies and 12 more \non the horizon. With the judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal \nJudgeship Act of 2000, there would be over 135 vacancies across the \ncountry. That is the truer measure of vacancies, many of which have \nbeen long-standing judicial emergency vacancies in our southwest border \nstates. The Chief Judges of both the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have had \nto declare their entire courts in emergencies since there are too many \nvacancies and too few Circuit judges to handle their workload.\n  After creating 85 additional judgeships in 1990, Congress reduced the \nvacancies from 131 in 1991, to 103 in 1992, to 112 in 1993, to 63 in \n1994. Vacancies were going down and we were acting with Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents to fill the 85 judgeships created\n\n[[Page S11491]]\n\nby a Democratic Congress under a Republican President in 1990. We will \nend this session with more vacancies than at the end of the session in \n1994, without having added the judgeships requested by the Judicial \nConference. Since Republicans assumed control of the Senate in the 1994 \nelection, the Senate has not closed the vacancy gap at all and the \nworkloads in many of our courts have gotten significantly worse. More \nvacancies are continuing longer, and it has taken longer to confirm \nnominees to existing vacancies. We have lost ground and squandered \nopportunities for progress in the past six years.\n  As I have pointed out, the vacancies are most acute among our Courts \nof Appeals and in our southwest border States. We have not acted to add \nthe judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference to meet increased \nworkloads over the last decade. According to the Chief Justice's 1999 \nyear-end report, the filings of cases in our Federal courts have \nreached record heights. In fact, the filings of criminal cases and \ndefendants reached their highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment \nwas repealed in 1933. Also in 1999, there were 54,693 filings in the 12 \nregional Courts of Appeals. Overall growth in appellate court caseload \nlast year was due to a 349 percent upsurge in original proceedings. \nThis sudden expansion resulted from newly implemented reporting \nprocedures, which more accurately measure the increased judicial \nworkload generated by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act and the \nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both passed in 1996.\n  I regret to report again today that the last confirmation hearing for \nfederal judges held by the Judiciary Committee was in July, as was the \nlast time the Judiciary Committee reported any nominees to the full \nSenate. Throughout August, September, October, and now into November, \nthere were no additional hearings held or even noticed, and no \nexecutive business meetings included any judicial nominees on the \nagenda. By contrast, in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration, \na Democratic majority in the Senate held three confirmation hearings in \nAugust and September and continued to work to confirm judges up to and \nincluding the last day of the session. During that presidential \nelection year the Senate confirmed 66 judges; this year the Senate will \nnot reach 40.\n  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all \nnominees, including women and minorities. That highly-qualified \nnominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate \nshould have joined with the President to confirm well-qualified, \ndiverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal \ncourts around the country.\n  I regret that the Judiciary Committee did not hold additional \nhearings after July, that the Senate only acted on 39 nominees all \nyear, and that we took so long on so many of them. I deeply regret the \nlack of a hearing and a vote on so many qualified nominees, including \nRoger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, \nEnrique Moreno and Allen Snyder. The Senate squandered a number of \nimportant opportunities to help our courts and should have accorded \nthese qualified and outstanding nominees fair up or down votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11491-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTERNET FALSE IDENTIFICATION PREVENTION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked \nwith Senator Collins on Senate passage of S. 2924, the ``Internet False \nIdentification Prevention Act of 2000.'' This legislation is an \nimportant step forward in the fight against identity theft.\n  ``The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000'' \nrecognizes that the crime of identity theft has entered the Internet \nage, and that the Federal government has a responsibility to bring our \nidentity theft laws up to speed. The primary law governing false \nidentification documents was enacted in 1982, well before the advent of \nwebsites and e-mail.\n  Specifically, this legislation prohibits individuals from knowingly \nproducing, distributing, or offering for download from the Internet \ncomputer files or templates that are designed to make counterfeit \nidentification documents.\n  While the total number of false identification documents sold on the \nInternet is unknown, purveyors of false identification documents have \nused the Internet to sell their wares to a much broader market, and to \ndistribute these documents as quickly as they can be downloaded from a \nwebsite. According to a study by the Senate Committee of Government \nAffairs, one web site operator reported that he sold 1,000 fake IDs a \nmonth yielding $600,000 in annual sales.\n  The ``Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000'' also \ncloses a loophole in current law that permitted manufacturers of false \nidentification documents to escape liability by displaying a \ndisclaimer, ``Not a Government Document.'' These disclaimers, however, \ncan be easily removed. The bill also directs the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to coordinate efforts to investigate and \nprosecute the distribution of false identification documents on the \nInternet.\n  I would note that this bill contains an exemption from criminal \nliability for certain ``interactive computer services.'' This language \nreflects a narrow, one-time solution and I want it to be clear that \nthis should not be considered as a precedent.\n  Congress has debated the issue of whether the liability of certain \nInternet service providers should be limited with respect to particular \nactivities of their subscribers or users of their services. This is a \ncomplicated question, requiring careful deliberation and evaluation of \nthe short- and long-term consequences. A full debate on this issue is \nneeded in the 107th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11491-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE ROLE OF PHARMACISTS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, every year in October there is \nrecognition made of our nation's pharmacists in the form of National \nPharmacy Week. This year's designation was October 22-28, 2000. I would \nlike to take a few minutes to talk about that profession and its role \nin the safe, cost-effective delivery of medication to American \ncitizens.\n  I have great respect for the innovation that this nation's scientists \nhave demonstrated to continually produce new and better ``wonder \ndrugs'' that have played a major role in the prevention and treatment \nof disease. Farther down the line within the drug delivery system are \npharmacists, using those same drugs every day, getting them to patients \nalong with information for their safe use.\n  The role of the pharmacist is changing. In addition to the \ntraditional role of accurately dispensing prescription drugs, today's \npharmacists are successfully involved in all areas of the drug use \nprocess. The result of this involvement, often termed ``pharmacy care'' \nhas made a huge positive difference in many studies within the areas of \nanticoagulation, asthma and diabetes treatment, pain control and many \nothers. When pharmacists are proactively involved, there have been \ndemonstrations of not only increased effectiveness and fewer adverse \nreactions, but cost savings as well.\n  Within the startling report issued earlier this year by the Institute \nof Medicine, which pointed out that tens of thousands of American die \nevery year from medical errors, was a recommendation to increase the \nutilization of pharmacists and pharmacy care.\n  So today I would like to congratulate the pharmacy profession for its \naccomplishments in improving patient care. During this Congress several \nbills have included provisions to encourage and support pharmacy care. \nI believe this is a fascinating approach that we should strongly \nconsider as we continue to work toward optimizing the safe and cost-\neffective use of prescription drugs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11491-3", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11491-S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO MARY JANE COLTON ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Mary Jane Colton, who will retire from my staff next week \nafter 20 years of service to the people of New Hampshire as an employee \nof the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S11492]]\n\n  Mary Jane is known throughout the state for her compassion and \nsuccess in helping New Hampshire citizens with problems they may be \nhaving with the federal government. As a chief caseworker on my staff, \nand as State Office Director for Senator Gordon Humphrey before me, she \nwas critical in managing a constituent service operation that was \nsecond to none. Mary Jane helped many senior citizens, veterans, \nparents, and communities with problems they had with the federal \ngovernment. From assisting a small community in its battle to receive \nits own zip code, to helping a local veteran get a long-awaited service \nmedal, Mary Jane's legacy has had a great impact on the Granite State.\n  Mary Jane's compassion is also evident in her home and personal life. \nFor many years she has cared for her elderly and infirm parents in her \nhome, so they would not be separated by being placed in a state nursing \nhome.\n  As Mary Jane leaves public service, I wish her the best in all of her \nfuture endeavors. I know she will be working full-time on her passion: \nAntiques. She will now be able to focus on her on-line antiques \nbusiness--an enjoyable and hopefully lucrative second career.\n  Good luck, Mary Jane. Thank you for all that you have done for me and \nfor the people of New Hampshire. It is an honor to represent you in the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11492-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ERIC KINGSLEY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Eric Kingsley as he leaves his position as Executive \nDirector of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, NHTOA.\n  Eric's five year tenure at NHTOA has been marked by progress and \nsuccess. The organization's programs and services have grown to meet \nthe needs and concerns of its members, and have established a strong, \nstable foundation for the association's future.\n  Through the years, I have grown to value Eric's input on the many \nissues that significantly impact New Hampshire's timberlands. Eric has \ndone an outstanding job of keeping me, and other policymakers, informed \non the issues and has been a true leader in making sure the voice of \nNHTOA was heard throughout the country.\n  Of all of Eric's achievements at NHTOA, perhaps his most important \nsuccess came this past spring. Eric helped lead the charge to defeat \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's ill-considered proposal to treat \nsome forestry activities as ``point source pollution'' under the Clean \nWater Act. These rules, known as the Total Maximum Daily Loads--TMDL \nRule--would have required landowners, foresters, and homeowners to \nobtain federal permits before conducting a timber harvest and could \nhave exposed them to lengthy bureaucratic delays and costly citizen \nlawsuits.\n  This past May, I held a field hearing in Whitefield, New Hampshire, \non the TMDL rule. Eric was a persuasive witness, providing thoughtful \nand compelling testimony. He also organized hundreds of foresters to \nensure their message was heard loud and clear in Washington. Thanks in \nlarge part to Eric's leadership on this issue, EPA withdrew the section \nof the TMDL rules that adversely affected forestry.\n  My staff and I have also worked closely with Eric on issues of \nimportance to the White Mountain National Forest. When the President \nissued his ``roadless'' initiative stripping the people of New \nHampshire and New England of the opportunity to have a meaningful voice \nin the management of their public lands, Eric was there to ensure we \ntook this Administration to task.\n  Eric also rose to the occasion in the face of destruction from Mother \nNature's wrath. The Ice Storm in January 1998 brought unprecedented \nchallenges to New Hampshire's forest lands. Hundreds of thousands of \nacres were significantly damaged. Eric worked closely with me and my \ncolleagues to help us turn this tragedy into an opportunity. Today, not \nonly has the federal government provided resources to help recover from \nthe storm, but we have a record number of acres under forest \nstewardship plans.\n  My staff and I have worked with Eric on a wide variety of other \nissues during his time at NHTOA. I have always been impressed with his \ndedication and the depth of knowledge he displayed on issues ranging \nfrom estate tax reform to rural economic development. Eric has always \nbeen an effective and honest advocate for the causes he holds close to \nhis heart. I know he will be greatly missed by NHTOA's 1,500 members.\n  I wish Eric well in all his future endeavors, and am confident he \nwill succeed in whatever pursuits he chooses. It is an honor to \nrepresent him in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/01/senate-section/article/S11492-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE SUDAN EMERGENCY--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 137\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Sudan emergency is to continue in \neffect beyond November 3, 2000, to the Federal Register for \npublication.\n  The crisis between the United States and Sudan that led to the \ndeclaration on November 3, 1997, of a national emergency has not been \nresolved. The Government of Sudan has continued its activities hostile \nto United States interests. Such Sudanese actions and policies pose a \ncontinuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad \nauthorities necessary to apply economic pressure on the Government of \nSudan.\n                                                  William J.

By Executive \nOrder 13067, I imposed trade sanctions on Sudan and blocked Sudanese \ngovernment assets. Because the Government of Sudan has continued its \nactivities hostile to United States interests, the national emergency \ndeclared on November 3, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date to \ndeal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond November 3, \n2000. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national \nemergency for 1 year with respect to Sudan.\n  This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and \ntransmitted to the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to improve \nprovisions concerning the recovery of damages for injuries resulting \nfrom oil spills; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           fishermen and aquaculture oil spill assistance act\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to address concerns raised by a number of my constituents \nwith respect to the Oil Pollution Act in the aftermath of the New \nCarissa incident. This legislation, the Fishermen and Aquaculture Oil \nSpill Assistance Act, is the first step toward ensuring that small \nbusinesses, such as the fishermen and shellfish producers in my state, \nwho are impacted by these oil spills, are not victimized a second time \nby a lengthy claims procedure under the OPA.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who are not aware of this incident, \nthe New Carissa was a large wood-chip freighter that ran aground near \nCoos Bay, Oregon last year and leaked 60,000 gallons of oil. This \ndevastated the coastal environment in that area, and temporarily \ndamaged some of the important oyster beds for which Coos Bay is well-\nknown in the seafood industry. In fact, we still have the ship's stern \nsection sitting off-shore, marring the natural beauty of the Oregon \ncoast.\n  Over the last several months I have heard from my constituents from \nthat part of the Oregon coast, who are extremely dissatisfied with both \nthe emergency response planning and the claims process under the Oil \nPollution Act as it applies to aquaculture producers. With respect to \nthe emergency response plans, the complaint has been that the concerns \nof shellfish producers are not necessarily taken into account in the \ndevelopment of these plans and that quick action in the early hours of \na spill could protect the areas where the oyster beds are present. On \nthe matter of the claims process, the complaint has been that there is \nlittle small businesses can do in the immediate term if the responsible \nparty fails to make the interim payments to claimants required under \nthe OPA.\n  This legislation addresses the concerns by authorizing the President \nto offer loans to fishermen and aquaculture producers who are mired in \nthe claims process, but have not been receiving the required interim \npayments. This would help these small, often family-owned, businesses \nmeet their most pressing expenses should the claims procedure become a \ndrawn out affair. Secondly, this legislation calls upon the Secretary \nof Commerce and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency to study the claims process and the emergency response plans to \ndetermine if they adequately protect the interests of seafood producers \nand submit any recommendations to the Congress. Ultimately, my aim is \nto ensure that future oil spill incidents do not cause the same \nproblems to others that oyster producers in Oregon have suffered \nfollowing the New Carissa spill.\n  I am pleased that my friend from the Oregon delegation, Mr. DeFazio, \nintends to introduce a companion measure today in the House of \nRepresentatives. Over the upcoming holidays we intend to look over this \nmatter again and reintroduce this legislation, after receiving further \nfeedback from our constituents, early in the 107th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 56. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to abolish the electoral college and \nto provide for the direct popular election of the President and Vice \nPresident of the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this morning I held a press \nconference with a colleague of mine from the State of Illinois, Ray \nLaHood. Ray LaHood is a Congressman from the city of Peoria, and a \nRepublican. It was interesting to see a bipartisan press conference at \nthis point in the congressional session.\n  Congressman LaHood and I agree on an issue which could become \nsupremely important in just a few days. Given the tight Presidential \nrace this year, we have the possibility that the winning candidate for \nPresident might not win the popular vote in our country. This\n\n[[Page S11495]]\n\npotential outcome highlights a serious and persistent flaw in our \ncurrent system of electing a Chief Executive of the United States.\n  I am introducing a joint resolution to amend the Constitution to \nreplace the electoral college with the direct election of the President \nand Vice President.\n  I introduced a similar measure in 1993 with Congressman Gerald \nKleczka of Wisconsin in the House. I will be doing the same in the \nSenate. But I hope to attract the support of colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle regardless of the outcome on November 7.\n  The electoral college is an antiquated institution that has outlived \nits purpose. It was the product of contentious debate and a great deal \nof controversy. Most of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention \nin 1787 felt that the process of selecting a President should not be \nleft up to a direct vote of the people. And most agreed with the \nsentiments of George Mason of Virginia, who said, ``it were as \nunnatural to refer the choice of a proper character for Chief \nMagistrate to the people, as it would be to refer a trial of colors to \na blind man.''\n  After a prolonged debate, an indirect method of electing the \nPresident was adopted. This compromise plan, known as the Electoral \nCollege Method, provided for the election of the President and Vice \nPresident by State appointed electors. Under Article II, Section 1, \nClause 2 of the Constitution as amended by the 12th Amendment in 1804, \neach state is required to appoint in a manner determined by the state \nlegislature a number of electors equal in number to its congressional \nrepresentation. If no candidate receives a simple majority of electoral \nvotes, then the House of Representatives chooses the President from the \nthree candidates with the greatest number of votes and the Senate \nsimilarly chooses a Vice President from the top two contenders for that \noffice.\n  The commonly held opinion among the delegates in 1787 was that \nmatters of such gravity should not be left up to the average citizen. \nMoreover, the discussions of the convention reveal that the delegates \nquestioned whether voters in one State could have enough relevant \nknowledge regarding the character of public men living hundreds of \nmiles away. In addition, the delegates from the less populous States \nwere concerned that a direct election of the President would enhance \nthe power and prestige of the more populous states.\n\n  But today, these concerns are no longer compelling--if they ever \nwere.\n  The 17th amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1913 and \nprovided for the direct popular election of U.S. Senators. Before that, \nSenators were chosen by State legislatures. But come 1913, we decided \nto trust the people to choose the Senators. I don't believe our Nation \nsuffered by that decision. I think the Senate as an institution has \nbeen enhanced by that decision. It is no longer a back-room deal in a \nState capitol that sends a Senator to Washington, it is a decision made \nby the people of each State in an open and free election.\n  The incredible advances in communication technologies since the 18th \nCentury render moot the concerns that citizens do not have enough \ninformation to make an informed decision about a President. Clearly \npotential voters today have more information about presidential \ncandidates than their counterparts had 200 years ago regarding their \ndirectly elected Representatives to Congress.\n  It has been argued that smaller States have a slight advantage in the \ncurrent system, because states receive a minimum of three electoral \nvotes, regardless of their population. However, any serious study of \npresidential campaigns would demonstrate that the more populous states, \nwith their large electoral prizes, as well as medium sized swing \nstates, have the true advantage. The winner-take-all aspect in each \nState motivates presidential candidates to focus on States with a \nmoderate or large number of electoral votes, assuming the candidates \nbelieve they have a chance to win the popular vote there. Less populous \nStates with only a few electoral votes are largely ignored. Also States \nthat are heavily leaning toward one of the presidential candidates are \nsimilarly ignored.\n  You do not see Al Gore and Joe Lieberman spend that much time in the \nState of Texas, nor do you find George W. Bush visiting the State of \nNew York very often. Most campaigns have written off certain States. So \nthe people in that State do not see much of the Presidential campaign \nexcept for national coverage.\n  Clearly, there is a reason why there have been more congressionally \nproposed constitutional amendments on this subject than any other. The \nelectoral college system, as it stands today, has several major \ndefects. The most significant of these are the result of voting schemes \nother than a direct popular vote. The most prevalent example is the \nunit vote or so-called winner-take-all formula. The unit vote is the \npractice of awarding all of a State's electoral votes to the candidate \nwith a popular vote plurality in the State, regardless of whether the \nplurality is one vote or one million votes. All States and the District \nof Columbia with the exception of the States of Maine and Nebraska have \nadopted this method.\n  In doing my research on this isue, I learned that Maine and Nebraska \nvote by congressional district and allocate their Presidential electors \naccordingly.\n  The first problem with the electoral college system is that it is \ninherently unfair and may disenfranchise voters. Senator Birch Bayh--\nfather of our colleague, Senator Evan Bayh--discussed this problem on \nthe floor of the Senate when he introduced a resolution to abolish the \nelectoral college on January 15, 1969. During his floor statement he \nsaid:\n\n       As a result, the popular vote totals of the losing \n     candidate at the State level are completely discounted in the \n     final electoral tabulation. In effect, millions of voters are \n     disenfranchised if they happen to vote for the losing \n     candidate in their State.\n\n  The famous Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, who was the first \nSenator to serve in the Senate for 30 years, further pointed out the \ninjustice of this system when he said:\n\n       To lose votes is the fate of all minorities, and it is \n     their duty to submit; but this is not the case of votes lost, \n     but of votes taken away, added to those of the majority and \n     given to a person to whom the minority is opposed.\n\n  Another problem with the electoral college system is that it often \nleads to wide disparities between the popular vote and the electoral \nvote. For example, since 1824, when the popular vote first began to be \nrecorded along with the electoral vote, winners of presidential \nelections have averaged 51 percent of the popular vote as compared to \nan average of 71 percent of the electoral vote. In comparison, the \nlosing main opponents have averaged 42 percent of the popular vote, but \njust 27 percent of the electoral vote. Year to year statistics vary \ngreatly.\n  A more serious problem is that the electoral college system can lead \nto Presidents who received fewer popular votes than their main \nopponent. In fact, this has happened 3 times out of the 42 presidential \nelections since 1824.\n  Another indication as to the likelihood of a non-majority President \ncan be seen in the elections of 1844, 1880, 1884, 1960, and 1968, in \nwhich the main opponent lost the popular vote by an average of only 0.3 \npercent. This is in stark contrast to the winning margin in electoral \nvotes for these elections, which averaged 17 percent. Other close \npresidential elections occurred in 1916, 1948, and 1976. In those \nyears, if a mere few thousand votes had been switched in a few key \nstates where the vote was close, a different candidate would have won \nthe White House. In 1916, for example, a shift of only 2,000 votes in \nCalifornia would have made Charles Evans Hughes President, despite \nWoodrow Wilson's half-million popular vote advantage. And in 1976, a \n6,000 vote shift in Ohio and a 4,000 vote shift in Hawaii would have \nelected Gerald Ford, even though Jimmy Carter won the popular vote by \n1.6 million ballots.\n  One can conclude that approximately one in fourteen presidential \nelections have resulted in a non-majority President, while one in five \nhave nearly resulted in one.\n  Senator Birch Bayh eloquently pointed out the risk of this system in \nhis floor statement on January 15, 1969:\n\n       The present electoral vote system has in the past, and may \n     in the future, produce a President who has received fewer \n     popular votes than his opponent. I cannot see how such a \n     system can be beneficial to the American people. I see, \n     instead, only grave dangers that could divide this Nation at \n     a critical hour if the President-elect lacked a popular \n     mandate.\n\n\n[[Page S11496]]\n\n\n  The third pernicious flaw in the electoral college system is that it \nproduces artificial distortions in the political process. The fact that \npresidential candidates cater to the larger and swing states often \ngives undue influence to a limited number of contested States. So-\ncalled safe States are given scant or no attention by candidates--who \nhave limited time, energy, and resources. Senator Thomas J. Dodd, the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut who was known as an ardent \ncrusader and civil rights advocate, argued convincingly on this subject \nsoon after President Kennedy's narrow victory in 1960. He said:\n\n       The shift of a few thousand votes in these States would \n     have elected Dewey in 1948. The shift of a few thousand votes \n     in Illinois and New Jersey could have changed the result of \n     an election as close as this past one. There is something \n     wrong with an election system which hinges, not on the vote \n     of 70 million, but on the vote of several thousand in a \n     few key States.\n\n  The issue isn't simply that every vote matters in a close election. \nThe issue is the injustice of a few thousand votes in just a few states \nhaving a disproportional impact on a National election. Why should a \nvote in Missouri or Florida be worth more to a presidential candidate \nthan one in Wyoming, Mississippi, or Rhode Island?\n  The fourth and last major flaw in the electoral college system is \nthat electors, in general, are not bound to cast their vote in \naccordance with the popular vote results from their State. While some \nStates require a binding oath or pledge under penalty of law, the \nmajority of States have no or an insignificant penalty. This leads to \nthe disturbing possibility that a President, in an election with a \nclose electoral vote, could win through subterfuge. Instances of rogue \nelectors casting votes contrary to the results in their State have \noccurred in the following years: 1948, 1956, 1960, 1968, 1972, 1976, \nand 1988.\n  Since 1797, when Representative William L. Smith of South Carolina \noffered the first Constitutional amendment proposing to reform our \nprocedure for electing the President, hardly a session of Congress has \npassed without the introduction of one or more similar proposals. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, approximately 109 \nconstitutional amendments on electoral college reform were introduced \nin Congress between 1889 and 1946. Another 265 were introduced between \n1947 and 1968. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina Olin \nJohnston summed up the sentiments of many of the critics of the \nelectoral college system when he said on the floor of the Senate on \nJanuary 5, 1961:\n\n       All of these proposals recognized . . . that the so-called \n     electoral college system has never functioned as contemplated \n     by the framers of the Constitution.\n\n  While all of these attempts failed, the most successful effort took \nplace after the 1968 presidential election when third party candidate \nGeorge Wallace received 46 electoral votes. In that election, there was \nconsiderable concern that no candidate would receive a majority of \nelectoral votes and that the new President would be selected by the \nHouse of Representatives. As a result, H.J. Res. 681 was introduced by \nRepresentative Emanuel Celler in the 91st Congress, proposing to \nabolish the electoral college and replace it with the direct popular \nelection of the President and Vice President. Included in H.J. Res. 681 \nwas a provision for a runoff election if no candidate received at least \n40 percent of the popular vote. While this joint resolution passed the \nHouse on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 338-70, it died in the Senate \nbecause of a filibuster by Senators from small States and southern \nStates.\n\n  The joint resolution I am introducing today is similar to H.J. Res. \n681, in that it calls for the direct election of the President and Vice \nPresident and includes a provision for a runoff election. More \nspecifically, in the event that no candidate receives at least 40 \npercent of the popular vote, a runoff would be held 21 days after the \ngeneral election between the two candidates with the greatest number of \npopular votes. This resolution builds upon a proposal I offered with \nRepresentative Gerald Kleczka in 1993 and other resolutions introduced \nin the current Congress by Representatives Ray LaHood and James Leach.\n  Every public opinion poll indicates that an overwhelming majority of \nAmericans want to elect their President directly by popular vote. \nDirect popular election has been endorsed in the past by a large number \nof civic-minded groups including the American Bar Association, the AFL-\nCIO, the UAW, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, and the NAACP.\n  If we believe that the President represents and speaks for the people \nof this great country, then we have an obligation to allow the people \nto have their voices heard. Abraham Lincoln once said, ``Public opinion \nis everything. With it, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can \nsucceed.''\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, as Congressman LaHood and I said in our \nbipartisan press conference, although this is an issue which apparently \nseems so rational and so easy to argue, it is one that has run into a \nlot of debate on the floor of the Senate. I spoke to one of my \ncolleagues from a smaller State and told him what I was doing. He said: \nI'll oppose you all the way because my tiny State has three electoral \nvotes, and the Presidental candidate has been spending a lot of time in \nmy State and would spend no time there if we had to rely on a popular \nvote.\n  But it seems strange to me we rely on a popular vote for virtually \nevery other election in America but not the Presidential election. If \nwe have a disparity between the popular vote for President and the \nelectoral vote for President, if we have someone elected President who \ndoes not receive a majority of the votes of the American people, it \nwill create a problem for that administration. It is tough enough to \nlead in this great Nation, tough enough for a President to muster \npopular support for difficult decisions to be made. But if that \nPresident does not bring a mandate from the people to the office, his \npower will be diminished.\n  I sincerely hope that does not occur. But whether or not, I hope my \ncolleagues will join me supporting this effort to abolish the electoral \ncollege and say we trust the people in this country. The arguments made \nover 200 years ago do not apply today. The people of this country \nshould choose the President as they choose Members of Congress as well \nas U.S. Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 56\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within seven years after \n     the date of its submission to the States for ratification:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1.
